NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Airlines' plans to resume air travel in India were in disarray on Monday after some states restricted the number of flights hours before departure, causing last-minute cancellations and leaving hundreds of passengers stranded.
Airlines, including IndiGo, India's biggest carrier, SpiceJet and Vistara, a joint venture between Tata Group and Singapore Airlines (OTC:SINGY), had been preparing to resume operations from Monday with about a third of their capacity amid strict rules.
But new restrictions at major airports, including Mumbai and Chennai, forced airlines to scramble late on Sunday to revise schedules.
The confusion will make it even harder for airlines to recover from the impact of a two-month lockdown to contain the novel coronavirus that has already cost tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue, industry executives, lawyers and analysts said.
""The entire handling of the restart has been reduced to a farce, causing pain for airlines, airports, and passengers,"" said an industry executive on condition of anonymity.
IndiGo had planned to start with about 430 daily flights while its low-cost rival SpiceJet said it would operate 204 flights a day and AirAsia India would start with 77 flights.
The final number could be much lower as some states, especially where coronavirus cases are rising, have curtailed air travel following relaxations that last Thursday allowed some domestic operations to resume.
IndiGo said on Monday it plans to fly just over 200 daily flights until May 31.
Potential travellers are also likely to be deterred by a lack of clarity on quarantine rules in different states.

""It's unfortunate there was no effective coordination between the states and central government. Each state has come out with its own rules, which is confusing and will compel only a few to fly,"" aviation law expert Nitin Sarin, a managing partner at Sarin & Co, said.

Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a briefing that the United States is trying to harm China's national security and said Beijing has lodged stern representations with Washington over White House National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien's comments that the security law for Hong Kong could lead to U.S. sanctions.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan eases coronavirus curbs following its first wave of cases, many small medical clinics are scrambling to stay afloat and the doctors who run them are calling for government support as patients keep away for fear of infection.
Such clinics are the backbone of a healthcare system short of doctors to care for one of the world's fastest-ageing societies, yet the fallout of the virus pandemic threatens the survival of many.
""Clinics in the residential and office areas seem to be operating on the brink,"" said Toshihiko Yamazaki, who runs a urology clinic in the city of Urawa, north of Tokyo.
""Even if the state of emergency is lifted, patients won't be able to return as long as there is a risk of infection.""
His clinic, which employs seven staff, made it through the storm relatively unscathed because it is close to a major train station, although April revenue shrank 17% on the month.
Others have fared less well.
With more than 16,500 infections and 825 deaths, the world's third-largest economy has weathered the coronavirus pandemic better than many nations, without having to resort to hard lockdowns on travel and business.
Citizens have largely obeyed the government's call for an 80% cut in social interactions, but that inevitably hit visits to GPs for regular check-ups. 
Another deterrent for many was a wave of infections among dozens of patients and staff at several hospitals in Tokyo.
More than 90% of clinics in the capital suffered a revenue drop in April, the Tokyo Medical Practitioners' Association said, citing its survey of 1,200 clinics, while more than half reported a drop in income.
Nationwide, more than 80% of the 2,900 clinics surveyed by the Japan Federation of Insurance Medical Associations also saw revenue fall in the same period.
Such falls imperil the survival of many doctors' offices, where fixed costs, such as staff and rent, typically consume more than half their revenue.
Adding to the pain, some infection-wary patients have opted for online consultations that get only about half the national insurance reimbursement provided for checks in person.
A projected annual decline of about 500 billion yen ($4.6 billion) in hospital revenues has prompted a national body of teaching hospitals to turn to the government for compensation.
This month, medical and hospital associations urged the health ministry to tackle worsening business conditions, asking for funds intended for community heath initiatives to be diverted to help small clinics. 
Health ministry official Kazuho Taguchi said the ministry was taking the issue seriously. Non-virus services must be maintained, he added, saying the ministry was holding hearings on ways to offset the fall-off in patient numbers.
As income dries up, doctors may reconsider investment in equipment and hiring of nurses and staff, leading to a ""decline in the quality of medical care,"" said Toshio Nakagawa, vice president of the Japan Medical Association.
Worrying trends include cancer and diabetes patients falling off the radar while parents skip routine checks and vaccinations for newborns, said Yamazaki, at the urology clinic. 
""In all this coronavirus commotion, I'm really scared that some sick children will be overlooked,"" he added.

SHEUNG SHUI, Hong Kong (Reuters) - Last summer, pro-democracy protesters harassed Chinese traders in Sheung Shui and smashed storefronts that catered to them in the Hong Kong border town, angry at what they saw as a de facto invasion.
The protesters, many from elsewhere in Hong Kong, built on years of resentment by some locals who blame the cross-border traders for overcrowding the town and pushing up rents as they load up on cosmetics, milk powder and medicinal items to sell at a profit on the mainland. 
Now, there are no traders and no protesters. The town has been quiet since Hong Kong effectively shut its border with mainland China in February to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. On some streets, three-quarters of stores primarily serving traders have closed.
The protesters got what they wanted. But it has left some of the locals with mixed feelings.
""It's complicated to say whether the border closure is good or bad,"" said Helen, a 22-year-old university student in Hong Kong who said she was frustrated with the traders. 
She often argues about the issue with her parents, who run a herbal tea shop in Sheung Shui, she said: ""They say if no people from the mainland shop here, we won't have a business. You'll have nothing to eat. You'll have nowhere to live.""
Helen, who only gave her first name for fear of angering her parents, now has to sweep the shop's floor because her parents' mainlander employee cannot return. 
Protests erupted across Hong Kong last year over perceived meddling by China's communist authorities into the affairs of the semi-autonomous city, a charge which Beijing denies.
Anti-mainland sentiment found fertile ground in Sheung Shui, where discontent had been building for more than a decade - since border controls were relaxed - over the fast-growing cross-border trade that was overloading the town's infrastructure, raising rents and disrupting everyday life. 
Residents complained that the 'parallel traders,' as they are called, blocked sidewalks with their splayed suitcases as they repacked beauty products and baby formula, littered the streets, choked access to the train station and drove up prices in shops.
DESERTED STREETS
There were only three cosmetics shops in 2013, but 139 in January of this year, according to data collected by North District Parallel Imports Concern Group, which has lobbied to stop cross-border trading and ""reclaim Sheung Shui"" since 2012. 
In that time, pharmacies, jewellery shops and currency exchanges also mushroomed, often replacing restaurants and boutiques cherished by locals.
Only a few months ago, the town reverberated with the sound of rumbling trolleys and bargaining in Mandarin. But now it is quiet. On one block of a main street, seven out of nine cosmetics and baby formula shops had their metal security gates rolled down last week, some displaying ‘for lease’ signs taped over remnants of protest graffiti. 
In the shops that are still open, employees sit idle by fully stocked shelves, and told Reuters their hours have been slashed.
Nick Suen, a 20-year-old anti-trader protester and waiter at a Sheung Shui restaurant decorated with pro-democracy posters, said the town he grew up in ""feels like Hong Kong now."" With restaurant sales down about 70%, he said he was concerned about employment in the town, but freedom was more important to him than having a job.  
David So said he supports the pro-democracy protesters, even though they damaged his Romantic Cat Cosmetics Store last year because it was popular with mainland traders. He said his sales have dropped 70% to 80% since the border closed. 
    ""There are a lot of contradictions in Sheung Shui,"" said the 35-year-old, sitting behind hundreds of unsold Korean shampoo bottles. ""Our economy depends on Chinese capital, I admit. But as we keep earning money from China, they may try to change our thinking. We might need to obey their laws. That we don't want.""
    Beijing announced plans to directly impose national security laws on Hong Kong last week, prompting protesters to take to the streets on Sunday in scenes similar to last summer's unrest.
Sam Leung, the third-generation owner of his family's bedding business, which caters mostly to locals, said he had to downsize because of rising rents caused by the traders.
    ""So many of the local stores have gone from really big to really small, from really small to disappeared, from the main streets to small alleys,"" said Leung. 

    But he said the recent economic devastation was a chance to start anew: ""If there's nothing, you can slowly build. We can adapt to a new model in Sheung Shui.""

The U.S. government late on Friday accused the Chinese government of making it impossible for U.S. airlines to resume service to China.

KARACHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - As Fazal Rahmaan, 80 and his wife, Wahida Rahmaan, 74, boarded a plane in the Pakistani city of Lahore on Friday, their family's biggest fear was that they might get catch the coronavirus on their way to spend the holiday in Karachi.
Instead the couple, who had been married for 54 years, were among the 97 people killed when an Airbus A320, operated by Pakistan International Airlines, crashed into a Karachi neighbourhood - Pakistan's worst air disaster since 2012. 
""We held many calls deliberating with doctors and family ... Our biggest concern was that they made the trip safely,"" said their son, Inam Ur Rahmaan, who instead of welcoming his parents for the Eid al-Fitr holiday found himself picking through the wreckage of flight PK8303 praying for a miracle.
""I got in my car and followed the smoke and the ambulances,"" said Rahmaan. 
""When I saw the area, I realised that it would be a miracle if they had made it.""
There were two survivors from onboard the aircraft, while no fatalities were reported on the ground in the densely packed neighbourhood of multi-story homes abutting the eastern edge of Jinnah International Airport where the plane came down.
More than two dozen homes were damaged as the airliner roared in, leaving a tangle of severed electric cables and exposed rebar - a broken wing rested against the side of a home, an engine on the ground nearby. 
The jet fuel set the wreckage ablaze, along with homes and vehicles, sending black smoke into the sky, a Reuters witness said.
Crowds rushed to the site, relatives searching for loved ones, rescue workers and the curious. Scores of ambulances and fire-engines jammed the narrow, debris-cluttered streets.
One rescue worker told Reuters two bodies were found with oxygen masks on. Many bodies pulled from the wreckage were charred beyond recognition.
The airline's chief executive said on Friday the last message from the pilot indicated a technical problem. A team from Airbus is due to arrive on Monday to investigate, a PIA spokesman said.
""They'll provide all possible assistance including decoding the black box,"" the spokesman Khan, referring to the flight data recorder.
SCREAMS AND FIRE
Shahid Ahmed, 45, was at the airport waiting for his mother to arrive. When he reached the crash site he saw rescuers retrieving bodies and people taking selfies.
""There was no one responsible at the site, people were busy posing for pictures,"" said a distraught Ahmed, who lost his mother, Dishad Begum, 75, who was also flying to Karachi for Eid.
After scouring the site and failing to find his mother, Ahmed went to look for her in hospitals.
""There was no list of the dead or injured at any of the hospitals, it was all chaos and mismanagement,"" said Ahmed, who sobbed as he recounted the ordeal. 
""Searching for our mother's body was a nightmare.""
One of the survivors, engineer Muhammad Zubair, told Geo News the pilot came down to land, briefly touched down, then pulled up again.
He announced he was going to make to make a second try shortly before the plane crashed, Zubair said from hospital.
""I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn't see any people – just hear their screams,"" he said.
Rahmaan said his family was still in shock.
""There's no Eid in our home,"" he said.
Rahmaan said he took some comfort from knowing his parents always wanted to be with each other.

""Whatever's happened, whatever the reason behind it, they always wanted to be together. At the end, they were together.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's security and police chiefs said ""terrorism"" was growing in the city, as government departments rallied on Monday behind Beijing's plans to introduce national security laws after thousands took to the streets to protest against the move.
The security legislation, which could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in Hong Kong and aims to tackle secession, subversion and terrorist activities, has sent shockwaves through the business and diplomatic communities.
""Terrorism is growing in the city and activities which harm national security, such as 'Hong Kong independence', become more rampant,"" Secretary for Security John Lee said in a statement.
""In just a few months, Hong Kong has changed from one of the safest cities in the world to a city shrouded in the shadow of violence,"" he said, adding national security laws were needed to safeguard the city's prosperity and stability.
Police said they arrested more than 180 people on Sunday, when authorities fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse anti-government protesters as unrest returned to the Chinese-ruled city after months of relative calm. 
Police Commissioner Chris Tang said there have been 14 cases involving explosives ""commonly used in terrorist attacks overseas"" and five seizures of firearms and ammunition since protests began in June last year.
The draft legislation ""will help combat the force of 'Hong Kong independence' and restore social order. Police fully support it,"" Tang said.
In a return of the unrest that roiled Hong Kong last year, crowds thronged the streets of the city on Sunday in defiance of curbs imposed to contain the coronavirus, with chants of ""Hong Kong independence, the only way out,"" echoing through the streets.
Calls for independence are anathema to Beijing, which considers Hong Kong an inalienable part of the country. The proposed new national security framework stresses Beijing’s intent ""to prevent, stop and punish"" such acts.
Protests are expected to resume on Wednesday, when the city's legislature is expected to give a second reading of a bill that would criminalise abuse of China's national anthem.
Agencies issuing statements in support of the legislation included the Commissioner of Correctional Services, Hong Kong Customs, the Fire Department and the Government Flying Service.
""MISUNDERSTANDING""
Financial Secretary Paul Chan wrote on his blog on Sunday the national security law ""itself"" does not affect investor confidence, only the ""misunderstanding"" of it does.
“The central government has already said the law is targeted at the minority of people who are suspected of threatening national security and will not affect the rights of the general public.”
The United States, Australia, Britain, Canada and others have expressed concerns about the legislation, widely seen as a potential turning point for China's freest city and one of the world's leading financial hubs.
Taiwan, which has become a refuge for a small but growing number of pro-democracy protesters fleeing Hong Kong, will provide the people of Hong Kong with ""necessary assistance"", President Tsai Ing-wen said.
Nearly 200 political figures from around the world decried the legislation. Bankers and headhunters said the legislation could lead to money and talent leaving the city.
Hong Kong's bourse added a 1% fall to the 5.6% plunge on Friday when the new security plan was unveiled by Beijing and the Hong Kong dollar hovered around its lowest since March.
In a statement late on Sunday, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said the vast majority of residents and overseas investors ""have nothing to fear"" from the new security legislation and hit back at criticism from abroad.

""Sadly, and perhaps tellingly, those who claim to be acting in Hong Kong's best interests turn a blind eye to the explosives, petrol bombs, firearms, weapons, attacks on bystanders, wanton vandalism, online trolling and disinformation campaigns used by radical protesters and their hidden handlers to stoke fear and chaos and destabilise society,"" it said.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state on Monday urged locals to continue working from home despite schools reopening as the number of coronavirus cases slows.
Australia has reported just over 7,100 COVID-19 infections, including 102 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries.
With fewer than 20 new COVID-19 cases most days, Australian states are pressing ahead with a three-stage plan to remove most social restrictions imposed by July.
In New South Wales (NSW), which includes the city of Sydney, children returned to full-time face-to-face learning on Monday, allowing many parents to return to offices - although lawmakers urged those who could to stay home to avoid putting pressure on the transport network.
""I am very pleased that the system hasn’t been overwhelmed,"" said NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.
""People are listening, making informed decisions, and that is the way we would like it to continue.""
Reopening schools is a central part of reviving Australia's economy.
With international borders likely to remain closed for months, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is also pressing locals to begin holidays locally to help support Australia's tourism sector.
But state squabbles continue to simmer.
While the federal government has devised a plan to reopen the national economy, the implementation is left to individual state and territory leaders, who come from opposing political parties and have different views on how much unrestricted movement should be allowed.
Around 120 million domestic overnight tourists spent a record A$80.7 billion ($52.79 billion) last year, according to government data, accounting for almost half of all tourism spending.
The differences between states also threaten to delay reopening travel between New Zealand and Australia.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Arden said both countries are developing protocols, but it would be unlikely to begin until Australia allows free domestic travel.

Wind speeds of up to 132 km/hour (82 mph) were registered at Cape Leeuwin, one of the state's most south-westerly points early on Monday, the strongest May gusts in 15 years, according to the Australia Broadcasting Corp.
""Some wild weather has affected large parts of WA, causing widespread damage and large scale power outages. Please listen to the advice of emergency services and stay safe everyone,"" Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on social media.
Around 50,000 customers were without power on Monday due to storm-related outages, utility Western Power said, as the remnants of Cyclone Mangga hit a cold front and brought squalling rain and emergency level storm warnings to the south of the state. 
""New damage from the windborne debris has meant the overall number of impacted homes and businesses remains high,"" it said on Twitter. 
More than 390 calls for assistance were made to the state's emergency services since Sunday, mostly from the Perth metropolitan area, the Department of Fire and Emergency Services Chief Superintendent Danny Mosconi told ABC Radio. 
Pilbara Ports Authority said port operations in the Pilbara had not been affected, but elevated swell led to some minor shipping schedule changes at the Port of Dampier, which is used by Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO).

The travel ban was a blow to right-wing Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who has followed the example of U.S. President Donald Trump in addressing the pandemic, fighting calls for social distancing and touting unproven drugs. The Brazilian president's office did not respond to a request for comment.
""The U.S. maintains a strong partnership with Brazil and we work closely to mitigate the socioeconomic and health impacts of COVID-19 in Brazil,"" the U.S. Embassy in Brasilia said in a statement. 
The new restrictions come into force on May 28, the embassy said, prohibiting most non-U.S. citizens from traveling to the United States if they have been in Brazil in the last two weeks. Green card holders, close relatives of U.S. citizens and flight crew members, among select others, would be exempt. 
Brazil's foreign ministry called it a technical decision in the context of ""important bilateral collaboration"" to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting U.S. donations of $6.5 million and a new White House promise of 1,000 respirators.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the new restrictions would help ensure foreign nationals do not bring additional infections to the United States, but would not apply to the flow of commerce between the two countries.
National security adviser Robert O'Brien earlier on Sunday told CBS' ""Face the Nation"" he hoped the move could be reconsidered at some point. 
""We hope that'll be temporary, but because of the situation in Brazil, we're going to take every step necessary to protect the American people,"" O'Brien said.
An advisor to Brazil's president played down Trump's move, highlighting shared views on fighting the virus with unproven anti-malarial drugs such as hydroxychloroquine.
""There is nothing specific against Brazil,"" tweeted Filipe Martins, an advisor on international affairs to Bolsonaro.
Two hours earlier, he wrote that Trump had ""opened a direct line for the exchange of information about the protocol for using hydroxychloroquine and other treatments for the virus.""
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned last month about using the drug to treat the COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, citing ""reports of serious heart rhythm problems"" in patients receiving the medicine. 
Bolsonaro's insistence on the drug's potential and defiance of state isolation orders pushed out two health ministers in a month, both trained doctors. The acting head of the Health Ministry, an army general, issued guidelines this week to expand use of the drug in coronavirus cases.
Brazil's Health Ministry raised its tally of confirmed cases by 15,813 on Sunday to 363,211 cases, second in the world behind the United States, with more than 1.6 million cases.

Brazil's death toll, which often slows over the weekend due to reporting delays, rose by 653 confirmed fatalities on Sunday to 22,666 dead in total, well behind nearly 100,000 U.S. deaths.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was undaunted by an earthquake that struck the capital Wellington on Monday while she was doing a live TV interview, and calmly continued with the programme.
Ardern, who became prime minister in 2017, is hugely popular in New Zealand for her handling of several crises - a mass shooting in Christchurch last year, a volcanic eruption in December and the recent coronavirus pandemic.
Wellington and nearby areas were shaken by a 5.8 magnitude earthquake with the epicentre 30 km (20 miles) northwest of Levin, a city close to the capital, and at a depth of 37 km, according to Geonet. 
Ardern was speaking on a live TV interview at the time from the parliament building, called the Beehive.
""We’re just having a bit of an earthquake here, Ryan...,"" she told the host of the show Ryan Bridge, as she, the camera and other things around her shook. 
""Quite a decent shake here...if you see things moving behind me. The Beehive moves a little more than most,"" she said.
Ardern assured the host that she was safe and the interview resumed.
""We are fine, I'm not under any hanging lights and I look like I am in a structurally strong place,"" she added.
The video was soon viral on social media. 

Although the quake caused no damages or injuries were reported, it lasted for more than 30 seconds and caused panic in Wellington with several people in offices and homes getting under their tables for cover.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As Muslims around the world celebrate Eid al-Fitr to mark the end of the fasting month, thousands of migrant workers in Singapore have had to spend the holiday in quarantine because of outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in their dormitories. 
To cheer them up, Singaporean business Dushyant Kumar, his wife and a team of chefs cooked up a giant biryani for a Sunday evening Eid feast for at least 600 migrants.
Kumar used a family recipe for the South Asian rice dish often eaten during festive occasions. 
""Usually, if they are with their family, they will get to enjoy these kinds of dishes, because everyone will cook and eat, but here these guys are alone,"" said Kumar, in between tasting the dish being prepared in big cooking pots at the kitchen of a restaurant.
There are about 300,000 foreign labourers in Singapore, most of them from Bangladesh, China and India, and most staying in purpose-built dormitories, in rooms with bunks for 12 to 20 men. 
""So we want to make sure they don't feel left out,"" said Kumar, whose imitative is supported by funds from donors and a non-governmental organisation. 
""The smile on their face gives you a lot of satisfaction,"" said Kumar, who has been overseeing the delivery of more than 1,000 meals a day to migrants in quarantine since early April.
The government has said employers are required to provide sufficient food for workers during this lockdown, but it is also working with charity groups to make up any shortfalls.

Singapore has had more than 30,000 COVID-19 cases, one of the highest tallies in Asia, with the vast majority of infections among migrant workers in their dormitory accommodation.

Taiwan has become a refuge for a small but growing number of pro-democracy protesters fleeing Hong Kong, which has been convulsed since last year by anti-Beijing and anti-Hong Kong government protests. 
Hong Kong police fired tear gas and water cannon to disperse thousands of people who rallied on Sunday to protest against Beijing's move to introduce new national security laws.
Writing on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page late on Sunday, Tsai said the proposed legislation was a serious threat to Hong Kong's freedoms and judicial independence. 
Bullets and repression are not the way to deal with the aspirations of Hong Kong's people for freedom and democracy, she added.
""In face of the changing situation, the international community has proactively stretched out a helping hand to Hong Kong's people,"" Tsai wrote.
Taiwan will ""even more proactively perfect and forge ahead with relevant support work, and provide Hong Kong's people with necessary assistance"", she wrote. 
Taiwan has no law on refugees that could be applied to Hong Kong protesters who seek asylum on the island. Its laws do promise, though, to help Hong Kong citizens whose safety and liberty are threatened for political reasons.
The number of Hong Kong immigrants to Taiwan jumped 150% to 2,383 in the first four months of 2020 from the same period last year, official data shows.
Johnny Chiang, chairman of Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, said Tsai's government was vocal about support for Hong Kong on the election campaign trail but had failed to provide meaningful help since Tsai was re-elected in January.
""Don't let 'supporting Hong Kong' only be a slogan of empty promises ... Bring up your thoughts on legislation. Support Hong Kong with real actions,"" Chiang said, referring to parliamentary bills to give political asylum for people from Hong Kong.
The small New Power Party also urged Tsai's cabinet to establish a special task force to give ""tangible assistance"" to Hong Kong people. 
The Hong Kong protests have won widespread sympathy in Taiwan, and the support for the protesters by Tsai and her administration have worsened already poor ties between Taipei and Beijing.
China has accused supporters of Taiwan independence of colluding with the protesters.

China believes Tsai to be a ""separatist"" bent on declaring the island's formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - When Manit Parikh's mother tested positive for the new coronavirus, she was rushed by ambulance to Mumbai's private Lilavati Hospital, but officials told the family no critical-care beds were available.
Five hours and dozens of phone calls later the family found a bed for her at the private Bombay Hospital. A day later, on May 18, Parikh's 92-year-old diabetic grandfather had breathing difficulties at home and was taken to the city's Breach Candy Hospital, another top private facility, but there were no beds.
""My dad was pleading with them,"" Parikh told Reuters. ""They said they didn't have a bed, not even a normal bed."" Later that day, they found a bed at Bombay Hospital but his grandfather died hours later. His test results showed he was infected with the virus.
Parikh said he believes the delays contributed to his grandfather's death. Officials at Lilavati and Bombay Hospital declined to speak with Reuters. Representatives of Breach Candy hospital did not respond to requests for comment.
For years, India's booming private hospitals have taken some of the strain off the country's underfunded and dilapidated public health network, but the ordeal of Parikh's family suggests that as coronavirus cases explode in India, even private facilities are at risk of being overrun.
India on Sunday reported 6,767 new coronavirus infections, the country’s biggest one-day increase. Government data shows the number of coronavirus cases in the world’s second-most populous country are doubling every 13 days or so, even as the government begins easing lockdown restrictions. India has reported more than 131,000 infections, including 3,867 deaths. 
""The increasing trend has not gone down,"" said Bhramar Mukherjee, a professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of Michigan, referring to India’s cases. ""We've not seen a flattening of the curve.""
Mukherjee's team estimates that between 630,000 and 2.1 million people in India - out of a population of 1.3 billion - will become infected by early July. 
More than a fifth of the country’s coronavirus cases are in Mumbai, India's financial hub and its most populous city, where the Parikhs struggled to find hospital beds for their infected family members.
India's health ministry did not respond to a request for comment on how it will cope with the predicted rise in infections, given that most public hospitals are overcrowded at the best of times. The federal government has said in media briefings that not all patients need hospitalization and it is making rapid efforts to increase the number of hospital beds and procure health gear.
The federal government's data from last year showed there were about 714,000 hospital beds in India, up from about 540,000 in 2009. However, given India's rising population, the number of beds per 1,000 people has grown only slightly in that time. 
India has 0.5 beds per 1,000 people, according to the latest data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), up from 0.4 beds in 2009, but among lowest of countries surveyed by the OECD. In contrast, China has 4.3 hospital beds per 1,000 people and the United States has 2.8, according to the latest OECD figures.
While millions of India's poor rely on the public health system, especially in rural areas, private facilities account for 55% of hospital admissions, according to government data. The private health sector has been growing over the past two decades, especially in India’s big cities, where an expanding class of affluent Indians can afford private care. 
Mumbai's municipal authority said it had ordered public officials to take control of at least 100 private hospital beds in all 24 zones in the city of almost 20 million people to make more beds available for coronavirus patients.
Still, there is a waiting list. An official at a helpline run by Mumbai's civic authorities told Reuters that patients would be notified about availability.
SHORTAGE OF STAFF
It is not just beds that are in short supply. On May 16, Mumbai's municipal authority said that it did not have enough staff to operate beds required for patients critically ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. 
As a result, resident doctors will receive less time off than what is prescribed by the federal government, the authority said. Some medical professionals told Reuters they already are overburdened and treating patients without adequate protective gear, exposing them to a higher risk of infection.
Several hospitals in Mumbai, western Gujarat state, the northern city of Agra and Kolkata in the east have in recent weeks shut partially or fully for days because some medical staff were infected with the virus. The federal government has not reported any deaths of medical staff from the virus. 
""In our country, healthcare has never gotten priority,"" said Dr Adarsh Pratap Singh, head of the 2,500-strong resident doctors association at New Delhi's top public hospital, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. ""The government is now realizing the reality, but it's already too late.""
The AIIMS group has in recent weeks protested about the lack of health gear and publicly rejected Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for doctors to donate a part of their salaries to his coronavirus fund.
Some health experts say India's struggle to treat virus patients is the result of chronic underinvestment in healthcare. The Indian government estimates it spends only about 1.5% of its GDP on public health. That figure is higher than it was - about 1% in the 1980s and 1.3% five years ago - but India still ranks among the world's lowest spenders in terms of percentage of GDP.
This year, Modi's federal government raised its health budget by 6%, but that is still short of the government's own goal of increasing public health spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2025, according to New Delhi-based think tank Observer Research Foundation. 
'TOO MANY PATIENTS'
Keshav Desiraju, a former Indian health secretary, said more investment in the health system before the virus outbreak might have made the health system more resilient. ""At the times of a crisis, all the holes show up,"" he told Reuters.
Dr. Chaitanya Patil, a senior resident doctor at King Edward Memorial government hospital, one of Mumbai's largest, said the facility had a shortage of medical staff and the 12 coronavirus wards catering to about 500 patients were almost full.
""There are just too many patients coming in,"" said Patil, ""It is lack of preparedness or a lack of insight of the people planning.""
Last week Rajesh Tope, health minister of the state of Maharashtra, which contains Mumbai, said the lack of hospital beds for critically ill patients will not last long. 
""In the next two months, more than 17,000 vacant posts of doctors, nurses, technicians and other health workers will be filled,"" he said in a public address.
India's United Nurses Association, which represents 380,000 medics, took a list of 12 issues they said they are facing - including lack of protective gear and accommodation - to the Supreme Court in April. The court told them they can lodge complaints on a government helpline.
Some nurses are leaving the big cities. Earlier this month, about 300 nurses working at hospitals in Kolkata city left for their hometowns 1,500 km (930 miles) away in India's remote northeastern state of Manipur. A group representing them said they had left because of irregular salaries and inadequate safety gear, among other issues.

""We love our profession,"" said 24-year-old Shyamkumar, who quit his nursing job in one of Kolkata's hospitals and is planning to head back to Manipur. ""But when we are going to work, please give us proper equipment.""

14,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2020 09:00PM ET</span>",Explainer: Emerging get-tough consensus among Trump's China advisers tested by Hong Kong debate,"By Matt Spetalnick and Steve Holland
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Long divided between those pushing for a hardline stance and others advocating cautious engagement, President Donald Trump’s China advisers - under the shadow of the coronavirus crisis - appear to have moved closer together on a tougher approach to Beijing.
A test for this emerging consensus will be how it affects the U.S. response to China’s Communist Party rulers proposing stricter national security laws for Hong Kong that have reignited pro-democracy protests in the former British colony.
Trump, who has vacillated between the two camps in his administration, must decide if the United States will preserve Hong Kong’s special status, halt privileged treatment that has helped make it a global financial hub or take lesser actions such as targeted sanctions or tariffs if Beijing goes ahead. His hard-fought trade deal with China could also hang in the balance.
As Trump seeks re-election in November, his advisers have become more in sync on the need to pressure China, including over Hong Kong, according to current and former U.S. officials and a congressional source. Opinion polls show growing anti-China sentiment among U.S. voters.
""There used to be really a line drawn on the ground, with the traditional free market people who weren’t crazy about the tariffs and understood China had the second-largest economy, and strategic national security advisers,"" said a former administration official. ""Most people are aligned that it’s time to be tough on China now.""
Others, however, are not so sure. “It’s tough to get a unified message out of Washington these days,” said Mark Simon, a U.S. executive for Next Media, a media group funded by pro-democracy Hong Kong businessman Jimmy Lai, and a Republican Party donor.
The following advisers will help shape Trump's decision:
MIKE POMPEO
The Secretary of State has become the public face of the anti-China push. A Trump loyalist, Pompeo is likely to play a pivotal role in any response to Beijing’s assertion of greater control over Hong Kong, which he warned could be the “death knell” for the territory’s autonomy. The department must issue a congressionally mandated report on whether Hong Kong has maintained a high degree of autonomy from China.
ROBERT O’BRIEN
Trump’s national security adviser has focused more on China than his predecessor, John Bolton. While taking care not to buck his boss, O’Brien has become a vocal critic of Beijing. On Sunday, he made the most explicit threat yet that China could face sanctions over Hong Kong.
MATT POTTINGER
A former journalist and Marine, he was one of the first in the administration to accuse China of not coming clean about the novel coronavirus outbreak. Pottinger is possibly the main driver for an aggressive approach. His distrust of China stems from his work as a journalist there, where he recounted being spied on and roughed up.
Pottinger started as Asia adviser before being named O’Brien’s deputy. “O’Brien could have picked anybody but he picked China hawk Pottinger,” the former administration official said.
STEVEN MNUCHIN
The Treasury Secretary has long been a voice of moderation on China. But as pressure has mounted over China’s handling of the coronavirus, Mnuchin has shown signs of being less hesitant about stronger measures, including restricting Chinese tech company Huawei Technologies. On Hong Kong, he could still advise caution to avoid upsetting markets. He has often been allied with Trump’s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner.
LARRY KUDLOW
Trump's economic adviser had been more circumspect on China but this month signed off on directing the board overseeing federal workers’ pensions to halt plans to invest in certain Chinese companies. It is unclear how Kudlow, a free-marketeer as a television commentator, will advise on Hong Kong.
PETER NAVARRO

The trade adviser gained notoriety for his book and film “Death by China.” Navarro is known at times to have Trump’s ear and is expected to push for harsh punishment of Beijing over Hong Kong.

15,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 24, 2020 06:09PM ET</span>",The Worst May Be Coming for Japan’s Abe Even as Virus Eases,"(Bloomberg) -- Japan’s coronavirus emergency could end as soon as Monday, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s political troubles may be just beginning.
Abe’s efforts to curb the outbreak and ease its economic damage have been widely ridiculed as slow and ineffective. He’s been outshone by regional governors, who pressed him to finally call the state of emergency credited with halting the spread of infections for now. Now, a favoritism scandal has helped push his approval rating to a level that has forced past premiers to resign.
Moreover, the crisis has undermined support for his economic stewardship and depleted the resources Abe will need to avert a deep recession and pull off another comeback like ones that made him the country’s longest-serving premier. As a result, some in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are weighing possible successors, led by former Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida.
“The more unease grows over the economy, the less people support him,” said Lully Miura, president of Tokyo-based political consulting firm Yamaneko Research Institute. “People who haven’t received financial aid are losing their jobs and companies are going under.”
Abe’s difficulties provide a warning to other world leaders who like him weathered the initial pandemic shock only to be confronted with a historic economic slowdown. Analysts expect Japan to suffer a contraction of almost 22% this quarter, the deepest since records began in 1955.
While Japan has suffered far fewer coronavirus infections and deaths than any of its Group of Seven peers and Abe could soon lift the state of emergency for Tokyo, his handling of the outbreak has reinforced concerns that his government has grown complacent after seven years in power. Abe has been criticized for delaying an emergency declaration when local cases began to surge and for being slow to close Japan’s borders to Chinese visitors.
Meanwhile, botched efforts to distribute cash handouts and re-usable masks became fodder for talk show ridicule. An Instagram video of Abe relaxing on a sofa meant to encourage people to stay home instead got slammed for appearing tone deaf.
Apart from the pandemic, Abe has been forced to change plans after another in a long string of controversies over government actions that appear to benefit political allies. Last week, Abe shelved a retirement bill that opposition lawmakers said would’ve allowed his favored candidate to stay on to become the country’s top prosecutor.
Making matters worse, the potential candidate, Hiromu Kurokawa, is now set to resign. Justice Minister Masako Mori said Thursday that Kurokawa had play mahjong games for money, despite emergency virus orders discouraging such social activities.
Support for Abe’s cabinet plunged 13 percentage points in less than four weeks to 27%, according to a poll released by the Mainichi newspaper Saturday, with any level below 30% traditionally seen as a danger zone for the government. Disapproval surged 19 percentage points to 64%, a trend mirrored by other surveys.
“When support falls, his sway over the party weakens,” Miura said. In another sign of Abe’s weakening position, his junior coalition partner forced him to change direction on the size and scope of cash handouts for individuals.
Abe has bounced back from several crises since taking office for the second time in 2012 and gone on to win six national elections, benefiting from a weak and splintered opposition. The coronavirus, however, comes at a time when many in the LDP had already begun to think about who will succeed him after his third -- and ostensibly final -- term as party leader expires in September 2021.
Who’s Next?
Kishida, the former foreign minister and current LDP policy chief, is widely seen as most likely to get the job, Miura said. Other potential candidates include Health Minister Katsunobu Kato and Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, who have both bolstered their profiles by playing key roles in Japan’s pandemic response.
Polls generally show Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister who has distanced himself from the government, as the public’s favorite.
Abe no longer has the fiscal ammunition he enjoyed when the economy was steady and the country had virtually full employment. Japan’s troubles are likely to deepen as households limit spending to essentials and companies cut back on investment, production and hiring to stay afloat.
Still, it might be too early to rule out Abe from staging another comeback and even securing a fourth term as LDP leader.
“Support will definitely fall for a week or two, but after that what happens to his support rate will depend on the spread of the virus,” said Harukata Takenaka, a political science professor at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies. “If the situation settles down, people may see him as having done a good job.”

Burkina Faso and its neighbours Mali and Niger in West Africa's semi-arid Sahel zone are battling Islamist insurgencies with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
Those groups have been strengthening and expanding their range of operations, leaving coastal countries like Ivory Cost fearful the violence will spill onto their territories. 
The joint operation was launched on May 11 with about 1,000 Ivorian soldiers participating from their side of the 580-kilometre (360-mile) border with Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast's army said in a statement. 
The suspected militants were killed in Burkina Faso, the army said, adding that the operation is ongoing. 
Jihadist attacks in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger have escalated dramatically over the past year despite significant military support from former colonial ruler France. 
While Ivory Coast has mostly been spared the violence affecting its neighbours, it was the victim in 2016 of an attack claimed by al Qaeda in which gunmen killed 19 people at a beach resort.

17,By Reuters,"<span>May 24, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",South African president says lockdown to ease from June 1,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - President Cyril Ramaphosa announced on Sunday a further easing of South Africa's coronavirus lockdown from June 1, allowing the vast majority of the economy to return to full capacity. 
Africa's most industrialised economy has been largely shut down since late March, when the government enforced severe restrictions to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus which has so far infected 22,583 people and killed 429.
Ramaphosa, who has been under pressure from rival political parties and a variety of industries to ease the restrictions, said following broad consultations the cabinet had decided to move the country to ""level three"" of its five-level lockdown system. 
""This will result in the opening up of the economy and the removal of a number of restrictions on the movement of people while significantly expanding... our public health interventions,"" he said in a televised address.
While Ramaphosa initially enjoyed broad support for the strict lockdown, which confined most people to their homes aside from essential trips and banned the sale of alcohol and cigarettes, that has given way to concerns about the impact on an already shrinking economy and on a mostly poor population. 
Under level three, Ramaphosa said that aside from a few exceptions where risk of transmission is high, the economy could return to full capacity, a curfew and restriction on outdoor exercise would be lifted and alcohol could be sold for home consumption. 
He warned though that this would result in a spike in the number of cases, which he said had only been delayed by the measures taken so far and given the country a chance to build up its public health capacity. 

Any part of the country, such as coronavirus hotspots like the major cities of Johannesburg and Cape Town, could be returned to a stricter lockdown if the rise in cases and the impact on the health system became too severe, he added.

(Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Sunday hailed supporters rallying in the country's capital to back his administration as an unfolding political scandal adds to the public health crisis driven by the coronavirus outbreak.
Surrounded by security guards wearing masks, but not wearing one himself, Bolsonaro was shown in a live streaming video on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page greeting protesters waving Brazilian flags and calling him a ""Legend,"" days after Brazil topped Russia to become the world's No. 2 virus hot spot after the United States.
The rally, one of several such demonstrations Bolsonaro has encouraged in recent weeks, came as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, a close ally of the far-right Bolsonaro, mulls a ban on travel from Brazil because of the worsening outbreak there.
Health Ministry figures released on Saturday evening showed that 16,508 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total above 347,000, while the death toll increased by 965 to 22,013.
Bolsonaro was seen posing for photographs, shaking people's hands and even carrying a young boy on his shoulders, part of a pattern of flouting and discouraging social isolation measures advised by health professionals to curb the pandemic.
More pro-Bolsonaro rallies were expected to take place in Sao Paulo, Brazil's most populous city and the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The demonstrations follow a decision by Brazil's Federal Supreme Court late last week to release a video recording of an April 22 ministerial meeting, in which Bolsonaro said he wanted to change security officials, their bosses or even ministers to stop his family and friends from getting ""screwed.""

The political scandal revolves around an accusation by former Justice Minister Sergio Moro, a popular anti-graft crusader, that Bolsonaro aimed to interfere in police investigations.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed his senior adviser Dominic Cummings on Sunday, despite calls from within his own Conservative Party for the aide to resign for travelling 250 miles during the coronavirus lockdown.
Cummings, who masterminded the 2016 campaign to leave the European Union, came under pressure when newspapers reported he had travelled from London to Durham in late March, when Britain was under a strict lockdown to combat the coronavirus outbreak.
With Johnson's words that he had acted with integrity, Cummings was safe. But the row within the governing Conservatives looked set to ripple on, with those who called for the senior aide's resignation expected to be marginalised.
""I've had extensive face-to-face conversations with Dominic Cummings,"" Johnson told a news conference.
""And I conclude that in travelling to find the right kind of childcare, at the moment when both he and his wife were about to be incapacitated by coronavirus, and when he had no alternative - I think he followed the instincts of every father, and every parent. And I do not mark him down for that.""
""I believe that in every respect he has acted responsibly and legally,"" he added.
A divisive figure, Cummings became the focus of criticism late on Friday when the Daily Mirror and Guardian newspapers reported he had travelled 400 km (250 miles) to Durham in northern England with his wife who had COVID-19 symptoms.
Johnson's office said Cummings made the journey to ensure his 4-year-old son could be properly cared for by relatives if he too fell ill.
The journey took place at a time when millions of Britons were staying inside and foregoing contacts with friends and relatives. The government's order at the time was everyone in a household where anyone had symptoms must not leave home.
The newspapers have since reported that Cummings was seen in northern England on other occasions. The government has denied this.
A number of cabinet ministers and the attorney general have said that the journey was justified.
But some Conservatives have said Cummings must go.
""I just see this rattling on now for day after day, wasting the public's time, consuming political capital and diverting from the real issues we need to deal with,"" Conservative lawmaker Steve Baker told Sky News. ""No-one is indispensable."" 

Other prominent British figures have resigned after breaking lockdown rules. Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson quit as a member of the government's scientific advisory group after he was visited at home by his girlfriend. Scotland's chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, stepped down after she was caught making two trips to her second home.

President Donald Trump in March canceled the G7 meeting scheduled for June 10 as the coronavirus outbreak was spreading around the world and international travel was curtailed.
Trump on Wednesday said he may seek to revive the idea of a face-to-face meeting of G7 leaders near Washington, saying it would send a message that the world is heading back to normal.
""The G7 summit, if it happens in person and we think it will, will take place at the end of June,"" O'Brien said on CBS's ""Face the Nation."" 
O'Brien said he believed the nation's capital is close to its peak of coronavirus cases and the United States would like to hold an in-person summit if the situation permits.
However, Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus task force response coordinator, said on Friday the Washington metropolitan area has the highest percentage of positive test results nationwide. 
She said she has asked the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work with officials in Washington, Chicago and Los Angeles to figure out why cases are rising.
O'Brien said he believed the G7 leaders would prefer to meet in person rather than on video conference.
""So the president extended the invitation and so far we've had a great response,"" he said. ""The logistics - we'll make sure everybody is tested. We'll make sure that it's a safe environment if the leaders can come here. But we'd love to host them in Washington."" 

French President Emmanuel Macron is open to traveling to the United States for an in-person meeting of Group of Seven leaders if the coronavirus epidemic situation allows, an Elysee official said on Wednesday.

""I can't wait for it,"" she said wistfully. ""I'm really looking forward to running, sunbathing and sitting by the fountains."" 
The coronavirus death toll rose by 70 on Sunday to 28,752, the eighth day in a row the daily death toll was under 100, the health ministry said. The total number of coronavirus cases rose to 235,772. 
Spain is now in the third month of its national emergency, having endured one of the highest per capita death tolls in the world from the coronavirus, which hit hardest in Madrid.
Madrid and Barcelona will follow other areas of the country where the lockdown has already been eased further. Bars will be allowed to open terraces at 50% capacity and people will be permitted to meet in groups of a maximum of 10. 
""A collective effort has allowed us to leave behind the most critical stage,"" said government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero on Sunday, urging people not to let their guard down as the lockdown eases. 
Madrid's main hospitality organisation told newspaper Cinco Dias this week it expected only around 10% of bars to open their terraces in the city.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The public returned to St Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) on Sunday to receive Pope Francis's blessing from his window for the first time in nearly three months as he convoked a year of reflection on the environment.
Only a few dozen people went to the square, which was reopened on Monday along with St Peter's Basilica following coronavirus lockdowns. They kept to social distancing rules and most wore masks.
Francis delivered his message via the internet from his library, as those in the square watched on large screens, and then went to the window for the silent blessing. In the past three months, he has blessed an empty square.
Sunday was the fifth anniversary of his encyclical ""Laudato Si"" on the care of the environment, which called for a reduction of fossil fuels and backed the majority scientific consensus that human activity is partly to blame for global warming.
He urged Catholics to reflect on the environment for the next twelve months, how they can better protect it and how to help those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. 
He also sent special greetings to Catholics in mainland China on the day they celebrate a national religious feast day.
Catholics in China are emerging from more than half a century of division which saw them split between a state-backed ""official"" Church and a ""non-official"" underground Church loyal to Rome.
In 2018, the Holy See and Beijing signed a historic pact on the naming of bishops, meaning all bishops recognized the pope's authority.
But there have been hiccups. In June, the Vatican asked Beijing to stop intimidating clergy who refuse to sign an official government registration.

The deal, which is up for renewal in September, has split Catholics in China and around the world, with some critics saying the pope caved in to the Communist government.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Benjamin Netanyahu professed his innocence at the start of his corruption trial on Sunday, saying he was being framed in the first criminal prosecution of a serving Israeli prime minister.
Flanked by a clutch of cabinet ministers from his right-wing Likud party, and speaking forcefully, Netanyahu appealed to public opinion, addressing television cameras in the courthouse hallway before taking his seat on the defendants' bench.
""These investigations were tainted and stitched-up from the first moment,"" Netanyahu said about charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud at the centre of three graft cases against him.
Outside the courthouse, and separated by metal barriers and police, hundreds of his supporters and opponents held noisy demonstrations. Chants of ""Bibi, king of Israel"" from Netanyahu faithful using his nickname echoed through the court building.
Netanyahu, 70, was indicted in November in cases involving gifts from millionaire friends and for allegedly seeking regulatory favours for media tycoons in return for favourable coverage.
He drove in a motorcade to court after attending the first working session of his new ""unity"" cabinet, sworn in a week ago after a surprise power-sharing deal with his main opponent Benny Gantz. Its inauguration ended more than a year of political deadlock in the wake of three inconclusive elections.
In his hallway appearance, Netanyahu dubbed prosecutors and police the ""Just Not Bibi Gang"", reasserting that he was a victim of a political witch-hunt abetted by a left-wing media to drive him from office.
""I am appearing here today, as your prime minister, standing tall and with head high,"" Netanyahu said, vowing to beat the charges and continue to lead Israel in his current fifth term.
He is Israel's longest-serving leader, now in office for more than 11 straight years, plus three years in the 1990s.
On the street, a supporter's sign read: ""Netanyahu, you'll never walk alone"".
""Crime Minister,"" countered a banner draped over a barrier in the other camp's protest area.
In the courtroom, one of the judges asked Netanyahu whether he had read and understood the indictment.

The prime minister then stood up and replied: ""Yes, your Honour.""

Earlier this month, President Emmanuel Macron said it was unlikely that French people would be able to undertake major foreign trips this summer and that even trips within Europe may have to be limited to reduce the risk of a resurgence of the coronavirus epidemic.
Borne, in an interview with France Inter radio, also said that next week the government would decide on possibly loosening rules on French domestic travel, currently limited to a maximum 100 kilometers from home. 
She said Paris parks had to remain closed for now, as the capital was still a ""red zone"" for virus circulation.

LONDON (Reuters) - Dominic Cummings, the mastermind of Brexit who openly scorned the British elite, is fighting for his job as Prime Minister Boris Johnson's senior adviser after claims he flouted the government's coronavirus lockdown rules.
Cast, variously, as an anarchist, visionary, Britain’s Rasputin, a political vandal and even Johnson's ""brain"", Cummings has made a name for himself by deriding what he sees as the arrogant and inefficient British governing class.
But it was accusations of hubris in apparently flouting the government's lockdown rules - which he helped craft - for at least one 400 km (250 mile) journey that may ultimately seal his fate.
Cummings, who has repeatedly refused to resign, entered Downing Street on Sunday after some Conservative Party lawmakers demanded he quit.
""It is intolerable that Boris’ government is losing so much political capital,"" said Steve Baker, a Brexit-supporting lawmaker. ""Dominic Cummings must go.""
Others were more brutal.
""It’s his cavalier 'I don’t care; I’m cleverer than you' tone that infuriates people,"" Conservative lawmaker Simon Hoare said.
Cummings has said he acted responsibly and legally and on Saturday, when asked if he would resign, scolded reporters outside his house for getting the 2016 Brexit referendum wrong.
""Obviously not,"" he said of resignation.
""You guys are probably all about as right about that as you were about Brexit: do you remember how right you all were about that?"" Cummings said. 
Still, Cummings has propelled Johnson into a crisis just as he tries to defend the government against claims from opposition parties and some scientists that he was too slow to impose a lockdown on the $3 trillion economy.
The United Kingdom has the worst official COVID-19 death toll in Europe.
BREXIT MASTERMIND
Cummings, alongside fellow campaigner Matthew Elliott, drove Vote Leave to victory in the 2016 referendum. He is credited with coining the phrase: ""Take back control"".
Behind his bluster, Cummings believes the elites of the West - and the United Kingdom in particular - are out of touch with voters and have consistently failed their people while bailing out big business.
He scorns the accepted Westminster dress code of a suit and tie, wearing jeans and t-shirts in Downing Street, often accompanied by an ill-fitting woolen hat.
Cummings also likes to berate reporters. In 2019, he told Reuters to stop asking about Brexit: ""You guys should get outside London and go to talk to people who are not rich remainers.""
But he is more than a campaigner: he is one of the most powerful unelected officials in the United Kingdom. Opponents compare him to King Henry VIII's chief minister Thomas Cromwell.
When asked by Reuters about comparisons with Cromwell earlier this year, Cummings just chuckled.
JOHNSON'S BRAIN
After Johnson won the top job in 2019, Cummings was brought into government at the very heart of British power.
He helped Johnson navigate the maze of Brexit which he provoked parliament into opposing, setting the scene for Johnson's victory in the 2019 election.
Johnson won the biggest majority his party has achieved since Margaret Thatcher's 1987 election victory. Inside Downing Street, Cummings treats the prime minister as an equal.
Such is Cummings' importance that Johnson has mobilized the entire machinery of Downing Street to defend him. Senior ministers tweeted their support of Cummings and Johnson extended his ""full confidence.""
Cummings is cast by allies and enemies as a ruthless strategist who cares little for the conventions of traditional British politics. 
Known as ""Dom"" to his friends, who cast him as a visionary, former Prime Minister David Cameron said he was a ""career psychopath."" 
He has openly questioned the competence of Britain's civil servants and scolded Conservative lawmakers for what he perceived as their stupidity and laziness. He once cast then Brexit Secretary David Davis as “thick as mince” and “as lazy as a toad”.
Cummings can be ruthless. He provoked a row inside Westminster last year when he sacked a 27-year-old adviser to then finance minister Sajid Javid. 
The adviser, Sonia Khan, was escorted by armed police from Downing Street without Javid’s knowledge.
THE THINKER 
Cummings, 48, was born in the northern city of Durham.
He studied under eminent Oxford University historian Norman Stone and graduated with a 'first' - the top degree class awarded at British universities. He likes to pepper his eclectic writings with cultural references.
""We need leaders with an understanding of Thucydides and statistical modeling, who have read The Brothers Karamazov and The Quark and the Jaguar, who can feel Kipling’s Kim and succeed in Tetlock’s Good Judgment Project,"" he once wrote.
After leaving university, he went to Russia for three years where he helped set up an airline in Samara. It failed.
Back in the United Kingdom, Cummings entered eurosceptic politics. He was campaign director for ""Business for Sterling"", the campaign against joining the Euro. He then went to work for Michael Gove, now one of the most senior ministers in Johnson's government.

""We need to reshape institutions so that they do not depend on sprinkling a layer of consultants on a broken bureaucracy to gerrymander management processes that ought to be in entry-level training for junior officials,"" Cummings wrote in 2015.

The assurance from Arthur B. Culvahouse Jr comes after remarks by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to suggest that America would ""simply disconnect"" from any country whose telecom services had been compromised by China's involvement.
Pompeo made the comments in an interview with Sky News that discussed the southern Australian state Victoria's investment in China's Belt and Road initiative (BRI).
""The United States has absolute confidence in the Australian government's ability to protect the security of its telecommunications networks and those of its Five Eyes partners,"" Culvahouse said in a statement.
The Five Eyes refers to the intelligence alliance that also includes Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom 
""We have made no secret of our concerns about 5G, and we commend Australia for its leadership on the issue. The Secretary was asked to address a hypothetical, and he carefully noted he was not familiar with the State of Victoria's BRI discussions.""
Victoria has signed a deal thought to be worth more than a billion dollars to work with the China strategy that prioritizes infrastructure investment. 
""Every citizen of Australia should know that every one of those Belt and Road projects needs to be looked at incredibly closely,"" Pompeo told Sky News.
""Some of them may just be straight up commercial transactions ... But nearly each one has some cost to it"", such as conditions placed in debt documents or concessions to the Chinese Communist Party to get projects built, he said.
""To the extent they have an adverse impact on our ability to protect telecommunications from our private citizens or security networks for our defense and intelligence communities, we will simply disconnect. We will simply separate.""
Australia was one of the first countries to raise security concerns around China's 5G telecommunications network. 
Trade tensions have recently worsened between the countries after Australia called for an independent investigation into the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, and China raised duties on Australian barley by 80%. 
U.S.-China ties are also on a weak footing, with Washington accusing Beijing of mishandling the outbreak and adding dozens of Chinese companies to an economic blacklist.

The meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's powerful Central Military Commission marked Kim's first public appearance in three weeks. He made an unusually small number of outings in the past two months amid coronavirus concerns.
North Korea has imposed strict anti-coronavirus measures although it says it has no confirmed cases. This follows intense speculation about Kim's health last month after he missed a key anniversary.
U.S.-led negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes have made little progress since late last year, especially after a global battle on the coronavirus began.
The meeting discussed measures to bolster armed forces and ""reliably contain the persistent big or small military threats from the hostile forces,"" KCNA said.
""Set forth at the meeting were new policies for further increasing the nuclear war deterrence of the country and putting the strategic armed forces on a high alert operation,"" it said. 
""Taken at the meeting were crucial measures for considerably increasing the firepower strike ability of the artillery pieces.""
The Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, expressed hope that the United States and North Korea could resume meaningful dialogue as soon as possible.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - For Indonesia's 225 million Muslims, celebrating Eid al-Fitr this year, the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan, is bittersweet. 
Many are forced to spend it away from their families due to travel restrictions imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19. Hundreds of mosques across Indonesia, however, are still hosting prayers, albeit while asking participants to wear masks and attempt social distancing.
Eid is traditionally a raucous three-day celebration in the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, marked by large family festivities, the exchange of gifts and mass prayers. 
But Indonesia has struggled to stem its coronavirus outbreak, with more than 21,000 cases. On Saturday, its reported death toll had reached 1,351, the highest in East Asia outside China. 
Indonesia’s biggest Islamic group, Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), issued a fatwa this week urging Muslims to pray at home, rather than congregate in mosques. 
Dicky Adam Sideq chose to spend Eid in the capital Jakarta, where cases have been concentrated, rather than risk travelling 150km home to Bandung, in neighbouring West Java province.
""What if I'm an asymptomatic carrier and infect others?"" the 25-year-old photo editor told Reuters, after video calling his family, who he has not seen for the last four months. ""I will wait until the situation is better before going home.""
Sideq and 18 others at his boarding house decided to do morning prayers together and cook the feast they would usual eat with their families.
""The most important thing is the Eid prayer. Thankfully, we can still pray together,"" he said.
Thousands of Indonesians are still congregating at mosques for prayers, despite the risks. 
Novita Sari, 37, told Reuters she went to her mosque in Klaten, in Central Java, after her village chief insisted the community attend prayers because no one had tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Participants were asked to wear masks and bring prayer mats from home. The mosque checked temperatures, and the elderly and young children are not allowed to attend.

""It's okay to be worried about COVID, but we should not be paranoid,"" she said. ""We also need to balance our obligations to this world and to the afterlife.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police fired tear gas and pepper spray to disperse thousands protesting on Sunday against Beijing’s plan to directly impose national security laws on the city, the biggest flare-up in the city since COVID-19 lockdowns began.
Crowds thronged the bustling shopping district of Causeway Bay, where protesters chanted, ""Revolution of our time. Liberate Hong Kong,"" ""Fight for freedom, Stand with Hong Kong,"" and ""Hong Kong independence, the only way out.""
The protest was the first since Beijing proposed national security laws on Thursday and pose a fresh challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping as authorities struggle to tame public opposition to China's tightening grip over the global financial hub.
The demonstrations come amid concerns over the fate of the ""one country, two systems"" formula that has governed Hong Kong since the former UK colony's return to Chinese rule in 1997. The arrangement guarantees the city broad freedoms not seen on the mainland, including a free press and independent judiciary.
Sunday's rally was initially organised against a controversial national anthem bill, due for a second reading in the city's lawmaking body on Wednesday. The proposed national security laws sparked calls for more people to take to the streets.
The city government sought on Sunday to reassure the public and foreign investors over the tough security laws that sent a chill through financial markets and drew a swift rebuke from foreign governments, international human rights groups and some business lobbies.
Police conducted stop-and-search operations in Causeway Bay and warned people not to violate a ban on gatherings of more than eight, imposed to curb the spread of coronavirus.
They fired tear gas and pepper spray to disperse crowds amid chaotic scenes that evoked memories of sometimes violent anti-government protests that roiled the city last year, drawing as many as two million people. Some protesters tried to set up road blocks.
""I am worried that after the implementation of the national security law, they will go after those being charged before and the police will be further out of control,"" said Twinnie, 16, a secondary school student who declined to give her last name. ""I am afraid of being arrested but I still need to come out and protest for the future of Hong Kong.""
China has dismissed other countries' complaints about the proposed legislation as ""meddling,"" saying the proposed laws are necessary and will not harm Hong Kong autonomy or foreign investors.
""These radical claims and illegal violence are extremely worrying,"" Chief Secretary Matthew Cheung said in a blog post, referring to a backlash against the proposed laws as well as anti-government protests that roiled the city for months from June last year. 
""EVIL LAW""
In a bold challenge to the mainland authorities, a small group of democracy activists protested outside Beijing's main representative office in the city, chanting, ""National security law is destroying two systems.""
Avery Ng of the League for Social Democrats pasted protest signs on a plaque outside the Liaison Office, despite warnings from police. He described the proposed legislation as an ""evil law"" and appealed to Hong Kong people to come out and protest against it. 
""It’s a moveable red line. In future they can arrest, lock up and silence anyone they want in the name of national security. We have to resist it,"" Ng told Reuters.
Some local commentators have described the proposal as ""a nuclear option"" that is part of Chinese President Xi's high-stakes power play. 
A backlash intensified on Saturday as nearly 200 political figures from around the world said in a statement the proposed laws said the proposed laws are a ""comprehensive assault on the city's autonomy, rule of law and fundamental freedoms"".
Hong Kong has increasingly become a pawn in deteriorating relations between Washington and Beijing, and observers will be watching for any signs of resignation to defeat among the broader local community or indications that activists are gearing up for a fresh challenge. 

Last year's anti-government protests plunged the city into its biggest political crisis in decades, battered the economy and posed the gravest popular challenge to President Xi since he came to power in 2012.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's prime minister stressed the need to create jobs as a way to minimise government welfare spending, while the country's second-most populous state Victoria set out measures to resume tourism to regions ravaged by bushfires and virus-linked curbs.
""Whether it's how we access markets, how we deliver assistance, whether it's to bushfire affected communities ... the thing that gets Australia back to where we want to be is making jobs,"" Scott Morrison told reporters on Sunday.
These are his first comments since the Treasury Department flagged last week that Australia had vastly over estimated the initial costs of its coronavirus wage subsidy scheme.
Australia on Friday halved the number of people expected to be covered by its subsidy scheme due to reporting errors and after swiftly controlling the outbreak, a revision that will save the government around A$60 billion ($39 billion).
""You just don't go around and borrow A$60 billion on a whim. You carefully consider every dollar you have to borrow.""
Morrison also said it was important to get agriculture and tourism back up to create more jobs and drive the economy.
Earlier, Victoria said it would relax travel curbs to boost tourism in its bushfire-struck towns, a key contributor to the southern state's coffers.
Tourists will be able to stay overnight from June 1 in regional areas in the state, Premier Daniel Andrews said.
Victoria will open up ski fields from June 22, with strict rules around hygiene and without shared facilities after a testing blitz showed low levels of community transmission.
""This is all about opening up again, but doing so because we have got some new test results, and we can be confident about how much virus is out there,"" Andrews said.
VICTORIA TESTING BLITZ
Victoria, which reported one case overnight, has conducted over 420,000 tests since the start 2020, and 174,000 this month, a week ahead of a schedule set by health officials.
The state has reported 1,603 cases, of which 180 are community transmissions. Its testing rate is 6,340 per 100,000 people, which if it were a nation, would be the sixth highest for testing in the world, a state health official said.
In New South Wales, only one case was recorded overnight, a returning traveller, bringing the total to 3,085. As cases have plateaued, the most populous state will let beauty salons reopen from June 1. Australia has reported 7,106 cases and 102 deaths.
In Victoria and New South Wales, where schools are set to reopen next week, playgrounds and skate parks will also be able to reopen from Tuesday, Premier Andrews added.
In Queensland, Australia's third-most populous state, officials announced a $50 million investment into community sports from June 12, after one new case was recorded overnight.
""In Australia, sport isn't just something people watch, it's something they participate in, and they particularly do it at a community level,"" Morrison said.
""It's all about getting life back to as normal as it can be in a COVID-safe world.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian doctor Muhammad Syahidd Al-Hatim was used to being away from his family on Eid al-Fitr, having spent the past two years celebrating the end of the holy Ramadan fasting month at Kuala Lumpur Hospital where he works.
But this year, the 26-year-old said, Eid has become a more sombre affair for the hospital's many Muslim staff, amid a pandemic that has so far seen over 7,000 people in the country infected with the coronavirus, including 115 who have died of COVID-19. 
""It’s sad because some of my friends - the staff nurses, some of the senior doctors - they don’t come from KL itself,"" Muhammad Syahidd told Reuters, referring to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's capital. 
""Usually, they would go back (to their hometowns) to spend time with their families, and they're not getting the chance to do that. So yeah, it brings a sad mood to the working area.""
Muslim-majority Malaysia has imposed widespread restrictions on movement since mid-March in a bid to stem the virus outbreak. 
Although some curbs were eased this month, interstate travel for non-essential reasons is still banned, with many people unable to return to their hometowns during the holiday season. 
Muhammad Syahidd, who works in the emergency ward, was on duty again on Sunday, the first day of Eid, amid concerns that the holiday will lead to a surge in coronavirus infections, as more people risked violating lockdown measures to visit relatives. 
The junior doctor, who lives with his parents, has been tested and quarantined twice after coming into close contact with patients suspected to have been infected with the virus. 
""I’m attending to patients here,"" he said. ""Then I bring back the sickness to my parents - that’s the only thing that I’m scared of.""
The pandemic, however, has brought the hospital staff closer, with non-Muslim workers often covering for Muslim staff breaking fast at sunset during Ramadan, Muhammad Syahidd said. 

""We take care of each other a lot,"" he said.

In a joint statement organized by former Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten and former British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind, 186 law and policy leaders said the proposed laws are a ""comprehensive assault on the city's autonomy, rule of law and fundamental freedoms"" and ""flagrant breach"" of the Sino-British Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Declaration that returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.

Recent advances by forces aligned with the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), including the seizure of a key air base, have thrown a year-long offensive on Tripoli by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) into jeopardy.
They have also drawn a threat by the LNA, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, to carry out a massive air campaign in retaliation. 
On Saturday the GNA forces pressed forward in some outlying districts of Tripoli, where they say they have had to pick their way through mines and other explosive devices laid by the LNA.
The LNA said it had withdrawn from some areas, but had also staged an ambush at Yarmouk military camp in Tripoli and killed or captured rival combatants.
Haftar, in an audio message addressed to his forces, urged them to battle the ""colonial"" intervention by Turkey until its defeat, in a reference to one-time Ottoman control of Libya.
""You are creating glory while fighting the odious coloniser greedy for our wealth,"" he said. ""And you are waging war on all fronts, a war in which there is nothing but victory.""
Haftar's comments were released as U.S. President Donald Trump appealed for a rapid de-escalation of the conflict in Libya in a call with Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan.
Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said separately his country had ""changed the balance"" in Libya and averted a ""full-blown civil war.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A major Argentina creditor group said on Saturday it had been invited to sign a non-disclosure agreement by Argentina's government, signaling that talks could be moving to the next phase after the South American country defaulted a day earlier.
The Exchange Bondholder Group, which comprises 18 investment institutions and represents 15% of Argentina's exchange bonds, said in a statement that Argentina approached its representatives and other creditor groups about signing a non-disclosure agreement ""in contemplation of engaging in negotiations with the Ministry of Economy.""
It is common during debt restructurings for creditor committees to agree to limit the flow of information near the end of talks, as some of it may be material and non-public, a source from another creditor committee said. In some cases when multiple creditor groups are involved, as is the case with Argentina, a non-disclosure agreement is introduced, the source said.
Argentine officials are currently weighing counter-offers from its major creditor groups after their original proposal to restructure about $65 billion in foreign debt was stiffly rejected. 
The South American country failed to reach an agreement by a May 22 deadline, prompting it to miss about $500 million in already delayed bond coupons, marking its ninth sovereign default.
At least one main creditor group has signed the non-disclosure agreement, a source from that committee said. 
A spokesman from the Ministry of Economy did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
Despite missing the deadline on Friday, a source close to the negotiations and familiar with the government's thinking told Reuters on Friday that talks could reach a breakthrough ""in a matter of days."" 
Executives from major credit agencies were optimistic Argentina would eventually strike a deal, but warned that the country's economic woes were far from over. 
""Argentina has a history on this issue and many think that it will not be the last,"" Gabriel Torres, a Moody's (NYSE:MCO) vice president, said of Argentina's default while speaking to local station Radio Milenium, adding that the country will eventually ""have to pay what it has agreed to."" 
Todd Martinez, director of Latin America sovereigns at Fitch Ratings in New York, cautioned that progress could be more challenging the longer the talks drag on. 

""Should it be a default without signs of progress toward a resolution, it could heighten uncertainties and have some destabilizing effects, but these could be minimal if recent progress towards a deal continues,"" Martinez said.

51,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",Rouhani says Iran to retaliate over any U.S. 'trouble' for Venezuela-bound tankers,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned on Saturday of retaliatory measures against the United States if Washington caused problems for tankers carrying Iranian fuel to Venezuela, the semi-official news agency Mehr reported.
""If our tankers in the Caribbean or anywhere in the world face trouble caused by the Americans, they (the U.S.) will also be in trouble,"" Rouhani said in a telephone conversation with Qatar's Emir, Mehr reported. 
A flotilla of five tankers carrying Iranian fuel for gasoline-starved Venezuela is approaching the Caribbean. Venezuelan state television reported on Saturday that the first tanker would reach the country's waters at 7 p.m. local time (11 p.m. GMT).
TankerTrackers.com, a service that tracks oil shipments and storage, estimated that the lead vessel in the flotilla, the Fortune, would arrive in Venezuela's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) between 9 and 11 p.m. local time (1 a.m.-3 a.m. GMT), according to time and speed calculations.
""Iran will never initiate a conflict,"" Rouhani said. ""We hope that the Americans will not commit an error.""
The tankers are carrying around 1.53 million barrels of gasoline and alkylate to Venezuela, according to both governments, sources and calculations made by TankerTrackers.com based on the vessels' draft levels.
The shipments have caused a diplomatic standoff between Iran and Venezuela and the United States as both nations are under U.S. sanctions. Washington is considering measures in response, according to a senior U.S. official, who did not elaborate on any options being weighed.
The United States recently beefed up its naval presence in the Caribbean for what it said was an expanded anti-drug operation. But a Pentagon spokesman, Jonathan Hoffman, said on Thursday he was not aware of any operations related to the Iranian cargoes.
Venezuela's defence minister has said its military will escort the Iranian tankers once they reach the nation's EEZ.

52,By Reuters,"<span>May 23, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Xi makes high-stakes power play in move to subdue Hong Kong,"By David Lague
HONG KONG (Reuters) - For Chinese leader Xi Jinping it is a high-stakes power play. His move to impose tough national security laws on Hong Kong risks reigniting pro-democracy protests that plunged the city into chaos last year, increasing tensions in an already fraught relationship with the United States and undermining Hong Kong's status as a global financial hub.
In the aftermath of the protests, Beijing appears determined to stamp out any renewed rebellion against the Communist Party's authority over the former British colony. China's largely rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, is preparing to circumvent the city's lawmaking body, the Legislative Council, in drafting the new laws. The fear among many in Hong Kong is that China intends to criminalize existing freedoms, including criticism of the central government and its policies. It is the latest and biggest step in a concerted effort by Beijing to assert control over Hong Kong and its 7.4 million people.
In recent weeks there had been widespread speculation here that Beijing was planning this move, described by some local commentators as the ""nuclear option."" Thursday's announcement by China nonetheless stunned pro-democracy lawmakers, business leaders and lawyers in the city. It was, they said, a historic turning point - the end of ""one country, two systems,"" the formula Beijing had promised would allow Hong Kong to retain its way of life and freedom for at least 50 years after the 1997 handover to Chinese rule.
""This represents a real demolition of the one country, two systems idea and also the idea of Hong Kong's autonomy,"" said barrister Wilson Leung, a member of the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Lawyers Group. Leung said extremely harsh sentences had been imposed on dissidents, journalists and lawyers on the mainland under vaguely expressed but draconian laws. ""These same vague concepts are now being introduced to Hong Kong,"" he said.
Many details of the new laws and exactly how they will be absorbed into Hong Kong's existing statutes remain unclear. But Beijing has openly expressed its intentions in recent months. It wants to end the cycle of mass protests that have thwarted successive post-colonial administrations each time they have moved to more closely align the city with China's political and legal system.
The current Beijing-backed leader of Hong Kong, Carrie Lam, was forced to drop proposed laws last year that would have allowed extraditions for trial in mainland Chinese courts after demonstrations convulsed the city. Alarmingly for Beijing, many young protesters began making calls to ""free Hong Kong"" and became increasingly violent as police battled to restore order.
The new laws will be annexed into Hong Kong's mini-constitution, known as the Basic Law, outlawing secession, subversion and terrorism - and providing for the stationing of mainland national security agencies in the city, according to a draft seen by Reuters that spells out what the legislation will cover. That intention is raising fears in Hong Kong that Chinese intelligence agents and police will not only be based in the city, but have formal enforcement power for the first time.
The draft also states that Hong Kong's ""judicial organs"" along with its government and legislature ""must effectively prevent, stop and punish acts endangering national security.""
Senior judges in the city told Reuters last month that the independence of Hong Kong's judicial system is under assault from the Communist Party leadership, posing a grave threat to the rule of law.
The proposal for new legislation is expected to be passed on May 28 by the National People's Congress, though it remains unclear how and when exactly Hong Kong will bring it into effect.
Legal scholars are unsure whether the Basic Law's extensive human rights protections will apply to the new imposed legislation. The Basic Law currently prevents mainland security institutions from routinely taking enforcement action inside the city.
Shiu Sin-por, a former top aide to Lam's predecessor as city leader, told Reuters that the deployment into Hong Kong of the Ministry of State Security – China's leading intelligence agency – could happen ""right away.""
""For Beijing to announce this, they most probably already have something in mind,"" Shiu said. ""This is not difficult to set up, so this can happen anytime.""
'ENOUGH IS ENOUGH'
Chinese officials say the decision to pass the legislation via the National People's Congress is because they know it won't be passed by the Legislative Council in Hong Kong. ""Hong Kong still has not completed legislation on national security since its return to China,"" said a person with direct knowledge of Beijing's thinking. ""After the endless protests, it's time for Beijing to say enough is enough.""
The mainland authorities did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.
Lam said in a statement on Friday that she ""deeply"" believed the new law ""will seek to practically and effectively prevent and curb acts and activities that seriously undermine national security, as well as sanction those who undermine national security by advocating 'Hong Kong independence' and resorting to violence.""
The immediate risk for Beijing is that the move will spark a fresh, more violent round of demonstrations. Protest groups and pro-democracy lawmakers are furious and have vowed to take to the streets to protest what they describe as ""evil laws.""
""Beijing is attempting to silence Hong Kongers' critical voices with force and fear,"" pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong said on Twitter. ""Deep down protesters know, we insist not because we are strong, but because we have no other choice.""
It is a decisive but potentially fraught move for the Chinese leadership at a time when Beijing faces the most intense international and domestic pressure it has experienced in decades.
The Covid-19 pandemic that began late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan is battering the global economy. The death toll now exceeds 330,000 worldwide. China's inability to initially contain the virus - and evidence that it suppressed information about the outbreak - has damaged its international standing. A report presented early last month by the Ministry of State Security to Xi and other Chinese leaders contained a stark warning, Reuters reported: Global anti-China sentiment was at its highest since the 1989 Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) crackdown.
Compounding Beijing's discomfort, Taiwan's government under President Tsai Ing-wen is basking in international acclaim for its success in containing the infection and avoiding serious economic harm. So far, Taiwan has had 441 confirmed cases of coronavirus and just seven deaths. China claims Taiwan as its own territory and has never renounced the use of force to assert that sovereignty.
As the pandemic spreads, Beijing has unleashed what Chinese commentators dub ""wolf-warrior"" diplomats - envoys who are lashing out against perceived slights or criticism with mockery and threats of trade retaliation.
China may be misreading the international mood. After Australia last month called for an independent inquiry into the origins and spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, China's ambassador said Chinese consumers could boycott Australian beef, wine and tourism. Beijing ultimately agreed to back a probe when it became clear at this month's meeting of the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, that there was overwhelming global support for an inquiry.
'READY TO FIGHT TONIGHT'
Military and economic tension with the U.S. is also on the rise. The Trump administration is sending loud signals that it will resist any Chinese move to expand its footprint in the South China Sea (NYSE:SE) or seek territorial gains while the world is distracted with the public health crisis. Earlier this month, the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet took the unusual step of announcing that all its forward deployed attack submarines were at sea on patrol in the Western Pacific. The location of U.S. submarines is normally secret - unless the Pentagon wants to send a warning that it is prepared to counter a threat.
""The Pacific Fleet submarine force remains lethal, agile and ready to fight tonight,"" U.S. Pacific Fleet submarine commander Rear Admiral Blake Converse said in a statement.
In the South China Sea and East China Sea, U.S. warships and long-range bombers have been mounting an ongoing series of patrols and exercises off the Chinese coast.
On Hong Kong, the United States is warning that Washington could retaliate economically if the city's freedoms are threatened. At stake is Hong Kong's special status in its ties with the United States, which provides for a broad range of trade, economic, political, social and law enforcement cooperation. Hong Kong, for example, is treated separately from the mainland by the United States in terms of customs and immigration.
On Thursday, a bipartisan group of U.S. senators introduced a bill to impose sanctions on Chinese officials or entities who violate freedoms China pledged to preserve in Hong Kong. The bill also would place sanctions on any bank that does significant business with those officials and entities.
Chinese officials bristle at U.S. attempts to dictate to Beijing how it should handle Hong Kong, which is a Chinese city. In particular, some point to the State Department saying it would delay the release of a report on whether Hong Kong is autonomous enough to continue receiving special treatment from the world's biggest economy.
""Beijing doesn't bow to threats like this,"" said the person with direct knowledge of Beijing's thinking. ""To Beijing, Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong.""
Damage to Hong Kong's role as a financial center could compound the challenge facing Beijing in rejuvenating the Chinese economy. Business activity had been slowing even before the pandemic; Covid-19 has hammered it. Official figures recorded a 6.8% contraction in economic output in the first quarter. One measure of the country's woes: The authorities announced this week that because of the uncertainty created by the pandemic, they won't be setting an annual growth target, a stark turnaround for a country whose statistics have shown unbroken expansion for decades in virtual lockstep with government forecasts.
Hong Kong is a vital cog in China's economy. While China still has extensive capital controls and often intervenes in its financial markets and banking system, Hong Kong is one of the most open economies in the world and one of the biggest markets for equity and debt financing. China uses Hong Kong's currency, equity and debt markets to attract foreign funds, while international companies use Hong Kong as a launchpad to expand into mainland China. The bulk of foreign direct investment in China continues to be channeled through the city. And many of China's biggest firms have listed in Hong Kong, often as a springboard to global expansion.
The American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong said in a statement that the move by China ""may jeopardize future prospects for international business,"" including the ability to ""recruit and retain top tier talent"" in the city. ""No one wins if the foundation for Hong Kong's role as a prime international business and financial center is eroded,"" said Robert Grieves, chairman of the business group.
MORE DIRECT ROLE
The core of the problem for Xi and other top leaders is that the Communist Party and the authoritarian political system it enforces on the mainland remain deeply unpopular in free-wheeling Hong Kong. With the 23rd anniversary of the handover approaching, top Chinese leaders are rarely seen in the city. When they do appear, usually at carefully staged events, they are enveloped by security cordons designed to ensure they never face the kind of rowdy protests or public criticism that Hong Kong leaders routinely endure.
In some respects, the mainland leadership appears to be more remote from the city's people than top British officials in the final years of colonial rule. Hong Kong's last colonial governor, Chris Patten, remains a popular figure here and a regular commentator on local political affairs.
""I think there has been a significant change in China, in Beijing, since Xi Jinping became president or dictator for life, complete with a personality cult which is extraordinary,"" Patten told members of the city's Foreign Correspondents' Club in an online presentation earlier this week. ""I think the sad point is that Xi Jinping and his court have regarded Hong Kong and Hong Kong's freedoms as an existential problem for them because Hong Kong represents so much of what they don't like.""
Mainland authorities and their proxies have worked tirelessly to win support from local people since the handover, but these efforts appear to be ineffective. Pro-democracy groups scored a dramatic victory at local elections held after the climax of last year's protests, in what was widely seen as a referendum on the performance of the Lam administration. A poll conducted for Reuters in March found that support for the demands of pro-democracy protesters had grown even though the demonstrations had paused as a result of the pandemic.
Veteran political activists in the city anticipate that pro-democracy candidates will repeat their success in a Legislative Council poll scheduled for September.
Resistance in the Legislative Council and mass protests killed off Beijing's first attempt in 2003 to introduce national security legislation. Last year's proposed extradition laws met a similar fate. Imposing such laws via the National People's Congress means Beijing won't have to risk another such setback at the hands of elected lawmakers and their supporters on the streets.
""Hong Kong has a high degree of autonomy, but Hong Kong definitely is not independent from China,"" Leung Chun-ying, a former leader of the city and now an adviser to China's government, told Reuters. ""Hong Kong is part of China, and therefore, Hong Kong has an obligation to protect the national security of China.""
Even as the pandemic and social distancing regulations restricted protests in Hong Kong in the early months of this year, there were signs Beijing was preparing to play a much more direct role in running the city. Key moves included the appointment of two top officials, both with reputations for toughness and both with close ties to President Xi, to oversee Hong Kong.
Luo Huining, who Xi had earlier deployed as party secretary to take down a corruption network in Shanxi province, was appointed to run Beijing's Liaison Office in Hong Kong. Another former provincial party secretary, Xia Baolong, took over the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office in Beijing, the top government body responsible for handling the city. Xia was Xi's deputy when the Chinese leader was Party Secretary in Zhejiang province between 2002 and 2007.
After the two leaders took up their new posts, the Liaison Office sparked a controversy when it said in a statement last month that it had the power, along with the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, to ""handle Hong Kong affairs."" Pro-democracy supporters in the city condemned the move as a clear threat to Hong Kong's autonomy.
The Liaison Office and Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office did not immediately respond to questions.
In a speech on April 15, Luo also signaled that new national security laws were in the pipeline. ""For the nearly 23 years since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the system for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong has had shortcomings and could be fatal at critical moments,"" Luo said. New laws were needed ""without delay,"" he added.
On Thursday, five weeks after Luo spoke, Beijing made its dramatic announcement: Chinese-style national security is coming to China's freest city.

""The COVID-19 pandemic today reached a milestone in Africa, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases. The virus has now spread to every country in the continent since the first case was confirmed in the region 14 weeks ago,"" the WHO said in a statement, noting there were 3,100 confirmed deaths on the vast continent.
Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa, who is from Botswana, said: “For now COVID-19 has made a soft landfall in Africa, and the continent has been spared the high numbers of deaths which have devastated other regions of the world."" 
Even so, she said, ""We must not be lulled into complacency as our health systems are fragile and are less able to cope with a sudden increase in cases.” 
About half of African countries are experiencing community transmission of the virus, the WHO said.
The situation in South America appeared graver. Dr. Mike Ryan, WHO's top emergencies expert, speaking earlier to a news conference, said: ""In a sense South America has become a new epicenter for the disease."" 
Brazil is the ""most affected,"" and authorities there have approved broad use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19, he said. He reiterated that clinical evidence does not support the drug's widespread use against the disease, given its risks.
Nine African countries had 50% rises in cases in the past week, while others have seen a decline or have stable rates, Ryan said. 
The low mortality rate may be because half the continent's population is 18 or younger, he said, while saying he remains worried the disease will spread on a continent with ""significant gaps"" in intensive care services, medical oxygen and ventilation.

LISBON (Reuters) - Surfboards, beach buckets and picnic baskets in tow, Portuguese flocked to the ocean in droves on Saturday for their first state-sanctioned beach weekend of the year.
""It's so great to see the sea and get some sun after two months,"" said Catarina, who arrived to Carcavelos Beach, half an hour from Lisbon, at 9 a.m. with her husband and daughter.
But despite her relief, Catarina wasn't sure this newfound freedom could last long.
""Most are behaving ... but there are a lot of groups, and that's what causes contagion, isn't it? I don't know, by next month I think we'll all be back in our homes,"" she said.
The nation of 10 million people has reported just 30,471 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 1,302 deaths, a small fraction of neighboring Spain's 28,628 fatalities.
Restrictions imposed during a six-week state of emergency starting March 18 are being lifted in 15-day intervals, as long as the number of cases keeps falling.
As temperatures rose, people were itching to get back into the water. ""Yesterday was already busy,"" Jose Primo, a waiter at a beach restaurant in Carcavelos, said. ""But today, my God! It's chaos.""
Some confusion was caused after Prime Minister Antonio Costa announced on May 15 beaches would open on June 6, but a government decree published two days later stated people could go to the beach from the beginning of this week. 
A smartphone app due to be in operation from June 6 is supposed to help avoid crowding by warning which bathing spots are full. In the meantime people are anticipating crowds.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - U.S. presidential adviser Ivanka Trump's praise of an Indian teenager's bicycle ride home hundreds of kilometres away is drawing criticism in India for being insensitive to the plight of impoverished migrant workers struggling in a lockdown. 
The girl carried her father on the back of her bicycle for about a week for 1,200 km (750 miles), the two said on Saturday, one of the many out-of-work migrant families leaving the big cities for their homes in other parts of India because the shutdown has sapped their savings.
""15 yr old Jyoti Kumari, carried her wounded father to their home village on the back of her bicycle covering +1,200 km over 7 days. This beautiful feat of endurance & love has captured the imagination of the Indian people and the cycling federation!"" Ivanka, daughter of U.S. President Donald Trump, tweeted on Friday night.
India's cycling federation, impressed with her endurance, has invited her for trials and said it could groom her into a cyclist, local media reported. 
But opposition political figures, as well as some commentators, in the country of 1.3 billion said Jyoti's desperate journey home because of a crippling transport shutdown was hardly something to celebrate.
""Her poverty & desperation are being glorified as if Jyoti cycled 1,200 KM for the thrill of it. Government failed her, that's hardly something to trumpet as an achievement,"" Omar Abdullah, a former chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir, tweeted on Saturday in response to Ivanka's message.
Health experts say India's vast lockdown has helped limit the spread of COVID-19, but it has pushed millions who live on daily wages to the brink of poverty. After weeks of mounting criticism and tales of hardship, the government is now running trains and buses to help the migrants get home.
""This is not a feat of excellence. It’s a feat fuelled by desperation caused due to the callous attitude of the government,"" said Kanti Chidambaram, an opposition member of parliament, about the teenager's hard journey home. 
Jyoti's father, a rickshaw driver in north India, said he could not cycle because of an accident he had suffered months ago. With food and cash running out, his daughter decided she would ride him to their village in the eastern state of Bihar.
""Initially I had doubts because she is just 15, but I was wrong,"" Mohan Paswan told Reuters by phone. ""She asked me to sit on the bicycle and not pay heed to what people would say.""
They survived on biscuits and food that people gave them during the stops in the blistering Indian summer. Jyoti said she was happy she had brought her father home safely.

She declined to be drawn into controversy about Ivanka's post, saying, ""I am very happy with the appreciation I am getting from all the corners.""

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - The flight data recorder from the Pakistani airliner that crashed into a residential neighbourhood of Karachi has been found, an official said on Saturday, as the death toll rose to 97.
There were two survivors from onboard the aircraft, while no fatalities were reported in the densely populated area of the city where the aircraft crash-landed on Friday.
Pakistan International Airlines flight PK 8303, an Airbus A320, was flying from Lahore to Karachi with 99 people on board when it went down in mid-afternoon while trying a second landing attempt. [nL4N2D4374]
""The black box had been found late yesterday, we are handing it over to the inquiry board,"" PIA spokesman Abdullah Khan said. He said that included both the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder.
The airline's chief executive, Arshad Malik, said on Friday the last message received from the pilot indicated there was a technical problem.
Another senior civil aviation official told Reuters it appeared the plane had been unable to lower its landing gear for the first approach.
Aviation safety experts say air crashes typically have multiple causes.
Seconds before the crash, the pilot told air traffic controllers he had lost power from both engines, according to a recording posted on liveatc.net, a respected aviation monitoring website.
Airbus said the jet first flew in 2004 and was fitted with engines built by CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).
Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan, announced soon after the crash that there would be an inquiry, and a four-member team was constituted Friday night, according to a notification from the government's aviation division, seen by Reuters.
The team includes three members of the Aircraft Accident and Investigation Board and one from the Pakistan Air Force's safety board. The team will issue a preliminary statement within a month, the notification says.
A statement from the provincial health minister's office on Saturday put the death toll at 97, with no confirmed deaths on the ground.
Army and civil administration personnel were clearing through the debris in the Karachi neighbourhood on Saturday and assisting residents whose homes had been damaged. 
""Rescue Op in progress ... 25 affected houses cleared, their residents accommodated at various places with assistance of Civil Administration,"" the Army said on Twitter.
Pakistan only last week resumed domestic flights it had suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with many people travelling for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, expected to fall on Sunday or Monday in the country.

Friday's crash is the worst air disaster in Pakistan since 2012, when a Bhoja Air passenger aircraft, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737, crashed in Islamabad, killing 127 people.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson resisted calls on Saturday from opposition parties to sack adviser Dominic Cummings after he traveled 400 km (250 miles) while his wife showed COVID-19 symptoms so that their son could be looked after by his family.
Cummings, who masterminded the 2016 campaign to leave the European Union during the Brexit referendum, traveled to Durham in northern England in late March, when a strict lockdown was already in place.
Johnson's office said his adviser made the journey to ensure his young son could be properly cared for, as his wife was ill with COVID-19 and there was a ""high likelihood"" that Cummings would himself become unwell.
""His sister and nieces had volunteered to help so he went to a house near to but separate from his extended family in case their help was needed,"" a Downing Street spokesman said.
""His actions were in line with coronavirus guidelines,"" the spokesman said. ""Mr Cummings believes he behaved reasonably and legally.""
One of Johnson's most senior ministers, Michael Gove, said of the situation: ""Caring for your wife and child is not a crime.""
But opposition parties called for Johnson to sack Cummings and said the lockdown rules made clear that those with suspected COVID-19 symptoms should isolate with their whole household.
""The prime minister’s chief adviser appears to believe that it is one rule for him and another for the British people,"" the Labour Party said. ""We are still unclear who knew about this decision and when, whether this was sanctioned by the prime minister.""
Just a few days before Cummings' journey, Johnson imposed a lockdown in the United Kingdom and asked people to stay at home. He said on March 23 that people ""should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home.""
Shortly after Johnson announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19, Cummings sprinted out of Downing Street on March 27 and developed symptoms on the weekend of March 28-29. 
Government guidelines say that those who have COVID-19 or suspect they have it should self isolate for at least seven days along with their household and not leave their house for any reason.
The Scottish National Party and the Liberal Democrats calls for Cummings to be sacked. 
Other prominent figures have resigned after having broken lockdown rules.

Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson quit as a member of the government's scientific advisory group after was visited at home by his girlfriend. Scotland’s chief medical officer, Catherine Calderwood, stepped down after she was caught making two trips to her second home.

(Reuters) - Americans are back on the road after more than two months of coronavirus lockdowns that kept them homebound, with beach-area traffic tripling since the low point in mid-April, reports released on Friday showed.
As the country heads into the long Memorial Day holiday weekend that traditionally kicks off the summer vacation season, traffic in some areas is even expected to surpass pre-pandemic levels.
Passenger car travel in U.S. beach counties has more than doubled since Easter, according to data by transportation analytics company StreetLight Data. At Maryland's Ocean City beach resort, car activity was four times higher, compared to only a 5% increase during the same period in 2019.
""That's an indication that part of the reason why people are on the move is to go somewhere nice and summery,"" StreetLight Data Chief Executive Laura Schewel said.
While U.S. traffic is still down some 50%, road use has more than tripled since its low point during Easter, when more than 90% of the U.S. population was under some form of lockdown order, StreetLight Data showed.
Traffic in major cities along the U.S. West Coast and North East, including in Seattle, Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and Washington, remains down significantly, data by INRIX Inc, another transportation data provider, showed. 
Road use in some less populated areas has even surpassed February levels, INRIX said, and non-coastal cities like Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit and Houston have seen large increases in activity since early May.
Both StreetLight and INRIX use anonymized, aggregated data from mobile apps and in-car systems to establish vehicle miles traveled. They calculate percentage changes based on road use in January and February of 2020, respectively, winter months with generally lower activity. 
Driving typically increases about 15% in the spring, meaning that average national road traffic is likely even lower compared to pre-crisis levels on a seasonally adjusted basis.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's foreign ministry branch in Hong Kong hit back on Saturday at ""meddling"" countries and said proposed national security laws would not harm the interests of foreign investors in the city.
The security legislation, which could see Chinese intelligence agencies set up bases in Hong Kong, has sent chills through the business and diplomatic communities.
U.S. government officials have said the legislation would end the Chinese-ruled city's autonomy and would be bad for both Hong Kong's and China's economies. They said it could jeopardise the territory's special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a global financial centre.
Britain has said it is deeply concerned by the proposed security laws which it said would undermine the ""one country, two systems"" principle agreed when Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Bankers and headhunters said it could lead to money and talent leaving the city. Hong Kong stocks slumped 5.6% on Friday.
A spokesperson of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in Hong Kong said in a statement the city's high degree of autonomy ""will remain unchanged, and the interests of foreign investors in the city will continue to be protected under the law.""
Beijing's move comes after pro-democracy protests in 2019 plunged Hong Kong into its biggest political crisis since the handover. Communist authorities see the protests as a security threat and blame the West for fomenting unrest.
The commissioner's office described statements by ""meddling countries"" as ""double standard and gangster logic.""
""No matter how venomously you smear, provoke, coerce or blackmail us, the Chinese people will remain rock-firm in safeguarding national sovereignty and security,"" it said.
""Doomed is your plot to undermine China's sovereignty and security by exploiting the troublemakers in Hong Kong as pawns and the city as a frontier for secession, subversion, infiltration and sabotage activities against China.""
Chris Patten, the last governor of the former British colony, said China has betrayed the people of Hong Kong and the West should stop kowtowing to Beijing for an illusory great pot of gold.
BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
Over the past 24 hours, Hong Kong's pro-Beijing politicians have also responded to concerns that the national security legislation could take the shine off China's freest and most international city.
Upon her return from Beijing late on Friday, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the stock market ""goes up and comes down"" and it was in fact the protests which had destabilised the business environment.
Henry Tang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, said the legislation was ""beneficial"" for business as it brings stability and strengthens the rule of law.
Former Hong Kong chief executive Leung Chun-Ying pointed to large U.S. investments in mainland China despite national security laws there.
""Can businessmen tell Hong Kong people, why are there more U.S. companies, U.S. businessmen and U.S. investments in mainland China than Hong Kong?"" he wrote in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
Hong Kong publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, an outspoken critic of Beijing who faces charges of illegal assembly, said on Twitter the legislation would bring the end of ""China's last miracle"" and the communist party was slaughtering ""the proverbial golden goose.""

Dozens of protesters gathered in a downtown shopping mall, on Saturday holding banners with slogans against national security legislation. As activists called for protests on Sunday in central Hong Kong, police said in a statement it ""will deploy adequate manpower in relevant locations.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican Museums will reopen on June 1, the Vatican said on Saturday, ending a closure caused by the coronavirus lockdown that has drained the Holy See's coffers.
A statement said the Museums, which house some of the world's greatest Renaissance masterpieces as well as ancient Roman and Egyptian artefacts, can be visited from the beginning of June, though only by making on-line reservations in order to control the number of people.
Visitors will have their temperatures checked and will have to wear masks and use hand sanitizer. Staff will wear masks and gloves and health workers will be on hand.
Similar conditions will apply to visitors to the papal summer residence at Castel Gandolfo south of Rome.
Italian museums began reopening on May 18 as part of a staged easing of lockdown measures in the country where nearly 33,000 people have died from the virus.
The pandemic has drastically slowed the flow of funds to the Vatican's coffers. The Museums received some 7 million visitors last year and are the Holy See's most reliable source of income, previously generating an estimated $100 million yearly.
Even after the reopening, officials fear that enhanced security measures, social distancing requirements, new health regulations and an expected dearth of international tourists will erode ticket and souvenir sales.

Malaysia has this month arrested more than 2,000 foreigners for not having permits that allow them to be in the country following raids in areas under lockdown. The centers they are detained in are often crowded, with dozens of migrants packed in a single cell. 
The United Nations and rights groups have called on Malaysia to stop the crackdown and criticized authorities for going after a vulnerable community during the pandemic. 
The Southeast Asian country has so far reported 7,185 virus infections and 115 deaths.
The health ministry said on Saturday that 21 cases were identified at the Semenyih detention center near the capital Kuala Lumpur, which houses around 1,600 detainees. 
It is the second detention center at which a cluster of virus infections has broken out. Around 60 cases were reported among the 1,400 detainees at the Bukit Jalil center earlier this week. 
The ministry's Director-General, Noor Hisham Abdullah, said the source of infections at the centers had not been identified. 
The migrants were screened before their arrests, but the virus may not have been detected during the incubation period, he said. 
Detainees can spend months in the centers before they are deported. 
In recent weeks, there has been public anger towards refugees and other foreigners, who have been accused of spreading disease, burdening the state and taking jobs as the economy plummets. Rohingya refugees in particular have been targets of harassment and threats.

KOLKATA/DHAKA (Reuters) - A powerful cyclone that tore through India's eastern state of West Bengal this week has caused a damage of 1 trillion rupees ($13 billion) to infrastructure and crops, state officials said.
Neighbouring Bangladesh, which also fell in Cyclone Amphan's path on Wednesday, initially said it had suffered a loss of 11 billion taka ($130 million). But this could rise, government officials said.
The two countries have lost at least 102 people in the cyclone, the most powerful in over a decade, mostly because of house collapses and electrocution. More than 3 million people were evacuated before Amphan made landfall, preventing a large number of deaths.
The cyclone has affected more than 13 million people - some losing houses, crops and lands - and over 1.5 million houses have been damaged, two West Bengal government officials told Reuters. 
In North 24 Parganas, a district in southern West Bengal, 700 villages were flooded and 80,000 people lost their homes, the Times of India newspaper reported.
Hundreds of thousands are in relief camps across the state, the officials said, amid concern that lax social distancing norms could fuel a spread of coronavirus cases.
In Kolkata, the state capital, authorities struggled to remove debris from roads and clear trees that fell as the cyclone, packing winds of 133 km (83 miles) per hour, pounded the city of 14 million for hours.
The cyclone also destroyed farmland in Bangladesh's low-lying coastal areas, damage that will likely endanger livelihoods, non-profit ActionAid said.
""Communities need urgent support as they are without basic necessities such as food, clean water and materials to rebuild their homes,"" Farah Kabir, the country director of ActionAid Bangladesh said.

Communist Party rulers in Beijing on Friday unveiled details of the legislation that critics see as a turning point for the former British colony, which enjoys many freedoms, including an independent legal system and right to protest, not allowed on the mainland.
""I was very upset when I held the newspaper with the headline that the national security law has arrived in Hong Kong,"" said Man, who declined to give her full name due to the sensitivity of the issue.
""I feel upset for the young generation ... What can they do now, where can they go?"" said Man, who has been selling newspapers in the bustling working class district of Mong Kok for nearly five decades. 
Lok, 42, a clerk at an investment company and mother of two children aged 16 and nine, shared her sense of despair about the outlook for Hong Kong's younger generation.
""There's no prospect for them anymore,"" said Lok, adding she hopes her children can leave the city. 
""I think Hong Kong is half-way dead. I didn’t expect Hong Kong would deteriorate that quickly."" 
Lui, 22, who works in marketing, told Reuters he felt scared when he heard the news but said Hong Kong people need to be persistent and continue to fight against what many see as Beijing's tightening grip over the city. 
""Whether or not Hong Kong is still Hong Kong, it depends on us, Hong Kong people,"" Lui said. 
""We should not give up easily simply because of the legislation of the national security law. Being persistent is the Hong Kong spirit.""
Others hope the proposed laws can help bring calm to a city wracked by months of often violent anti-government protests that show signs of ramping up again as anger builds over Beijing's move to assert its authority over the city.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says her government will ""fully cooperate"" with the Chinese parliament to safeguard national security, which she said would not affect rights, freedoms or judicial independence.
""We are not wealthy people and not financially sound. To earn a living is of the utmost importance so as to feed my family,"" said Ben Ip, 45, a mechanic and owner of a vehicle paint shop in the city's Tai Hang district.

Museums and historical sites are to reopen on Sunday to coincide with the Eid el-Fitr celebrations that end the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan, President Hassan Rouhani said on state television.
Holy shrines — some of which became focal points of the coronavirus epidemic in Iran - will reopen Monday.
Rouhani had said last week that the shrines would open for three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon. Some areas of the shrines such as narrow corridors will stay shut.
All workers in the country will return to work next Saturday.
""We can say we have passed the three stages regarding the coronavirus,"" Rouhani said.
The fourth phase is containment in 10 of Iran's 31 provinces, where the situation is better and screening will intensify while infected patients will be separated from the rest of the population.
The president said last week that restaurants would reopen after Ramadan and sports activities would resume without spectators. Universities, but not medical schools, will reopen on June 6.
Rouhani said on Saturday that 88 percent of the fatalities from COVID-19 in Iran were victims with underlying illnesses.

According to health ministry figures, more than than 7,000 have so far died from the pandemic in Iran and more than 130,000 have been infected.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state said on Saturday it recorded just three new cases of the coronavirus the previous day and urged younger people to get tested as it prepares to further loosen restrictions on pubs and restaurants.
New South Wales (NSW), which includes the city of Sydney, is home to nearly half Australia's roughly 7,100 coronavirus cases and plans to let pubs and restaurants host up to 50 seated patrons from June 1, from 10 now.
That has prompted health officials to remind people to maintain social distancing measures and increase testing to prevent a ""second wave"" of infections.
""As we move forward and as we try to relax the restrictions that we have lived under for the past two months, it is ... absolutely crucial that people come forward for testing if they have the slightest hint of any respiratory issues,"" NSW health minister Brad Hazzard said in a televised news conference.
""As we are freeing up our restrictions, particularly around clubs and hotels and so on, we need (to send) a very powerful message ... that these young people who may think they are invincible are actually not invincible,"" he added.
NSW has recorded a total of 3,086 coronavirus cases and has recorded nearly half the country's total deaths which rose by one to 102 on Saturday. No. 2 state Victoria, where the latest death occurred, reported nine new infections in the previous day. The third-most populous state, Queensland, reported two new cases.
Australia's low number of COVID-19 infections and deaths, relative to many other countries, has been attributed mostly to a closure of national and state borders and a nationwide stay-home order now being unwound by states under a three-step federal plan.
Opposition lawmakers meanwhile criticised the federal government after it revealed on Friday an administrative error had vastly overstated its forecast expenditure for a wage subsidy scheme for workers left unemployed by the shutdown. 
The Treasury Department said successful efforts to control the outbreak combined with errors on programme applications by about a 1,000 businesses meant only 3.5 million workers would need to be covered, at a cost of A$70 billion ($46 billion), not 6 million people at a cost of A$130 billion.
The Federal government has framed the error as a surprise benefit to the economy since it would likely reduce the forecast Budget deficit, while the opposition has called for the government to redirect the money to workers left out of the emergency welfare program.
""We need a calculation of what the figures are from this government on casuals, on the arts and entertainment sector, on other groups who have missed out, and some real figures on what the costings would be,"" said Labor Party opposition leader Anthony Albanese.

RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said he was unwilling to see his family get ""screwed"" because of his inability to change law enforcement officials, according to a video released on Friday set to deepen the political crisis surrounding the president.
In the recording of an April 22 ministerial meeting, which forms part of a criminal investigation and was released by a Supreme Court justice on Friday, Bolsonaro said it was his prerogative to change security officials, their bosses or even a minister. 
""I've tried to change our security people in Rio de Janeiro officially, and I wasn't able to. That's over. I won't wait for my family or my friends to get screwed,"" Bolsonaro said. 
""If you can't change (the official), change his boss. You can't change the boss? Change the minister. End of story. We're not kidding around,"" he added. 
Writing on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) after the release of the video, Bolsonaro said there was ""no indication of interference in the federal police.""
In a radio interview with Jovem Pan, he said he had been talking about his own personal security and not senior members of the federal police. 
The public airing of the video comes at a bad time for Bolsonaro. His political woes have led to rumblings about impeachment. 
Bolsonaro has been criticized for his handling of Brazil's worsening coronavirus outbreak. Brazil now has the second highest number of infections, behind the United States. 
Supreme Court Justice Celso de Mello ordered the partial release of the video. It is one component of a criminal investigation over allegations by former Justice Minister Sergio Moro that Bolsonaro leaned on him to change senior members of the federal police in Rio. Moro quit last month.
Before becoming president, Bolsonaro represented Rio state as a federal lawmaker for nearly 30 years. His son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, also got his start there, and is under investigation over allegations of corruption.
Kim Kataguiri, a member of congress and one-time Bolsonaro ally, said on Twitter the video ""proves"" Bolsonaro had interfered in the federal police to protect his children. 
Brazilian political parties are also investigating the president's conduct. In one of those probes, the parties have asked for the seizure of Bolsonaro's cell phone. 

The national security adviser, former General Augusto Heleno, said in a statement he was outraged by the ""inconceivable"" request for the president's phone. It could ""have unpredictable consequences for the stability of the country,"" he said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin and her husband on Friday pleaded guilty to participating in a vast U.S. college admissions fraud scheme to secure spots for their daughters at the University of Southern California.
Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, appeared before a federal judge in Boston through a Zoom videoconference to plead guilty under agreements calling for them to serve two months and five months in prison, respectively.
They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. But U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton said he would weigh whether to accept their plea deals, which restrict his ability to impose different sentences.
Loughlin and Giannulli have also agreed to be sentenced to respective fines of $150,000 and $250,000 and 100 and 250 hours of community service.
Gorton scheduled their sentencings for Aug. 21, though defense attorney William Trach requested an earlier date so the Los Angeles couple could have ""finality.""
They are among 54 people charged over a scheme where wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and fraud to secure their children's admission to top schools.
Consultant William ""Rick"" Singer has pleaded guilty to facilitating cheating on college entrance exams and using bribery to secure the admission of parents' children to schools as fake athletic recruits.
The parents include actress Felicity Huffman, who received a 14-day prison sentence. 
Also on Friday, Peter Dameris, staffing company ASGN (NYSE:ASGN) Inc's former chief, agreed to plead guilty. ""He is deeply apologetic,"" said his lawyer, Richard Crane.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - For many New Yorkers, one of the only good things to come out of the coronavirus pandemic is a temporary relaxation of some state regulations, allowing people to buy to-go wine and cocktails or get them delivered.
With bars and restaurants closed for table service to control the spread of the virus in much of the United States, the change has been such a hit that one New York state senator wants to extend it for at least two years beyond the lifting of the lockdown. 
Senator Brad Hoylman, a Democrat who represents parts of lower and midtown Manhattan, introduced the legislation this week as a way to support the struggling hospitality industry.
“It would really extend a very important lifeline to these restaurants and bars that were on the margin even before the pandemic,” Hoylman told Reuters on Friday. 
In March, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo temporarily loosened State Liquor Authority regulations for businesses licensed to sell alcohol, allowing them to sell beverages to go as long they are in sealed containers and accompanied by food. 
Unlike many countries in Europe and the rest of the world, most U.S. states have so-called ""open-container"" laws that restrict the public consumption of alcohol. 
Last weekend, hundreds of New Yorkers with drinks in hand were seen gathered outside bars in Manhattan and elsewhere. The impromptu parties led Mayor Bill de Blasio to threaten a crackdown if social-distancing rules are not observed.
Outside Pilar Cuban Eatery in Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, a few customers have been lining up 6 feet apart on recent evenings to order to-go spicy margaritas, sangria or mojitos. 
""I think the alcohol right now is saving us,"" owner Ricardo Barreras told Reuters on Friday.
Barreras, 49, said he welcomed Hoylman's proposed legislation, given the uncertainty facing his business as New York City moves closer to a partial reopening in June.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain will introduce a COVID-19 quarantine for travellers arriving from abroad from June 8, interior minister Priti Patel said on Friday, a measure that airlines have warned will devastate their industry.
All international arrivals, including returning Britons, will have to self-isolate for 14 days and provide details of where they will be staying under the plans, which were criticised by airlines, business groups and politicians alike.
""Now we are past the peak of this virus, we must take steps to guard against imported cases triggering a resurgence of this deadly disease,"" Patel said at a news conference.
Those who breach the quarantine in England could be fined 1,000 pounds ($1,218), and spot checks would be carried out by health and border officials. 
The quarantine will not apply to those arriving from the Irish Republic, or to freight drivers, medical professionals and seasonal agricultural workers. The measures will be reviewed every three weeks. [nL8N2D44UM]
Transport minister Grant Shapps has suggested the government would seek to negotiate ""air bridges"" for travellers coming from countries with low virus infection rates.
In France, Britain's closest neighbour on the continent of Europe, the government said it regretted Britain's decision. It stood ready to impose reciprocal measures, AFP news agency cited the French interior ministry as saying.
Unlike many other countries, Britain has carried out few tests and checks on visitors, with quarantine limited only to arrivals from China at the start of the outbreak.
Spain and Italy have introduced rules that mean international arrivals must self-isolate for two weeks, while on Friday Ireland gave further details for its own quarantine proposals.
AIRLINES DISMAYED
The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) said the blanket quarantine was deeply concerning and could be avoided with strong safety measures.
""This approach will damage international business and investor confidence at a time when it is vital to demonstrate that the UK can open for business safely,"" BCC Director General Adam Marshall said.
The opposition Labour Party supported the measures but said the government's handling of UK arrivals had ""lacked urgency, coherence and clarity from the outset"". Some members of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative party have also criticised the plan.
Chief among industry critics are airline bosses, who have said the measures would have severe repercussions. Michael O'Leary, Ryanair's chief executive, said they would be ""unenforceable and unpoliceable."" 
Ryanair and easyJet (LON:EZJ) have outlined plans to restart some flights in coming months. But under the quarantine plan, Virgin Atlantic will not restart until August at the earliest.

""Introducing a quarantine at this stage makes no sense and will mean very limited international aviation at best,"" said Tim Alderslade, chief executive of industry body Airlines UK. ""It is just about the worst thing government could do if their aim is to restart the economy.""

The Andean nation, which began the lockdown in mid-March, will have lived under it for more than 3-1/2 months by a June 30 expiration, outlasting restrictions in Italy, Spain and China, some of the hardest hit countries in the pandemic.

Vizcarra said the latest and fifth extension, which is more than a month beyond the previous expiration date of May 24, would come with the reopening of certain economic activities, including household appliance sales, hair salons and dental services. 
Restrictions on some sports will also be relaxed, including professional soccer, though games will take place in stadiums without an audience.

""We must move to a new coexistence, which allows us as a society to be more caring, more responsible, disciplined, respectful of the minimum standards of behavior so as not to harm the people we love the most,"" Vizcarra said.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Georgia police expect no more arrests in the shooting death of a black jogger after taking a third suspect into custody in the racially charged case, which attracted national attention when a video of the incident went viral, authorities said on Friday.
Late Thursday, William ""Roddie"" Bryan, 50, of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia, became the third white man charged with the Feb. 23 murder of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old black man. 
""We feel confident that the individuals who needed to be charged have been charged,"" said Vic Reynolds, director of the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, at a press conference Friday in Atlanta.
A cell phone video of Arbery's death in the small, coastal community of Brunswick shows him jogging down a two-lane street, then being shot to death by two armed men who had stopped their pickup truck in his path.
Bryan, who had come forward publicly to say he shot the video, was charged with felony murder and attempt to commit false imprisonment.
A father-and-son pair, Gregory McMichael, 64, and Travis McMichael, 34, were arrested May 7, and each were charged with felony murder and aggravated assault.
A police report says that the McMichaels spotted Arbery running down the street, grabbed a shotgun and a pistol and gave chase in their pickup, seeking to make a citizen's arrest. They had suspected Arbery in a burglary.
At some point, Bryan comes on the scene in his own vehicle, police said. An arrest warrant says Bryan attempted to block Arbery from running away multiple times.
His Brunswick attorney, Kevin Gough, declined immediate comment to Reuters, but he has told multiple media outlets that Bryan was just an unarmed bystander.

The three are all being held in the Glynn County Detention Center without bond.

""We absolutely reject this attempt to allow access of missionaries to indigenous territories here there are isolated tribes,"" the largest umbrella organization representing Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) indigenous tribes, COIAB, said in a statement.
COIAB said the presence of evangelizing missionaries has historically brought ""tragedy and death"" to indigenous people in the Amazon, and was a particular threat to isolated tribes that have only entered recent contact with Brazilian society.
The bill, which still needs Senate approval, was passed by the chamber on the same day that a federal judge blocked the appointment of a former missionary to head the isolated tribes department at the government's indigenous affairs agency Funai.
The judge said the appointment of Ricardo Dias was unlawful because it countered Brazil's policy of not forcing uncontacted indigenous people to enter contact with society.
Funai said it would comply with the ruling pending appeal and denied the policy of respecting the voluntary isolation of indigenous people had changed.
Survival International said the appointment of Dias was ""like putting the fox in charge of the hen house.""
Evangelical missionaries have re-doubled their efforts to contact uncontacted tribes under Brazil's right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, who has vowed to develop the Amazon economically and has strong evangelical support.

In the Thursday morning attack, the gunman opened fire at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi, wounding one sailor, a member of the base security force, but the assailant was the only person killed, the FBI said.
The suspect's name and age were confirmed to Reuters in an email from an FBI official, and tweeted by the agency. No further official information about the suspect was immediately released.
A U.S. law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said Alsahli was a native of Syria who held U.S. citizenship.
FBI agent Leah Greeves said on Thursday that the incident was being treated as ""terrorism related,"" but official details about the circumstances of the attack remained scant.
The  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) quoted a base spokeswoman as saying a man in a vehicle approached a gate to the installation and began firing at a guard, who was injured but managed to activate a ""final denial barrier"" that prevents entry. Base personnel returned fire, and the gunman was ""neutralized,"" the spokeswoman told the Times.
Greeves said on Thursday that authorities were searching for ""a potential second related person of interest"" who remained at large in the community. A law enforcement official said that as of Friday afternoon, authorities had no updated information to release about the possible second suspect.

The Justice Department said separately on Thursday that electronic media found at the scene was being analyzed as part of the investigation.

Cummings, a polarising figure in Britain since he masterminded the successful campaign to leave the European Union in 2016, travelled to Durham in northern England in late March, when a strict lockdown was already in place, the reports said.
A spokesman for Johnson's Downing Street office said it would make no comment. Cummings could not immediately be reached.
The opposition Labour Party said Downing Street should explain his actions. ""The British people do not expect there to be one rule for them and another rule for Dominic Cummings,"" a spokeswoman said.
Johnson imposed a national lockdown on March 23, asking Britons to stay at home. Non-essential travel was not allowed.
On March 27, Johnson announced that he had tested positive for the virus. On the weekend of March 28-29, Cummings also developed symptoms of the virus. Downing Street said he was self-isolating at home. He returned to the office on April 14.
The Guardian and the Mirror reported that on March 31, police in Durham received a report that Cummings was staying at an address in the city.
""Officers made contact with the owners of that address who confirmed that the individual in question was present and was self-isolating in part of the house,"" a spokesman for Durham police was quoted as saying in both newspapers' reports.
""Officers explained to the family the guidelines around self-isolation and reiterated the appropriate advice around essential travel.""
No comment from Durham police was immediately available.
The two newspapers said that the property where Cummings stayed in Durham was his parents' house.
The BBC's political editor quoted a source close to Cummings as saying he did travel to Durham during lockdown but did not breach the rules as he needed his parents' help with childcare while he was ill. Cummings and his wife have a young son.
The reports could put Cummings in a difficult position, after several senior people involved in the country's response to the coronavirus outbreak were forced to resign when it emerged that they had broken the lockdown rules.
Epidemiologist Neil Ferguson resigned from his role as a government advisor on May 5 after the Daily Telegraph reported he had met his girlfriend.
Scotland's Chief Medical Officer Catherine Calderwood resigned on April 5 after she broke her own advice to stay at home by visiting her second home on two weekends.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistan International Airlines Airbus jet with 99 people aboard crashed into a crowded residential district of the city of Karachi on Friday afternoon while approaching the airport.
At least 56 people were confirmed to have died, hospital officials told Reuters, though other officials gave different figures and authorities did not release an estimate of casualties on the ground.
Two passengers survived, including Zafar Masood, president of the Bank of Punjab, a Sindh provincial government spokesman said. The bank said he had suffered fractures but was ""conscious and responding well"". 
The other survivor, engineer Muhammad Zubair, told Geo News the pilot came down for one landing, briefly touched down, then took off again. 
After around 10 more minutes of flying, the pilot announced to passengers he was going to go around for a second go, then crashed as he approached the runway, Zubair said from his bed in Civil Hospital Karachi.
""All I could see around was smoke and fire,"" he added. ""I could hear screams from all directions. Kids and adults. All I could see was fire. I couldn’t see any people – just hear their screams.
""I opened my seat belt and saw some light – I went towards the light. I had to jump down about 10 feet to get to safety.”
'WE HAVE LOST ENGINES'
Smoke billowed from the scene where flight PK 8303 came down at about 2:45 p.m. (0945 GMT). Twisted fuselage lay in the rubble of multi-storey buildings as ambulances rushed through chaotic crowds.
The crash happened on the eve of the Muslim festival of Eid, when Pakistanis travel to visit relatives. 
""The aeroplane first hit a mobile tower and crashed over houses,"" witness Shakeel Ahmed said near the site, a few kilometres short of the airport.
The Airbus A320 was flying from the eastern city of Lahore to Karachi in the south with 91 passengers and eight crew, civil aviation authorities said, just as Pakistan was resuming domestic flights in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
A total of 56 bodies were brought to JPMC hospital and the Civil Hospital Karachi, officials from both institutions said. The airline's chief executive, Arshad Malik, told reporters he knew of 41 confirmed deaths.
Seconds before the crash, the pilot told air traffic controllers he had lost power from both engines, according to a recording posted on liveatc.net, a widely respected aviation monitoring website.
""We are returning back, sir, we have lost engines,"" a man was heard saying in a recording released by the website. The controller freed up both the airport's runways but moments later the man called ""Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!"".
'IMMEDIATE INQUIRY'
There was no further communication from the plane, according to the tape, which could not immediately be authenticated.
""The last we heard from the pilot was that he has some technical problem ... It is a very tragic incident,"" said the state carrier's spokesman, Abdullah H. Khan.
Another senior civil aviation official told Reuters it appeared the plane had been unable to lower its undercarriage for the first approach due to a technical fault, but it was too early to determine the cause.
Aviation safety experts say air crashes typically have multiple causes, and that it is too early to understand them within the first hours or days.
Prime Minister Imran Khan tweeted: ""Shocked & saddened by the PIA crash ... Immediate inquiry will be instituted. Prayers & condolences go to families of the deceased."" 

Airbus said the jet first flew in 2004 and was fitted with engines built by CFM International, co-owned by  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) and France's  Safran  (PA:SAF).

The rescue was conducted by a Maltese patrol boat in the early hours of Friday after the dinghy drifted into Malta’s search and rescue region. 
The migrants were transferred to the tourist boat on Friday afternoon. They join another two tourist boats chartered for the same purpose by the government just over two weeks ago and holding another 160 migrants.
The government has insisted it will not allow any migrants to land in Malta, saying other European Union nations have not kept promises to take migrants already brought to the island. 
Prime Minister Robert Abela has also told the European Union than once Malta’s airport and harbours have been closed to tourists, they will not be open to migrants.
The government confirmed on Friday, however, that a group of 19 including children, their parents and pregnant women who had been among the newly rescued migrants have been brought to Malta for humanitarian reasons.
Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo in a statement on Thursday said Malta’s migration centres are holding twice the number of people they were designed for and Malta was at the mercy of people smugglers.
""We want to protect the rights of people seeking protection, but we can only do so much. We are being left alone. Words of sympathy are not enough, we need practical help,"" he said referring to the EU. 
Only 8% of migrant arrivals had been distributed to the EU over the years, he said. Of 1,500 this year, only France and Portugal had pledged to take migrants, just 36. Malta, he said, was protecting an EU external border, but ""we cannot become European Union’s crisis centre.""
He warned that the situation in Libya was worsening and the migration problem, therefore, was likely to also worsen over the coming months. 
On May 8 Malta pressed its demand for EU migration action by warning that it will vote to freeze financing for a naval mission monitoring arms traffic into Libya.
It also told the EU that it would no longer commit a landing party to form part of the mission, known as Operation Irini.

Wednesday's election, the first competitive presidential election since civil war erupted in 1993, is meant to usher in the first democratic transfer of power in 58 years of independence.
There was widespread international criticism of the last election in 2015, which the opposition boycotted, when President Pierre Nkurunziza won a third term.
There were few international election monitors on Wednesday after the government said they would have to spend 14 days in quarantine to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
The ruling CNDD-FDD party’s candidate, retired general Evariste Ndayishimiye, ran against opposition leader Agathon Rwasa and five others.
Nkurunziza, whose government has repeatedly been accused of rights abuses, will step down after 15 years in power.
Police were not immediately available to comment. An official at the justice ministry, who asked not to be identified as he was not authorised to talk to the media, said the detainees were currently on trial. 
""The voting was marred with several irregularities: arrests of over 200 CNL (observers), intimidation, people who voted several times or under the names of dead ones, refugees or prisoners,"" said Terence Manirambona, the spokesman for the CNL. 
The electoral commission said the allegations of fraud had to be addressed by the courts and not by them. The government did not respond to requests for comment about the accusations.
Full results are expected within a week. If no one wins 50% in the first round, then a run-off will be held within two weeks.

The Dar Assalam mosque in the Neukölln district normally welcomes hundreds of Muslims to its Friday services. But it can currently only accommodate 50 people at a time under Germany's coronavirus restrictions.
During the holy fasting month of Ramadan, the nearby Martha Lutheran church stepped in to help, hosting Muslim prayers in Arabic and German.
""It is a great sign and it brings joy in Ramadan and joy amid this crisis,"" said Mohamed Taha Sabry, the mosque's imam, who led his congregation in prayer watched over by a stained-glass window depicting the Virgin Mary.
""This pandemic has made us a community. Crises bring people get together.""
Places of worship reopened in Germany on May 4 after being shut for weeks under a coronavirus lockdown, but worshippers must maintain a minimum distance from one another of 1.5 metres.
The church, a red-brick neo-renaissance building in Berlin's Kreuzberg district could hardly offer a sharper contrast to the cultural centre in Neukoelln where the Muslim congregation is accustomed to gathering.
""It was a strange feeling because of the musical instruments, the pictures,"" said worshipper Samer Hamdoun. ""But when you look, when you forget the small details, this is the House of God in the end...""
The Islamic Council, an umbrella group of 400 mosques, said in April that many face bankruptcy because the closures stretched into the holy fasting month of Ramadan, usually a vital period for donations.
The church's pastor, Monika Matthias, said she had felt moved by the Muslim call to prayer.

""I took part in the prayer,"" she said. ""I gave a speech in German. And during prayer, I could only say yes, yes, yes, because we have the same concerns and we want to learn from you. And it is beautiful to feel that way about each other.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday urged state governors to allow the reopening this weekend in the United States of places of worship which have been closed due to the coronavirus, warning that he will override governors who do not do so.
At a short appearance in the White House briefing room, Trump said he was declaring that places of worship - churches, synagogues and mosques - are providing essential services and thus should be opened as soon as possible.
Places of worship have been closed along as part of stay-at-home orders most states have tried to control the spread of the coronavirus. With the infection rate declining in many areas, there is pressure to begin reopening.
Trump issued a warning to governors who refuse his appeal but did not say under what authority he would act to force the reopening of religious facilities.

""If they don't do it I will override the governors. In America we need more prayer, not less,"" he said.

Senior officials in President Donald Trump's administration, which says Russia has repeatedly violated the treaty's terms, said on Thursday that Washington would formally pull out of Open Skies in six months.
The U.S. move deepens doubts about whether Washington will seek to extend the 2010 New START accord, which imposes the last remaining limits on U.S. and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear arms to no more than 1,550 each. The accord expires in February.
Envoys to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), meeting in response to the U.S. announcement, agreed ""on the importance of arms control, and on the need to bring Russia back to compliance"", the NATO official said.
""A number of allies expressed concern that the U.S. may be leaving the treaty,"" the official added.
Some allies worry that a U.S. exit from Open Skies, which will halt Russian overflights of the United States, could prompt Moscow's withdrawal. That would end overflights of Russia by the remaining members, weakening European security at a time when Russian-backed separatists hold parts of Ukraine and Georgia.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that for many years Russia had ""imposed flight restrictions inconsistent with the treaty, including flight limitations over Kaliningrad, and restricting flights in Russia near its border with Georgia"".
""Russia's ongoing selective implementation has undermined the Open Skies Treaty,"" he said in a statement after the meeting of ambassadors to the Brussels-based alliance.

He noted that Washington would reconsider its withdrawal if Russia respected the treaty's terms, and said NATO allies were engaging with Moscow to seek its early return to compliance.

VAMOSSZABADI, Hungary (Reuters) - Pale, thin but in high spirits, Yemeni engineering student Wesam Al-Hadrami emerged from the unlocked gate of a new migrant centre in Hungary on Friday to take his first walk after nine months of detention.
Behind him lay a cluster of white buildings, recently renovated with funds from Switzerland and the European Union. 
A few unarmed private security guards looked on as migrants filed out into the sun and children kicked a ball around.
""This is the first day after nine months that I go on the streets,"" Hadrami said. ""I might start running for kilometres. It's so good to feel free.""
The newly opened centre at Vamosszabadi is a far cry from the machine guns, dogs and wide military perimeters of Hungary's so-called ""transit zones"", where Hadrami spent the preceding months before the government shut the last one on Thursday. 
""It was awful. The place, the environment... we basically lived in dirt... it was like prison, basically,"" Hadrami said.
During the peak of Europe's 2015 migration crisis, Prime Minister Viktor Orban's government sealed Hungary's southern border, blocking a route for hundreds of thousands of migrants trying to reach western Europe.
Some of those who made it across were then detained at the ""transit zones"", where they were lodged in shipping containers surrounded by heavily-guarded barbed wire perimeters. 
Hungary had to shut the zones after the European Court of Justice ruled them unlawful.
Hadrami and the 300 other migrants held there have been transferred to what the government calls ""migrant reception centres"". Here they have internet access, can come and go for a few hours a day but must check in every 24 hours. The grounds are surrounded by a chain-link fence. 
However, Hungary has said it will now only accept asylum applications at its consulates - a move rights activists say would breach EU law.
""Completely excluding asylum applications made at borders or in the country would be very much beyond EU law,"" said Marta Pardavi, co-chair of the Hungarian Helsinki Committee.

The government announced last week that it would now require arrivals to complete a ""passenger locator form"", which has been voluntary since the quarantine rule was introduced last month.
Britain will introduce similar quarantine measures from June 8 and also announced the details on Friday. Those measures will not apply to people arriving from Ireland.
Airlines have told both governments that the rules are impossible to implement.
The Irish regulations will apply to all nationalities, including returning Irish residents, and be reviewed on June 18. Harris told Reuters this week the government ""honestly don't know"" how long they will be needed.
Failure to complete the form or to update contact details if they change, or providing false information, could lead to a fine of up to 2,500 euros ($2,700) or six months in prison.
Aircraft crew, hauliers and passengers transiting to another jurisdiction will be exempt.
""These are extraordinary measures but they are necessary in a time of a public health crisis,"" Harris said in a statement.
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Ireland rose by 115 to 24,506 on Friday, with related deaths up 11 to 1,592.
It was the first time in seven days that the number of new cases had exceeded 100.
Ireland's Chief Medical Officer, Tony Holohan, said the cases stemmed from exposures prior to the easing of stay-at-home restrictions a week ago.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also rebuked this week's move by China's Communist Party-controlled parliament, calling it arbitrary and disastrous. On Thursday, Republican President Donald Trump warned that Washington would react ""very strongly"" against any attempt by Beijing to gain more control over the former British colony.
On CNBC, Biden said, ""We should be calling the rest of the world to condemn their actions, criticizing Trump for a ""silence"" on human rights issues the former vice president said was ""devastating for people around the world.""
""All it does is encourage thugs and dictators, which, in fact, I think the president has some kind of affinity for,"" Biden said.
China has quickly become a focus in the U.S. presidential race, with both Trump and Biden spending millions of dollars on ad campaigns before Nov. 3's election targeting each other's record in dealing with the country. 
Trump's campaign, which has seized on Americans' growing animosity toward China over the coronavirus outbreak to underpin his re-election pitch, contends Biden will not be as tough on Beijing as the president is.
But Biden argues Trump is helping China by undermining U.S. relations with allies and reducing the United States' role and influence in international institutions.
China's action could spark fresh protests in Hong Kong, which enjoys many freedoms not allowed on the mainland, after often-violent demonstrations last year plunged the city into its deepest turmoil since its return to Beijing's rule in 1997. 

Pro-democracy demonstrators have for years opposed the idea of national security laws, arguing they could erode the city's high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula in place for two decades.

Fighters for the Government of National Accord (GNA) said they had advanced into several districts and overrun a military camp. The LNA said it had already pulled out of those areas in what it said was a humanitarian gesture for Ramadan. 
The GNA has with Turkish help made sudden strides in recent weeks, seizing a string of towns from the LNA, capturing the strategically important Watiya airbase and destroying several of its Russian-made air defence systems. 
The LNA, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt, has promised to respond with a massive air campaign and on Thursday its spokesman Ahmed Mismari said four warplanes had become newly available. 
As diplomats warned of the risk of a new round of escalation with the warring sides' external backers pouring in new weaponry, the focus of the conflict shifted towards Tarhouna, the biggest remaining LNA stronghold in northwest Libya. 
The GNA took Asaba, which lies on a major supply route to Tarhouna on Thursday, putting more pressure on LNA forces in the town, which has been subjected to bombardment for weeks.
An LNA military source said GNA forces were gathering to attack Tarhouna and said it had downed a drone there. 
The United Nations Libya mission said it was following the mobilisation around Tarhouna with ""great concern"", warning all parties against any acts of retribution in a statement the United States said it supported.

(Reuters) - A flotilla of five tankers carrying Iranian fuel for gasoline-starved Venezuela is approaching the Caribbean, with the first vessel expected to reach the South American country's waters on Sunday, according to Refinitiv Eikon tracking data.
Iran is supplying about 1.53 million barrels of gasoline and alkylate to Venezuela, according to both governments, sources and calculations made by TankerTrackers.com based on the vessels' draft levels.
The shipments have caused a diplomatic standoff between Iran, Venezuela and the United States as both nations are under U.S. sanctions. Washington is considering measures in response to the shipments, which the administration believes are being paid with gold, a U.S. official told Reuters last week.
Venezuela's defense minister said the military will escort the tankers once they reach the nation's exclusive economic zone. 
Iran-flagged tanker Fortune, the first in the flotilla, was approaching the Caribbean Sea (NYSE:SE) on Friday. It has been navigating with its satellite signal on since it passed the Suez Canal earlier in May. The four other vessels are following the same route across the Atlantic Ocean, the Eikon data showed.
The OPEC-member country desperately needs fuel to feed up to 1,800 gasoline stations that have been partially closed for weeks due to insufficient supply from state-run PDVSA's refineries, which until March worked at about 10% of their joint capacity of 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd).
Venezuela was consuming 170,000 bpd of gasoline before coronavirus-related lockdown measures. Fuel sales at stations declined to about 40,000 bpd due to rationing, according to independent calculations.
Over a decade of mismanagement and lack of staff combined with U.S. sanctions that since 2019 have limited imports have left the refineries in poor condition. Shipments of equipment in flights by Iran's Mahar Air have arrived in Venezuela in recent weeks to start repair work.

Children's Fund (UNICEF) and GAVI said in a joint statement issued ahead of the Global Vaccine Summit set for June 4.
Travel restrictions, delays in vaccine deliveries, reluctance among some parents to leave their homes amid fear of exposure to coronavirus, and a lack of available health workers were behind what it said may be ""unprecedented"" disruption on a global scale since such expanded programmes began in the 1970s.
""We cannot let our fight against one disease come at the expense of long-term progress in our fight against other diseases,"" said Henrietta Fore, UNICEF executive director.

""Tourists are welcome in Portugal,"" Santos Silva told newspaper Observador, explaining that some health checks will be introduced at airports but there will be no compulsory quarantine for those flying in.
Portugal, which has so far recorded 30,200 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 1,289 deaths, is slowly easing restrictions in place since it locked down in mid-March.
It has been less affected than its neighbour Spain or Italy, which both plan to reopen next month.
Many shops and restaurants in Portugal have already reopened under strict restrictions as part of an effort to revive the country's export-oriented, tourism-dependent economy.
""Portugal's health system responds well, and this is very important for us to be able to welcome people,"" Santos Silva said.
The minister's comments came a day after British low-cost airline easyJet (LON:EZJ), which operates in various Portuguese cities, said it would restart a small number of flights next month.
Earlier this month Portugal's flag carrier TAP resumed some of its international operations, with flights to London and Paris.
Flights to and from outside the European Union are still temporarily suspended until June 15, with some exceptions, including some routes to and from Portuguese-speaking nations like Brazil. 
The Spain-Portugal land border, which has been closed to tourists since March, will also remain shut until then.
""We are gradually going to start looking at easing border controls,"" Internal Affairs Minister Eduardo Cabrita said on Friday.
The tourism industry, one of the hardest hit by the outbreak, contributed 14.6% to gross domestic product in 2018, according to the latest official data, and helped Portugal to recover from a severe debt crisis. 
The sector registered a 62% slump in the number of people staying in holiday accommodation in March from a year ago and total hotel revenues fell by over 57%.

Unemployment in the Algarve region more than doubled in April compared with the same month last year as the lockdown kept foreign visitors away and wiped out seasonal jobs.

""We've witnessed an explosion in demand from individuals wanting flour,"" Delacroix told Reuters from her mill, whose two large water wheels are powered by a tributary of the river Strange, and grind the wheat grain.

Delacroix, whose family bought the mill in 1991, believes it could become a habit, even as Belgium has been slowly opening up since May 4. Delacroix, who helped modernise the mill, gave up being a magistrate in 2009 to follow her passion for baking.
""I think it's been long enough (to have an impact),"" she said of the lockdown. ""I think the crisis has also brought home the importance of eating local produce,"" she said.
Once one of 430 mills noted in a 1900 census in the region, the Hollange mill's increased activity since March has not been without challenges. German bakers seeking scarce spelt grain on the Belgian market have sharply driven up prices.
The month of April was one of the driest and warmest on record, according to Belgium's Royal Institute of Meteorology, meaning a reduced harvest for wheat farmers and lower river water levels that could affect grinding at the mill.

""It is going to hit the harvest and, because we use hydropower, we may need to turn to electricity,"" Delacroix said.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Conservative Polish President Andrzej Duda has seen his lead narrow sharply ahead of an election expected to take place in coming weeks, opinion polls have shown, after preparations for a May 10 ballot collapsed amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Squabbles over how to organise the ballot during the outbreak plunged Poland into political turmoil, leaving the date of the vote unclear.
Some analysts said Duda's campaign appears to have lost steam amid political infighting, with the opposition accusing the government of failing to ensure fair and free voting in its preparations for a May 10 ballot.
The ruling nationalists have pushed for the election to be held as soon as possible, wary that a growing economic downturn could erode the chances of Duda, an important ally, to be re-elected.
Government officials say June 28 is now the most likely date.
Support for Duda has fallen 20 percentage points since April, according to a May 18-19 survey by the Kantar pollster, reaching 39%. Another poll, by IBRiS, showed him at 43%.
Duda, one of Poland's most popular politicians, had polled as high as 63% shortly before the election, his popularity driven in part by an election boycott announced by the biggest opposition party, the centrist Civic Platform (PO).
A PO announcement last week to replace its candidate with popular Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski appears to have galvanised centrist voters.
A prominent defender of gay rights, a highly divisive issue in the largely conservative Poland, Trzaskowski could win 18% in the presidential ballot, securing second place, the Kantar poll showed.
Despite falling support, Duda is still likely to secure re-election, the pollster said. If he fails to win more than 50% of vote, he will have to compete with the runner up in a second round. Kantar showed him winning 48% to Trzaskowski's 41%.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader on Friday denounced Israel as a ""tumor"" to be eliminated and hailed Tehran's supply of arms to Palestinians, drawing swift condemnation from the United States and the European Union.
Opposition to Israel is a core belief for Shi’ite-led Iran, which backs Palestinian and Lebanese armed groups opposed to peace with the Jewish state, which Tehran refuses to recognize.
""The Zionist regime (Israel) is a deadly, cancerous tumor in the region. It will undoubtedly be uprooted and destroyed,"" Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in an online speech. 
The United States and European Union rejected the comments.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Twitter dismissed them as ""disgusting and hateful anti-Semitic remarks"" that did not represent the tradition of tolerance of ordinary Iranians.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said they were ""totally unacceptable and represent a deep source of concern"".
Although leaders of Palestinian militant groups in Gaza, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad, have frequently praised Iran's financial and military support, Khamenei had not himself previously given public confirmation of Tehran's weapons supply.
""Iran realised Palestinian fighters' only problem was lack of access to weapons. With divine guidance and assistance, we planned, and the balance of power has been transformed in Palestine, and today the Gaza Strip can stand against the aggression of the Zionist enemy and defeat it,"" he said.
Israeli Defence Minister and Alternate Prime Minister Benny Gantz said: ""The State of Israel has great challenges in a variety of arenas. Khamenei's statement that Israel is a 'cancerous tumor' illustrates this more than anything.""
He said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): ""I do not suggest anyone to test us ...We will be prepared for all threats, and by any means.""
RALLIES CANCELLED 
Iranian officials have repeatedly called for an end to Israel, including by a referendum that would exclude most of its Jews while including Palestinians in the region and abroad.
Khamenei said his referendum idea showed that accusations of anti-Semitism against Iran's position on Israel were unfounded.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called Iran ""the most antisemitic regime on the planet"" in an address during a Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem on Jan 23.
Khamenei suggested global attention on the coronavirus crisis had helped obscure wrongs done to Palestinians. ""The long-lasting virus of Zionists will be eliminated,"" he added. 
Khamenei was speaking on Iran's annual Quds Day, which uses the Arabic name for Jerusalem, held on the last Friday of the fasting month of Ramadan. 
Iran cancelled nationwide Quds Day rallies due to coronavirus. Iran is one of the most-affected countries in the region with 7,300 deaths and a total of 131,652 infections.

Khamenei also denounced what he called treason by ""political and cultural mercenaries in Muslim countries"" helping Zionists to downplay the Palestine issue, an apparent reference to some Arab states including Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States called on the World Health Organization (WHO) on Friday to begin work immediately on investigating the source of the novel coronavirus, as well as its handling of the response to the pandemic.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has accused the agency of being ""China centric"", threatened in a tweeted letter to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday to permanently halt funding if the WHO did not commit to improvements within 30 days, and to reconsider his country's membership of the agency.
More than 5.12 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported worldwide, including 332,0526 deaths, since the virus emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, according to the latest Reuters tally.
The WHO's executive board of 34 member states, including the United States, held a three-hour session on Friday. 
Admiral Brett P. Giroir, U.S. Assistant Secretary for Health, told the board in a written statement: ""As President Trump just made clear in his May 18 letter to Director-General Tedros, there is no time to waste to begin on the reforms needed to ensure such a pandemic never happens again.
""We applaud the call for an impartial, independent, and comprehensive review to be undertaken in consultation with Member States and urge that work begin now,"" he said.
Giroir was referring to a resolution presented by the European Union that was unanimously adopted by the WHO's annual ministerial assembly of 194 states on Tuesday that called for a thorough evaluation ""at the earliest appropriate moment"". 
""This review will ensure we have a complete and transparent understanding of the source, timeline of events, and decision-making process for the WHO’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic,"" he said.
When the WHO Assembly resumes in the autumn, it must address the outcome of the review process, reforms to strengthen the WHO, ""including the ability of Taiwan to participate as an observer"", Giroir added.
Taiwan lobbied hard to be included as an observer at the two-day assembly and received strong support from the United States, Japan and others, but says it was not invited due to opposition from China. China considers Taiwan a breakaway province with no right to the trappings of a sovereign state.
Tedros has always promised a post-pandemic review and ""accountability"".
In remarks to the board, Tedros said that the WHO had worked non-stop since the coronavirus emerged, informing all member states of its evolution and providing technical advice.
""WHO has worked day and night to coordinate the global response at all three levels of the organisation, providing technical advice, catalysing political solidarity, mobilising resources, coordinating resources and much more,"" he said. 
""So far almost $800 million has been pledged or received towards WHO's appeal for COVID-19 programmes, leaving a gap of just over $900 million,"" he said.

The Czech Republic took early action in March to close borders, schools and much of the services sector and has also been eager to relax many of the restrictions.
Most retail and sports grounds have already reopened and from Monday public events for up to 300 people will be allowed and swimming pools and schools will reopen. 
Health Minister Adam Vojtech said an initial easing of restrictions from May 11 had not had an adverse effect.
""There are no negative trends noted, it is still valid that the Czech Republic has managed the situation very well,"" he told reporters, adding that the relaxation of lockdown would continue. 
The Czech Republic had recorded 8,757 cases of COVID-19 by Friday morning, with 306 deaths.
There were currently two main local infection hot spots, chief public health officer Jarmila Razova said - Prague, and a mine in the east of the country, where more than 100 cases have been identified, mostly among the miners from one shaft and their families.
A rise in cases to a May high of 111 on Tuesday, were mainly attributed to the mine. 
In Prague, there were 50 new daily cases on average since May 1 scattered across the whole city, a presentation showed.
The overall number of hospitalised patients had dropped by two thirds from the peak to 150 on Friday.
The ministry predicts around 9,430 cases at the end of May, compared with approximately 8,600 in a previous outlook presented on May 6.

The restrictions in the capital will now be the same as in most of the Spanish mainland, which started relaxing the lockdown early this month. Both Madrid and Barcelona, Spain's second city, had been kept in full lockdown because their outbreaks were so severe.
The state-owned TV channel TVE said Barcelona's restrictions would be similarly eased. Beaches there were opened for walking this week, but public swimming and sunbathing remain banned.
Bars and restaurants in the capital will be allowed to reopen on pavements and terraces from Monday, churches will also reopen, and people will be free to travel within the province.

The lockdown is due to be eased one notch further in other regions. The sparsely populated Canary Islands of La Graciosa, El Hierro and La Gomera, as well as Formentera in the Balearics, were freed from most restrictions on Monday.

Speaker Nabih Berri, head of the Shi'ite Amal Movement, said the Lebanese citizen was worried about ""his livelihood, his fate and everything to do with his life and the life of the nation"", which is facing the worst crisis since the 1975-90 civil war.
""It is time for the government to launch fieldwork away from plans and programmes on paper. What is required is actions more than words,"" he said. 
The currency has lost more than half its value since October amid a liquidity shortage that has largely frozen savers out of their deposits. Inflation and unemployment are soaring.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab has said there is the risk of a major food crisis and many Lebanese may soon find it hard to afford bread.
The government is negotiating with the IMF, aiming to unlock aid based on a recovery plan that details vast losses in the financial system. Lebanon defaulted on its sovereign debt in March for the first time.
Berri, who seldom gives public addresses, was speaking to mark the anniversary of the Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon and al-Quds Day, a commemoration initiated by Iran in 1979 that falls on the last Friday of Ramadan.
Diab took office in January with support from Berri, the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah, and President Michel Aoun, the Maronite Christian head of state. Sunni politician Saad al-Hariri, Druze leader Walid Jumblatt and Aoun's Maronite rival Samir Geagea stayed out of his cabinet. 

The central bank has said it will start providing dollars for food imports as part of ""necessary measures"" to defend the currency.

103,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>","As China fast-tracks biosecurity law, some experts urge whistleblower protection","BEIJING (Reuters) - China is fast-tracking a new law to help prevent infectious diseases and other ""biological threats"", but some experts said a provision aimed at deterring false information could discourage potential whistleblowers and put the public at risk.
The proposed legislation, which is under discussion at the annual session of parliament that began on Friday, bars entities or individuals from fabricating or disseminating false biosecurity information, according to the latest and first publicly available draft of the law.
Authorities have repeatedly promised to take action to address ""shortcomings"" in public health laws and regulations, which has led to the fast-tracking of the biosecurity law.
But if medical workers' information on what they suspect to be a new contagious disease cannot be proved 100% accurate, the fear is they could be punished.
""If I were a doctor, I would think about it,"" said Zhang Mingmei, a lawyer at Beijing DHH Law Firm. ""Had I reported (on a potential epidemic) and it later turned out to be incorrect, would I bear liability for this?""
""It takes time to make checks on false information,"" Zhang said. ""But ... opportunities to curb an epidemic will never return once we miss them.""
In January, Wuhan doctor Li Wenliang was reprimanded by police for spreading ""illegal and false"" information after disclosing on social media that multiple patients in the city had been infected by a virus similar to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
Li eventually became one of the early victims of a new coronavirus that would go on to kill 330,000 people worldwide, and his treatment by the authorities caused widespread outrage in China.
The legislation, a draft of which was first reviewed by the parliament's standing committee in October, was opened for public comment in late April and will remain so until mid-June, according to the parliament website. 
China aims to roll out the law by the end of the year, a parliamentary spokesman said on Thursday, unusually fast for a comprehensive new law by Chinese legislative standards.
'OUR NATURAL-BORN RIGHT'
Some experts said they hoped the draft would be tweaked to give medical workers and others more leeway to raise the alarm in the event of a suspected new disease outbreak, even though their information may turn out not to be accurate.
In addition to the new biosecurity law, China's top lawmaking body pledged last month to revise a series of existing laws, with the coronavirus outbreak providing ""a deeper understanding of the importance and urgency of strengthening legal safeguards for public health.""
Xiao Youdan, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Science, said laws and regulations should protect the rights of front-line medical professionals to warn the public of potential health threats.
For example, even if they have not been authorised by the government to speak out, doctors or pharmacists should be allowed to warn patients to wear masks if they notice an increase in local consumption of antiviral drugs, or a surge in the number of respiratory infections, Xiao said. 
""Access to such information should be our natural-born right,"" Xiao said.
Wang Chenguang, a retired professor from Beijing's Tsinghua University who has submitted suggestions to authorities on amending China's infectious disease prevention and control law, said regulations should also require officials to consider epidemic clues gathered from informal channels like social media.
""If this is available, it should be treated carefully according to laws and regulations, rather than ignored or simply banned,"" Wang said.

Fearing a spike in new COVID-19 cases, the Indonesian authorities have sought to discourage people from travelling for the festival this year, which usually sees workers from across the archipelago return to their hometowns. 
Around 2,000 workers at a plantation in Indragiri Hilir on Sumatra island run by Singapore-based firm Musim Mas have been in isolation since March 20, with nobody allowed to leave or to enter the site, the company said. 
A plantation manager said the workers were permitted to leave if they required medical assistance or for family reasons. 
For one of the workers, Muhammad Saleh, 40, it will be the first time in six years working at the plantation that he cannot visit his hometown of Medan to celebrate Eid al-Fitr, the festival marking the end of the holy Muslim month of fasting.    ""I feel sad because we cannot return to our hometown and cannot meet our parents,"" said Saleh.  
Health measures at the plantation include wearing masks, maintaining at least one metre (3.3 ft) distance between people and monitoring body temperature.The Indonesia Palm Oil Association and the Indonesia Oil Palm Labor Union Network have jointly urged members not to travel outside plantations to ensure operations run smoothly. 
They also called on plantation owners to pay a traditional extra month bonus during Eid al-Fitr and ensure the health and safety of workers.

Musim Mas said in a statement it could not say when it might end its lockdown, but would continue to assess the situation and take precautionary steps in line with government regulations.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Temitope can't find work in Lebanon since the Nigerian domestic worker escaped her employer's house last month. 
With Lebanon in deep financial crisis and dollars in short supply, people have less money to spend on help. And with Beirut airport shut under a coronavirus lockdown, Temitope can't go back home even if she tries.
""I'm very afraid. There's not a day that I don't cry... without any money even to eat now,"" said Temitope, who climbed down a building after her employer beat her until she bled. She now lives with friends, relying on any cash they can give her.
Like many African and Asian women in Lebanon, Temitope, a mother of two, was recruited for work and came so she could send money home to her family.
But dollar shortages piling pressure on hundreds of thousands of migrant workers in Lebanon have left some stranded in the streets and many begging to go home. Rights groups warn this puts workers at risk of abuse and trauma. 
Embassy and NGO shelters are saturated. 
Since Lebanon plunged into crisis late last year, the local currency has lost more than half its value. Prices have soared as more Lebanese slide into poverty. 
The coronavirus pandemic has also hampered government efforts to repatriate workers via their embassies, and even those flights require payment in dollars.
""There's more need than ever before for shelters...for those who lost jobs and have no place else to go,"" said Zeina Mezher of the International Labour Organization.
Activist groups say they field regular calls from unpaid domestic workers who have been kicked out or escaped their employer's households.
""SLAVERY""
Migrant workers form the backbone of sectors like waste collection and housekeeping in Lebanon, where many barely have any rights, face widespread racism and sometimes commit suicide. 
Most women work as maids under a sponsorship system called ""kafala"" that even the former labour minister likened to slavery. It prevents them from leaving without the employer's consent, with salaries as low as $150 a month. 
Last month, police interrogated a man who tried to sell a Nigerian housekeeper for $1,000 on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""The crises, whether it's coronavirus or the economy, expose the flaws in the kafala system,"" Mezher said.
The prime minister's wife sparked controversy last week when she called on Lebanese - facing rising unemployment - to take up jobs usually filled by foreigners like housekeeper or doorman. 
Bangladeshi trash collectors went on strike for weeks after the firm managing waste in Beirut, RAMCO, switched to paying them in Lebanese pounds, undermining the value of their wages. 
When workers stopped garbage trucks from going out in protest last week, riot police arrived, firing smoke bombs and beating some of them.
Mohamad Ilahi, one of the workers, has not sent money to his wife and two daughters in Bangladesh for months. ""My family cries a lot,"" he said. ""They can't pay school fees, can't buy enough food.""
He said the firm had finally agreed to a pay raise in local currency.
RAMCO manager Walid BouSaad said the company had no choice because the Lebanese state, its main customer, stopped paying in dollars late last year, on top of millions the government owes in arrears. ""It is the worker's right to ask for payment in dollars,"" he said. ""But some things are out of our hands."" 

For Ilahi, the future in Lebanon remains uncertain. ""I want to work. But without a solution, there's no use for me here,"" he said. ""I will want to leave then. All of us will.""

CASCAIS, Portugal (Reuters) - A popular beach town near Lisbon plans to be the first in Portugal to test all of its 200,000 residents for coronavirus antibodies to try and help them enjoy as normal a summer season as possible despite the crisis. 
Born and bred in Cascais, loved for its beaches and golf courses, 57-year-old Marina Lima was one of the first to enter the tiny testing room when the initiative began on Thursday.
Results take 24 hours, and Lima hoped hers may clear her for spending more time with family, including a two-month-old grandson. ""Having that information is very good,"" she said. 
The municipality of Cascais hopes to conduct 5,000 tests per week in a deal with pharmaceutical firm Roche. Each test costs five euros ($5.45) and is paid for by the municipality and several patrons, said Cascais' deputy mayor Miguel Pinto Luz.
""These kind of initiatives also increase people's confidence, which is needed now we are trying to restart the economy,"" said Pinto Luz before himself being tested.
Mass antibody testing is being considered by many countries to speed reopening of economies. 
Portugal, which so far has nearly 30,000 cases and 1,277 deaths, is slowly easing restrictions from a mid-March lockdown.
Although the tests show who has been infected by COVID-19, it is not yet clear whether the presence of antibodies confers permanent immunity.
Retiree Jose Ferreira, 79, will book an appointment to do his free test but has doubts. 
""Experts say the test itself can give us an idea but not exactly whether we are immune or not,"" the 79-year-old said as he walked by one of Cascais' beaches. 
""I hope it goes well, for the benefit of all.""
To coax people back outside safely, Cascais has come up with initiatives including a carefully-controlled food fair, free buses, vending machines for masks, and geometrical figures on grass to help sunbathers and picnickers keep apart. 
""We miss being outside,"" said 33-year-old Gabriela Ferreira at a park. ""Here we feel safe and can still have fun.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been criticised for scaling back testing and tracing in March, only to ramp up the system in recent weeks to try to ease out of a lockdown to tackle the coronavirus outbreak that has all but shut down the economy.
Johnson's government repeatedly says it has been guided in its fight against the coronavirus by scientific and medical advice, and on Friday, John Newton, Britain's testing coordinator, said it was ministers who ultimately decided on contact tracing.
Newton said the government's scientific advisory group established in February that an increased rate of transmission of the virus in the community meant it would not be worth carrying on with mass contact tracing.
""When, in March, it became apparent that community transmission was occurring ... that decision was then enacted. It was a decision of course of government, informed by all its advisers not just Public Health England,"" he told parliament's science and technology committee.
He said the advice from modellers in March was that Britain in a short period would have as many as a million cases - something that would stretch even those countries with large testing and tracing capabilities.
""At that point it was the government's very significant decision, made by government, to move to lockdown as the most appropriate response to the epidemiology in the UK at the time,"" he said.

On other measures where Britain is adopting different advice to other countries, Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, told the committee the advice to the public to keep two metres apart would be kept under review.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The new coronavirus is believed to be spreading throughout Yemen where the health care system ""has in effect collapsed"", the United Nations said on Friday, appealing for urgent funding.
""Aid agencies in Yemen are operating on the basis that community transmission is taking place across the country,"" Jens Laerke, spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), told a Geneva briefing. 
""We hear from many of them that Yemen is really on the brink right now. The situation is extremely alarming, they are talking about that the health system has in effect collapsed,"" he said.
Aid workers report having to turn people away because they do not have enough medical oxygen or sufficient supplies of personal protective equipment, Laerke said.
A flight carrying international aid workers landed in Aden on Thursday as air space opened up for rotations, but Yemeni nationals have been doing most of the on-site work, he said.
The main coronavirus treatment centre in southern Yemen has recorded at least 68 deaths in just over two weeks, Medecins Sans Frontieres (Doctors Without Borders), the medical charity running the site, said on Thursday. 
The figure - more than double the toll announced by Yemeni authorities so far - suggested ""a wider catastrophe unfolding in the city"", MSF said. [L8N2D33M3]
War-ravaged Yemen, whose malnourished population has among the world's lowest immunity levels to disease, is divided between the Saudi-backed government based in Aden and its foe, the Iran-aligned Houthi group, in the north.
Yemeni authorities have reported 184 coronavirus infections including 30 deaths to the World Health Organization (WHO), the latest WHO figures showed overnight. ""The actual incidence is almost certainly much higher,"" Laerke said. 
The United Nations estimates that it will seek $2 billion for Yemen to maintain aid programmes through year-end, he added.
Laerke, noting that the world body and Saudi Arabia will co-host a virtual pledging conference in 10 days, said: ""It is very, very critical that the international community steps up now and at the pledging conference on the 2nd of June, because we are heading towards a fiscal cliff.
""If we do not get the money coming in, the programmes that are keeping people alive, are very much essential to fighting back against COVID, will have to close,"" he said.

""And then the world will have to witness in a country what happens without a functioning health system battling COVID. I do not think the world wants to see that.""

The resource-rich Central Asian nation of 34 million has been opening up since President Shavkat Mirziyoyev took over in late 2016 following the death of veteran leader Islam Karimov, who had run Uzbekistan with an iron fist for 27 years.
In a draft decree published on Friday for public discussion, Mirziyoyev proposed constitutional amendments that would replace the current majoritarian, winner-takes-all system used in parliamentary elections with a mixed system that includes some proportional representation.
Uzbekistan is a presidential republic with key powers concentrated in the executive branch, although Mirziyoyev said last year he would seek some decentralisation and boost the role of parliament in overseeing the work of the cabinet.
Under the proposed reforms, Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, would no longer imprison people convicted of libel and slander. Some journalists and bloggers critical of the authorities have been jailed in the past under these laws.
The reforms also involve easing campaign finance regulations by allowing private donations and moving all elections from December - one of the coldest months - to March.
It was unclear whether moving elections to March, if implemented, would slightly shorten or prolong Mirziyoyev's current term, which is due to end in December 2021. Under the constitution, he may run for a second term.

The large white grouper caught off the Atlantic coast - considered one of the ""noble fish"" by Senegalese on account of its size and firm skin - was generally seen as a luxury treat, served up for big occasions with rice and vegetables.
High demand from Europe and over-fishing by foreign trawlers made it too expensive for many local families who had to cook up their ""thieboudienne"" meals with cheaper alternatives.
But then the pandemic restrictions came, trade routes were disrupted and the export market slowed.
At a busy market in the northern port city of Saint Louis, supplied by the city's legions of colourfully-painted wooden fishing boats, metre-long thiofs were selling at a steep discount over the weekend. 
""Before, the thiof was at 4,500 CFA francs ($7.56) per kilo. It was expensive, so as a vendor, it did not work for me,"" said Aissatou Diop, who stood at her stall underneath an orange-and-white parasol, wearing a black mask with ""COVID 19"" written in white letters. 
""But now at 2,500 CFA francs a kilo, I can buy some for my own consumption and sell the rest,"" she said.
The crisis has had the opposite effect on other parts of the market. Without the distortions of slackening exports, prices for fish meant for local tables have gone up as curfews cut the hours fishermen can spend at sea. 
""The prices have risen because the fishermen can no longer go fishing normally, and the demand is still there,"" said Aliou Ba, a political adviser at Greenpeace who monitors the sector. 
Senegal's fishers and the industries that support them have been hit hard.
""Because of the restrictions we had to let go of 10 employees. Now we only have five people working,"" said Daouda, a worker at a refrigeration company in Saint Louis.

KOLKATA/DHAKA (Reuters) - Prime Minister Narendra Modi, peering down from his aircraft on Friday, saw the devastation and flooding caused by the most powerful cyclone to strike India and Bangladesh in more than a decade, before he landed in the stricken city of Kolkata.
Cyclone Amphan killed at least 96 people in the two countries after it swept in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday, most in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal.
The toll is expected to rise as communications are restored and authorities reach villages cut off by blocked roads.
But the evacuation of some three million people before the cyclone struck undoubtedly reduced the number of casualties.
India's prime minister said the country stood with the people of West Bengal and announced emergency aid of 10 billion rupees ($131.66 million) to help the state at a time when it and the rest of the country are dealing with the novel coronavirus outbreak.
""Dealing with the pandemic requires social distancing whereas battling the cyclone requires people to move to safer areas,"" Modi said at a school during a stop on a tour to inspect the damage.
""Despite this, West Bengal is fighting well. We are all with West Bengal in these adverse times."" 
Modi wore a mask as he stepped onto tarmac at the airport in Kolkata earlier and was greeted by the state's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, and other officials, all wearing masks.
Police were using drones to assess the damage in Kolkata, a city of 14 million people, where an estimated 10,000 trees were brought down during the storm that lasted several hours and brought extensive flooding.
""The city is still in a state of shock,"" Kolkata's deputy mayor, Atin Ghosh, told Reuters.
""Municipal teams, civil defence personnel, police personnel have been working overtime to restore road connectivity first. But there is an acute shortage of manpower due to coronavirus related restrictions,"" Ghosh said.
""Private buses and trains are still not in service. We really need citizens of Kolkata to come forward and lend a helping hand in whatever way possible.”
Reuters Television footage showed some streets strewn with uprooted trees, while torn power lines lay amid pools of stagnant water. 
At least a dozen people were killed in the city, most of them either electrocuted or crushed by collapsed walls.
""It is complete devastation. First it was COVID-19 that drained our resources and now this,"" Banerjee told a news conference late on Thursday.
It would take several days to get damage reports from remote areas, he said.
BANGLADESH BATTERED
Amphan unleashed torrential rain and storm surges in low-lying coastal areas that burst embankments protecting villages in the Ganges delta. Winds, gusting up to 185 kph (115 mph), wrecked mud walled houses.
Amphan originally started as a super cyclone with wind speeds reaching more than 230 kph, the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane, but it weakened after making landfall into a very severe cyclone as it moved inland through Bangladesh.
Initial estimates from the Bangladesh government put the damage to infrastructure, housing, fisheries and livestock, water resources and agriculture at about 11 billion taka ($130 million).
""Some 1,100 km of road, 200 bridges and 150 km of dams in coastal districts have been damaged,” said Enamur Rahman, junior minister for disaster management and relief.
Crops have been damaged over an area of 176,000 hectares, Agriculture Minister Abdur Razzaque said, while the electricity authority was scrambling to restore power to some 10 million people.
“It has left a trail of destruction,"" said Rahman.

115,By Bloomberg,"<span>May 22, 2020 05:27AM ET</span>",China Dares Trump to Hit Back With Hong Kong Power Grab,"(Bloomberg) -- On the first day of China’s biggest political event of the year, Xi Jinping sent a clear message to Donald Trump: We’re going to do what we want in Hong Kong, and we’re not scared of the consequences.
China confirmed on Friday that it would effectively bypass the city’s legislature to implement national security laws, which have long been resisted by residents who fear they will erode freedoms of speech, assembly and the press. The announcement, which came on the same day China refrained from setting an economic growth target for the first time in decades, triggered immediate calls for fresh protests and sent the MSCI (NYSE:MSCI) Hong Kong index to its worst loss since 2008.
For Xi, the move allows Beijing to reassert dominance over a piece of Chinese territory where his government was rendered impotent during sometimes-violent protests last year. Facing rising unemployment in the mainland due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the potential for a big loss in Hong Kong legislative elections set for September, the Communist Party decided it had more to gain by acting decisively to stem any potential threats.
“Xi feels threatened, the leadership feels threatened -- this is a crisis,” said David Zweig, an emeritus professor at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology and director of Transnational China Consulting Ltd. “This is, ‘We’re not going to give an inch, we’re going to tighten up, and Hong Kong’s national security as a potential subversive center is greater than its economic value.’”
The move risks triggering yet another round of tit-for-tat escalation between the U.S. and China, which have seen ties spiral to their worst in decades since Covid-19 began spreading around the world. From supply chains and visas to cyberspace and Taiwan, the world’s two largest economies are poised for confrontation on a number of fronts as both Xi and Trump seek to win over domestic constituencies looking for someone to blame for a deterioration in living standards.
The unease within the party leadership was on display at the opening of the National People’s Congress in Beijing, where Premier Li Keqiang announced China would abandon its decades-long practice of setting an annual target for economic growth due to “great uncertainty” in the world economy. While rolling out only moderate stimulus, the government nevertheless made clear that stabilizing employment had become the top priority. Defense spending this year was set to grow at the slowest pace since 1991.
“We will strive to keep existing jobs secure, work actively to create new ones, and help unemployed people find work,” Li said.
The shifting away from a hard target for output growth breaks with decades of Communist Party planning habits and is an admission of the deep rupture that the disease has caused. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg see an expansion of just 1.8% this year, the worst performance since the 1970s.
China sought to avoid reviving trade tensions with Trump, who has escalated his rhetoric against Beijing as his poll numbers have fallen in the wake of the pandemic. Li noted that China will work with the U.S. to implement the “phase one” agreement they reached in January, just before the virus sent the economy -- and potentially Trump’s re-election prospects -- into a tailspin.
“The Chinese leadership does not want to be accused of walking away or reneging on the U.S.-China trade agreement,” said James Green, a former State Department official who is now a senior adviser for geopolitical consulting firm McLarty Associates. “If it fails, in their view, the U.S. will have to be the one to pull the trigger and walk away.”
The big question now is how Trump will respond. He has threatened for weeks to abandon from the trade deal, and on Thursday said the U.S. would react “very strongly” if China pushed ahead with the national security legislation in Hong Kong.
Economic Sanctions
Any concrete U.S. action will likely be announced in an assessment of Hong Kong’s autonomy: Secretary of State Michael Pompeo delayed a report earlier this month, seemingly in anticipation of China’s latest move. Under the terms of the United States-Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992, the U.S. agreed to treat the former British colony as fully autonomous for trade and economic matters even after China took control in 1997.
A law passed last year allows the U.S. to either put sanctions on any Chinese officials deemed responsible for undermining the city’s autonomy, or to do something more sweeping like revoke its special trade status. Congress could also do something in between, such as prohibit Hong Kong from importing sensitive U.S. technology with consumer and military applications -- like carbon fiber used to make both golf clubs and missile components.
No matter what, U.S. actions won’t have much impact on how China governs Hong Kong given the recent decisions in Beijing, according to Antony Dapiran, a lawyer based in the city and author of “City on Fire: The Fight for Hong Kong.”
“If Hong Kong is not able to serve effectively as a safe haven insulated from the political risks of doing business in the rest of China, there is no rationale for international businesses to be here,” he said. “They can either go direct to China, or base themselves elsewhere in Asia.”
Trump’s other options for hitting China aren’t great: The economic downturn has made it less likely that Trump will pressure Xi through tariffs, which can increase costs for American businesses and consumers. Instead the U.S. has focused on reducing financial ties with China, taking action that could lead to delisting some Chinese companies from American stock exchanges and moving to restructure supply chains for essential goods.
China is also feeling heat from other countries: Disputes over its handling of the virus has strained ties with Australia and the European Union, while poorer countries who borrowed large sums for infrastructure under Xi’s Belt and Road Initiative are struggling to pay back the cash.
But the biggest risk for Xi is still unemployment at home. With lots of young people out of work on the mainland, the last thing the Communist Party wants is a revival of violent Hong Kong protests, Zweig said.
“They feel at threat, at risk, and therefore they’re doing it,” he said. “Maybe five or six months ago, they were feeling okay. But I think a lot of stuff’s come crashing down.”"

Serge Brammertz said Augustin Bizimana, who was indicted on 13 charges, including genocide, murder and rape, is believed to have died in Pointe Noire, in the Republic of the Congo, in 2000. His remains were identified by DNA testing.
""Bizimana was alleged to be responsible for the murders of former Prime Minister Agathe Uwilingiyimana and 10 Belgian United Nations peacekeepers, and for the murder of Tutsi civilians"" in five Rwandan regions, Brammertz said in a statement.
The announcement of Bizimana's death follows the arrest in Paris last week of Felicien Kabuga, another of a handful of prominent suspects from the Rwandan genocide who had been on the run for more than two decades.
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda conducted 50 trials before closing its doors in 2015. Brammertz is prosecutor of a successor UN court with dual offices in Arusha, Tanzania and The Hague, Netherlands, that continues to function for remaining suspects and appeals.
The statement said prosecutors had conducted DNA analysis ""late last year"" on remains that had earlier been recovered from a grave site in Pointe Noire.
""Subsequent investigations and comparative DNA analysis ... over the last several months ruled out that the remains were those of any other person,"" it said.
Brammertz said his office continues to pursue Protais Mpiranya, the former commander of the Presidential Guard of the Rwandan Armed Forces, and five other Rwandan suspects.

117,By Reuters,"<span>May 22, 2020 04:29AM ET</span>",Beijing may base security agencies in Hong Kong as part of new laws,"By Clare Jim and Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A proposal to impose national security laws in Hong Kong could see mainland intelligence agencies set up bases in the global financial hub, raising fears of direct enforcement by Chinese authorities in the city and the prospect of fresh protests.
The details were unveiled on Friday, a day after Beijing proposed the new controversial national security legislation that critics see as an historical turning point for China's freest city.
Hong Kong activists called on Friday for people to rise up against the proposal, aimed at tackling secession, subversion, terrorism, and foreign interference, that has sent jitters across the business and diplomatic communities.
Foreign diplomats fear establishing new Beijing agencies in the Chinese-ruled city could give mainland security and intelligence officers enforcement powers that could potentially put rights and freedoms at risk. 
Calls have emerged for flash mobs at night across the territory and democracy activists including Joshua Wong plan to meet the press to announce ""street action"" later on Friday.
""This is a great moment to reboot the protest,"" said university student Kay, 24, who participated in last year's mass scale and often violent anti-government and anti-Beijing protests which this year entered a lull due to the coronavirus.
The security law plan hit financial markets on Friday, due to concerns the semi-autonomous city's status as a financial hub was at risk, with Hong Kong stocks selling off as China's parliament sat to discuss the new law.
Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed 5.6% down, the largest daily percentage drop since July 2015.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said her government will ""fully cooperate"" with the Chinese parliament to complete the legislation, which she said will not affect rights, freedoms nor judicial independence.
The proposed legislation could heighten tensions between Beijing and Washington, whose relationship is already frayed by trade disputes and reciprocal accusations over the pandemic.
U.S. President Donald Trump warned Washington would react ""very strongly"" if Beijing went ahead with the security law.
""It is starting to look like a U.S.-China summer of discontent in the making,"" said Stephen Innes, chief global market strategist at AxiCorp.
Innes said the new law could potentially reignite the pro-democracy demonstrations of 2019, the biggest crisis the former British colony has faced since it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
DRAFT PROPOSAL
In his annual report to the Chinese parliament, Premier Li Keqiang said China will establish a ""sound"" legal system and enforcement mechanisms to ensure national security in Hong Kong and Macau, its other semi-autonomous city.
The proposed legislation for Hong Kong requires the territory to quickly finish enacting national security regulations under its mini-constitution, the Basic law, according to a draft seen by Reuters.
The document said the laws will safeguard the central government's ""overall jurisdiction"" as well as Hong Kong's ""high autonomy"".
""When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People's Government will set up agencies,"" in Hong Kong to safeguard national security, the draft said.
Foreign diplomats fear this could formalise and expand the presence of mainland security and intelligence services in Hong Kong. Currently they can take no enforcement action in the city. 
A previous attempt to adopt similar legislation in 2003 was met with a protest that drew around half a million people onto the streets and was eventually shelved.
Pro-democracy activists and politicians have for years opposed the idea of national security laws, arguing they could erode the city's high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" handover agreement, which China says it is undermined by protesters.
""It is essentially declaring directly that 'one country two systems' is null and a failure,"" said Eric Cheung, principal lecturer at Hong Kong University's department of law.
Beijing said the legislation in fact strengthened that principle, was in Hong Kong's interest and will support its development. Lam said Beijing's intention was to tackle illegal activities that had damaged national security.
""THE END OF HONG KONG""
Local pro-democracy lawmakers denounced the plans on Thursday night as ""the end of Hong Kong"".
""Beijing is attempting to silence Hong Kongers’ critical voices with force and fear,"" pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong tweeted. ""Deep down protesters know, we insist not because we are strong, but because we have no other choice."" 
Beijing's move is expected to lead to the flight of capital and talent from Hong Kong, bankers and headhunters said.
""In some cases where clients had a bit of inertia and hoped things that happened last year will just go away, they will now step on the gas to reduce their wealth concentration risk here,"" said a senior banker at a European private bank.

The U.S. State Department warned a high-degree of autonomy and respect for human rights were key to preserving the territory's special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a world financial centre.

BANDUNG, Indonesia (Reuters) - A zoo in Indonesia may slaughter some of its animals to feed others, such as a Sumatran tiger and a Javan leopard, if it runs out of food in coming months after the coronavirus pandemic forced it to shut its doors.
While its 850 animals are being fed smaller portions than usual, the zoo is contemplating a ""worst-case scenario"" of culling some animals to feed others as it expects to run out of food in July.
The Badung zoo in Indonesia's fourth-biggest city, which usually earns about 1.2 billion rupiah ($81,744) a month from visitors, shut on March 23 as part of a wider country lockdown to try to contain the outbreak.
""We have around thirty dotted deer, and we have identified the old and unproductive ones (who can no longer breed) to be slaughtered to save the carnivores, such as the Sumatran tiger and Javan leopard,"" said zoo spokesman Sulhan Syafi'i.
Some birds including geese may also be culled, he said.
Big cats, including a critically endangered Sumatran tiger named Fitri, now get 8 kg (18 lb) of meat every two days, down from 10 kg previously.
The zoo needs more than 400 kg of fruit per day and 120 kg of meat every other day, Syafi'i said, noting it is now relying on donations to keep its animals alive.
""The crocodiles are fatter and the tigers are healthier too. But the lion is still a bit skinny,"" said Fauzan Dzulfikar, who was allowed to visit after a donation.
The smaller daily portions have not gone unnoticed by the animals, even though Syafi'i said they still met minimum animal welfare standards.
Orangutan keeper Aep Saepudin said the endangered primates can go into a rage and throw things. 
""The food is finished, but they still want to eat,"" said Saepudin.

The Indonesia Zoo Association, which has requested help from President Joko Widodo, estimates 92 percent of the country's 60 zoos can only feed their animals until the end of May.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India registered some 6,000 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Friday, the country's biggest jump in 24 hours, as New Delhi eases a nationwide lockdown and airlines prepare to resume some domestic flights. 
The country of 1.3 billion people reported a total of over 118,000 confirmed cases on Friday, a roughly 5% increase from Thursday's figures. Included in the total are 3,583 deaths. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended a lockdown, begun on March 25, to May 31, but relaxed rules in areas with lower numbers of cases and allowed state governments to issue their own guidelines on some matters.
India's airlines will be allowed to resume flights with about a third of operations as of Monday, but only on domestic routes and under rules that are among the strictest in the world.
""This surge in cases has happened after movement of people has been partially allowed. But if you see overall, this is a much lower exponential trajectory as compared to the rest of the world,"" said Giridhar Babu, a professor of epidemiology with the Public Health Foundation of India. 
""The only question now is: How do you reduce mortality? Do we have the capacity? The answer seems to be yes,"" Babu added. 
India's contagion hotspots include the capital New Delhi, financial hub Mumbai, Modi's home state of Gujarat, and the southern state of Tamil Nadu.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China's top leaders took the stage in front of a sea of masked delegates for the opening of parliament on Friday, the culmination of intensive planning at a time when gatherings around the world have been curtailed by the new coronavirus.
President Xi Jinping and other top leaders appeared without masks in front of about 5,000 delegates from parliament, known as the National People's Congress (NPC), and a government advisory body, for the top annual political assembly.
Delegates travelling from across the country had to have multiple coronavirus tests and they have been sequestered in hotels, while media events and speeches have been moved online.
But there was no sign of social distancing at the opening session in the Great Hall of the People with the delegates sitting side by side in rows as usual.
Originally scheduled for early March, the NPC was delayed by more than two months because of a nationwide lockdown to block the spread of the coronavirus. The lockdown remained in place in the capital until late April. 
It is the first time the largely rubber-stamp parliament has been delayed in 25 years and its staging, although late, is a clear show of resolve by the government as it grapples with an economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus.
""From a political perspective, it's important they hold it despite the costs and risks involved because of coronavirus,"" said Graeme Smith, fellow at the Department of Pacific Affairs at the Australian National University. 
""It's a symbol of strength and reassurance to the people but also to the party,"" he said, referring to the ruling Communist Party.
As part of coronavirus checks, attendees had to submit details of their travel and contacts in recent weeks, state media reported. Some also had to spend time in quarantine.
State-media staff were quarantined for seven days and have been told they can only move between their hotel and the media centre during the week-long event.
About 200 delegates from Hong Kong were bussed across to mainland China before taking nucleic acid tests and flying to Beijing, where they had another test. 
In the crowd of delegates gathering early on Friday, some wore face masks decorated to match their ethnic costumes, which are typically worn during the congress.
The few foreign reporters allowed to cover Friday's opening session had to arrive on Thursday afternoon to submit a nucleic acid test, then had to stay in a designated hotel to gain access to the hall off Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) where the congress is held. 
As usual, authorities stepped up city-wide security before the congress, banning large gatherings, boosting the police presence and setting up extra checkpoints throughout the city. 
The congress opens with a speech by the premier outlining goals for the coming year. 
During Friday's address, the shortest in 40 years, Premier Li Keqiang pledged to step up stimulus spending. 
In another break with tradition, the government declined to announce a target for 2020 gross domestic product (GDP) growth for the first time since it began announcing them in 1990. 

The economy contracted by 6.8% in the first quarter as the coronavirus outbreak paralysed production.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made an unusually small number of public appearances in the past two months, once again going three weeks without state media reporting his attendance at a public event, according to analysts.
Kim's low profile comes as North Korea imposes anti-coronavirus measures, although the country says it has no confirmed cases, and follows intense speculation about his health last month after he missed a key anniversary.
Kim has appeared publicly four times in April and so far in May, compared to 27 times in the same period last year. 
Since coming to power in 2011, the previous fewest public appearances Kim has made during those months was 21 in 2017, according to a tally by Chad O'Carroll, CEO of Korea Risk Group, a Seoul-based organisation that tracks North Korea.
""This is not business as normal,"" he said in a post on Twitter this week.
As a leader with near-absolute power over North Korea's 25.5 million people, and access to a growing arsenal of nuclear weapons, Kim's health and whereabouts are often scrutinized by the international community for any signs of instability.
Information in North Korea is tightly controlled, however, and independently confirmed details on Kim are almost non-existent.
South Korean officials have said they believe Kim's limited public appearances may be precautions in the face of coronavirus concerns. North Korea has cancelled, postponed, or toned down many major public gatherings because the new coronavirus.
When asked about Kim's absences, South Korea's Unification Ministry said on Friday it is monitoring the situation, but noted Kim is often out of the public eye.
Citing an unnamed South Korean government official, JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported Kim may be carrying out his duties from a favoured villa in Wonsan, on the coast. 
But the North Korean leader may also simply be focused on some of the domestic economic and political goals he outlined before the coronavirus crisis struck, said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea open source intelligence analyst in the U.S. government.
""COVID does remain a major concern for the country, but state media coverage of COVID has declined over the past month or so, so I don't seen regime's increased concern,"" she said.
Friday marks three weeks since state media last showed images of Kim attending a public event. 
North Korean state media reported Kim attended the opening ceremony of a fertilizer plant on May 1. That appearance marked a reemergence for Kim, whose unprecedented absence from a major holiday on April 15 sparked weeks of international speculation over his health and whereabouts.
Since then, state media has carried a steady stream of stories on Kim sending or receiving letters and diplomatic correspondence, but have not shown him attending public events.

Kim's longest public absence was for 40 days in 2014. South Korea's spy agency later said Kim had undergone a medical procedure on his ankle during that time.

Simon Bridges was replaced by Todd Muller in an emergency caucus meeting of his centre-right National Party following a week of disastrous poll results. 
Just 5% of New Zealanders supported Bridges, 43, as the country's leader in a poll published on Thursday, while support for the Nationals fell to the lowest in decades. The same poll revealed Ardern, 39, enjoyed the support of 63% of the electorate.
Ardern's popularity has shot higher in recent weeks with around 84% of New Zealanders approving of her government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. Another poll showed Ardern had become New Zealand's most popular prime minister in a century and her centre-left Labour Party led coalition would be handed a huge victory at the Sept. 19 election.
Muller, 51, a largely unknown figure at the national level, had not been publicly perceived as a potential leader. Speaking to the media after the party ballot, he emphasised his strong ties to the rural farming community, the backbone of New Zealand's economy. Muller held roles at both dairy giant Fonterra and kiwifruit growers cooperative Zespri.
""I come from New Zealand communities that define this country,"" Muller said. 
""The question sitting in front of all New Zealanders in the next 100 days is who actually has the best plan and the team to deliver it.""
Muller said Ardern was ""impressive"" in her handling of the coronavirus crisis and his focus would be on the country's economic recovery, not criticising the current leader.

Nikki Kaye, 40, was elected as the Nationals' deputy leader, replacing Paula Bennett. Kaye has twice defeated Jacinda Ardern in previous electorate battles.

China describes Taiwan as its most sensitive and important territorial issue, and has never renounced the use of force to bring what it views as a wayward Chinese province under its control.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, speaking in Taipei on Wednesday at the inauguration for her second term in office, said Taiwan cannot accept becoming part of China under its ""one country, two systems"" offer of autonomy, strongly rejecting China's sovereignty claims. 
Li, in his work report at the start of the annual meeting of China's parliament, said his country would ""resolutely oppose and deter any separatist activities seeking Taiwan independence"".
China will improve policies and measures to encourage exchanges and cooperation across the Taiwan Strait, and protect the wellbeing of Taiwan's people, Li added.
""We will encourage them to join us in opposing Taiwan independence and promoting China's reunification. With these efforts, we can surely create a beautiful future for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.""
China translates the word ""tong yi"" as ""reunification"", but it can also be translated as ""unification"", a term in English preferred by many in Taiwan who point out that Beijing's Communist government has never ruled Taiwan, so it cannot be ""reunified"".
Democratic Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.
China has offered to Taiwan the ""one country, two systems"" model, which is supposed to guarantee a high degree of autonomy and which Beijing uses to run the former British colony of Hong Kong.
However, all major Taiwanese parties have rejected it.
Responding to Li's speech, Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said the Taiwanese people were resolutely opposed to the ""one country, two systems"" proposal that ""belittles Taiwan and damages the status quo in the Taiwan Strait"".
On Friday, China proposed new legislation for Hong Kong requiring it to quickly enact national security regulations, a move some see as contradicting the ""one country, two systems"" concept.
China believes Tsai is a separatist bent on Taiwan's independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.

Taiwan has complained of increased Chinese military harassment since coronavirus outbreak began, with fighter jets and naval vessels regularly approaching the island on drills China has described as routine.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday instructed the judge presiding over the criminal case against President Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn to respond to a petition in which Flynn asked the appellate court to toss the charges.
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit gave District Judge Emmet Sullivan 10 days to respond to an emergency petition filed by Flynn's lawyers seeking to force Sullivan to grant a Justice Department request to dismiss the case.
The department, in a major reversal, on May 7 asked Sullivan to drop the charges, drawing accusations from Democrats and retired career prosecutors that Attorney General William Barr was politicizing the U.S. criminal justice system to go light on Trump's friends and associates.
A retired Army lieutenant general who also advised Trump's 2016 presidential campaign, Flynn pleaded guilty in 2017 to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russia's U.S. ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the weeks before Trump took office.
Flynn, charged as part of former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump's candidacy, later sought to withdraw his plea and accused the FBI of tricking him. The department's decision to ask Sullivan to drop the charges followed public pressure from Trump and the Republican president's political allies.
Sullivan last week signaled reluctance to drop the charges, appointing a retired judge to advise whether Flynn should face an additional criminal contempt charge for perjury. Sullivan has scheduled an in-person court hearing in the case for July 16.
Flynn served as national security adviser in the first weeks of Trump's presidency before being fired for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about his dealings with Kislyak.

National Party MPs backed agriculture spokesman Todd Muller to replace Simon Bridges in a caucus vote Friday in Wellington. Muller challenged for the leadership after two disastrous polls this week showed support for National plummeting to as low as 29% from 46% three months ago.
“My focus as leader is our country’s economic recovery and the strengthening of every community throughout New Zealand,” Muller said in a statement. “New Zealanders need a National Government with the experience and management skills to get our country through the worst crisis since the end of the Second World War.”
Muller now faces the daunting task of trying to dethrone Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, whose masterclass in crisis management during the coronavirus pandemic has seen her popularity soar. Support for Ardern’s Labour Party surged to 59% in a 1News/Colmar Brunton poll published yesterday, 30 percentage points ahead of National.
Nikki Kaye was elected National’s deputy leader, replacing Paula Bennett.

Investing.com – China said on Friday that it will not set a numerical target for economic growth in 2020, deviating from years of precedence, due to the impact of the COVID-19 virus.
Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in his annual report to the opening session of the National People’s Congress, “I would like to point out that we have not set a specific target for economic growth this year...This is because our country will face some factors that are difficult to predict in its development due to the great uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and the world economic and trade environment.”
“At present, the epidemic has not yet come to an end, while the tasks we face in promoting development are immense...We must redouble our efforts to minimize the losses resulting from the virus,” he added.
He also called for a sound legal system and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong, suggesting that the session will table a resolution to pass a controversial national security law in the special administrative region.
Meanwhile, in lieu of the economic growth targets, Li will set targets for over 9 million urban jobs and an urban surveyed unemployment rate of around 6%. Approving the budget, increasing the fiscal deficit and issuing more local government debt is also on the agenda for the National People’s Congress opening session.
The failure to set a hard-economic target is an indication of how much economic turmoil COVID-19 has caused the in the world’s second largest economy. With China’s economy contracting by 6.8% in the first quarter of the year, the government will focus its efforts on dealing with rising unemployment, which has reached historic highs, as well as maintaining stability.
The session itself was delayed from its usual March timeframe due to the virus.
Although China was one of the first countries to emerge from global COVID-19 lockdowns, it continues to deal with a second wave of cases in the northeast and a growing number of countries, led by the United States and Australia, calling for an investigation into China’s handling of the virus.
Johns Hopkins University data said that the number of global cases has surpassed 5 million as of May 22."

HONG KONG/BEIJING/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China is set to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong after last year's pro-democracy unrest, a Chinese official said on Thursday, drawing a warning from President Donald Trump that Washington would react ""very strongly"" against the attempt to gain more control over the former British colony.
The U.S. State Department also warned China, saying a high-degree of autonomy and respect for human rights were key to preserving the territory's special status in U.S. law, which has helped it maintain its position as a world financial centre. 
China's action could spark fresh protests in Hong Kong, which enjoys many freedoms not allowed on the mainland, after often violent demonstrations of 2019 plunged the city into its deepest turmoil since it returned to Beijing's rule in 1997.
Trump, who has ratcheted up his anti-China rhetoric as he seeks re-election in November, told reporters ""nobody knows yet"" the details of China's plan. ""If it happens we'll address that issue very strongly,"" he said.
Zhang Yesui, spokesman for the China's National People's Congress, said details of the legislation would be given on Friday when the parliament holds its annual session. 
""In light of the new circumstances and need, the National People's Congress (NPC) is exercising its constitutional power"" to establish a new legal framework and enforcement mechanism to safeguard national security in Hong Kong, he told a briefing.
The ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"" approved by Trump last year requires the State Department to certify at least annually that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify favourable U.S. trading terms.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on May 6 he was delaying this assessment to account for any NPC actions.
If the State Department decertifies the territory, it would still ultimately fall to Trump whether to decide to end some, all, or none of the privileges Hong Kong currently enjoys.
On Thursday, Democratic and Republican U.S. senators said they would introduce legislation to strengthen the Hong Kong act's sanctions provisions.
""A further crackdown from Beijing will only intensify the Senate’s interest in re-examining the U.S.-China relationship,” U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said in a statement.
Wall Street ended lower on Thursday as U.S.-China tensions raised doubts about a trade deal reached this year between the world’s two largest economies. Tensions have heightened significantly in recent weeks, with bitter exchanges over the coronavirus.
Pro-democracy demonstrators have for years opposed the idea of national security laws, arguing they could erode the city's high degree of autonomy, guaranteed under the ""one country, two systems"" formula in place for two decades.
A senior Hong Kong government official said details on the move and its implementation remained unclear, but Hong Kong media have reported the legislation would ban secession, foreign interference, terrorism and all seditious activities aimed at toppling the central government.
U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said any Chinese move to impose legislation that did not reflect the will of the people would be highly destabilising and met with strong condemnation.
Ending Hong Kong's special status would be a big blow for U.S. firms. The State Department says 85,000 U.S. citizens lived in Hong Kong in 2018 and more than 1,300 U.S. companies operate there, including nearly every major U.S. financial firm.
A previous attempt to introduce Hong Kong national security legislation, known as Article 23, in 2003 was met with mass peaceful protests and shelved.
Online posts had urged people in Hong Kong to protest on Thursday night and dozens were seen shouting pro-democracy slogans in a shopping mall as riot police stood nearby.
Opposition lawmakers said the move would gravely wound Hong Kong's reputation as a financial centre and its autonomy.
""If this move takes place, 'one country, two systems' will be officially erased,"" said democratic lawmaker Dennis Kwok. 
“This is the end of Hong Kong.""

Daniel Russel, the top U.S. diplomat for Asia until early in the Trump administration, suggested Chinese President Xi Jinping might see ""muscle-flexing"" on Hong Kong as a means to make up for a series of setbacks, most notably the coronavirus pandemic that began in China - despite the risk of severe economic consequences for Hong Kong, China and others.

129,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>","U.S. to pull out of Open Skies treaty, Trump's latest treaty withdrawal","By Steve Holland and Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States said on Thursday it would withdraw from the 35-nation Open Skies treaty allowing unarmed surveillance flights over member countries, the Trump administration's latest move to pull the country out of a major global treaty.
The administration said Russia had repeatedly violated the pact's terms. Senior officials said the pullout would formally take place in six months, but President Donald Trump held out the possibility that Russia could come into compliance.
""I think we have a very good relationship with Russia. But Russia didn't adhere to the treaty. So until they adhere, we will pull out,"" Trump told reporters.
His decision deepens doubts about whether Washington will seek to extend the 2010 New START accord, which imposes the last remaining limits on U.S. and Russian deployments of strategic nuclear arms to no more than 1,550 each. It expires in February.
Trump has repeatedly called for China to join the United States and Russia in talks on an arms control accord to replace New START. China, estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons, has repeatedly rejected Trump's proposal.
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien told Fox News Channel later on Thursday that he did not expect the United States to leave the New START accord.
NATO allies and other countries like Ukraine had pressed Washington not to leave the Open Skies Treaty, whose unarmed overflights are aimed at bolstering confidence and providing members forewarning of surprise military attacks.
In Moscow, RIA state news agency quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko as saying that Russia had not violated the treaty and nothing prevented the continuation of talks on technical issues that Washington calls violations.
The Open Skies decision followed a six-month review in which officials found multiple instances of Russian refusal to comply with the treaty. 
Last year, the administration pulled the United States out of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia.
A senior administration said U.S. officials had begun talks in recent days with Russian officials about a new round of nuclear arms negotiations to ""begin crafting the next generation of nuclear arms control measures.""
TREATY TOOK EFFECT IN 2002
Trump's arms control negotiator mounted a full-blown defense of the administration's arms control policies, focusing on the president's proposal that China join the United States and Russia on a replacement for New START.
""We know how to win these races and we know how to spend the adversary into oblivion. If we have to, we will, but we sure would like to avoid it,"" Special Presidential Envoy for Arms Control Marshall Billingslea told the Hudson (NYSE:HUD) Institute think tank.
The Open Skies treaty, proposed by U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower in 1955, was signed in 1992 and took effect in 2002. The idea is to let member nations make surveillance flights over each other's countries to build trust.
The officials cited a years-long effort by Russia to violate the terms, such as by restricting U.S. overflights of Russia's neighbor Georgia and the Russian military enclave in Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast.
In addition, they said Russia had been using its own overflights of American and European territory to identify critical U.S. infrastructure for potential attack in time of war.
Some experts worry that a U.S. exit from the treaty, which will halt Russian overflights of the United States, could prompt Moscow's withdrawal, which would end overflights of Russia by the remaining members, weakening European security at a time that Russian-backed separatists are holding parts of Ukraine and Georgia.

Trump's decision to leave the treaty is ""premature and irresponsible,"" said Daryl Kimball, head of the Washington-based Arms Control Association.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - The man who videotaped the slaying of an unarmed black man gunned down as he jogged through a suburban neighborhood in Georgia was arrested on Thursday as the third white suspect accused of murder in the racially charged case.
William ""Roddie"" Bryan, Jr., 50, of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia, was charged with felony murder and attempt to commit false imprisonment of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, in the Feb. 23 shooting death, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said in a statement.
Bryan's attorney Kevin Gough could not immediately be reached for comment on Bryan's arrest.
Bryan has previously come forward as the man who recorded a video of the slaying and turned the footage over to investigators before it emerged on social media and went viral earlier this month. The video shows Aubrey jogging down a two-lane street, then being shot to death as he was confronted by two armed white men who had stopped their pickup truck in his path. 
The footage stoked outrage from civil rights activists already pointing to the case - with no arrests 10 weeks after the fact - as the latest incident of law enforcement in the United States allowing white perpetrators to go unpunished in the unjustified killing of a black man.
Days later, after the GBI intervened, police arrested the two white men seen in the video - former police officer George McMichael, 64, and his son Travis McMichael, 34. Each was charged with aggravated assault and felony murder.
The McMichaels told police they suspected Arbery in a string of neighborhood burglaries when they spotted him running down the street and gave chase in their pickup through the coastal, south Georgia town of Brunswick, seeking to make a citizen's arrest.
Bryan's attorney has said to the media that his client had no relationship to the McMichaels and told police he was a mere bystander to the confrontation.
Arbery's relatives have said they believe Bryan, too, had taken part in the fatal pursuit. Authorities have not explained any circumstances of Bryan's suspected involvement.

The state attorney general is investigating the handling of the case by local prosecutors and police. The U.S. Justice Department is investigating whether there are grounds to bring federal hate-crimes charges.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's attorney general's office said on Thursday it will issue arrest warrants for 10 mayors for alleged acts of corruption during the country's two months of coronavirus lockdown.
In addition, the Andean country's inspector general is moving ahead on 512 disciplinary processes involving 26 provincial governments and 271 mayor's offices.
Corruption is a hot-button political issue in Colombia. Graft costs the country an estimated 5% of its gross domestic product a year, equivalent to about $13 billion, according to the comptroller.
Colombian authorities have discovered cost overruns in purchases of food and hospital equipment as well as tenders given to companies without relevant experience or with political connections, the attorney general's office, comptroller and inspector general said in a joint virtual press conference.
""We are on a crusade to defend Colombians' public resources, which are sacred and by virtue of this crisis are ever more scarce,"" the inspector general, Fernando Carrillo, said, urging citizens to continue to report irregularities.
The inspector general can impose disciplinary sanctions on public officials, while the attorney general's office takes on criminal investigations, and the comptroller is charged with recovering state resources.
Attorney General Francisco Barbosa said his office reviewed some 3,000 contracts for irregularities and found information that led to the issuance of arrest warrants for the 10 mayors.
""We will not allow public resources to be used improperly,"" he said. The mayor of Armenia, located in the coffee region, is among those implicated.
Comptroller Carlos Felipe Cordoba said his office has reviewed 3.1 trillion pesos ($815 million) worth of contracts meant to provide goods or services related to pandemic response. It has detected $110.4 million in cost overruns. The majority of contracts are for hospital and safety equipment, food and service provision, he said.
Twelve provincial governments and 10 municipalities are implicated in the investigations, while the Navy paid double for some 1.7 million units of face masks, Cordoba added.

Average pay advertised for new positions in the sector has risen by just 20 pence ($0.24) to 9.50 pounds per hour since before the U.K.’s coronavirus outbreak, according to data collected by recruitment website Indeed. At the same time, minimum wage for over-25s was increased by 51 pence at the start of April.
Around 40% care posts nationwide pay below the Real Living Wage -- an amount calculated each year based on the cost of living -- and in London that climbs to almost 70%, the analysis shows.
New job openings have plunged by half amid restrictions on businesses to slow the spread of coronavirus that have seen 8.5 job furloughed and jobless benefit claims spike to the most on record -- something that looks likely to depress wages for those still in work.
Yet the acute pressures of caring for the sick and elderly during the outbreak means new social care adverts have fallen by less than half of that. The phrase “care assistant” more than doubled to over 10% of searches of CVs on the website’s database last month, but jobseekers themselves were more interested in exploring driving and agriculture roles.
Pessimism about the labor market and state of the U.K. economy helped drive consumer confidence back down in May, according to a separate report from GfK.
“Consumer confidence remains battered and bruised despite efforts at loosening the Covid-19 restrictions,” said GfK Client Strategy Director Joe Staton. “With unemployment claims rising by the highest rate on record and warnings of a severe recession and possible tax hikes, the damage done by the coronavirus pandemic to the U.K. economic landscape has been laid bare.”

The shooter, who was not identified by law enforcement, opened fire at Naval Air Station Corpus Christi around 6:15 a.m. CDT (1115 GMT), the Navy Office of Information said in a written statement.
""We have determined that the incident this morning at the Naval Air Station Corpus Christi is terrorism related,"" FBI agent Leah Greeves said. ""We are working diligently with our state, local and federal partners on this investigation, which is fluid and evolving.""
Greaves said the gunman had been slain at the scene of the shooting, which was still being processed by authorities. A lockdown of the base had been lifted.
""We may have a potential second related person of interest at large in the community, but would encourage the public to remain calm. If you see something, say something,"" she said.
In a separate statement, the U.S. Department of Justice said it was working with the FBI along with state and local agencies in the investigation and would analyze ""electronic media found at the scene.""
The Justice Department did not elaborate on the nature of that electronic media.
The sailor who was wounded in the attack, a member of the base security force, was in good condition and had been released from a hospital, the Navy said.
Late last year, a Saudi gunman killed three U.S. sailors in an attack at the Pensacola Naval Air Station in Florida, just days after a U.S. sailor shot three civilians at the historic Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii, killing two of them before taking his own life.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - China does not appear to understand that Canada's judiciary is independent, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday, taking a rare public swipe at Beijing at a time when bilateral ties are poor.
China says Canada must free Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who is fighting extradition to the United States. She was arrested in the province of British Columbia in December 2018.
Canadian officials have repeatedly said they cannot intervene in the case.
""Canada has an independent judicial system that functions without interference or override by politicians,"" Trudeau told a daily briefing.
""China doesn't work quite the same way and (doesn't) seem to understand that we do have an independent judiciary.""
Later in the day, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he was ""very concerned"" by Chinese plans to impose new national security legislation on Hong Kong, home to around 300,000 Canadian citizens.
""Canada ... will make its voice heard,"" he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
The United States says it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country.
A decision on a key legal aspect of the trial over whether Meng can be extradited will be announced next Wednesday, the British Columbia Supreme Court said on Thursday.
Shortly after Meng's arrest, Chinese authorities detained two Canadian men in China on state security charges. Beijing also blocked imports of Canadian canola seed.
Trudeau said last month that China had suspended consular visits, citing the coronavirus outbreak.
""The fact that China is still linking an independent judicial system in the case of Meng Wanzhou with the arbitrary detention of two Canadians is saddening, but that's a challenge we've been working with for many months,"" he said on Thursday.

Governor Gretchen Whitmer said U.S. President Donald Trump had pledged federal support after days of heavy rain caused the Tittabawassee River to overflow its banks and breach the Edenville and Sanford dams in central Michigan this week.
""This is unlike everything we've seen before. The damage is truly devastating,"" Whitmer told a news conference.
Around 11,000 people in Midland County were evacuated as floodwaters lapped around heavy buildings and submerged parts of roads and bridges. No deaths have been reported.
National Weather Service meteorologist Ian Lee said floodwaters had begun receding but would linger into the weekend.
Forecasters said rain was unlikely for the next seven days.
Mark Bone, 53, a business owner and county commissioner in Midland, said: ""Everyone is really pulling together, helping each other. We're in the Midwest, we take care of each other,"" he told Reuters in a phone interview.
Although the flooding didn't hit the worst predicted levels, it was still too dangerous for people to return home even if just to check their properties for damage, as the waters have yet to substantially recede, Bone said.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) directed Boyce Hydro LLC, which owns the dams, to establish an independent investigative team to probe the root cause of the breaches. FERC is sending teams to both dams to assist in an investigation. The agency in 2018 revoked the hydropower-generating license for the Edenville structure, accusing its operators of deficiencies.
Boyce said in media statements that it had been in conflict with federal and local authorities in recent years over how much water the dams should release and the levels of a nearby lake. 
The company also said that since temporarily losing its license in 2018, it was unable to deploy funds to make improvements to the dams, and was not given additional resources by FERC and the local community.

Chemical giant Dow Chemical, which is headquartered in Midland and operates a 1,900-acre (770-hectare) plant, said on Thursday it was working with state and federal agencies to assess damage, including inspections at the hazardous waste site.

Makhlouf, the cousin of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and one of the country's richest men, had his assets ordered seized this week. 
The government says Syriatel owes 134 billion pounds, around $77 million at the current exchange rate on the parallel market.
Makhlouf has addressed the dispute in three video messages in which he has appealed to Assad himself to help save his firm. In his last appearance Makhlouf said he had been told to quit as the head of Syriatel.
Once at the heart of Assad's inner circle, Makhlouf has called the asset seizure illegal and an attempt by the government to take the company from him. The unprecedented public tussle has uncovered a rare rift in Syria's ruling elite.
The court order said the travel ban comes after a request made by the ministry of telecommunications and would be dropped if Makhlouf paid the arrears, without specifying the amount.

Jasima Bibi and Saeeda Bibi, sisters aged 16 and 18, were murdered on May 14 in the former tribal district of North Waziristan in Pakistan's conservative northwest province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in what police say was an “honor killing” after their relatives saw the video online.
“The main suspect has confessed to the murder during investigations and now we will produce him before a judge,” a senior provincial police official, Abdul Ghafoor Afridi, told Reuters.
The suspect is the girls' first cousin. 
Police had earlier arrested the man seen in the video kissing the girls, along with another man whose cellphone was used to make the video, and who police say is the one who uploaded it on social media. 
The girls’ father and uncle had been arrested on suspicion of concealing the murder.
Police said the girls’ relatives did not want to bring charges so the state became the complainant in the case.
Thousands of incidents of violence against women perceived to have “damaged” family honour are reported in Pakistan each year and many more go unreported, rights groups say. 
In addition to murder charges, police are also using laws specifically meant to curb ""honour killings"" introduced in 2016, according to a charge sheet seen by Reuters.
Suspects often escape punishment because they are related to the victims, and use a loophole in the law allowing the dropping of charges if two parties come to an agreement over the killing.
In 2016, Pakistan amended its laws in a bid to close that loophole and allow prosecutors to seek life in prison for those suspected of an “honour killing”.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has disrupted in-person education and student life, leaving U.S. colleges and universities scrambling to make plans for the fall semester and beyond. 
As part of our weekly #AskReuters Twitter chat series, Reuters gathered a group of experts to discuss what is next for higher education. Below, they share their views on what changes colleges will need to make to succeed in the ""new normal.""
    
“Colleges need to get creative with their learning methods. For example: larger areas with extra space for classes, revised meal accommodations and flexible arrangements for living. It's actually somewhat exciting for the creative minds out there and brings the opportunity for campuses to show how they are unique by stepping outside of what we think of as the ‘traditional’ college learning environment. I think the crisis has really shined a light on campuses who need tuition dollars to keep the lights on. I expect we will see more consolidation and actual closures as a result of COVID-19.” 
 — Melissa Bassett, business lead for private student loans at Social Finance Inc. (SoFi), a student online lending company 
    
“1. Cut necessary costs, facilities, and ancillary programs or entertainment. 2. Enrich online learning. 3. Offer degree programs that are more flexible and tailored for distance learning. 4. Reduce tuition, but increase enrollment.” 
— Janet Alvarez, executive editor at Wise Bread, a personal finance website 
    
“Building community through social distancing will be key to ensuring a robust social and academic experience. Focusing on equity in the process is especially important. How are we bringing everyone into the conversation? How does remote teaching bias some student voices over others and how can we mitigate that?""
— Dana Mortenson, CEO of World Savvy, a global education initiative 
    
“Meet students where they are, put more effort into building sustainable remote learning environments for both students and faculty. Remove the addiction to student loans.” 
— Austen Allred, CEO at Lambda School, an online computer science bootcamp 
    
“As colleges brace for massive financial strain, they’ll need to find new ways to reduce costs without sacrificing quality. Leveraging technology to support operational efficiency and student engagement will be critical to institutional sustainability.” 
— RedShelf, a digital textbook company
    
“Colleges will need to consider scaled pricing based on in-person vs. online education, as students probably won’t want to pay the same prices for online education. Schools might also need to adapt dorm life to accommodate socially distancing, as well as plan for sudden changes or another shutdown.” 
— Rebecca Safier, student loan counselor and writer with Student Loan Hero, a student loan advice website
    
“Colleges are going to have to figure out how to build affinity among students who are no longer in physical proximity. We think we’ll see innovation in building online students cohorts.” 
— Megan O'Connor, entrepreneur in residence at Kaplan, a test preparation company 
    
“Colleges need to meet the unique needs of students taking online classes for the first time. Out of the box idea: offering set class times for students needing structure vs. task/completion date courses for students who need to work while going to school.”

143,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>","A U.S. Memorial Day weekend like no other, with parties and biker rallies on hold","By Nathan Layne
(Reuters) - Tom McNamara had planned to ride his 2013 Harley Road Glide Ultra motorcycle through the heart of Washington on Sunday, joining hundreds of thousands of bikers in a Memorial Day weekend rally in the nation's capital to raise awareness of U.S. veterans. 
But, like the rest of the United States, the coronavirus pandemic upended McNamara's plans for the weekend that traditionally marks the start of summer, forcing him to cancel the event and come up with a safer alternative.
Even with all 50 states taking steps to reopen their economies, this Memorial Day weekend will not resemble any in decades. In many places, beaches and parks will be open, but groups will asked to stay six feet apart; restaurants will only be serving customers outside; and bars will be closed in what is customarily one of the year's biggest drinking weekends.
""A Memorial Day party would be great,"" said Michael Williamson of the Michigan State University Black Alumni, who is organizing an online kickoff party for his local chapter on Friday night. ""Bars and clubs aren't open right now, so we are doing everything virtual."" 
Motorcycle rallies are a staple of the weekend. AMVETS, a veterans group, had been expecting up to half a million bikers at its Rolling to Remember rally in Washington. But it canceled the event, asking local chapters to instead organize 22-mile (35-km) rides to spotlight the estimated 22 veterans who die by suicide each day. 
""This is something that is far beyond our control. We are disappointed, but we are not letting it go,"" said Tom McNamara, AMVETS' National Riders president and one of the event's lead organizers.
Memorial Day, which falls on Monday, was established to honor and mourn American military personnel who died while serving. 
The holiday weekend comes at a time of unprecedented economic and social upheaval. Over 93,000 Americans have died from the virus, and more than 38 million Americans have filed for unemployment claims since the lockdowns began in March.
A large swath of the country is expected to spend the weekend at home, in contrast with last year's Memorial Day weekend when an estimated 43 million traveled, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).
AAA is not issuing a travel forecast for this weekend, citing uncertainties due to the virus. Online travel company Tripadvisor Inc says it expects activity to vary by state, depending on how far each has relaxed social distancing rules. 
New York, New Jersey and Delaware are opening their shorelines this weekend, although with various restrictions, including a swimming ban at New York City beaches. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he expected a 50 percent capacity limit to be reached by 10 a.m. due to pent-up demand. 
""It's Memorial Day weekend. People want to get out of their homes,"" he told a daily coronavirus briefing on Thursday.
The northern New Mexico town of Red River will have an unusually quiet holiday weekend after canceling a motorcycle rally that had been expected to draw 20,000 riders and had been a reliable source of revenue for 37 years.
Red River's tourism director, April Ralph, said the town had brought in portable toilets and set up picnic benches anyway. She said it expects visitors from Texas escaping the heat and that some bikers would come to tour a scenic byway called the Enchanted Circle and pay homage at a Vietnam War memorial, rally or not. 
Since bars are closed, Ralph was not anticipating trouble getting visitors to follow social distancing guidelines. She said she has a stunt group known as the Busted Knuckles already booked for next year, when she hopes the virus will be under control.

""People are getting antsy to move and get out,"" Ralph said. ""We are hoping that next year will be a whole different ball game.""

GUATEMALA CITY/SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Strict coronavirus lockdowns in Guatemala and El Salvador have so battered local economies that hundreds of families are flying white flags outside their homes or waving them in the street: not in surrender, but to seek food and assistance.
After 50 days of lockdown that has snuffed out their livelihoods, Ana Orellana and three neighbors put up a white flag and a sign asking for food on the graffiti-scrawled concrete boarding house they share in central San Salvador, the capital of El Salvador.
Orellana, a street vendor of coffee, said that since the government ordered people to stay home in March, she has had no income to pay for food or the $75 monthly rent on the room she inhabits alone in the building. Now she takes turns with her neighbors to scavenge throwaway food at a city market.
""I go looking through the bins where the rubbish is,"" the 51-year-old said. ""I go to the Tiendona market to get stuff, because we really don't have tomatoes or onions now, and we make a tomato stew here without oil, just parboiled.""
Alongside the white flag is a misspelled sign over a boarded up window saying ""we were not beneficiaries"" to signal they did not receive a $300 voucher issued in March by President Nayib Bukele to 1.5 million poor families, about three-quarters of the population.
The bleak outlook for Orellana and her companions extends deep into Central America and much of Latin America, where the pandemic threatens to worsen chronic poverty among the millions of people who live hand-to-mouth.
Food protests have broken out in countries including Venezuela and Chile. El Salvador and neighboring Guatemala, two of the poorest countries in the Americas, have borne some of the strictest quarantine measures.
In towns and villages across the two countries, hundreds of signs have gone up asking for food, and people have taken to the streets to wave white flags in distress.
Food parcels from the national government and donations from ordinary people have helped to alleviate some of the want, but resources are stretched.
""We're worried about the virus and food, because if the virus doesn't kill us, hunger will,"" said Jose Rodriguez, 69, a street vendor who lives in another San Salvador boarding house with 100 other people. ""We desperately need things to eat.""
Guatemala's government says it has delivered nearly 190,000 food boxes to over 1.2 million people, about 7% of the population. In El Salvador, security forces began handing out 1.7 million bags of food to the poor on Sunday.
COLOR CODING
After Guatemala's government erected the first sanitary cordon around the impoverished municipality of Patzun on April 5 to contain the virus, hundreds of cut-off residents began putting up rags and white cloths in a call for help.
Pictures of the houses festooned with white signs began to circulate on social media, and the phenomenon soon spread to other parts of Guatemala, and eventually, El Salvador.
Micaela Ventura, a 24-year-old shoe seller in Guatemala City, started using a flag about six weeks ago.
""We put it out because we need food,"" she said, ""because we have nothing to give our children, and can't pay for our room.""
A color coding system has developed in Guatemala. Red flags indicate medicines are needed, black alert the police to violence, and yellow ones to attacks on children.
Guatemala has reported 45 deaths and 2,265 infections from the virus, while El Salvador has confirmed 32 fatalities and 1,640 cases. Neighboring Honduras, where the poor have also gone out to beg for food, has registered 3,100 cases and 151 deaths.
Traditionally, those who see no future for themselves in the three countries, which have long been plagued by violence, have emigrated to the United States by any means possible.
Maria Jauria, a 21-year-old housewife and mother of two living in the central Guatemalan department of Chimaltenango, said there was so little work that her bricklayer husband has had to start selling the very things he needs for his job.

""We've been going out with the white flags for a month, and yes, some people have helped us out with food,"" she said. ""But the truth is, my husband has been selling his tools so we have something to eat.""

145,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 01:00PM ET</span>",Threat to hit Turkey in Libya underscores risk of escalation,"ANKARA/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Turkey warned on Thursday against any attacks on its interests in Libya by Khalifa Haftar's forces after his Libyan National Army (LNA) threatened to respond to recent military setbacks by striking Turkish positions in the country.
""In the event Turkish interests in Libya are targeted, this will have very grave consequences,"" said Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy. 
The LNA's air force chief Saqer al-Jaroushi said in a video posted overnight on social media that ""all Turkish positions and interests in all occupied cities will be targeted,"" in what he said would be the biggest air operation in Libyan history. 
The threat points to the growing risks of a wider escalation in Libya, where Turkey backs the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in a conflict against the LNA, backed by Russia, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt. 
Turkish support has this week helped the GNA take an important airbase near Tripoli, gain control over towns in the west and destroy several Russian-supplied air defence systems. 
It has raised questions over the LNA's ability to sustain Haftar's year long assault to capture Tripoli without a new injection of support from his external backers, analysts say. 
On Thursday, the GNA and local residents said its forces had taken control of Asaba, a small town whose capture could put more pressure on the most important LNA stronghold left near Tripoli, the town of Tarhouna. 
An LNA military source denied the town had been captured, saying fighting there continued. The LNA had also said on Wednesday it was pulling back from frontlines in Tripoli, but its forces withdrew only in some places leaving most of its positions intact. 
Years of conflict have already wrought destruction upon much of the country, and Haftar's year-long assault to capture Tripoli has resulted in months of often intense bombardment of residential areas in the capital. 
On Tuesday, the acting U.N. envoy Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) warned that the ""massive influx of weaponry, equipment and mercenaries to the two sides"" would ""intensify, broaden and deepen"" the conflict. 
In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry said Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu and his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov had spoken by phone on Thursday to back an immediate ceasefire and the resumption of the political process.
Peace making efforts in Libya have made little progress and the United Nations special envoy Ghassan Salame resigned in March, with no agreement yet on a successor. 
The conflict has hampered efforts by both the GNA and a rival administration based in Benghazi that governs areas held by the LNA to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and medical facilities have repeatedly been hit by shelling.

Both the GNA and the Benghazi administration also face financial difficulties, with a blockade of oil exports by eastern-based forces preventing energy sales since January.

""This final agreement will reflect Sudan's agreement to pay. It would include compensation in connection with claims relating also to non U.S. nationals killed and injured in the embassy bombings,"" Tibor Nagy, assistant secretary for African Affairs, told a teleconference. 
His comments come days after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the African nation cannot avoid punitive damages in lawsuits accusing it of complicity in the 1998 al Qaeda bombings that killed 224 people.
The ruling reinstates about $826 million out of a total $4.3 billion in punitive damages, said Christopher Curran, a lawyer representing Sudan.
Nagy did not mention a specific amount for the compensations but said those details were being worked out. ""We have discussed obviously numbers with the parties involved, but in no way can we make those public yet,"" he added.
The issue is a key component of efforts between the United States and Sudan to normalize relations after decades of antagonism. Both countries pledged to improve ties after the fall of veteran Islamist ruler Omar al-Bashir in an uprising a year ago. 
Earlier this month, Sudan has appointed its first ambassador to the United States for almost a quarter of a century. In December, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the two countries would exchange ambassadors.
The U.S. ambassador would be nominated by President Donald Trump and needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.

148,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Hundreds killed in South Sudan tribal clashes: ICRC,"By Denis Dumo
JUBA (Reuters) - Hundreds of civilians, including three aid workers, were killed in a series of tribal clashes in villages in South Sudan's vast Jonglei state, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Thursday.
The territory of South Sudan has been plagued for decades by ethnic clashes over cattle and land, as well as blood feuds. But violence has risen in recent months after the government in February designated ten new states, including Jonglei, but failed to agree on governor appointments, creating a power vacuum. 
Fighting between Lou Nuer and Murle groups broke out on Saturday in and around the town of Pieri, leaving hundreds injured and thousands displaced. 
Aid group Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said in a statement on Tuesday it had lost a South Sudanese staff member and two others were injured in the clashes. A South Sudan Red Cross volunteer was also killed. 
ICRC warned that COVID-19 restrictions have made it more difficult to evacuate wounded by air and to provide surgical care for trauma injuries. They said more lives will be lost if violence keeps escalating. 
South Sudan's five-year civil war erupted soon after the country's formation in 2011 and created the worst refugee crisis in Africa since the Rwandan genocide.
""If we see the same level of violence that we saw in 2019 we can expect a greater loss of life and deeper suffering as COVID-19 hampers our ability to respond,"" said James Reynolds, the ICRC's head of delegation in South Sudan. 
The U.N. peacekeeping mission in South Sudan, which is currently investigating the clashes, condemned the violence and urged the government to find a deal over the appointment of governors. 
""We strongly urge the Government and other parties to compromise and agree on these critical positions so the states can take measures to prevent conflict, build peace, and assist with the COVID-19 response,” said David Shearer, head of the UN Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS).

Scotland, which has a semi-autonomous government with responsibility for health and education, is diverging from its much more populous southern neighbour England, where schools are due to start re-opening from June 1.
""In reopening Scotland’s schools, our overriding priority is ensuring the health and wellbeing of our pupils and staff and giving parents the confidence schools are safe,"" Deputy First Minister John Swinney said.
""This is not, however, a return to schooling as we knew it. Schools are not returning to normal at this stage,"" he said.
Smaller class sizes would allow schools to better implement physical distancing measures such as moving seats further apart and staggering arrivals, breaks and departures, the government said. 
Where possible, libraries, community halls, leisure centres and conference venues will be used to give schools extra space.
Teachers and other school staff will return in June to prepare for the new way of operating. Time spent in school will increase further as soon as it is safe for that to happen, the government said.

Kyaw Win Thant, 31, was arrested on Tuesday after angry scenes at a monastery in the central city of Meiktila, where he apologised to monks for deriding them in Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts. His attacks stemmed from comments posted by numerous other monks denouncing the government's proposal. 
Footage shared widely on social media showed hundreds of people who had come to the monastery denouncing Kyaw Win Thant and chanting ""arrest him, or kill us"". 
Several sources, including two officials from the Ministry of Religion, confirmed on Thursday that Kyaw Win Thant had been charged with insulting a religion or religious beliefs. He faces up to two years in prison if found guilty. 
His Facebook posts, which have since been deleted and could not be verified by Reuters, used language deemed offensive to monks and questioned whether they were in a position to pass judgement on sex education.
The issue has been a hot topic on social media but remains taboo in the conservative, mainly Buddhist country where monks have long been an influential source of moral guidance.
Sex education has broad support from women's groups, activists and among the younger generation but is largely opposed by nationalists, conservatives and many parents. 
U Warama, a Meiktila-based spokesman of the State Sangkha Maha Nayaka, a body of high-ranking Buddhist monks, said the monks had no opinion.
""We had never said whether we agree or do not agree on the new curriculum. It is not monks' business,"" he said.
Win Tun, a former politician and vocal supporter of nationalist groups, said there could be trouble ahead if the doctor went unpunished, and said sex education was unacceptable.

JERUSALEM/GAZA (Reuters) - The Palestinians have suspended contacts with the CIA after announcing an end to security coordination with Israel and the United States in protest at Israeli proposals to annex territory in the West Bank, a Palestinian official said on Thursday.
Saeb Erekat, Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization, said Washington had been told of the move after Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Tuesday his administration was no longer committed to agreements with Israel and the United States, including on security coordination.
On cooperation with the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Erekat told reporters in a video call: ""It stopped as of the end of the (Palestinian) president’s speech.""
Intelligence cooperation with the CIA continued even after the Palestinians began boycotting U.S. peace efforts led by President Donald Trump in 2017, with the sides working together on heading off violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority is based. 
Abbas has threatened before to end security ties, without following through. Israeli officials say he needs Israel's support in the face of domestic challenges from the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas.
But Erekat said: ""Things change and we have decided it is time now to change.""
""Security cooperation with the United States is no more. Security coordination with Israel is no more,"" said Erekat. ""We are going to maintain public order and the rule of law, alone.""
The U.S. embassy in Jerusalem declined comment.
Palestinians worry that Israel, with the blessing of Washington, could carry out pledges to apply Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, which they see as annexation.
Palestinians seek statehood in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as their capital.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India said on Thursday that Chinese troops had stood in the way of regular Indian patrols along their disputed border in flare-ups at two locations this month and called for stability on the front line.
The two countries have in recent years taken steps to build confidence between their militaries while expanding commercial ties. But the border remains an unresolved issue over which they went to war in 1962 and tensions erupt sometimes.
Troops briefly skirmished nearly the eastern Indian state of Sikkim earlier this month and have also been locked in a weeks-long face-off in the Galwan region in the western Himalayas.
Indian soldiers had stuck to their side of the Line of Actual Control that divides the two armies, foreign ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said, blaming China for the latest row. 
""All Indian activities are entirely on the Indian side of the LAC. In fact, it is Chinese side that has recently undertaken activity hindering India’s normal patrolling patterns,"" he said in a statement. 
China has not commented directly on the heightened tensions along the mountain border, but it noted that its troops have consistently maintained peace and tranquillity in the area.
But the state-controlled Global Times said Indian troops had been trespassing on Chinese territory and even trying to erect illegal defence facilities since the beginning of May. China has bolstered border controls in response to Indian provocations in the Galwan Valley, it said. 
Neither side has provided details of the latest border row. Indian media reports say both sides have deployed additional troops in the Galwan sector.
Foreign ministry spokesman Srivastava said India was committed to resolving border disputes through talks.
""The two sides have established mechanisms to resolve such situations peacefully through dialogue. Both sides remain engaged with each other to address any immediate issues.""

A series of shutdowns which started on Feb. 29 left many unable to cross to the other side of the island for work, tuition or medical reasons. [L8N2CN60O]
Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades, the island's Greek Cypriot leader, and Turkish Cypriot leader Mustafa Akinci discussed the matter by phone on Thursday, government spokesman Kyriakos Koushos said.
There was a 'common understanding' that car crossings would open for individuals working and requiring medical attention on the Greek Cypriot side of the island, in addition to crossings currently allowed for humanitarian reasons, Koushos said in a written statement.
Turkish Cypriot students at educational institutions on the Greek Cypriot side would also be bussed over, he said.
Cyprus was split in a Turkish invasion in 1974 following a brief Greek-inspired coup. There are a number of crossings along a United Nations controlled ceasefire line which bisects the island from east to west. Those crossings started opening from 2003, after years of absolute segregation on the island.

Northern Cyprus, a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state recognised only by Ankara, has not reported any COVID-19 cases since late April, while the latest tally for the government-controlled south was 922 cases and 17 deaths.

State media said Navy admiral Nguyen Van Hien, 65, who was found guilty of ""lack of responsibility"", had transferred plots totalling 7,300 sq metres for 45-49 years for the construction of office buildings.
Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong has presided over a crackdown on corruption that has seen several high-ranking ministers and politicians jailed, including a member of the one-party state's ruling Politburo.
""Hien's activity meant the Navy lost the use of the plots for 49 years, causing losses of nearly 940 billion dong ($40 million) to the state,"" the Ministry of Public Security said.
The military court also sentenced four other military officers to between four and nine years in prison for their involvement in the case. 
Hien, who was deputy defence minister from 2009 to 2016, was stripped of his party credentials in April, according to the Ministry of Public Security.

BETHLEHEM, West Bank/GAZA (Reuters) - Bethlehem is struggling back to life just in time for the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, nearly three months after it became the first town in the West Bank to be sealed off because of a coronavirus outbreak.
Although the Church of the Nativity, the traditional birthplace of Jesus, remains shut, shops are displaying new clothes and sweets to lure customers after 75 days of closures.
The city livened up after the Palestinian Authority on Saturday eased curbs in several cities, including Bethlehem, in preparation for Eid El-Fitr, which is due on Saturday or Sunday and marks the end of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
Shops, businesses and banks were allowed to restart briefly in cities not heavily affected by the infection. 
But to try to limit the mass gatherings normally seen during holidays, the PA said that during the three days of the festival itself a blanket lockdown would be re-imposed on the West Bank.
The announcement confused many residents who had only just begun to enjoy a first taste of greater freedom. Closures will prevent people from celebrating in the usual ways, by holding family feasts, wear new clothes and visit parks.
""People want to celebrate despite corona, despite the existing situation, and despite the suffering,"" Bethlehem resident Khaled Abdel-Moati said. ""I believe this situation is very dangerous."" 
The PA has recorded two deaths and 388 infections. But some believe it over-reacted, causing economic problems. 
""Stores are open, but there are no people inside them,"" said Yasser Jawariesh, from the city of Beit Jala. 
In Gaza, where there have been no confirmed coronavirus cases outside quarantine centres, Hamas officials said a full lockdown was not yet needed. People flocked into markets and shops by the thousand, only a few wearing masks.
Gaza religious officials have announced the gradual re-opening of mosques on May 22, two months after they closed.

The Eid al-Fitr festivities are usually a time of release when people pack the streets and visit families, cafes and restaurants.
But this year, authorities are bringing forward the start of the existing coronavirus curfew by four hours to 5 p.m. and banning all public transport for six days from Sunday as they try to contain the pandemic.
Shoppers, many wearing masks, said celebrations will be much quieter - restrictions had already made it difficult for families to meet for fast-breaking at sunset during Ramadan.
""We will not see our siblings, loved ones and friends,"" said Hoda Mahmoud, 53, standing outside a shop with a bag of biscuits. 
""We used to go out and have fun at cafes, but now we are being careful, taking care of ourselves.""
Egypt confirmed 745 new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, the highest daily increase yet. 
""There is an evening curfew and everyone's errands are now in the morning,"" said Ali Mohamed, a 26-year-old civil engineer. At night, he added, ""we all disappear.""
The timing of Eid al-Fitr depends on the sighting of the moon but it is widely expected to start on Sunday.
Shops, restaurants, parks and beaches will also be closed for the holiday, which has been extended from three to six days under the coronavirus measures.

MADRID (Reuters) - Nearly one in six Spanish children have felt regularly depressed during the coronavirus crisis, with those from poorer backgrounds suffering worse, a charity said on Thursday. 
Spain has had one of the world's strictest lockdowns, including keeping children behind doors for weeks, to curb the outbreak which has killed nearly 28,000 people.
Save the Children said its survey from April showed that while lockdown was enabling many families to enjoy more time together, still 17% of children felt depressed often or daily and new economic hardships were widening inequalities.
In the most needy families, 32.3% of children struggled to sleep while 30.1% feared the COVID-19 disease - almost a third more than in less vulnerable households. Those from poorer backgrounds also cried more, according to the survey of more than 1,800 interviews with children and families.
Save the Children said one out of four vulnerable families have suffered job losses or reduced income, heaping tension and uncertainty on children. In some cases, families have had to share housing with strangers to cut the cost of rent.
""Being isolated in very tiny flats with people who are not part of your family is actually a risk because these families are facing two types of stress. They’ve lost their jobs as they cannot work and they are isolated in very tiny places,"" Andres Conde, head of Save the Children in Spain, told Reuters.
The charity urged authorities to support poor families in covering their basic needs.

The Spanish government has repeatedly said it will not leave anyone behind and is planning to pay a basic monthly income to about a million of the poorest households.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not face criminal action following allegations of misconduct over his relationship with a U.S tech entrepreneur but he might have had an intimate relationship with her, the police watchdog said on Thursday.
The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) launched an investigation last September following a newspaper report that Johnson, when mayor of London, had failed to disclose his personal links to Jennifer Arcuri, who received thousands of pounds in public funding and places on official trade trips.
Johnson denied any wrongdoing, saying everything was done with full propriety and that there was no interest to declare.
The IOPC's Director General Michael Lockwood said there was no evidence to indicate Johnson influenced any payments to Arcuri or influenced her participation in trade missions.
But Lockwood said ""there was evidence to suggest that those officers making decisions about sponsorship monies and attendance on trade missions thought that there was a close relationship between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, and this influenced their decision-making"".
Johnson's spokesman welcomed the fact that ""this politically motivated complaint had been thrown out"", saying it was a waste of police time.
""Such vexatious claims of impropriety in office were untrue and unfounded,"" the spokesman said.
The matter was referred to the watchdog because Johnson was head of the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, a role equivalent to a police commissioner, during his 2008-2016 term as mayor.
The Greater London Authority said it had alerted the IOPC because Innotech, Arcuri’s then company, had received 11,500 pounds ($14,000) from London & Partners, the mayor’s promotional agency, for two events in 2013 and 2014. 
She attended a trade mission to Singapore and Malaysia in 2014 through Playbox, one of her companies, even though an initial application through Innotech had been declined.
Last October, the government's Internal Audit Agency ruled a decision to award a 100,000 pound grant to a company run by Arcuri was appropriate. 
Arcuri gave a number of TV interviews after the allegations came to light, saying she and Johnson had enjoyed a ""very special relationship"", having bonded over classical literature, but said he had never shown her any favouritism.
She repeatedly refused to say whether she had had an affair with Johnson but said he had cast her aside like ""some gremlin"" after the reports surfaced. 
""Our review established there was a close association between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri and there may have been an intimate relationship,"" the IOPC said.
It said it would have been wise for Johnson to have declared this as a conflict of interest and might be a breach of the GLA's Code of Conduct.
The London Assembly said it would continue its investigation into Johnson's conduct.

""My message to the prime minister is that this issue isn’t going away just yet,"" Assembly member Len Duvall said.

The arrest of the 23-year-old Japanese man was first such detention of a foreign citizen, though the country has previously arrested four South Koreans, including two from Seoul, a police station official in the capital's Seodaemun district said.
The man entered the country on May 2 with a work visa and, after a negative coronavirus test at the airport, was ordered to self-quarantine for two weeks as is mandatory for all arrivals.
Police said surveillance video footage and card transactions showed that he had broken the rules on eight out of 14 days, including for visits to restaurants, cafes and a vet.
The Japanese man, who will face a trial, was being held at the police station and would soon be sent to a detention centre, the official added. 
In late March, the country's health ministry warned it would deport foreigners and South Korean citizens could face jail for violating self-quarantine rules after a surge in imported coronavirus cases.
After weeks of nearly no new domestic cases, South Korea relaxed its lockdown on May 6, but a subsequent spike in infections linked to a nightlife neighbourhood in Seoul forced a rapid re-think.
Schools reopened on Wednesday after the beginning of the Spring semester had been postponed several times since March, but the discovery of new cases in two students marred the reopening and forced 75 high schools to send pupils back home.
South Korea has reported a total 11,122 infections so far with 264 deaths.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union must be careful not to become a ""transfer union"" in which richer member states are asked to bankroll their poorer peers, a leading candidate to succeed German Chancellor Angela Merkel told Reuters.
Friedrich Merz, a lawyer and former leader of the parliamentary faction of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), said the EU was walking a ""very fine line"" with financial rescue packages now under discussion.
He was referring to a proposal made by France and Germany for a 500 billion euro ($548 billion) Recovery Fund that would offer grants to EU regions and sectors hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic.
Merz said that when, as a member of the European Parliament and Germany's Bundestag, he had agreed to Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) he promised voters that it would not become a European transfer union. 
""I feel bound by this promise - also in order not to give the opponents of Europe arguments that can be misused in the next federal election campaign,"" he told Reuters in the interview published on Thursday.
Merz's comments highlight the wariness in Merkel's party about the Recovery Fund proposal she has put forward together with French President Emmanuel Macron. The opposition Free Democrats and the Alternative for Germany (AfD), a far-right party, oppose the plan.
Merz welcomed the initiative and said Germany had an interest in a functioning European internal market.
""But the devil is in the detail,"" he added, calling for checks to the proposal for the European Commission to borrow money on behalf of the whole EU, in order to make sure it is compatible with EU law.
""If necessary, the treaty must be amended,"" he said.
The new CDU leader, set to be chosen in December, will be in pole position to run as chancellor in the next federal election due by October 2021, as Merkel has said she will not seek a fifth term.
So far, the top contenders to lead the party are Merz, a former Merkel rival who is popular on the right of the party, and Armin Laschet, the premier of Germany's most populous state. Foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen is an outsider.
Merz also said he was concerned about a setback for Europe's industrial companies during the coronavirus pandemic due to ill-designed rescue policies.
""If Europe is not careful, China and the United States in particular will emerge stronger from the corona crisis,"" he said.
""My great concern is that what happened to Europe's banks after the euro crisis will happen to Europe's industrial companies - that after the crisis they will fall behind the competition from the United States and China,"" he added.

MILAN (Reuters) - Health workers and care providers in northern Italy are outraged by regional budget limits which they say have cut into payments despite a surge in work during the coronavirus emergency.
""When I received the message from Bergamo health services, I started crying,"" said Maura Zucchelli, a partner in Itineris, a private contractor that provides home care support in the area near the Lombardy town of Bergamo. 
""Basically they told us, in the first quarter you've gone over budget so we're not paying you.""
Lombardy regional authorities did not respond to requests for comment.
Under normal budget rules, when private providers exceed a fixed budget, Lombardy authorities reduce funding to 40%. Once the budget excess goes beyond 6%, they stop funding altogether.
Itineris stepped up operations after Lombardy was hit badly by the coronavirus in late February and hospitals were overwhelmed.
Zuchelli said the Bergamo health services calculated Itineris was 8% over budget in the first quarter, and she estimated she could be 21% over budget in April.
""They asked us to do this, they said we had to provide this service,"" she said. ""They said take care of cases locally because there's no room in the hospitals. And now?"" 
Medical staff in the neighbouring Piemonte region protested on Thursday at pay rises of just one euro ($1.10) per shift.
Massimo Sparpaglione, president of the Assedo association comprising private contractors and cooperatives groups in the sector, said others had complained of being penalised financially during the crisis. 
ATS Bergamo, the local health agency, said the budget tariff system that controls payments to contractors was adjusted after March 23, so the first month of the crisis was treated under normal budget rules.

It said no decision had been taken on how to adjust the system for the second quarter.

The European Union's top court ruled last Thursday that four asylum seekers stuck in a transit zone on the Hungarian-Serbian border had effectively been detained and that a local court should release them immediately.
""The Hungarian government disagrees with the ruling, we consider it a risk with regard to European security, but as an EU member state, we will adhere to all court rulings,"" Gergely Gulyas told an online press briefing.
The Court of Justice was reviewing the case of two Afghan and two Iranian nationals who arrived in Hungary from Serbia in late 2018 and early 2019 and applied for asylum from the Hungarian Röszke transit zone on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Gulyas said four people currently in the transit zone would be detained elsewhere, while another 280 people would be moved to a facility for asylum seekers.
Once the transit zones are scrapped, asylum requests can only be submitted at Hungarian embassies and consulates, Gulyas said.

During the peak of the migration crisis in 2015, Orban effectively sealed Hungary's southern border with a fence. Hungary was a transit route for hundreds of thousands of migrants heading through the Balkans to Western Europe.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Outbursts of political anger are rare in Japan. Street protests tend to be tame and some are led by the elderly. Government supporters have swamped online debate at times, and the Shinzo Abe administration has rarely listened to voices of dissent.
But now, the coronanvirus is reshaping how the Japanese talk about politics.
In an unusual outburst of political anger, millions of tweets by hundreds of thousands of netizens have helped force the government to delay a bill extending the retirement age for prosecutors, which critics say threatens judicial independence.
Opposition party lawmakers and others have also said the legislation was aimed at giving a retroactive legal basis to a decision to keep Tokyo prosecutor Hiromu Kurokawa, who is seen as close to Abe, in his post after he reached retirement age.
In a rare about-face, Abe delayed deliberations on the bill on Tuesday citing the ""lack of public understanding,"" and while there were other sources of opposition to the bill, experts say the unusual online anger was a major factor.
""I felt we had the power to raise our voices and it made me wonder why we hadn't done any of this before,"" Fuemi, the Twitter handle of an advertising specialist credited with setting off the campaign against the bill, told Reuters by phone.
Fuemi, a feminist who has more than 13,000 followers, was accused online of being a ""spy"" and ""traitor"" after the campaign. She declined to give her name for fear of harassment.
Fuemi said she was not interested in politics, but the coronavirus lockdown prompted her to listen to parliamentary proceedings more closely. She thought the debates on the bill ""didn't make sense"" and kicked off the hashtag.
Fujio Toriumi, an associate professor of computational social science at the University of Tokyo, said the hashtag associated with the movement was tweeted 4.7 million times within three days by more than 500,000 Twitter accounts.
The campaign against the retirement age of prosecutors has been the strongest of online protests against a number of bills. Experts say these protests have allowed people to vent their frustration against the government as economic uncertainty mounts and the coronavirus epidemic drags on.
""It's not just a protest against the bill, but against the forceful tactics Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sometimes employs,"" said Masaaki Ito, media studies professor at Seikei Gakuen university in Tokyo. 
Public support for Abe has slipped over what critics say is his clumsy handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has tipped the world's third-largest economy into recession.
According to a poll taken last week by the daily Asahi Shimbun, Abe's approval ratings dropped eight points to 33 percent. Close to two-thirds of respondents opposed the retirement age bill.
But Abe has not conceded defeat and his justice minister has said the bill would be debated without any changes later.
""I think the government might try to get the law adopted again, but I don't think I have the power to do another online protest like this,"" Fuemi said.

""I'm just a worker, after all.""

And the 1 NEWS Colmar Brunton Poll showed popularity for Ardern's Labour rose to 59%, a rise of 18 percentage points, which if repeated in the elections would allow the party to govern on its own rather than in coalition.
The Pacific nation was locked down for more than a month and strict social measures enforced by Ardern's government, moves which helped prevent the coronavirus spreading.
Ardern has won global praise for her leadership during the pandemic and her stratospheric rise to become New Zealand's youngest prime minister and third woman to hold the office has been dubbed ""Jacinda-mania"" by some.
As preferred prime minister, 39-year-old Ardern, whose Labour party is now in a coalition with the Greens and the nationalist New Zealand First party, had 63%, while rival opposition National Party leader Simon Bridges polled just 5%. 
Bridges faces a vote at his party's caucus on Friday on whether he will lead it into the election. The National Party, the biggest party in parliament, slumped by 17 percentage points to 29%, its lowest since 2003.
Ardern's rating is the highest in the history of the poll, which is the second this week showing her rising star, after a Newshub-Reid Research poll said she had become New Zealand's most popular prime minister in a century.

Businesses in New Zealand including malls, cinemas, cafes and gyms reopened last week after the rate of new coronavirus cases have slowed dramatically in recent weeks. It has so far infected just over 1,500 people and caused 21 deaths.

171,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 04:30AM ET</span>","China set to implement its first civil code, as private investment slows","By Keith Zhai, Gabriel Crossley and Yew Lun Tian
(Reuters) - China's parliament is poised to enact its first civil code, a wide-ranging legislative package that includes strengthening protection of property rights in a Communist Party-ruled country whose embrace of private ownership has long been awkward.
The civil code, in the works since 2014, will become law at a time when China needs its often-embattled private sector to step up investment to help revive a virus-battered economy, and will be a centrepiece of the annual parliamentary session that begins on Friday after a more-than two month delay.
However, the civil code is largely an amalgamation of existing laws, meaning its impact may be limited, some analysts said. And enforcement is uncertain, as courts are not independent and ultimately answer to the party, although legal reforms in recent years have aimed to give judges more independence and rein in local officials' influence over courts.
The civil code, which among other provisions protects personal information and makes it easier to divorce or sue for sexual harassment, is expected to spell out the clearest boundary yet between government and markets since the 1949 founding of the People's Republic of China. 
It is a cornerstone of President Xi Jinping's push to reform the country's legal system by 2020, even as China has tightened controls on civil society and expanded party control under his leadership.
The legislation - on paper at least - reduces the scope for bureaucratic meddling and abuse that have often bedevilled private firms and property owners in a country where business owners were not allowed to join the Communist Party until 2001 and are still treated with suspicion by some party officials.
""It gives more complete protection to the rights of the individual,"" said Wang Jiangyu, a law professor at the City University of Hong Kong. 
""The bigger context is, is this a country that adheres to the rule of law? Is the government really executing the law?""
BUSINESS INSECURITY
Implementation of the code, which incorporates existing laws including those covering property, contracts and torts, reflects long-running concerns among business owners over protection of personal and property rights.
""All private firms have their 'original sin,'"" Xu Bin, a steel trader in Henan province, told Reuters in March, referring to the sometimes dubious actions taken by entrepreneurs in the early days of China's reform and opening.
Some worry those ""sins"" can still be used against them.
A 2017 survey on the climate for private sector firms by Unirule Institute of Economics, a now-defunct liberal Beijing-based think tank, found companies rated ""legal fairness"" 4 out of 10.
""Without legal protection, private businessmen don't feel safe. Our survey showed that they think there is a 22.5% chance of danger to themselves and a 26.8% chance that their assets are at risk,"" Sheng Hong, an independent scholar who was previously Unirule's executive director, told Reuters.
However, the civil code will not protect entrepreneurs in criminal cases.
""Since the Civil Code only covers civil disputes, it does not help protect property rights against seizure of assets by the state, a most important concern among entrepreneurs,"" said Xin Sun, a lecturer in Chinese and East Asian business at King's College London. 
NEEDED INVESTMENT
Private sector investment in China has slowed sharply, to the worry of officials, from more than 20% growth when Xi assumed power to single digits in recent years. It fell 13% during the coronavirus-battered first four month of this year, compared with a 7 percent decline for state companies.
In an April meeting chaired by Xi, the Communist Party's decision-making Politburo said the government will support the private economy and development of small- and medium-sized firms, which remain excluded from several industries and have long had difficulty securing bank credit. 
""The civil code could restore confidence of private business owners and to help prop up economic growth,"" said Hu Xingdou, a retired economics professor with Beijing Institute of Technology.
Sun, of King's College, isn't so sure, saying the civil code brings little added protection for rights and property, and is more symbol than substance.
""China does have a comprehensive system of high-quality written laws but a lot of concerns arise from their enforcement rather than the laws themselves,"" he said.

The United States, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but is bound by law to provide the democratic island with the means to defend itself. China routinely denounces U.S. arms sales to Taiwan.
The U.S. State Department has approved a possible sale to Taiwan of 18 MK-48 Mod6 Advanced Technology Heavy Weight Torpedoes and related equipment for an estimated cost of $180 million, the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said in a statement on Wednesday.
""The Defense Security Cooperation Agency delivered the required certification notifying Congress of this possible sale today,"" it added.
The proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic, and security interests by supporting Taiwan's ""continuing efforts to modernise its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability"", the agency said.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China had lodged ""solemn representations"" with Washington about the planned sale.
China urged the United States to stop all arms sales to, and military ties with, Taiwan to prevent further damage to Sino-U.S. relations, Zhao added.
The U.S. announcement came on the same day Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen was sworn in for her second term in office, saying she strongly rejecting China's sovereignty claims. China responded that ""reunification"" was inevitable and that it would never tolerate Taiwan's independence.
China has stepped up its military drills near Taiwan since Tsai's re-election, flying fighter jets into the island's air space and sailing warships around Taiwan.

China views Tsai as a separatist bent on formal independence for Taiwan. Tsai says Taiwan is an independent state called the Republic of China, its official name, and does not want to be part of the People's Republic of China governed by Beijing.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian state and territory leaders bickered on Thursday over whether to reopen internal borders, a major step to rejuvenating the country's A$80 billion ($50 billion) domestic tourism industry, as part of measures to ease coronavirus restrictions.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he wants the bulk of all social distancing restrictions removed by July under a three-step plan, as the country continues to report low daily numbers of new COVID-19 infections.
But the implementation of the federal plan is down to the leaders of individual state and territories, who come from opposing political parties and disagree on how safe it is to allow unrestricted movement throughout the country.
New South Wales (NSW) state, the country's most populous, has called for all borders to be opened as a critical step to giving the ailing economy a much needed boost. 
""For Australia to really move forward as a nation during this very difficult economic time as well as difficult health time, we do need our borders down,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told Australian Broadcasting Corp. television.
Domestic tourists spent a record A$80.7 billion last year, according to official government data, almost half of all tourism spending.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said on Wednesday there was no medical reason to keep borders closed, but many smaller states, which have reported very low numbers of infections and few to no deaths, remain reluctant.
""It's odd, New South Wales is saying don't catch public transport in Sydney ... yet they're saying 'why can't New South Wales people fly to Western Australia,"" said Western Australia state Premier Mark McGowan.
South Australia Premier Steven Marshall said maintaining the strict border measures meant easing restrictions on local businesses quicker.
""I promise you we can create thousands more jobs in South Australia by keeping our borders closed at the moment,"" said Marshall.
Queensland state Chief Medical Officer Jeannette Young supported calls to keep borders closed, saying ""one case can cause an enormous setback to our plan to open up our communities.""
Australia's tourism sector was one of the country's hardest hit by social distancing restrictions, including the closure of its international borders to non-residents and a ban of non-essential domestic travel.
Nearly 600,000 people were in April forced out of work by the coronavirus restrictions. Australia's unemployment rate effectively rose to 9.6%. 
In an effort to cushion the ""unprecedented"" blow to the economy, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) slashed interest rates to 0.25% in an emergency meeting in March and launched an unlimited quantitative easing programme.
The government is also splashing out cash, including a A$130 billion wage subsidy scheme, and still the head of the central bank said he could offer no guarantees.
""Despite all these efforts, the future remains unusually uncertain,"" RBA Governor Philip Lowe said during opening remarks in an online panel discussion.
""We might get a vaccine, we might get some anti-viral medication, but it's also possible that we don't. So we have an incredible lot riding on the work of the scientists.""
Secretary to the Australian Treasury Steven Kennedy on Thursday said unemployment will likely rise through the next few months, with a sharp economic rebound now unlikely.
“I’m not predicting a V-shape recovery. But given the nature of the shock – if the government responds well with its fiscal levers, we needn’t have an L-shaped recovery, which is what people would think when it comes to a depression,"" Kennedy told Australian lawmakers in Canberra.
Australia has reported just over 7,000 COVID-19 infections, including 100 deaths, well below figures reported by other developed countries.

""Washington's fruitless and repetitive sanctions against Iranian officials is a sign of weakness, despair and confusion of the U.S. administration,"" state TV quoted Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi as saying. 
The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on several Iranian authorities, including the interior minister, accusing them of engaging in serious cases of human rights abuse.
The U.S. Treasury Department said Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani-Fazli gave orders authorising the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) of Iran to use lethal force in response to anti-government protests in November, leading to the killing of protesters, including at least 23 minors. 
Hundreds of young and working-class Iranians took to the streets on Nov. 15 to protest against the government's decision to increase fuel prices. The protests turned political, with demonstrators burning pictures of senior officials and calling on clerical rulers to step down. 
Iran’s top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, denounced the unrest as a “very dangerous conspiracy” by Iran’s enemies.
An opposition website said in January that at least 631 people were killed during the unrest and London-based Amnesty International said more than 300 people had been killed. 
Both accounts have been dismissed by the Islamic Republic, which has yet to give a death toll. The Iranian judiciary has sentenced dozens of protesters to long terms in prison.

KABUL (Reuters) - The U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan has demanded that all sides reduce violence, he said on Thursday, after shuttling from Kabul to the Gulf to push a peace effort that looks increasingly precarious.
The envoy, Afghan-born Zalmay Khalilzad, the architect of a February agreement with the Taliban clearing the way for a U.S. troop withdrawal, met Taliban leaders in Doha on Wednesday, hours after meeting government leaders in Kabul.
""‪On violence, I told the Talibs, violence by all sides must fall,"" Khalilzad said on Twitter.
Violence has surged in recent days after a bloody militant raid in Kabul, which the Taliban denied responsibility for, triggered an Afghan government order for its forces to go on the offensive.
Clashes have erupted in several parts of the country with dozens killed.
The main element of the Feb. 29 agreement between the United States and the Taliban was the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.
A Taliban ceasefire was not part of the pact though the militants, fighting since their 2001 ouster to expel foreign troops and bring back Islamic rule, promised to enter power-sharing talks with the U.S.-backed government.
But peace efforts have stalled over disagreement on an exchange of prisoners.
Khalilzad said he met Taliban leaders, including political chief Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, and discussed the prisoner release and reducing violence.
Taliban leader Haibatullah Akhundzada on Wednesday released a statement for the Eid al-Fitr holiday calling for progress on peace but also telling his fighters to stay ""focused on their objectives"" and ""consolidate ... ranks"", which government security officials criticised as inciting violence.
Earlier on Wednesday, Khalilzad met Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his former rival Abdullah Abdullah.
Ghani and Abdullah signed an agreement to share power on Sunday, ending a months-long impasse over a disputed election, and raising hopes that the government would now focus on the U.S.-brokered peace process effort.

178,By Reuters,"<span>May 21, 2020 03:11AM ET</span>",Japan's Abe wants to build ventilators that hospitals probably don't need,"By Tim Kelly and Maki Shiraki
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged to build 2,000 new ventilators for coronavirus patients that even the government says hospitals are unlikely to need. 
Instead, the plan, announced in April, appears to be more about bringing home manufacturing of equipment seen as key to the country's national security, a long-held focus for the Japanese premier that has deepened with the coronavirus crisis.
Abe wants Japanese companies to build 2,000 ventilators to add to an unused stock of 4,700 already in hospitals. A further 8,300 are deployed in critical care units, of which only a fraction are used to keep COVID-19 patients alive.
But even the health ministry acknowledges that hospitals, which now buy almost all their ventilators overseas, likely have enough, while industry experts say Japan's small ventilator-makers will struggle to produce more than the few dozen a month they usually build. 
""It is probably more than Japan needs now,"" said Akihisa Maeda, an official at the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labour who is responsible for medical device policy, about the number of ventilators. ""It is true there aren't enough qualified people to operate them."" 
Abe's plan shows how the coronavirus crisis is spurring political concern about the potential vulnerability of overseas supply lines. Japan is also offering firms money to shift production of face masks and other products from China. 
Japan needs to cut dependence on imports from the United States, Europe and China, said the health ministry's Maeda.
""It's a matter of national security. The coronavirus outbreak has shown that.""
Ventilators are used to inflate the fluid-filled lungs of critically ill COVID-19 patients through a tube inserted into the windpipe, and require constant monitoring. 
Yet so far, only around 5% of seriously ill COVID-19 patients in Japan need the procedure known as intubation, a panel of experts has said. In early May there were 4,500 hospitalised cases, meaning roughly 270 were on ventilators. In Japan just under 800 people have died.
""It's like building fighter jets without having pilots,"" a leading intensive care specialist said about the government's plan. Every new ventilator needs health professionals who are in short supply, he said, asking not to be identified.
The Japan Society of Respiratory Care also said there are enough ventilators, barring a major coronavirus surge. 
CATS AND DOGS
Ventilator makers require technicians to ramp up production, but even with additional manpower, they still need to find components overseas amid strong international demand. 
""My first thought was, it's going to be tough to get the parts,"" said Akikazu Endo, sales and marketing manager at ventilator maker Sanko Manufacturing, about the government's plan. 
At its small plant next to a vegetable field an hour by train from Tokyo, Sanko is making coronavirus ventilators with parts from human anaesthesia machines and ventilators designed for cats and dogs. 
It usually hand builds around 30 ventilators a year, and initially proposed to build 300. It later scaled that back to 50. 
Sanko buys electronic boards from China and will have to wait as long as six months for more, Endo said. Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry officials, who visited Sanko, connected it with a Japanese company that can build the same part, but conducting tests will take time and money, he said.
""We can't be in a situation where we run out of ventilators,"" a METI official told Reuters.
Nihon Kohden, which builds 30 ventilators a month, is aiming to manufacture 1,000 within six months. It is still in talks to secure parts, a spokeswoman said. 
'RISKY MARKET'
Given the parts shortage, Abe has asked  Toyota  Motor (NYSE:TM) Corp, Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co,  Sony  Corp (T:6758) and others to help.
Unlike U.S. President Donald Trump, who has invoked Korean War-era laws to compel manufacturers to build some 200,000 ventilators, Abe's more modest 2,000-target faces hurdles because he can't force Japanese companies to cooperate.
""Companies tend to see ventilators and other invasive medical devices as too much of a gamble,"" an official at the Japan Association of Medical Devices Industries said. 
Speaking as head of the Japan auto industry lobby, Toyota president Akio Toyoda said automakers wanted to take a back seat by providing manufacturing know-how, saying it was ""not easy"" to make products that so directly affect human life.
An auto executive told Reuters the industry had other concerns. 
""We are willing to cooperate, but it's a small and risky market,"" the executive said, asking not to be identified.
A Sony (NYSE:SNE) spokesman said it won't be responsible for ventilator design or development. Nissan said nothing had been decided.
The health ministry's Maeda said there's no deadline for Japan Inc to deliver.

""Our aim is to achieve a balance between imports and those made locally.""

Writing in the Washington Post, Hassan Diab also warned of a global food security emergency triggered by the pandemic. He said attempts to restrict food exports must be resisted and called on the United States and the European Union to set up an emergency fund to help the Middle East avoid a severe crisis.
Otherwise, ""starvation may spark a new migration flow to Europe and further destabilize the region"", he wrote.
Lebanon was in deep crisis even before COVID-19. The local currency has more than halved in value since October amid a hard currency liquidity shortage. Inflation and unemployment are soaring. Lebanon defaulted on its sovereign debt in March.
Imported food prices had more than doubled since the start of 2020, Diab wrote. More than half of Lebanon's food is imported. 
""Once the breadbasket of the Eastern Mediterranean, Lebanon is facing a dramatic challenge that seemed unimaginable a decade ago: the risk of a major food crisis,"" Diab wrote.
""A few weeks ago, Lebanon witnessed its first 'hunger protests.' Many Lebanese have already stopped buying meat, fruits and vegetables, and may soon find it difficult to afford even bread."" 
Diab, who took office this year with backing from the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its allies, also blamed decades of political mismanagement and corruption for a lack of investment in agriculture.
COVID-19 and lockdowns had ""dramatically worsened the economic crisis and profoundly disrupted the food supply chain"".

Eighty percent of Lebanon's wheat had been coming from Ukraine and Russia, but last month, Russia suspended wheat exports, while Ukraine is considering a similar move, he said.

KOLKATA/DHAKA (Reuters) - Rescue teams searched for survivors in eastern India and Bangladesh a day after the most powerful cyclone in over a decade devastated coastal villages, destroying mud houses, ripping out electricity poles and washing away bridges.
The full extent of the casualties and damage to property inflicted by Cyclone Amphan would only be known once communications were restored, officials said, but at least a dozen people died in the Indian state of West Bengal and eight in neighbouring Bangladesh.
Most deaths were caused by trees uprooted by winds that gusted up to 185 km per hour (115 mph), and a storm surge of around five metres that inundated low-lying coastal areas when the cyclone barrelled in from the Bay of Bengal on Wednesday.
""I have never seen such a cyclone in my life. It seemed like the end of the world. All I could do was to pray... Almighty Allah saved us,"" Azgar Ali, 49, a resident of Satkhira district in Bangladesh.
Mohammad Asaduzzaman, a senior police official in the coastal district, described the destruction Amphan left in its wake. 
""Devastation is huge. Many villages are flooded. It tore off tin roofs, snapped power lines, and uprooted trees."" 
Designated a super cyclone, Amphan has weakened since making landfall. Moving inland through Bangladesh, it was downgraded to a cyclonic storm on Thursday by the Indian weather office. And the storm was expected to subside into a depression later.
Authorities in both countries managed to evacuate more than three million people, moving them to storm shelters before Amphan struck. But the evacuation effort was focused on communities that lay directly in the cyclone's path, leaving villages on the flanks still vulnerable.
Television images showed upturned boats on the shore, people wading through knee-deep water and buses crashed into each other. The airport in Kolkata, West Bengal's state capital, lay under water. 
Pradip Kumar Dalui, a official in the state's South 24 Parganas area, said that storm waters breached river embankments in several places, flooding over half a dozen villages, that were home for more than 100,000 people.
""Many mud houses have been destroyed because of the wind or fallen trees,"" Dalui told Reuters by telephone. Electricity lines and phone connections were down in many places, but so far no deaths had been reported in this area, he said.
The cyclone came at a time when the two countries are battling to stop the spread of the coronavirus, and some evacuees were initially reluctant to leave their homes for fear of possible infection in the packed storm shelters. 
Cyclones frequently batter parts of eastern India and Bangladesh between April and December, often forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread damage.
While the evacuation again saved countless lives, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee dreaded the cost of repairing property and infrastructure wrecked by Amphan.
""Area after area has been devastated. Communications are disrupted,"" she said. ""We do not know if the damages will run into thousands of millions of rupees, will take three, four days to fully assess the extent of damage.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will lift its state of emergency in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo on Thursday as the number of new coronavirus infections drops, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said, amid hopes the move will help the world's third-largest economy to recover. 
Tokyo and four other prefectures, including the northern island of Hokkaido, would remain under the state of emergency - which has already been lifted for much of the country.
""I believe it is safe to lift the state of emergency in Kyoto, Osaka, and Hyogo given that the number of new infections in recent days are under 0.5 cases per 100,000 people and medical services are under control,"" Nishimura told the experts at the start of their meeting, which was open to the media.
Nishimura made the announcement after a panel of experts, whose approval is needed, signed off on the move. 
Japan has not had the explosive surge seen in many other countries, with 16,433 confirmed cases including 784 deaths as of Wednesday, according to public broadcaster NHK.
But the outbreak and restrictions on activity and business under the state of emergency have already tipped the economy into recession. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, like other world leaders, has been striving to balance the need to contain the pathogen's spread with the need to keep the economy running.
So far, the western prefectures of Kyoto, Osaka, and Hyogo are averaging at 0.09 infections per 100,000 people, in contrast with 0.59 for Tokyo and surrounding areas and 0.69 for Hokkaido. 
The availability of tests and medical services will also be factored in to the final decision.
New cases in Tokyo have recently dropped to single digits, while the western metropolis of Osaka has seen no new cases.

The move to drop Kyoto, Osaka, and Hyogo from its list of prefectures with curbs in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus comes a week after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced that the blanket state of emergency instated across Japan would be lifted in most places.

MIDLAND, Mich. (Reuters) - Rising floodwaters unleashed by two dam failures submerged parts of the central Michigan town of Midland on Wednesday, displacing thousands of residents and spreading into a Dow Chemical Co plant in the riverfront city.
By late morning, the company said, floodwaters were confirmed to be ""comingling with on-site containment ponds"" at the sprawling Dow plant, located just upstream from a Superfund hazardous waste cleanup site on the rain-swollen Tittabawassee River.
The National Weather Service (NWS) warned of ""life-threatening"" flooding as the Tittabawassee rose to historic levels.
Parts of Midland, a city of some 42,000 residents about 120 miles (193 km) northwest of Detroit, were submerged under 5 feet (1.5 m) of water before the river crested a few feet lower than expected.
Mark Bone, chairman of the Midland County Board of Commissioners, said no injuries had been reported. But the flood posed a major logistical challenge to authorities already coping with the coronavirus pandemic, and Governor Gretchen Whitmer called for federal assistance.
Some 10,000 people were evacuated throughout Midland County, Whitmer said, after days of heavy rain caused the Tittabawassee to overflow its banks and breach the Edenville and Sanford dams on Tuesday.
""Experts are describing this as a 500-year event,"" Whitmer told a news conference after a tour of the flood zone. She urged residents of low-lying areas to seek higher ground. 
National Guard troops assisted in moving some evacuees out of harm's way. 
At an evacuation shelter inside Midland High School, about 2 miles (3 km) from the riverfront, volunteers and evacuees wore face coverings to maintain social distancing recommended for curbing spread of the coronavirus.
One evacuee, 101-year-old Dot Costello, who fled her apartment with neighbor friends on Tuesday, said she was doing ""fine,"" but wished she ""had a TV to watch the news."" 
FEMA AND MILITARY
A spokeswoman for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said engineers would be sent to both dams to assist authorities in an investigation into the cause of the breaches. The agency in 2018 revoked the hydropower-generating license for the Edenville structure, accusing its operators of various deficiencies.
Video footage of the flood zone showed high water lapping around buildings in downtown Midland, partly submerging bridges and roads. Several residents were seen kayaking through flooded streets. 
Dow Chemical, headquartered in Midland, said in a statement that all operating units, except for facilities needed for managing chemical containment, had been shut down.
The 1,900-acre (770-hectare) Dow facility sits just upstream from a site contaminated with highly toxic chemicals, including dioxins, spewed from the plant for decades during the manufacture of chlorine-based products, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
A multi-year project to clean up the waste under the EPA's Superfund program is likely to be completed next year, the agency said.
The EPA said in a statement its cleanup plan required Dow to conduct ""post-flood assessment to determine if there is recontamination or if the constructed cleanup remedies have been damaged."" 
An EPA assessment following a major flood in 2017 found that ""impacts to the Superfund site were minimal,"" and Dow completed ""necessary, minor repairs as required.""
President Donald Trump, scheduled to tour a Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co auto plant in Michigan on Thursday, said on Twitter he had dispatched teams from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the U.S. military to the flood-stricken area to lend support.

Trump, who had encouraged protesters demanding that Whitmer ease coronavirus stay-at-home orders, tweeting a ""LIBERATE MICHIGAN"" message weeks ago, chided her again on Wednesday, tweeting: ""Governor must now 'set you free' to help. Will be with you soon!""

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo's top prosecutor was set to resign after a report that he gambled illegally during Japan's coronavirus state of emergency, media said on Thursday, in a blow to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose support has been hit over his handling of the pandemic.
Tokyo High Public Prosecutors Office chief Hiromu Kurokawa, who is seen as close to Abe, has been at the centre of a furore over the government's efforts to raise the retirement age for prosecutors after he was allowed to stay in his post beyond retirement age of 63.
Abe's government this week abandoned its push to enact a bill during the current session of parliament that would raise prosecutors' retirement age to 65 from 63, and let the cabinet defer retirement of senior prosecutors for a further three years, a step critics said threatened judicial independence.
Opposition party lawmakers and others also said the legislation was aimed at giving a retroactive legal basis to the decision to keep Kurokawa in his post.
In the latest twist, Kurokawa was hit with a social media backlash over a media report that he allegedly played mahjong for money during Japan's state of emergency, potentially flouting social distancing guidelines. Gambling is illegal in Japan, with some exceptions.
Abe told reporters the government was trying to confirm the facts of the matter.
""Naturally, there will be criticism (over Kurosawa),"" independent political analyst Atsuo Ito said. ""Certainly, it will be damaging.""
Public support for Abe has slipped over what critics say is his clumsy handling of the coronavirus outbreak, which has tipped the world's third-largest economy into recession. 
Abe was expected to lift the state of emergency in more regions on Thursday as new infections decline, moving to resume sorely needed economic activity.

Japan has not had the explosive surge seen in many other countries, with 16,433 confirmed cases including 784 deaths as of Wednesday, according to NHK.

185,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 10:10PM ET</span>","China legislators take on wildlife trade, but traditional medicine likely to be exempt","By David Stanway
SHANGHAI (Reuters) - As China's parliament prepares new laws to ban the trade and consumption of wildlife, local action plans published this week suggest the country's fur trade and lucrative traditional medicine sectors will continue as usual.
After identifying exotic animals traded in a Wuhan market as the most likely source of COVID-19, Beijing imposed a temporary ban on the wildlife trade in late January. Parliament followed up in February with a resolution promising to enshrine a permanent ban in law. 
Though legislative changes are expected to be discussed at the national session of parliament starting on Friday, regions are already taking action to implement the February ruling. 
Hunan and Jiangxi, both major wildlife breeding provinces, promised this week to release captive animals into the wild wherever possible, and will pay hunters and breeders to switch to other professions. 
But they left the fur trade untouched, and included loopholes allowing traders to stay in business if their products are used for science or medicine.
That means the practices that lead to cross-species virus transmission could continue, said Peter Li, China policy specialist with Humane Society International, an animal rights group. 
""There is nothing to stop farmers continuing business as usual but pivoting to selling their farmed wild animals for traditional Chinese medicine instead,"" he said.
CRACKDOWN
Since January, regulators have cracked down on trade in wet markets and online e-commerce platforms. Authorities in Shanghai closed shops and took action against dozens of online stores selling lizards, peacocks and even arctic foxes. 
But some products associated with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) remain for sale, reflecting legal ambiguities and a strong demand for folk remedies. 
Traders told Reuters they can still harvest bat guano and sell it for use in a traditional medicine known as yemingsha, used to treat eye and spleen complaints. 
Bats have been implicated as a possible source not only of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, but also Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome, SARS and even Ebola. 
The February parliamentary resolution promised to ban wildlife consumption for food while allowing it to continue for medicinal purposes, but in TCM, the distinction doesn't apply: wild animals are eaten because of supposed medical benefits.
Though it has been recognised by the World Health Organization as a valid therapy, critics say that there is no evidence TCM works, and that it puts endangered species further at risk. 
""Since the 1980s, eating wild animals has been promoted in TCM remedies for such things as skin health, fertility, longevity and fighting cancer, and it's undoubtedly a powerful lobby,"" Li said. 
STRICTER SUPERVISION?
China has extolled the virtues of TCM in the fight against COVID-19.
Lawmakers have proposed rules forcing producers to find synthetic replacements, saying the sector's dependence on outdated practices undermines quality as well as the prospects of promoting the sector overseas. 
Musk and tiger bone have already been replaced by artificial ingredients, but firms say they are still years away from producing viable alternatives to bear bile, a major component of tanreqing, a recommended TCM treatment for COVID-19.
Bear bile is sourced from captive breeding facilities, which were also exempt from the January ban, though the practice has been branded cruel by animal welfare groups.
Bear bile producers Guizhentang and  Shanghai Kaibao Pharmaceutical  (SZ:300039) declined to comment when contacted by Reuters, though Kaibao said in February it was still working on synthetic replacements. 
It remains unclear how the industry will be affected by new legislation, with parliament promising at least a stronger approval and supervision regime.
""It will be important for TCM experts, wildlife conservation experts, and relevant authorities to take a look at TCM-related laws and regulations to make sure they are consistent,"" said Aili Kang, executive director of the Asia Program of the Wildlife Conservation Society.
""To strictly forbid the use of endangered species, no matter wild or captive breeding population... is good for both TCM and conservation,"" she added.

186,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",Factbox: What to expect from China's annual meeting of parliament,"(Reuters) - About 3,000 delegates to the annual gathering of China's largely rubber-stamp parliament, the National People's Congress, will gather in Beijing on Friday to discuss political and economic policy. 
Below is an overview of China's top legislature and this year's meeting, widely expected to be shorter than the usual 10 days.
ISSUES:
On opening day, Premier Li Keqiang typically announces key annual economic targets in a state-of-the-nation style address.
This year, all eyes will be on the government's 2020 gross domestic product growth target - if there is one at all - after GDP contracted in the first quarter for the first time in decades due to the new coronavirus outbreak. 
Li may also announce fresh measures to stimulate an economy hit by the worst public health crisis since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. 
The defence budget is expected to be unveiled on opening day too, seen as a gauge of the extent China may ratchet up its military capabilities this year.
During parliament, the NPC is also expected to pass China's first civil code, wide-ranging legislation that, among other things, will formalise property and personal rights as part of President Xi Jinping's plan to reform the legal system. [L4N2D10RB]
Amid the global coronavirus pandemic, lawmakers will also likely discuss measures to contain any potential flare-up in new cases and steps to prevent a second wave in the longer run. 
FUNCTIONS:
The NPC normally meets every March to pass major bills, approve the budget and endorse personnel nominations. Its Standing Committee meets regularly to approve other legislation.
The gathering this year was postponed due to the epidemic, the first time the NPC has been delayed since China adopted the March schedule in 1995.
The NPC is generally considered a rubber stamp for the ruling Communist Party's policies and decisions.
MEMBERSHIP:
Delegates represent China's 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, as well as Hong Kong, Macau and the military. There are also delegates for Chinese-claimed Taiwan, mostly made up of defectors and their descendants but not elected by Taiwan's people.
VOTES:
Votes always follow the Communist Party's wishes and generally pass by an overwhelming majority, but delegates have in the past departed from the party line to vent frustration over issues such as corruption and crime.
All citizens above the age of 18 are technically allowed to vote for delegates and be elected to the NPC, but most delegates are hand-picked by local officials.
MEETINGS:
Parliament meets in the Great Hall of the People to the west of Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in the heart of Beijing. The main auditorium can seat 10,000 people.
The number of delegates attending is expected to remain unchanged, with China well past the February peak of the coronavirus epidemic and measures to prevent any return of the virus to the Chinese capital in place. 
Typically, there are news conferences during parliament, including a news conference by the government's top diplomat, State Councillor Wang Yi, and the premier's annual press conference on the last day. 
But the number of such conferences is expected to be reduced this year due to precautionary coronavirus measures.
The high-profile but largely ceremonial advisory body, the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), meets in parallel with the NPC. 
It is made up of business magnates, artists, monks, non-communists and other representatives of broader society, but has no legislative power.

The CPPCC will open on Thursday.

Venues serving alcohol have remained closed across the country despite most other businesses re-opening last week. The government said they posed additional risks, citing South Korea where a fresh spike in cases was blamed on crowded nightclubs in Seoul.
""We're nervously excited, we've been closed for a really long time, which hurts,"" Matt McLaughlin, a pub owner and a member of industry group Hospitality New Zealand told 1News.
""But, you know, we're in hospitality. We love our punters, we love our people; we're excited to get the doors open and get some bums on seats hopefully.""
The hospitality and tourism sectors were worst hit by the pandemic, as New Zealand enforced some of the tightest social restrictions in the world to stop the spread of the coronavirus. 
The measures helped limit infections to just over 1,500 people and 21 deaths, far fewer than many other countries.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's government faces a tough task rebooting the $200 billion economy, with growth expected to slow significantly and hundreds of thousands of jobs lost.
The government announced a NZ$50 billion package last week, which included billions on infrastructure, healthcare, housing and wage subsidy schemes.
With international travel still banned, Ardern has encouraged businesses to consider allowing a four-day work week so New Zealanders can travel around the country to help the battered tourism industry. 
""Ultimately, that really sits between employers and employees,"" Ardern said, highlighting the increased workplace flexibility the pandemic has led to.
""Think about whether that is something that would work for your workplace, because it certainly would help tourism all around the country.""

His comments came after Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said the shipment should ""alarm"" Latin America. Both OPEC members are U.S. adversaries whose oil industries are under U.S. sanctions. Trump administration officials say Washington is considering a response to the shipment.
The tankers - Fortune, Forest, Petunia, Faxon and Clavel - are carrying around 1.5 million barrels of fuel, and passed the Suez Canal in the first two weeks of May, Refinitiv Eikon data show. They are expected to arrive in Venezuela between late May and early June. 
""When they enter our exclusive economic zone, they will be escorted by Bolivarian National Armed Forces boats and planes to welcome them in and thank the Iranian people for their solidarity and cooperation,"" Padrino said on state television, adding that the government was in touch with Iran's defense minister.
Guaido said the fact President Nicolas Maduro's socialist government is importing fuel shows its mismanagement of the country's oil industry. Venezuela's refining network has 1.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of capacity, but has collapsed after years of underinvestment.
""We are very concerned for the safety of Venezuelans, and of Latin America as well, due to this attempted Iranian presence on Venezuelan soil,"" said Guaido, who leads the opposition-held National Assembly and is recognized as the rightful president by dozens of countries, including the United States.
Maduro calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup, and blames U.S. sanctions for Venezuela's economic woes.

Out of the 35,000 cities, towns and villages that France counts, about 30,000 have already elected their mayor in the first round. But many French large cities are among the 5,000 remaining, including Paris, Lyon and Marseille. 
Philippe said the elections could only be held at the end of June if conditions surrounding the coronavirus pandemic would allow it and that no final decision had been made, according to party leaders. 
A postponement beyond July 1 would require cancelling the results of elections held in March for the cities that did not elect a mayor at the first round and organising a new ballot.
The first round was just two days before the start of a nationwide lockdown, to the bewilderment of many as Philippe then said the vote would go ahead even as he declared all cafes, bars, cinemas and non-essential shops would close until further notice.
France is the world's fourth worst-hit country in terms of deaths from the novel coronavirus. Its lockdown started to ease last week. 
""The majority of the participants are in favour of a ballot on 28 June,"" the head of centrist UDI party Jean-Christophe Lagarde told Reuters, asking for a postponement of the vote to 2021. 

The organisation of a second round at the end of June ""is the preferred option, it seems,"" said Socialist Party leader Olivier Faure.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) appealed on Wednesday for the world to work together toward a coronavirus vaccine, warning against any unilateral action that could prevent access for poor countries.
""The reality is that there is this risk,"" Francesco Rocca, who heads the world's largest disaster relief network, told Reuters. ""Everyone must have access to these lifesaving treatments.""
On Tuesday, the United States rejected language in a World Health Organization resolution that was designed to ensure poor countries can have access to medicine, arguing that it sends ""the wrong message to innovators who will be essential to the solutions the whole world needs.""
The novel coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19, has infected more than 4.9 million people globally and caused almost 324,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. https://tmsnrt.rs/3bQxbz5
""If someone would say this is the intellectual property of this company ... and putting high prices on the vaccines, so making it impossible or very difficult to have access, this of course can have an impact on the most vulnerable,"" Rocca said.
""We want to prevent some unilateral decision that can effect the opportunity to have treatments and vaccines for everyone,"" said Rocca, who is also president of the Italian Red Cross. 
Rocca spoke from Rome shortly after meeting virtually with U.N. chief Antonio Guterres. He said they discussed the importance of multilateralism during the pandemic. The IFRC has 14 million volunteers in 192 countries.
""In this moment, some countries are not giving enough importance to the role of mulilateralism and this is a concern,"" Rocca said. 
The United States has suspended funding for the World Health Organization, accusing the U.N. agency of promoting Chinese ""disinformation"" about the outbreak. The WHO denied the accusation and China said it was transparent.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian authorities on Wednesday fired the country's health minister and launched a probe into potential corruption after officials allegedly bought ventilators at inflated prices, underscoring the global challenge to prevent graft amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Press reports on the steep premium paid for the ventilators, bought at $27,683 each, sparked social media backlash against the South American country's government, which received Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) funds to purchase the devices in May.
Bolivia's state prosecutor said in a statement on Wednesday that four health ministry officials had been detained over the scandal and that some officials abroad and intermediaries involved in the deal would also be investigated.
Health minister Marcelo Navajas was also detained in relation to the case, the head of the country's police special forces told reporters. A government spokeswoman said later in the day Navajas had been dismissed from his post.
""I will seek jail and order the full weight of the law against those who have taken a single cent. Every penny of corruption must be returned to the state,"" caretaker President Jeanine Añez had written on Twitter late on Tuesday.
In televised comments, she said that she had ordered a thorough investigation ""no matter whom it brings down.""
Reuters was unable to reach the health minister for comment.
The scandal emerged after Bolivian officals purchased 170 emergency respirators from the Spanish firm GPA Innova, using IDB funds.
Reuters could not reach the Spanish firm for comment, though its chief executive told Bolivian media that the ventilators had been sold via a third party.
The IDB said in a statement on Wednesday it was concerned about ""possible irregularities in the purchase of respirators"" made by Bolivia's health ministry using financing from the bank.
The lender said earlier in May it had financed the country's purchase of the ventilators as part of $82 million in funding for Bolivia to fight against the spread of the coronavirus.

""We will support and assist any nation or any group anywhere who opposes and fights the Zionist regime, and we do not hesitate to say this,"" Khamenei said in a post on his official English-language Twitter account.
Iran, Israel’s arch-enemy in the Middle East, has been a key supporter, along with Russia, of President Bashar al-Assad during Syria’s civil war, sending military advisers as well as material and regional Shi’ite militias.
Israel, which monitors neighbouring Syria intensively, has carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria targeting suspected arms and troop movements by Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas that Tehran sponsors.
Separately, Khamenei said on Wednesday that Iran's enmity toward Israel was not the same as hostility toward Jewish people.
""The elimination of the government of Israel does not mean the elimination of Jews. We don't have an issue with Jewish people,"" Khamenei said in a post on his official Farsi-language Twitter account.
""'Elimination of Israel' means the Muslim, Christian and Jewish people of #Palestine choose their own government themselves and push out foreigners and thugs like [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu,"" the post added.

The diamond-rich Southern African country has been gradually easing restrictions for the past two weeks with only selected economic sectors such as mines allowed to operate.
""All lockdown restrictions will be lifted effective midnight, with only those moving across the designated zones requiring permits to travel,"" COVID-19 Task Force Coordinator Dr Kereng Masupu said in a televised briefing. 
""Depending on the coronavirus disease pattern, a return to lockdown will remain an option.""
Stringent conditions have been set for businesses and schools wishing to reopen such as checking of body temperatures, regular disinfection and wearing of masks.
Returning citizens and residents will undergo mandatory quarantine while the ban of foreign visitors remains in place.
Botswana has a relatively low number of COVID-19 infections with 29 cases recorded. One person has been killed by the virus.
But the economy has been severely impacted by the outbreak with real GDP estimated to contract by 13% in 2020 while the budget deficit is now seen more than doubling.
Botswana has been unable to sell its diamonds for the past three months as buyers from diamond cutting and polishing centres, who visit the country as often as 10 times annually, have been unable to enter the country to do business due to restrictions on travel globally.
In response, the government has set aside a 5 billion pula ($413.00 million) fiscal stimulus to cushion the impact of the outbreak while the central bank has cut interest rates and halved the primary Reserve Requirements (PRR) for commercial banks in a bid to improve liquidity in the banking system.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - It is not a bird, a plane or Superman: the aircraft humming in the skies above Colombia's capital Bogota are instead police drones that are meant to detect people with high temperatures or those violating the country's coronavirus quarantine.
If a drone detects someone with a potential fever it sends the location to a medical team that seeks out the person to determine if they have coronavirus symptoms, officials said on Wednesday.
""It facilitates the location of groups of people day or night,"" said Captain Jorge Humberto Caceres, head of the police drone unit, as he monitored an area of northern Bogota with a thermal camera-equipped drone. 
""It gives us an approximate body temperature and directs the case to a national system so it can be attended to.""
The drones only detect temperatures or groupings of people who are out on the street, the police said, and do not penetrate into houses or apartments. The country has been in a coronavirus lockdown for nearly two months.
Each drone can fly for up to 30 minutes at a height of 500 meters (1,640 feet) and can get as far as 5 kilometers (3 miles) from the vehicle that serves as its control center.
Bogota - home to some 8 million people - has more than a third of Colombia's nearly 17,000 coronavirus cases.
Bogota's mayor, Claudia Lopez, has placed a dozen areas with high infection rates under special restrictions, tightening rules for outings even as other parts of the country have begun re-opening.
The Mazuren neighborhood in the Suba district, where the drone was flying on Wednesday, is one such zone.
""Without a doubt the use of these technologies from the national police has been very useful in these orange alerts areas,"" Julian Moreno, the district mayor for the Suba district, told Reuters. 

Suba is the city's most populous district, with 1.4 million residents, and has its second-highest infection rate.

HAVANA (Reuters) - With her buoyant colonial-style dresses and witty songs about the roasted peanuts she sells, street vendor Lyssett Perez had become something of a living landmark in Havana alongside its old fortresses, squares and churches. 
But now, with all tourists gone amid the coronavirus pandemic, she either stays at home or dons a face mask to go hawk her wares to locals queuing outside shops. 
""I miss it so much. The other day, I arrived at the square, looked all around, with a kind of mischief and I could swear I could see it full of people in my mind,"" Perez said. 
Perez is one of a multitude of hawkers or performers who usually bring Havana's historic centre alive in exchange for tourist dollars but who have now had to put away their costumes for better days and are struggling financially.
""I have had to sell some of my things to get by, musical equipment, good shoes,"" said Carlos Sanchez, who used to make a living playing Cuban classics on the trumpet in the streets while dressed up dapper.
For a brief while, he played for the locals lining up outside shops but stopped after police charged him a fine for contravening the partial lockdown, which allows people to go out only on essential business. 
Another fixture, Roberto Gonzalez, usually dresses his daschnunds up for photo opportunities and mini shows- like one in which they gnash their teeth every time he mentions U.S. President Donald Trump.
Now, he says, they are very stressed due to the lack of interaction and confinement at home, where he has but a small patio for them to run around outside.
""I've had to take them to the veterinary,"" said Gonzalez. ""I just hope all this will improve, and that we will soon come out the other side"".
Cuba appears to have contained the virus, according to official data, with new cases declining to less than 20 per day from a peak of around 50 in April, bringing its total tally to 1,900 cases and 79 deaths.
But many of its tourism markets have not recovered and the government has not yet outlined any plan for reopening borders which it closed in March.
Anaibis Montero, who usually dons colorful dresses and turbans to greet and guide tourists in the old town, said she was living off scant savings but preferred that to opening too quickly.
""How am I going to approach a tourist now if I don't know who has (the virus) and who doesn't?"" she said. ""The main thing now is to end the pandemic, because if not, we will continue exposing our lives.""

KOLKATA/DHAKA (Reuters) - A powerful cyclone pounded eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, killing at least 14 people and destroying thousands of homes, officials said, leaving authorities struggling to mount relief efforts amid a surging coronavirus outbreak.
The populous Indian state of West Bengal took the brunt of Cyclone Amphan, which barrelled out of the Bay of Bengal with gusting winds of up to 185 km per hour (115 mph) and a storm surge of around five metres.
West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said at least 10 people had died in the state, and two districts been completely battered by one of the strongest storms to hit the region in several years.
""Area after area has been devastated. Communications are disrupted,"" Banerjee said, adding that although 500,000 people had been evacuated, state authorities had not entirely anticipated the ferocity of the storm.
With rains continuing, she said the hardest hits areas were not immediately accessible. Federal authorities said they could only make a proper assessment of the destruction on Thursday morning.
""We are facing greater damage and devastation than the CoVID-19,"" Banerjee said, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, which has so far killed 250 people in the state.
In West Bengal's capital city, Kolkata, strong winds upturned cars and felled trees and electricity poles. Parts of the city were plunged into darkness.
An official in the adjoining Hooghly district said thousands of mud homes were damaged by raging winds.
In neighbouring Bangladesh, at least four people were killed, officials said, with power supplies cut off in some districts.
Authorities there had shifted around 2.4 million people to more than 15,000 storm shelters this week. Bangladeshi officials also said they had moved hundreds of Rohingya refugees from Myanmar, living on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal, to shelter.
But officials said they feared that standing crops could be damaged and large tracts of fertile land in the densely-populated country washed away.
""Fortunately, the harvesting of the rice crop has almost been completed. Still it could leave a trail of destruction,"" said Mizanur Rahman Khan, a senior official in the Bangladesh agriculture ministry.
Cyclones frequently batter parts of eastern India and Bangladesh between April and December, often forcing the evacuations of tens of thousands and causing widespread damage. 
SURGE AND HIGH TIDE
Surging waters broke through embankments surrounding an island in Bangladesh's Noakhali district, destroying more than 500 homes, local official Rezaul Karim said.
""We could avoid casualties as people were moved to cyclone centres earlier,"" Karim said.
Embankments were also breached in West Bengal's Sundarban delta, where weather authorities had said the surge whipped up by the cyclone could inundate up to 15 km inland. 
The ecologically-fragile region straddling the Indian-Bangladesh border is best known for thick mangrove forests that are a critical tiger habitat, and is home to around 4 million people in India.
On the Sundarbans' Ghoramara island, resident Sanjib Sagar said several embankments surrounding settlements had been damaged, and some flooding had started.
""A lot of houses have been damaged,"" he told Reuters by phone.
Anamitra Anurag Danda, a senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation think-tank who has extensively studied the Sundarbans, said that embankments across the area may have been breached.

""The cyclone surge coincided with the new moon high tides. It is devastation in the coastal belt,"" he said.

SCHEVENINGEN, Netherlands (Reuters) - A handful of beach bars at the Dutch coast unpacked their sun beds and started serving cocktails to customers as temperatures soared this week, only for authorities to warn them to stop until June 1 or face steep fines.
Frustrated owners and beachgoers fumed, but returned to take-away coffee and packed lunches.
In several European countries, confusion about the rules threatens to spoil the joy of once again being able to spend a day at the beach.
""It's confusing because some cities allowed people to rent beach beds and others prohibited it. So it is difficult to know what you can and cannot do,"" said Bartjan van den Beukel, who works at beach club Breez, near The Hague. 
After nearly 10 weeks of lockdown, a complex list of dos and don'ts will go into effect at the start of June, when public holidays could see a surge in visitors to the seaside.
Besides trying to keep customers 1.5 meters apart, Dutch restaurants, including those on the beach, will only be allowed to accept online table reservations and will then have to check clients for COVID-19 symptoms.
""You can ask people how they feel, but we're not doctors, so for us its not easy to see if someone is sick or not,"" he said, ""And how many times do they need to cough or sneeze before you say: 'you need to leave'?""
Dutch beaches remained open during the country's ""smart"" lockdown. Restaurants were allowed to serve takeaway, but not to rent out beach beds or allow customers inside.
NO SWIMMING
In Spain by contrast, beaches were mostly closed during lockdown but now in most areas people are allowed to walk and run, but not to swim or sunbathe. 
Barcelona reopened beaches on Wednesday and attracted huge crowds, who widely ignored the swimming and sunbathing bans. In the smallest Canary and Balearic Islands people can sunbathe and swim, but must apply social distancing.
In Portugal, where temperatures neared 30 degrees Celsius over the weekend, some people tried to go for a swim before it was officially allowed from May 18 and were told off by authorities.
The confusion seems to have been caused after Prime Minister Antonio Costa announced on Friday beaches would open on June 6 but then a government decree published on May 17 stated people could go to the beach from the beginning of this week. 
Groups will in any case have to stay 1.5 metres apart, sun beds may only be booked for the morning or afternoon, and beach sports of two people or more will not be allowed.
""We have clients who have been coming here for more than 30 years and they are used to book the sun beds… the half day rule won't be easy,"" Claudio Vieira, who manages a business at a beach in the southern Algarve region, told SIC television. 

A new app is supposed to help avoid crowding by warning which bathing spots are full, but some municipalities have already expressed doubts it will be effective.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo took fresh aim at China over the coronavirus on Wednesday, calling $2 billion Beijing has pledged to fight the pandemic ""paltry"" compared to the hundreds of thousands of lives lost and trillions of dollars of damage.
Pompeo rejected Chinese President Xi Jinping's claim that Beijing had acted with transparency after the outbreak in China, and said if Xi wanted to show that, he should hold a news conference and allow reporters to ask him anything they liked.
""President Xi claimed this week that China is acting with openness, transparency responsibility. I wish it were so,"" Pompeo told a State Department news conference, charging that Beijing continued to withhold virus samples and access to facilities, to censor discussion, ""and much, much more.""
U.S.-China tensions have spiked in recent weeks, with Pompeo and President Donald Trump slamming Beijing's handling of the outbreak. The United States has been hardest hit in the global pandemic.
Trump has proposed quitting the World Health Organization over its response and called it a ""puppet of China,"" while Xi has pledged it $2 billion.
""I look forward to seeing them fulfill that $2 billion commitment,"" Pompeo said.
""China's contributions to fighting the pandemic are paltry compared to the cost that they have imposed on the world.
""This plague has cost roughly 90,000 American lives, more than 36 million Americans have lost their jobs since March; globally 300,000 lives. Could be as much as $9 trillion, according to our estimates, cost imposition on the world of the Chinese Communist Party's failures,"" Pompeo said.
He accused China of threatening Australia with ""economic retribution"" for seeking an independent inquiry into the outbreak's origins and charged that WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had had ""unusually close ties to Beijing ... long before this current pandemic,"" something ""deeply troubling.""

Pompeo said the United States had responded with ""about $10 billion to benefit the international response,"" including vaccine research, preparedness funding and humanitarian aid.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Leaders of Brazil's lower house of Congress reached a deal on Wednesday to vote on a land bill seen by some as contributing to deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rain forest and has dozens of European companies threatening to boycott Brazilian exports.
The bill allows squatters on public land to more easily receive deeds to their properties, a policy that environmental advocacy group Imazon warns will accelerate deforestation of up to 16,000 square kilometers in the world's largest rain forest by 2027.
The fate of the bill, which would also require passage by the Senate, is not certain.
Congressman Zé Silva, the author of the bill, and other congressional leaders told Reuters there was an agreement to take a vote on Wednesday. 
On Tuesday, over 40 companies including major supermarket Tesco (OTC:TSCDY) and Burger King UK, issued an open letter threatening to boycott Brazilian products if it passes.
Brazilians have been settling the Amazon rain forest for decades, but many lack official deeds, putting them in a legal gray area. Proponents of the bill say granting deeds to settlers will encourage them to comply with laws to curb deforestation.
Environmentalists oppose putting the bill to a vote, saying it will reward the past crimes of illegal land grabbers, who often deforest land to increase its value for agriculture.
""Today the majority of Amazon deforestation is happening on public land,"" said congressman Rodrigo Agostinho, leader of the environmentalist caucus. ""We will keep fighting (the bill)."" 
The legislation has been considerably diluted since it was initially proposed by right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, in a move to please farmers, who overwhelmingly supported his 2018 election.
The latest version would fast-track deeds for land settled until 2008 with areas up to roughly 6.6 square kilometers, although the size varies by municipality, according to Richard Torsiano, a former official at the land rights agency Incra.
That is down from up to 16.5 square kilometers in the initial proposal. Lawmakers also removed an earlier provision making more recently settled properties eligible for deeds.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Colombia on Wednesday followed Argentina's footsteps and imposed one of the toughest travel bans in the world to fight coronavirus, saying no international passenger flights will be allowed until Aug. 31. 
Argentina took a similar drastic step https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-argentina/argentina-imposes-toughest-travel-ban-in-the-americas-sparking-outcry-idUSKCN2291PF this month, although it also banned domestic flights.

""Until Aug 31 we do not expect to resume international air travel or to reopen land borders,"" Colombia's transport minister Angela Maria Orozco said in an interview with Blu Radio on Wednesday. 
Latin America has imposed stricter travel restrictions than most regions to fight coronavirus. In addition to Colombia and Argentina, Peru, Ecuador, El Salvador and Panama have also grounded all flights and repeatedly extended those bans as the disease has spread. Cargo flights are allowed.
Colombia's decision is a blow to its largest carrier, Avianca Holdings (CN:AVT_p), which this month filed for bankruptcy in a U.S. court. Avianca said in a statement that the government had not yet notified it about the new ban. 
Avianca had earlier hoped to resume flying in June. The carrier is in a delicate situation as its entire passenger fleet is currently unable to fly due to restrictions in several countries. It is, however, operating cargo flights, but those represent a small percentage of the company's revenue in normal times. 

The carrier has a limited amount https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-latam-airlines-ana/latin-americas-airlines-pray-for-bailouts-to-avoid-aviancas-fate-idUSKBN22P1LZ of cash to keep the operation afloat while earning little revenue, which has prompted it to seek government aid that has yet to materialize.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal on Wednesday published a new political map that includes a small stretch of disputed land, toughening its stance on a decades-long row over the territory with India which rejected the move.
Nepal’s liberal communist Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli has been under intense pressure from student groups and members of parliament to issue the new map since India opened an 80 km (50 mile) long road this month linking the northern state of Uttarakhand with Lipulekh on the border with Tibet across the controversial piece of land.
Nepal claims the territory under an 1816 treaty with the East India Company which sets the Kali as its western boundary with India and says the land lying east of the river was its territory. Nepalese officials said the exact size of the territory was being calculated.
The new map that shows a sliver of land – including areas like Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani – jutting out from the northwestern tip of Nepal was made public on Wednesday by Land Management Minister Padma Aryal who said the occasion was “historically pleasant” for Nepal and its people.
But India, which says the land is its territory, rejected Nepal’s “unilateral act” saying it was not based on historical facts and evidence.
“It is contrary to the bilateral understanding to resolve the outstanding boundary issues through diplomatic dialogue,” Indian External Affairs Ministry Spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said in a statement. “Such artificial enlargement of territorial claims will not be accepted by India,” he said.
India has stationed a security post in the area since its border war with China in 1962.
Nepali officials said the new map will be printed in school and college text books and official documents and will be used for all administrative purposes.

BOSTON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities on Wednesday arrested a former Special Forces soldier and another man wanted by Japan on charges that they enabled the escape of former Nissan (OTC:NSANY) Motor Co boss Carlos Ghosn out of the country.
Federal prosecutors in Massachusetts said former U.S. Green Beret Michael Taylor, 59, and his son, Peter Taylor, 27, helped Ghosn last year flee to Lebanon to avoid trial in Japan over alleged financial wrongdoing.
Japan in January issued arrest warrants for both men along with a third, George-Antoine Zayek, in connection with facilitating the Dec. 29, 2019 escape. The Taylors are scheduled to appear by video conference before a federal judge later on Wednesday.
A lawyer for both Taylors did not immediately comment. 
Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, while he was awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.
U.S. legal papers recount the details of Ghosn's escape including his departure from Japan hidden in a large black box aboard a private jet.
The Japanese embassy in Washington and Nissan did not immediately comment. A representative for Ghosn declined to comment.
Federal prosecutors asked the judge to order both men detained. ""The very offense for which Michael Taylor is charged in Japan demonstrates his aptitude for hatching escape plans on a grand scale and his blatant disrespect for bond conditions,"" they said in a court filing.
Earlier this month, Turkish prosecutors prepared an indictment charging seven people, including four pilots, over Ghosn's escape via Istanbul to Beirut.
U.S. law enforcement learned Peter Taylor had booked a flight from Boston to Beirut departing Wednesday with a layover in London. He was arrested as was Michael Taylor in Harvard, Massachusetts.
In September, Nissan and Ghosn settled U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision (SEC) claims over false financial disclosures related to Ghosn's compensation.
The SEC said in total Nissan in its financial disclosures omitted more than $140 million to be paid to Ghosn in retirement — a sum that ultimately was not paid. Nissan paid $15 million and Ghosn $1 million to resolve the investigation. Ghosn also agreed to a 10-year ban from serving as an officer or director of a publicly traded U.S. company.
The SEC also said Ghosn engaged in a scheme to conceal more than $90 million of compensation. Nissan sued Ghosn in February seeking about $90 million.

The SEC said beginning in 2004 Nissan's board delegated to Ghosn the authority to set individual director and executive compensation levels, including his own. ""Ghosn and his subordinates, including Kelly, crafted various ways to structure payment of the undisclosed compensation after Ghosn's retirement,"" the agency added.

A project manager with the  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation, Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit.
She was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran's clerical establishment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday recent treatment of Hong Kong pro-democracy activists made it more difficult to assess that the territory remains highly autonomous from China, a requirement for the special treatment it enjoys under American law.
Pompeo said a congressionally mandated State Department assessment as to whether the former British colony has such a degree of autonomy was still pending.
""We are closely watching what's going on there,"" he told a news conference.
Pompeo said pro-democracy lawmakers had been ""manhandled"" this week while trying to stop what he characterized as procedural irregularity by pro-Beijing legislators, and added:
""Leading Hong Kong activists like Martin Lee and Jimmy Lai were hauled into court. Actions like these make it more difficult to assess that Hong Kong remains highly autonomous from mainland China."" 
Pompeo announced on May 6 he was delaying the report assessing whether Hong Kong was sufficiently autonomous to warrant the special economic treatment that has helped it remain a world financial center. 
He said this was to account for any actions Beijing might contemplate ahead of China's National People's Congress this Friday.
On Sunday, Pompeo said he believed China had threatened to interfere with the work of U.S. journalists in Hong Kong, and warned Beijing that any decision impinging on Hong Kong's autonomy could affect the American assessment.
U.S.-China tensions have spiked in recent weeks, with Pompeo and President Donald Trump slamming Beijing's handling of the coronavirus outbreak, in which the United States has been hardest hit.

""This plague has cost roughly 90,000 American lives, more than 36 million Americans have lost their jobs since March; globally 300,000 lives. Could be as much as $9 trillion, according to our estimates, cost imposition on the world of the Chinese Communist Party's failures,"" Pompeo said.

Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli gave orders authorizing the Law Enforcement Forces (LEF) of Iran to use lethal force in response to anti-government protests in November, leading to the killing of protesters, including at least 23 minors, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement.
""His - and the regime's - goal was to quash these peaceful protests and suppress the rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression at any cost,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a separate statement.
The Treasury on Wednesday also blacklisted seven senior officials of the LEF, including commander Hossein Ashtari Fard, and a provincial commander of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, for their roles in the suppression of protesters.
The LEF Cooperative Foundation - which the Treasury said is controlled by the LEF and is active in Iran's energy, construction, services, technology and banking industries - was also blacklisted, as were its director and members of the board of trustees. 
Treasury's action freezes any U.S.-held assets of those blacklisted and generally bars Americans from dealing with them.
Washington also barred Rahmani Fazli and Ali Fallahian, the head of Iran's intelligence service from 1989 to 1997, from traveling to the United States. The State Department said Fallahian was involved in assassinations and attacks around the world. 
""The United States will continue to hold accountable Iranian officials and institutions that oppress and abuse their own people,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.

Tensions between Washington and Tehran have spiked since U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal and began reimposing sanctions eased under the accord.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador pledged to bring down gang-fueled violence afflicting Mexico when he took office in December 2018, but homicides hit a record level in 2019 and have continued to climb even during the coronavirus lockdown.
In the first four months of this year, 11,535 murders were registered, up from 11,266 homicide in same period last year, preliminary data from the security ministry showed. Just over 34,600 murders were logged in Mexico in all of last year.
Mexico in late March began imposing restrictions to curb the coronavirus outbreak, a development that some analysts hoped might lead to a reduction in criminal violence.
But nearly 6,000 murders were registered between March and April, one of the worst two-month periods on record.
Lopez Obrador has taken a more conciliatory strategy to tackling violence, one that aims to focus on the causes of crime, in particular by reducing poverty and corruption.
However, he has conceded Mexico must do better, and this month ordered the armed forces to help handle security on the streets for another four years, extending a policy pursued by his predecessors he had long criticized.
The president has also come under fire for the government's record on tackling violence against women.
The latest data hinted at progress.

In the year through April, there were 314 femicides, a crime described under Mexican law as murder of a woman for reasons of gender. That was a drop of 2.2% compared to 2019.

The government's leader in the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg confirmed he did not plan to renew the temporary arrangement which permitted lawmakers to question ministers from their homes. 
He said it was too slow, did not provide sufficient scrutiny of new legislation, and fundamentally restricted parliament's ability to perform its functions fully.
""We have to recognise that if we persist with the present arrangement it will become harder to make progress in a timely fashion,"" he told parliament.
The so-called hybrid parliament has temporarily turned the 19th century debating chamber into a modern videoconferencing hub. 
Only a handful of lawmakers and ministers are currently allowed to attend in person and the rest have their questions broadcast via flat-screen televisions dotted around the chamber.
Despite protests from political opponents, who say travelling to parliament from all corners of the country presents a public health risk, Rees-Mogg asked lawmakers to return in person on June 2.
That coincides with another expected easing of the far-reaching restrictions on daily life that have kept most Britons at home for more than eight weeks. 

Having already loosened regulations slightly, the government hopes to be able to re-open schools and some other sectors of the economy on June 1, provided the rate of infection has not reversed its current decline.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Israel must abandon its threat to annex parts of the occupied West Bank, the U.N. Middle East envoy said on Wednesday, branding such a plan as a serious violation of international law that would ""close the door to a renewal of negotiations.""
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said cabinet discussions would begin on July 1 on his plan to extend Israeli sovereignty to territory Palestinians want for their own state. There is no publicly stated deadline for annexation of land that Israel captured in 1967.
""The continuing threat of annexation by Israel of parts of the West Bank would constitute a most serious violation of international law, deal a devastating blow to the two-state solution, close the door to a renewal of negotiations,"" U.N. Middle East envoy Nickolay Mladenov told the Security Council.
""Israel must abandon its threat of annexation. And the Palestinian leadership to re-engage with all members of the quartet,"" he said, referring to the United States, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. 
Mladenov urged the 15-member council to back a push by U.N. chief Antonio Guterres against unilateral steps that would hinder diplomatic efforts to renew negotiations between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
Such a statement by the council is unlikely as it has to be agreed by consensus and the United States traditionally shields its ally Israel from any action. 
""This council cannot dictate the end to this conflict. We can only encourage the parties to sit down together to determine how they wish to make progress,"" U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said.
The Palestinians have rejected a peace plan by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration. 
Mladenov urged the quartet to ""come forward with a proposal that will enable the quartet to take up its mediation role.""

Some 11,000 families waited for charity food parcels on Wednesday in a queue stretching for several kilometres outside South Africa's capital Pretoria, with some lining up from 4.a.m.
Aid workers estimated more than half of those waiting for the third distribution this month were migrants.
President Cyril Ramaphosa has been praised for trying to mitigate the impact of the two-month-old coronavirus shutdown on the country's most vulnerable, setting aside 50 billion rand ($2.78 billion) for social grants for the poor, who on one measure make up half of Africa's most industrialised country.
But to claim a grant or food parcel, you need a national ID card -- which migrants aren't entitled to and many South Africans from poor areas have failed to obtain. 
""We saw about the money that they are going to send to the South Africans, but as foreign nationals who is going to provide for us?"" said Peter Ndhlovu, an out-of-work Zimbabwean migrant casual labourer, as he queued.
""These people are hungry,"" said Yusuf Abramjee, one of the coordinators of the charity handout programme, gesturing to a queue stretching several kilometres. 

""Some of them are South African, a large chunk of them are foreign nationals.""

215,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Irish health minister says some sectors could reopen ahead of plan,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Some parts of Ireland's economy could restart ahead of schedule if the novel coronavirus remains under control, Ireland's Health Minister told Reuters on Wednesday, expressing cautious optimism of moving into phase two of a reopening plan on June 8.
Ireland partially reopened its economy on Monday, in the first of five stages that constitute one of the most conservative plans in Europe for rolling back a lockdown imposed in late March. The number of new cases recorded of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new virus, has stayed below 100 for four successive days for the first time since March 18.
Pointing to construction work beside his office in central Dublin, where only a small number of builders - many in face shields - were back on site, Harris said there were significant signs of a gradual return to work for those allowed and of people sticking to the plan. 
""Anecdotally, my sense is we're doing well with the lifting of the restrictions... I think that there are reasons for cautious optimism,"" Harris said, referring to when the country could move to phase two.
Building sites, garden centres and repair shops were among the limited group allowed to resume operations on Monday, when people were also permitted to meet in non-household groups of four outdoors for the first time in seven weeks.
With pubs having to wait until Aug. 10 and already pushing to move up the queue, Harris said the government had an open mind on which sectors reopened when - but would retain the planned three-week gap between each stage to monitor for any changes in the spread of the virus.
""If the virus is going well, could you look at something in phase four and say bring it to phase three? In theory, yes, but everything is phased based on the potential risk and it will all depend on how people are able to modify that activity,"" he said.
Schools are only due to reopen in September and Harris said it was really important that they did. While it will mean classrooms operating in a different way, he also thinks that may not be as ""drastic or dramatic"" as some people think.
""DON'T VISIT NOW""
Other parts of society, such as nursing home care, would have to operate differently in future, said Harris, who at 33 is the youngest member of Ireland's cabinet.
With care homes making up more than half of Ireland's 1,561 COVID-19 related deaths, he proposed stronger links between private homes and community health services, statutory care to help elderly people live at home for longer and more purpose-built housing for retirees in place of the ""outdated model"" of congregated living. 
Ireland would remain similarly cautious on travel. The soon-to-be mandatory 14-day self-isolation of anyone entering the country would not necessarily remain in place until a vaccine or treatment was found, Harris said, but the government ""honestly don't know"" how long it would be needed.
However so-called ""travel bubbles"" between countries with low infection rates was ""a really interesting idea"" that merits consideration for a country where tourism-related sectors account for around 10% of the workforce, he added. 

""This is the country of 'céad míle fáilte',"" Harris said, using the Irish phrase meaning '100,000 welcomes'. ""Please do come and visit Ireland but don't visit now for non-essential reasons.""

""I am considering rescheduling the G-7, on the same or similar date, in Washington, D.C., at the legendary Camp David,"" Trump tweeted. ""The other members are also beginning their COMEBACK. It would be a great sign to all - normalization!""
In March, the Republican U.S. president had canceled the physical summit scheduled for June, at the time moving to a video conference as nations grappled with the shutdown of international travel and multiple U.S. closures amid the outbreak.
The leaders' April and May discussions were also moved to teleconference. 
But in a tweet, Trump said holding an in-person summit would be a symbol of the United States and other countries seeking to return to normal, something the president has urged should happen quickly despite concerns from public health experts. 
All 50 U.S. states have sought to re-open at least partially as of Wednesday, although the nation's capital and its surrounding suburbs remain largely shuttered. Camp David is located about an hour's drive north of Washington in Thurmont, Maryland.

The pandemic has afflicted the United States more than any other country, with more than 1.5 million known infections and more than 90,000 deaths.

The camp is one of several in Syria's war-torn northwest region where makeshift barbers are being set up by the International Association for Relief and Development (ONSUR), part of a project to bring relief to children during the Eid holiday that marks the end of Ramadan.
""Today we came to the camp to give children haircuts ahead of the Eid holiday in order to bring their hearts joy and to prevent crowds from gathering at barber shops,"" said Abdul Wahab Al-Daif, a 33-year-old barber.
The rebel-held northwest, home to more than 3 million people, has not had a confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, but doctors fear its shattered medical infrastructure and overflowing camps could quickly turn any outbreak into a humanitarian disaster.
To minimise the risk of contagion, ONSUR's barbers are operating in individual tents or setting up designated haircut areas to help maintain social distancing.
""No matter how much you try to separate people in the camps, it's almost impossible, but we're doing our best to serve people and protect them from disease,"" said Muhammad Najjar, ONSUR's Idlib director.

The group is also distributing masks and educational brochures for children on how to prevent the spread of the coronavirus as well as offering psychological support.

Some critics, however, believed Netanyahu was trying to reduce the optics of the first criminal prosecution of a sitting Israeli prime minister. Indicted for bribery, fraud and breach in three long-running cases, he denies wrongdoing.
The court said in response that it could accommodate the fifth-term Netanyahu's security detail, though it declined his additional request to bring a larger legal retinue.

Britain left the EU in January and has until the end of this year to negotiate an agreement on future ties or start 2021 without a trade agreement, which some businesses say could cause costly delays and confusion at borders.
Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom but shares a land border with EU member Ireland, hampered any agreement between Britain and the bloc until late last year when Prime Minister Boris Johnson agreed to a so-called protocol.
The EU says the Northern Ireland protocol requires customs checks and controls on some goods coming from mainland Britain into the province in case they were headed further into Ireland and the bloc's single market.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove described the proposals as the heart of ""a consensual, pragmatic approach"".
""Implementing the protocol in this way will ensure we can support businesses and citizens, and protect Northern Ireland’s place in the UK’s customs territory while upholding our commitments to the EU’s Single Market,"" he said.
The government acknowedged, however, ""there will be some limited additional process on goods arriving in Northern Ireland."" 
""There will be no new physical customs infrastructure and we see no need to build any. We will however expand some existing entry points for agrifood goods to provide for proportionate additional controls.""
Johnson has repeatedly said, that while the government will comply with the obligations set out in the protocol, it does not see that entailing new checks on goods, saying it already complies with requirements for live animals and agrifoods.

But officials say there will have to be some additional checkpoints, and the EU has become increasingly critical of London's refusal to explain how they would deal with the border.

Twelve of the detainees were arrested late on Tuesday and three more on Wednesday morning in Thailand's Mae Sot, close to a bridge that separates the two countries, police said.
All were from Buthidaung, home to one of the largest concentrations of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar's northwestern Rakhine State. 
""They have been preliminarily charged with illegal entry, pending further interrogation to determine whether they are victims of human trafficking,"" Phubed Sang-aram, superintendent of the Mae Sot district police, told Reuters by phone.
Phubed said three Thais had also been arrested for providing accommodation to illegal migrants. 
Local television showed video of the group of mostly Rohingya women sitting on the floor being questioned by police.
The group had planned to go to Malaysia via Thailand, said to Chaiyapheuk Chiantranluk, the Mae Sot district chief. 
Vast numbers of Rohingya fled a 2017 military crackdown in the largely Buddhist Rakhine state that the U.N said was executed with genocidal intent. 
Many Rohingya risked death and starvation on perilous boat journeys in the hope of reaching predominantly Muslim Malaysia. 
Myanmar denies allegations that its security forces have committed atrocities against them and says it was conducting a legitimate security operation against militants who attacked police posts. 
It says Rohingya are illegal immigrants from South Asia. More than a million of them now live in camps in neighbouring Bangladesh, too frightened to return.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Veteran Malaysian politician Mahathir Mohamad said he would seek to oust Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin at every turn, scolding his successor for bringing back into power a graft-tainted party rejected by voters in an historic election two years ago.
The prospect of more political and policy uncertainty in Malaysia comes at a time when the multi-ethnic Southeast Asian nation is grappling with the health crisis and economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
On Wednesday, the 94-year-old Mahathir, who resigned the premiership in February, questioned the legitimacy of Muhyiddin's 2-1/2 month old coalition with the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).
""It's wrong for this backdoor arrangement to be done. We want to give the people the rightful government that they chose. That is our aim,"" Mahathir told Reuters in an interview conducted on video conferencing app Zoom.
Having been part of Mahathir's government, Muhyiddin unexpectedly emerged as prime minister in March after forging al alliance with UMNO to gain a parliamentary majority. The opposition have accused him of stealing power by shifting alliances instead of earning it at the ballot box.
Earlier this week, the government avoided a confidence vote tabled by Mahathir, insisting that parliament gave priority to the fight against the coronavirus, and its economic fallout.
But Mahathir reckoned Muhyiddin's alliance only held a two-seat majority in parliament's 222-seat lower house, and said he would keep working with opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim, despite past differences, to topple the government that replaced them.
""That is the narrowest majority any government in Malaysia ever had,"" Mahathir said.
""(Muhyiddin) is going to be in very great trouble. Because whatever chance we have to prove that it is not legitimate for him to be the prime minister, we will do that."" 
He said opposition parties would reject bills that Muhyiddin's administration brings to parliament if a confidence vote is not allowed to be tabled. 
""If everything he brings to parliament is rejected, how does he continue?,"" Mahathir said.
Having led Malaysia for 22 years until 2003, Mahathir came out of retirement to join hands with former foes to oust then prime minister Najib Razak, who now faces corruption charges mostly related to the alleged looting of billions of dollars from sovereign fund, 1Malaysia Development Bhd. 
The multi-ethic alliance led by Mahathir and Anwar scored a stunning victory in the 2018 election, toppling Najib and dumping UMNO out of power for the first time since Malaysia's independence from British colonial rule.
Najib, who co-founded 1MDB, has denied all wrongdoing.
Last week, prosecutors dropped money-laundering charges tied to 1MDB against Riza Aziz, Najib's stepson, after agreeing to a deal that officials said included the recovery of $107.3 million from overseas assets.

In a sermon posted online in late March, Lah had told followers: “If you hear the sermon of God, the virus will never come to you. I declare it with the soul of Jesus Christ.”
Judge Moe Swe told journalists after the hearing at a Yangon court that Lah would be remanded in Insein prison until June 3 while police continue their investigations.
Lah had previously been taken to hospital and was then under quarantine at a hotel. Wai Tun was not present in court.
About 20 people who participated in the gatherings in early April subsequently tested positive, an official said at the time.
This led to a cluster of 67 cases, Thar Tun Kyaw, a spokesman for Myanmar’s health ministry, told Reuters on Wednesday.
The Yangon Region COVID-19 Control and Emergency Response Committee said in a statement that Lah and two other pastors had held services after a March 13 ban was introduced.
The coronavirus has infected nearly five million people globally and killed more than 322,000. More than half the coronavirus cases in South Korea, at the beginning of the outbreak there, were linked to gatherings at a church.

Myanmar, which has reported 193 cases of the virus and six deaths, is a Buddhist-majority nation but Christians comprise about 6% of the population.

The election will pit the ruling centre-right Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) against the top opposition Social Democrats (SDP) party, which is trailing slightly in opinion polls. Neither party is expected to win an outright majority, so a coalition government with smaller parties is almost certain.
According to the latest opinion poll, the HDZ has the support of around 30% of voters, while the SDP would get around 28%. The third force is a nationalist and eurosceptic block around the Domovinski Pokret (Homeland Movement) party led by a popular singer, Miroslav Skoro, which is supported by some 10% of voters.

The future government will have an uphill task to spark a recovery in an economy that is expected to shrink 9.4% this year due to the coronavirus pandemic and its strong negative effect on tourism, which accounts for almost 20% of Croatia's output.

231,By Reuters,"<span>May 20, 2020 06:11AM ET</span>","As in 1918, New York may use staggered work hours to keep subway safe","By Nathan Layne
(Reuters) - As New York City makes plans to reopen in the coming months, officials are dusting off the playbook from the 1918 flu pandemic, when businesses were ordered to begin their work days at staggered times to prevent the subway from becoming a vector of disease.
The idea, then and now, is to spread riders through the day to avoid the kind of crowding health experts fear could turn the subway into a breeding ground for the novel coronavirus which has killed over 20,000 people in the city.
Talks over staggered hours and days for offices are still at an early stage, a member of the New York state's reopening panel told Reuters. Coordination could prove complex in a city of 220,000 businesses, most of them smaller firms.
But Patrick Foye, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has been making the case to business leaders, signaling that he sees it as key to restoring confidence in the tangled web of 665 miles of track that ferried 5.5 million people a day before the lockdown in March.
Foye told a May 6 call organized by the Association for a Better New York that he sees staggered work hours and days as ""part of the answer"" to congestion, citing the 1918 response.
Kathryn Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City and a member of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's reopening committee, said businesses would support coordinated start times. 
""It's the expectation of employers that something like that will have to be worked out if they are going to get their people back on the trains,"" she said.
During the 1918 pandemic, the New York City health commissioner, Royal Copeland, staggered starting and ending times for most businesses by 15-minute increments. While it is unclear what impact the move had, New York ultimately fared better than other cities - it had a death rate of 4.7 per 1,000 residents, far lower than Philadelphia at 7.3.
New York City is unlikely to reopen in a meaningful way until the fall. Even then, workers will likely return in phases, if at all. Employees of technology firms  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) and  Square Inc  (NYSE:SQ), for example, have been given the option to keep working at home. 
""As we try to reopen the economy the use of buildings is obviously going to change. We should be talking about implementing staggered shifts,"" said Kyle Bragg, president of service workers union 32BJ SEIU. 
MORE TRAINS
Last month Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist and physician Jeffrey Harris published a paper titled ""The Subways Seeded the Massive Coronavirus Epidemic in New York City"" that pointed to a parallel between rider patterns and virus spread in early March.
But some officials have said they are not convinced the subway is a root cause. One skeptic is Cuomo, who has cited data showing transit workers with below-average infection rates and a hospital survey indicating most patients had not used public transit.
Sarah Kaufman, associate director at New York University (NYU) Rudin Center for Transportation said the notion that subways spread the virus was inaccurate. ""It was a failure to quickly make people stay home.""
Even so, transit and health experts say the MTA needs to go beyond disinfecting cars at night, the mandating of masks and other steps already taken. One common proposal is more frequent trains, especially on lines where people stand shoulder-to-shoulder during peak times. 
""That's the only way to help with the social distancing, so that you clear the platforms quickly and there are fewer riders on the trains,"" said Elodie Ghedin, a former professor of global public health at NYU who is now at the National Institutes of Health. 
That would require money the MTA doesn't have. It received $3.9 billion in emergency federal funding, but is asking for $3.9 billion more to compensate for the 93 percent drop in subway revenues. 
For now, companies are making their own plans. Marsh & McLennan Cos, a Manhattan-based insurance and risk management group, said it instructed office leaders to make plans for staggered teams at the office and to determine whether commuters should travel at off-peak times.

Authorities were looking at how best to use technology, including apps that could direct commuters to use trains or subways at certain times based on capacity, Wylde said, a tool that did not exist in 1918.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean victims of Japanese wartime sexual violence boycotted a weekly protest in Seoul on Wednesday after a former leader of the group organising the rally was accused of misusing funds meant for victims.
Yoon Mi-hyang recently stepped down as longtime leader of the group to contest the national election and won a seat in parliament. She is under investigation by Seoul prosecutors over allegations she used government subsidies for her own benefit, not to help the ""comfort women"" - a euphemism for those forced to work in Japan's wartime brothels. 
Dozens of young students still attended the regular protest outside the Japanese embassy, but Lee Yong-soo, a prominent victim and activist, along with other elderly victims who also sometimes attend, were absent.
Lee this month publicly accused Yoon of politically and financially exploiting victims to garner government funds and public donations through the protests while spending little money on them. 
Lee, 92, vowed to quit the rallies, held almost every Wednesday since 1992, and demanded Yoon not be made a lawmaker.
""The Wednesday demonstration should end,"" Yonhap news agency quoted Lee saying. ""We don't even know how and where money comes from anyway, but the donations should be used for us, but they never have.""
Several calls to Lee and Yoon seeking comment went unanswered. 
On social media, Yoon has said she properly managed the budget of the group, the Korean Council for Justice and Remembrance for the Issues of Military Sexual Slavery by Japan, and Lee's memory appears to have faded. 
The investigation into Yoon include allegations she embezzled funds for personal use and inflicted losses by buying and selling a property meant to shelter victims.
The group, better known as Jungdaehyup, is also being investigated. Jungdaehyup said on Wednesday it has ""never loosely used money"" but apologised for ""accounting flaws"" for which it has requested an independent audit. 
""We might have made some errors because of workforce shortages, but there can never be accounting fraud,"" Han Kook-yeom, one of the group's founders, told the rally. 
The feud threatens to undermine the wartime sexual violence movement, led for decades by Yoon, Lee and Jungdaehyup, which together played a key role in effectively nullifying a controversial 2015 settlement with Japan.
The scandal is also a setback for President Moon Jae-in, whose relations with Tokyo turned sour after he declared the 2015 deal flawed.
""The dispute could hurt the legitimacy and morality of the group which has long enjoyed public trust for supporting the victims,"" said Shin Beom-chul, director of the Centre for Diplomacy and Security at the Korea Research Institute for National Strategy in Seoul. 
""It might also provide a fresh source of friction with Japan that complicates future negotiations."" 
As the group held its 1,440th weekly protest, a dozen other activists staging their own rally nearby booed and jeered, with one chanting ""Give the money back to the grandmas.""
Lee Na-young, who now leads Jungdaehyup, pledged to regain public trust.
""We should not let the history and cause of this movement, which contributed to making wartime sexual violence a universal issue of human rights, suffer a crushing collapse,"" she shouted.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A week after being sworn into office for a fifth term, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will go on trial on May 24, charged with corruption.
WHAT ARE THE CHARGES AGAINST NETANYAHU?
Bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Netanyahu, 70, was indicted in three criminal cases last November. He denies all wrongdoing.
CASE 4000 alleges that Netanyahu granted regulatory favours worth around 1.8 billion shekels (about $500 million) to Israeli telecommunications company Bezeq Telecom Israel.
In return, prosecutors say, he sought positive coverage of himself and his wife on a news website controlled by the company's former chairman, Shaul Elovitch.
In this case, Netanyahu has been charged with bribery, fraud and breach of trust. Elovitch and his wife, Iris, have been charged with bribery and obstruction of justice. The couple deny wrongdoing. 
CASE 1000, in which Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust, centres on allegations that he and wife Sara wrongfully received almost 700,000 shekels worth of gifts from Arnon Milchan, a Hollywood producer and Israeli citizen, and Australian billionaire businessman James Packer.
Prosecutors said gifts included champagne and cigars and that Netanyahu helped Milchan with his business interests. Neither Packer nor Milchan face charges.
CASE 2000 alleges that Netanyahu negotiated a deal with Arnon Mozes, owner of Israeli newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth, for better coverage. In return, the prime minister allegedly offered legislation that would slow the growth of a rival newspaper. Netanyahu has been charged with fraud and breach of trust. Mozes has been charged with offering a bribe, and denies wrongdoing.
WHAT DOES NETANYAHU SAY? 
Netanyahu says he is the victim of a politically orchestrated ""witch hunt"" by the media and the left to oust him from office.
Loyalists in Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party have accused the justice system of bias, and Netanyahu has said receiving gifts from friends was not against the law. 
His legal team says criminal investigations into relations between politicians and the news media threaten press freedom. 
WILL A VERDICT COME SOON?
Unlikely. The trial could take years. Netanyahu could also seek a plea deal rather than go through the trial process. 
COULD NETANYAHU GO TO JAIL, IF CONVICTED?
Bribery charges carry a sentence of up to 10 years in jail and/or a fine. Fraud and breach of trust carry a prison sentence of up to three years.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The World Bank has approved a $1 billion loan for Kenya to help it close a gaping budget deficit and tackle the economic shocks from the coronavirus pandemic, both sides said on Wednesday.
The loan, initiated before the health crisis started, is the second ever such direct lending for the budget from the World Bank, after the first was processed last year.
""Its approval is timely, since it will help fill the financing gap generated by the severe, ongoing shock to Kenya's economy,"" the World Bank said in a statement.
The budget deficit has swollen to 8.2% of GDP in the financial year to the end of June, from an initial forecast of under 7%, mainly due to reduced tax collection and lost revenue from VAT and income tax cuts.
Finance Minister Ukur Yatani said the approval was a vote of confidence in the government's handling of the economy.
""The... WB (World Bank) does not provide budget support to countries with a weak macro framework,"" he wrote on Twitter.
The bank did not give the terms of the loan. A senior official at the finance ministry told Reuters in January that the loan would be ""fairly priced"". 

It comes two weeks after the IMF approved $739 million in emergency financing, a move which has supported the shilling currency .

""The naval units of the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman will continue their regular missions in accordance with professional principles as in the past,"" ISNA quoted an unnamed military official as saying. 
The U.S. warning to mariners followed U.S. President Donald Trump's threat last month to fire on any Iranian ships that harass U.S. Navy vessels.
The Bahrain-based U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement its notice was ""designed to enhance safety, minimize ambiguity and reduce the risk of miscalculation"".
It follows an incident last month in which 11 Iranian vessels came close to U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Gulf in what the U.S. military called ""dangerous and provocative"" behaviour. Tehran blamed its longtime adversary for the incident.
Friction between Tehran and Washington has risen since 2018, when Trump quit Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions on the country that crippled its economy. 
The head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards last month said Tehran would destroy U.S. warships if its security is threatened in the Gulf.

Iran's clerical rulers consider the U.S. military presence in the Middle East a threat to the Islamic Republic's security.

DHAKA/COX'S BAZAR (Reuters) - Authorities in Bangladesh have moved hundreds of Rohingya refugees living on a flood-prone island in the Bay of Bengal to storm shelters as super cyclone Amphan, the strongest recorded in the region, barrels down, they said on Wednesday. 
The eastern edge of the storm headed for Bangladesh and neighbouring India is expected to batter Bhasan Char island, where 306 Rohingya, members of a persecuted minority from Myanmar, were sent this month after being rescued from boats.
""Each block has a cyclone centre and they have been moved to the centre,"" said Bimal Chakma, a senior official of the Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commission.
The United Nations has called for the refugees to be moved to the mainland to join more than a million more who live in sprawling camps outside the town of Cox’s Bazar.
Although that settlement, the world’s largest refugee camp, is expected to escape the worst of the storm, the danger level has been raised to nine from six, signifying a severe threat.
Heavy rain and high winds lashed the flimsy shelters, built on hills prone to landslides, and red flags were raised to warn refugees to stay inside.
Aid workers say the cyclone could hamper efforts to control a coronavirus outbreak in the camps, which reported their first infections last week.
""It is already a huge challenge to contain the spread of coronavirus amongst the Rohingya refugees living in over-crowded camps, sharing water and toilet facilities,"" said Dipankar Datta, the country director of charity Oxfam in Bangladesh.
Water-borne and other infections were also a threat, he added in a statement.
Bangladeshis and Rohingya are among thousands of volunteers trained in emergency response measures who received life-jackets and torches.
""We are using megaphones and the mosque microphones to warn people,"" said Sabbir Ahmed, a 24-year-old Rohingya volunteer.
Refugees have been told to head for madrasas and schools if the storm destroys shelters, he told Reuters by telephone, adding, ""If it hits the camps there will be huge destruction.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan cannot accept becoming part of China under its ""one country, two systems"" offer of autonomy , President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday, strongly rejecting China's sovereignty claims and likely setting the stage for an ever worsening of ties.
China responded that ""reunification"" was inevitable and that it would never tolerate Taiwan's independence.
In a speech after being sworn in for her second and final term in office, Tsai said relations between Taiwan and China had reached an historical turning point. 
""Both sides have a duty to find a way to coexist over the long term and prevent the intensification of antagonism and differences,"" she said.
Tsai and her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party won January's presidential and parliamentary elections by a landslide, vowing to stand up to China, which claims Taiwan as its own and says it would be brought under Beijing's control by force if needed.
""Here, I want to reiterate the words 'peace, parity, democracy, and dialogue'. We will not accept the Beijing authorities' use of 'one country, two systems' to downgrade Taiwan and undermine the cross-strait status quo. We stand fast by this principle,"" Tsai said.
China uses the ""one country, two systems"" policy, which is supposed to guarantee a high degree of autonomy, to run the former British colony of Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It has offered it to Taiwan, though all major Taiwanese parties have rejected it.
China's Taiwan Affairs Office, responding to Tsai, said Beijing would stick to ""one country, two systems"" - a central tenet of Chinese President Xi Jinping's Taiwan policy - and ""not leave any space for Taiwan independence separatist activities"".
""Reunification is a historical inevitability of the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,"" it said. ""We have the firm will, full confidence, and sufficient ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.""
China views Tsai as a separatist bent on formal independence for Taiwan. Tsai says Taiwan is an independent state called the Republic of China, its official name, and does not want to be part of the People's Republic of China governed by Beijing.
TAIWAN OPEN TO DIALOGUE
China has stepped up its military drills near Taiwan since Tsai's re-election, flying fighter jets into the island's air space and sailing warships around Taiwan.
Tsai said Taiwan has made the greatest effort to maintain peace and stability in the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the democratic island from its autocratic neighbour China.
""We will continue these efforts, and we are willing to engage in dialogue with China and make more concrete contributions to regional security,"" she added, speaking in the garden of the old Japanese governor's house in Taipei, in front of a socially-distanced audience of officials and diplomats.
Taiwan has become a rising source of friction between China and the United States, with the Trump administration strongly backing Taiwan even in the absence of formal diplomatic ties. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo sent his congratulations to Tsai on Tuesday, praising her ""courage and vision in leading Taiwan's vibrant democracy"", in a rare high-level message from Washington direct to Taiwan's government.
China's Foreign Ministry condemned Pompeo's remarks, and said the government would take ""necessary countermeasures"", though did not elaborate.
China cut off a formal talks mechanism with Taiwan in 2016 after Tsai first won election.
Yao Chia-wen, a senior adviser to Tsai, told Reuters the chance of talks with China were small given ongoing tensions.

""We are ready to engage with them any time, but China is unlikely to make concessions to Taiwan,"" he said. ""In the next four years there's little chance for the cross-strait relationship to improve.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - For years, Jeong Nam-poong has found entertainment at daytime discotheques called colatecs that cater to older folks, often losing track of time while dancing the jitterbug under fairy lights and mirror balls.
He can't do that anymore.
With colatecs mostly shut down after coronavirus infections linked to nightclubs raised fears of a second wave of contagion in South Korea, the 89-year old now sleeps for six hours during the day and plays online Janggi, a Korean version of chess, to kill time.
""I miss dancing,"" said the retired tool-store owner, who has been living alone since his wife died 19 years ago. ""It's so depressing not having anyone to talk to all day. I don't just dance there, I find people to talk to, drink tea, and play Janggi.""
Eager to bust a move and chat, Jeong and four of his colatec friends met on Tuesday at a Seoul park for the first time since late February. 
The team - a retired lieutenant colonel, an ex-hotelier, a jitterbug instructor and a housewife - coupled up and boogied to jitterbug music on YouTube, all wearing masks even as sweat dripped down their faces.
In a country where the elderly are the most depressed and impoverished among rich nations, colatecs https://www.reuters.com/article/us-southkorea-ageing-discos/in-daytime-discos-south-koreas-elderly-find-escape-from-anxiety-idUSKBN1HN01L - a portmanteau of ""cola"" and ""discotheque"" - offered comfort to hundreds of thousands of seniors such as Jeong.
Entrance fee is just 1,000 won ($0.82), and a kimchi soup or a soybean-paste soup with a bowl of rice costs only 5,000 won at many, Jeong and his friends said.
The number of senior South Koreans is ballooning faster than in any other developed country, but businesses catering to the elderly are some of the hardest hit by the pandemic. 
South Korea, which once had the second-highest number of cases behind China, controlled the virus' spread without having to take severe measures such as imposing a national lockdown or forcing businesses to close. It now has about 11,000 cases.
But a spike in infections linked to Seoul's Itaewon nightlife district in early May led to shutdowns of discos and bars across the country, after weeks of nearly no new domestic coronavirus cases. 
Yoon Ji-won, the ex-hotelier, says Korea's young clubbers took away her ""playground.""
""Why should we suffer? We wore masks and put on sanitary gels before dancing. All of us were very careful not to get into any sort of trouble because we knew it could really kill us, you know, when you're my age,"" the 61-year-old said. 
Another jitterbug veteran who identified himself only as 'Qingdao Wind,' says he has moved from colatecs to hiking and camping because his dance friends are now spending time in Geomdansan, a mountain near Misari, east of Seoul.

""I also like camping, but there's nothing like gliding through the dance floor with a partner and some music,"" he said.

An investigation into the death of Sabri Choubi was ongoing, said the prosecutor's department for the district of Pontoise, which handles judicial matters for Argenteuil. It added that initial findings did not show Choubi's motorcycle had been in a collision with a police car, as some of the victim's associates had alleged.
Officials at the Paris police department could not be immediately reached for comment on the unrest overnight, but the AnonymeCitoyen twitter feed and residents in the suburb of Argenteuil posted videos and photographs of burnt out cars and riot police in the area.
Residents in the nearby suburb of Bezons also posted videos on Twitter of a large fire, though it was unclear what was burning.
France's banlieues are frequently flashpoints of anger over social and economic inequality and allegations of heavy-handed policing.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan's restaurants and bars slowly open up from a coronavirus lockdown, many are looking to reassure the public that dining out is safe again and one Japanese-style izakaya pub thinks it has found the perfect solution.
The pub in Tokyo's normally bustling Shinjuku district has installed a machine that sprays customers with hypochlorous acid water as they enter.
Customers are first greeted by a hostess on a monitor, of course, who instructs them to disinfect their hands and check their temperature with a thermometer provided.
They then step into a machine that looks like an airport security scanner, or a car-wash for humans, to get sprayed with a fine mist of the chlorine-based disinfectant for 30 seconds.
Customers then pick up a map that guides them to their seat where they order with smartphones.
Throughout the process they have not come into contact with a single person.
""We wanted to develop a system that is in accordance with the new lifestyle and something that is a high model that could prevent infection,"" said the president of the Kichiri&Co group that owns the pub.
""It’s still an experiment, but once we develop the system, we want to share the know-how at each of our restaurants.""
A clear acrylic screen is set up between each diner to further minimise the risk of infection, and it seems to work.
""I feel safe,"" said one woman customer who didn't want to be identified.
""But being in there for 30 seconds was a bit long. I was like, when will this be over.”

Kichiri has also installed a spraying booth, which cost more than 700,000 yen (US$6,493), at a pub in Osaka city, where the government is expected to lift a coronavirus emergency on Thursday. It remains in place in Tokyo.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Unable to hold a mass vigil due to coronavirus controls, the people of Hong Kong should light candles across the city to commemorate pro-democracy protesters killed in Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in 1989, an organiser said on Wednesday.
This year's June 4 anniversary of the crackdown by China's communist rulers would be extremely sensitive, after the anti-government mass protests and sometimes violent unrest seen in semi-autonomous Hong Kong since July last year.
In past years, tens of thousands of people in Hong Kong have joined sombre and peaceful candlelit vigils in a downtown park in the biggest commemoration of the 1989 crackdown in Beijing, when Chinese troops opened fire on student-led protesters.
On Tuesday, Hong Kong authorities said the limit on group gatherings to no more than eight people would be extended at least until the end of the day on June 4.
Lee Cheuk-yan, chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, which organises the annual vigils, told Reuters on Wednesday he believed the motive for the extension was ""political suppression."" 
Police have still to respond to an application for the annual vigil to be held in Victoria Park, Lee said, adding that he was ""not optimistic.""
""We have to have a plan B,"" Lee said. ""Instead of one point, we will do it everywhere, still with the powerful candlelight to condemn the massacre and mourn for those who died in 1989.""
The death toll given by officials days after the crackdown was about 300, most of them soldiers, with only 23 students confirmed killed. China has never provided a full accounting of the violence, but rights groups and witnesses say the figure could run into the thousands. The topic is taboo in China.
Lee said the Tiananmen vigil represented ""a litmus test for one country, two systems"" - the agreement governing Britain's handover of the city to China in 1997, which gives it freedoms unavailable on the mainland.
Health Secretary Sophia Chan and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said on Tuesday health measures were not based on political considerations.
Hong Kong has recorded few new coronavirus cases recently, with the total lingering just above 1,000, but on May 13 the city reported its first case in more than three weeks involving someone who had not travelled overseas.
Authorities allowed bars, cinemas and gyms to re-open earlier this month and said religious gatherings can resume with certain safety rules. Bath houses, karaoke bars and night clubs will stay closed for another week.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A man has been sentenced to death in Singapore via a Zoom video-call for his role in a drug deal, the city-state's first case where capital punishment has been delivered remotely.
Punithan Genasan, a 37-year-old Malaysian, received the sentence for his role in a 2011 heroin transaction on Friday, court documents showed, with the country under lockdown to try and curb one of the highest coronavirus rates in Asia. 
""For the safety of all involved in the proceedings, the hearing for Public Prosecutor v Punithan A/L Genasan was conducted by video-conferencing,"" a spokesperson for Singapore's Supreme Court said in response to Reuters' questions, citing restrictions imposed to minimise virus spread. 
It was the first criminal case where a death sentence was pronounced by remote hearing in Singapore, the spokesperson added. 
Genasan's lawyer, Peter Fernando, said his client received the judge's verdict on a Zoom call and is considering an appeal.
While rights groups have criticised the use of Zoom in capital cases, Fernando said he did not object to the use of video-conferencing for Friday's call since it was only to receive the judge's verdict, which could be heard clearly, and no other legal arguments were presented.    
California-based tech firm Zoom did not immediately respond to a request for comment made via its representatives in Singapore. The Attorney General's Chambers, the public prosecutor, referred Reuters' questions to the Supreme Court.
Many court hearings in Singapore have been adjourned during a lockdown period that started in early April and is due to run until June 1, while cases deemed essential have been held remotely. 
Singapore has a zero-tolerance policy for illegal drugs and has hanged hundreds of people - including dozens of foreigners - for narcotics offences over past decades, rights groups say.
""Singapore's use of the death penalty is inherently cruel and inhumane, and the use of remote technology like Zoom to sentence a man to death makes it even more so,"" said Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Asia division. HRW has also criticised a similar case in Nigeria where a death sentence was delivered via Zoom.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In an alert that appeared aimed squarely at Iran, the U.S. Navy issued a warning on Tuesday to mariners in the Gulf to stay 100 meters (yards) away from U.S. warships or risk being ""interpreted as a threat and subject to lawful defensive measures.""
The notice to mariners, which was first reported by Reuters, follows U.S. President Donald Trump's threat last month to fire on any Iranian ships that harass Navy vessels. 
""Armed vessels approaching within 100 meters of a U.S. naval vessel may be interpreted as a threat,"" according to the text of the notice, which can be seen here. (https:// A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the new notice to mariners was not a change in the U.S. military's rules of engagement.  The Pentagon has stated that Trump's threat was meant to underscore the Navy's right to self-defense. The Bahrain-based U.S. Naval Forces Central Command said in a statement that its notice was ""designed to enhance safety, minimize ambiguity and reduce the risk of miscalculation.""  It follows an incident last month in which 11 Iranian vessels came close to U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Gulf, in what the U.S. military called ""dangerous and provocative"" behavior. At one point, the Iranian vessels came within 10 yards (9 meters) of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Maui, the U.S. military said. Trump's threat followed that incident, which Tehran, in turn, said was the fault of the United States.  The head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards responded to Trump by threatening to destroy U.S. warships if its security is threatened in the Gulf. The back-and-forth is just latest example of razor-sharp tension between Washington and Tehran, which has steadily escalated since 2018, when Trump withdrew from Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers and reimposed crippling sanctions. Animosity reached historic heights in early January, when the United States killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad.  Iran retaliated on Jan. 9 by firing missiles at bases in Iraq, causing brain injuries among U.S. troops at one of them. Close interactions with Iranian military vessels were not uncommon in 2016 and 2017. On several occasions, U.S. Navy ships fired warning shots at Iranian vessels when they got too close. 
But Iran had halted such maneuvers before the April incident.

The government is also talking with Australian universities about allowing the return of some international students, a sector that contributes more than A$30 billion ($19.6 billion) to the domestic coffers.
New South Wales, the country's largest state, will allow people to resume travel for pleasure from next month, effectively reopening tourist regions on its southern coast that were badly damaged by huge bushfires before the epidemic.
""We will play our part as the largest state, traditionally the economic powerhouse of the nation, to make sure we generate as much economic activity as possible in a safe environment,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
""We want people to enjoy themselves, to feel free, but at the same time please know that nothing we do is the same during a pandemic.""
Australia has reported just over 7,000 infections, including 100 deaths, and has completed around 1.1 million tests among its population of 25 million. Health Minister Greg Hunt said just 11 new cases were logged over the past 24 hours. 
Australia's states and territories are implementing a three-step federal government plan to unwind lockdown measures that have been in place for two months, but the staggered pace means different restrictions around the country at any point in time.
South Australia state said it planned to move more quickly to phase two, allowing more people to enjoy eating and drinking in restaurants and bars. Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania, which have all reported low numbers of cases, are maintaining border closures. 
The resumption of business and social life across the country comes amid a dispute with China over Australia's leading role in the push for a global inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.
China this week supported a comprehensive review by the World Health Organisation, but has been angered by what it views as a more targeted inquiry pushed by Australia. Beijing this week imposed hefty barley tariffs on Australian imports.
""We would be disappointed if there was any process of conflating these issues,"" Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne told Australian Broadcasting Corp radio.
The disagreement could affect universities' plans to lure back pupils. Chinese students account for almost 40% of the international higher education population.
SMARTPHONE APP
In Victoria, the country's second most populous state, health authorities revealed they were using a controversial smartphone contact tracing app for the first time to track the movements of an infected person.
Almost 6 million Australians have downloaded the COVID-safe app, still short of the 40% of 18 million smartphone users the government has said would make it an effective tool, amid privacy concerns about the use of the data. 

Authorities have said the use of the app is restricted to state health officials but have so far provided limited detail on its use.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Norma McCorvey, the woman known as ""Jane Roe"" in the landmark 1973 U.S. Supreme Court Roe v. Wade ruling legalizing abortion, said she was lying when she switched to support the anti-abortion movement, saying she had been paid to do so.
In a new documentary, made before her death in 2017 and due to be broadcast on Friday, McCorvey makes what she calls a ""deathbed confession.""
""I took their money and they took me out in front of the cameras and told me what to say,"" she says on camera. ""I did it well too. I am a good actress. Of course, I'm not acting now.""
""If a young woman wants to have an abortion, that’s no skin off my ass. That’s why they call it choice,"" she added.
""AKA Jane Roe,"" will be broadcast on the FX cable channel on Friday but was made available to television journalists in advance. 
It traces McCorvey's troubled youth, how she became the poster child of abortion rights and her about-face in the 1990s when she announced she was baptized as a born-again Christian who campaigned against abortion.
The documentary was filmed in the last months of her life before her death at age 69 in 2017 in Texas.
The 1973 Supreme Court ruling has for decades been the focus of a divisive political, legal and moral debate. 
The Rev. Robert Schenck, one of the evangelical pastors who worked with McCorvey after her conversion to Christianity in the mid-1990s, looked stunned as he was shown her interview as part of the documentary.
Schenck said the anti-abortion movement had exploited her weaknesses for its own ends and acknowledged she had been paid for her appearances on the movement's behalf.
""What we did with Norma was highly unethical,"" Schenck said in the documentary. ""The jig is up.""
In a separate blog post on Tuesday, Schenck said he hoped people would watch ""AKA Jane Roe.""
""You’ll see me express profound regret for how movement leaders (like me) mistreated Norma,"" he wrote in the blog.

""Her name and photo would command some of the largest windfalls of dollars for my group and many others, but the money we gave her was modest. More than once, I tried to make up for it with an added check, but it was never fair.""

The ministry suspects hackers stole performance requirements that were sent to several defence-industry companies as part of the bidding process for the project, the Asahi reported, citing government sources whom it did not identify. Mitsubishi Electric did not win the bid for the prototype, the newspaper said.
Mitsubishi Electric said it was investigating the report but had no other immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. The defence ministry also did not provide an immediate comment. 
The missile is of a type in use by countries including the United States, China and Russia, which flies at supersonic speeds over long distances and can pass through enemy missile defence networks to make precision strikes, the newspaper said. Japan has been researching such missiles since fiscal 2018, it said.
Among the leaked details may have been range, propulsion and heat resistance, according to the newspaper.

President Pierre Nkurunziza, whose government has repeatedly been accused of rights abuses, will step down after 15 years. His ruling CNDD-FDD party candidate, retired army general Evariste Ndayishimiye, is running against opposition leader Agathon Rwasa and five others.
The election is meant to usher in the first democratic transition in 58 years of independence for the impoverished east African nation, after widespread international criticism of its last election in 2015, when Nkurunziza ran for a third term.
His opponents said the move violated a peace deal that ended the civil war and boycotted the poll. The election sparked violent protests that drove hundreds of thousands of Burundians into exile. U.N. reports documented hundreds of killings and the torture and gang-rape of opposition activists. Donors withdrew funding in protest.
The government denies accusations of rights violations.
Rwasa, like Nkurunziza a former rebel leader, warned about possible electoral fraud in his final rally on Sunday.
""We know there is plan of election fraud, some are even intimidating people asking for their voter cards to vote for them,"" he said. ""All of that is worthless."" 
The U.N. and the African Union said they ""remain concerned about reports of intimidation and violent clashes between supporters of opposing sides"", in a joint statement on Sunday.
There will be few election monitors after the government said they would have to go into a 14-day quarantine to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. 
The government expelled the national head of the World Health Organization (WHO) last week following public criticism that all parties were holding rallies despite the disease. 

So far, the tiny East African nation has reported only 42 coronavirus case and one death. Testing remains very low, however - the nation of 11 million has carried out only 633 tests, according to the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention.

""We decided to move our forces in all battlefronts in Tripoli a distance of 2-3 kilometres"" to allow citizens to move more freely during the end of Ramadan and in the run-up to the Eid al-Fitr holiday, Ahmed al-Mismari said. 
Mismari called on the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), whose forces the LNA is fighting, to do the same but did not say whether its own withdrawal was contingent on it doing so. The GNA has yet to comment. 
In its biggest advance in a year, the GNA on Monday captured Watiya airbase, an important LNA stronghold and its only major airbase near to Tripoli, along with an abandoned Russian-made Pantsir air defence system. 
On Tuesday, it took the towns of Badr and Tiji in western Libya as the LNA said it had moved out of some positions in Tripoli, where the front lines have been mostly static for nearly a year. 
The eastern-based LNA is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. The GNA is backed by Turkey. 
The acting United Nations Libya envoy on Tuesday urged the Security Council to pressure foreign actors to stop helping the warring parties there, warning the flood of arms and fighters into Libya would only intensify fighting. 
The UAE said in a statement the only acceptable path forward in Libya involved ""an immediate, comprehensive ceasefire and a return to the political process"".

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada and the United States have agreed to extend a ban on non-essential cross-border travel by another 30 days to help the fight against the coronavirus, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday.
""This is an important decision that will keep people in both of our countries safe,"" Trudeau told reporters. The ban, introduced in mid-March, was extended in April until May 21.
Similar restrictions are in place between the United States and Mexico. A U.S. official told Reuters the three nations planned to announce an extension before the limitations expire on Wednesday.
Relations between Canada and the United States have steadily improved since a low point in June 2018, when U.S. President Donald Trump accused Trudeau of being weak.
Trump though said on Tuesday that Washington should consider terminating trade deals under which it imports cattle. A new free trade agreement between the United States, Canada and Mexico comes into effect on July 1.
Canadian officials did not respond to requests for comment. Canada exported C$2.75 billion worth of beef in 2018, 74% of it to the United States.
The restrictions do not cover trade across a border that stretches 5,525 miles (8,891 km).
Trudeau said when non-essential travel restarted, Canada would need ""to have strong measures in place"".
Acting U.S. Department of Homeland Security chief Chad Wolf said Washington would examine how Canada and Mexico were handling the outbreak.
""What we don't want to do is try to open up parts of our economy and have a lot of folks coming across the border that we haven't seen in the past 50 or 60 days,"" he said at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event.

Canada's total coronavirus death toll edged up by less than 1% to 5,857, the lowest daily increase since the crisis started, official data showed.

KABUL (Reuters) - Gunmen opened fire in a mosque in central Afghanistan on Tuesday evening, killing eight worshippers breaking their Ramadan fast and wounding five others, officials said.
""Unknown gunmen fired on people praying inside a mosque during iftar time,"" said Wahida Shahkar, spokeswoman for the governor of Parwan province, referring to the meal eaten to break daytime fasting during the Islamic holy month.
The Ministry of Interior confirmed the attack in Parwan's provincial capital Charekar, blaming it on the insurgent Taliban. The Taliban denied responsibility and said Afghan security forces were to blame.
The United Nations has warned of an alarming uptick in violence against civilians in Afghanistan. A shocking attack on a Kabul maternity ward last week killed 24 people, including newborn babies.
Violence increased around the country even after a Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban pact on the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees. 
Afghan security forces on Tuesday clashed with Taliban fighters around the city of Kunduz, a strategically important centre that has been one of the Taliban's main targets and which the group has briefly captured twice in recent years. 
Security forces largely repelled the Taliban offensive with the help of air support and Assadullah Khalid, acting minister of defence, said during a visit to the city that more than 50 insurgents and eight security force members had been killed. 
The Taliban have rejected repeated calls for a ceasefire by the Afghan government. They deny any involvement in the maternity ward attack and the United States believes the Islamic State was responsible. 
The United States has sent special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad to Doha and Kabul to press the Afghan government and the Taliban to start stalled peace talks. Khalilzad has said he will push for a reduction in violence during the trip.

BRASILIA/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The World Health Organization's director for the Americas warned on Tuesday of a coronavirus surge across the region and voiced hope for continuing U.S. help to tackle the outbreak, despite President Donald Trump's threat to permanently halt WHO funding.
Carissa Etienne, the head of the WHO-affiliated Pan American Health Organization, said U.S. contributions account for about 60% of the regional health agency's budget. She also pointed to successful past collaborations with the U.S. government to combat diseases like malaria and yellow fever.
However, in recent days Trump has ramped up his criticism of the WHO's response to the coronavirus pandemic, threatening to reconsider his government's membership of the global body and to permanently end its funding.
""As the curve of the pandemic flattens or falls in other parts of the world, the virus is surging across our region,"" Etienne told a virtual briefing on COVID-19 in the Americas. 
""PAHO hopes that we will continue collaboration with the United States and all of our allies.""
She said COVID-19 cases reached more than 2 million across the Americas as of Monday, with deaths standing at 121,000: ""This represents a staggering increase of 14% for cases and for deaths from just last week,"" Etienne said.
PAHO officials voiced concern the new coronavirus was spreading rapidly in the tri-border area of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) between Colombia, Peru and Brazil, which currently has the worst outbreak of any developing nation. The regional outbreak threatens to infect remote indigenous communities in the rainforest.
Etienne added there were about 20,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in Amazon provinces, and isolated villages there have minimal access to healthcare.
PAHO officials urged that special measures be taken to protect vulnerable populations among the indigenous, poor and racial minorities. 
They said the contagion was moving fast in densely populated Amazon border cities such as Manaus, Leticia and Iquitos, and the greatest danger was that COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, risked spreading to indigenous villages in the forest where inhabitants had no protection.

Separately, PAHO communicable diseases director Marcos Espinal said there was ""no evidence"" to recommend the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19, after Trump said he was taking the drug despite his own government's warnings on its use.

The easing will take place nearly two and a half months after lockdown measures were imposed across the country of 17 million in mid-March.

Israel does not have diplomatic relations with any of the six Gulf Arab countries, and there are no commercial flights between them. It has relations with only two Arab countries: Egypt and Jordan. 
However, shared concerns over Iran's influence in the region have led to a discrete thaw in ties between Israel and the Arab Gulf in recent years. 
That thaw has been accompanied by a slight relaxation of stringent air travel rules. In 2018, Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for the first time to a commercial flight to Israel - an Air India route between New Delhi and Tel Aviv. 
""Etihad Airways operated a dedicated humanitarian cargo flight from Abu Dhabi to Tel Aviv on 19 May to provide medical supplies to the Palestinians,"" an Etihad spokeswoman said, adding that there were no passengers on board.
An official at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport said the flight would arrive at 9 p.m. (1900 GMT). 
The United Nations coordinated a 14-tonne shipment of ""urgent medical supplies"" from the UAE to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in the Palestinian territories, according to a statement from the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East Peace Process (UNSCO).

The girls were killed last week in the deeply conservative and war-torn northwestern area of North Waziristan in what police suspect was an act of ""honour killing"". 
Police say the video which they believe prompted the girls' murder was shot a year ago but had only recently been uploaded on social media. 
""The females were sisters, identified as Jasima Bibi and Saeeda Bibi,"" North Waziristan police chief Shafiullah Gandapur told Reuters.
Their family had been displaced by a military operation against militants in their hometown, he said. 
He said the man who was filmed kissing them in a 44-second video was arrested on Monday together with a friend who police believe uploaded the video, but police believe the murder suspect fled to Karachi, Pakistan's largest city.
Police also said the girls' father and uncle had been arrested on suspicion of concealing the murder and evidence.
The killing is the first high-profile criminal case to be pursued in the formerly autonomous tribal region, where ultra-conservative customs present a big challenge for police.
Pakistan extended police jurisdiction to the area in 2018, ending more than a century of relatively autonomous rule in a region used by Taliban and al Qaeda militants to launch attacks in Pakistan and neighbouring Afghanistan.  
Police said the girls' relatives and local residents did not want a case registered because of ""local traditions"", so the police became the complainant in the case.

Thousands of incidents of violence against women perceived to have ""damaged"" family honour are reported in Pakistan each year and many more go unreported, rights groups say. Pakistan enacted legislation to protect against ""honour killings"" in 2016.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has suggested that world leaders send video statements for the world body's annual September meeting because it is ""highly unlikely"" they will be able to travel to New York during the coronavirus pandemic. 
New York is an epicenter for COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus that has infected more than 4.8 million people and killed over 319,000 globally. The U.S. death toll has surpassed 90,000.
In a letter to the president of the 193-member U.N. General Assembly on Monday, Guterres suggested a different format be considered for the 75th annual gathering ""such as using pre-recorded messages provided by heads of state and government or ministers, with physical presence in the General Assembly Hall limited to one delegate per delegation based in New York.""
Guterres said that while another option would be to postpone the high-level gathering until 2021, he believed it would be better for world leaders to be able to make their statements in September.
""It would also allow for the work of the organization to continue, albeit in a different format, and for world leaders to convey their views on important international issues, including on the international response to the pandemic, as well as to hear the views of other leaders,"" Guterres wrote. 
Ultimately, the decision on how to hold the gathering of world leaders will be made by the 193 U.N. member states. Hundreds of other events are also normally held during the week-long gathering in September, but diplomats say they will be canceled this year. 
The U.N. General Assembly and the 15-member Security Council have been operating virtually for two months. That is likely to continue until at least the end of June.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The murder of his estranged wife during a well-publicised love triangle proved one problem too many for Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, who survived repeated security crises to become Lesotho's dominant politician but resigned on Tuesday.
His replacement, Finance Minister Moeketsi Majoro, is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday
Thabane's departure brings down the curtain on a career marked by exile, political feuding, intrigue and strains with the military. 
Thabane leaves nearly three years into a second term that began when he was sworn in -- two days after gunmen shot his estranged second wife Lipolelo dead in her car.
Two months after Lipolelo's death, he married his long-time lover, Maesaiah. This year, police charged Maesaiah with assassinating Lipolelo. They have also accused Thabane of being involved, although they have not brought charges to court.
Both he and Maesaiah have repeatedly denied having anything to do with killing Lipolelo. But the charges plunged the country into turmoil, and voices in Thabane's own party began pushing for him to leave. 
It is not the first time Thabane, a stocky, shaven-headed figure fond of quoting Bible passages, has been at the centre of intrigue -- in 2014, he fled the kingdom to neighbouring South Africa after accusing the military of staging a coup.
South African security forces escorted him back, one of many times tiny Lesotho, with 2 million people, has drawn its bigger neighbour into its political turmoil.
Thabane was born on May 28, 1939, in what was then Britain's colony of Basutoland, composed of mountains running along South Africa's Drakensberg range.
MILITARY JUNTA
He began his career in the civil service in 1966, the year of Lesotho's independence. He stayed there for two decades before the military seized power in a 1986 coup, one of several since independence.
The military junta promoted him, making him foreign, and then information, minister. Thabane helped negotiate a return to civilian rule and repatriation of exiles, culminating in 1993 elections.
In the next poll, in 1998, he won a parliamentary seat and became foreign minister. Months later, accusations of electoral fraud triggered rioting, and Nelson Mandela, then South African president, deployed troops to try to quell it. They failed, pulling out after seven months. 
In 2006, after several ministerial posts in the LCD ruling party, Thabane left to form the All Basotho Convention (ABC), enabling him to take power as prime minister in 2012. 
In the same year, he filed for divorce from his wife, Lipolelo, so he could marry Maesaiah. Lipolelo refused, and a very public spat erupted between them.
Thabane failed to retain his majority in a 2015 election. He resigned as premier before fleeing again to South Africa, whose security forces he saw as protection against his own military. 

He spent much of his time there, at his house in Ficksberg, until he won an election on June 3, 2017. Eleven days later, eight gunmen shot Lipolelo in the head, killing her instantly, police say. Two days after that, Thabane was sworn in as prime minister for a second time.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The acting U.N. Libya envoy urged the Security Council on Tuesday to pressure foreign actors to stop helping the North African country's warring parties, warning that the flood of weapons and mercenaries will only intensify fighting. 
The oil-producing state descended into chaos after the NATO-backed overthrow of leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. Since 2014, Libya has been split with the internationally recognized government controlling the capital Tripoli and the northwest, while military leader Khalifa Haftar in Benghazi rules the east. 
Haftar launched an offensive a year ago to grab Tripoli. He is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey. Libya has been under a U.N. arms embargo since 2011.
""From what we are witnessing in terms of the massive influx of weaponry, equipment and mercenaries to the two sides, the only conclusion that we can draw is that this war will intensify, broaden and deepen,"" acting U.N. Libya envoy Stephanie Williams (NYSE:WMB) told the council.
""We must not let Libya slip away,"" she said. ""This council can ensure the collective security it is mandated to maintain by applying consistent and credible pressure on those regional and international actors that are fueling the conflict.""
Russian private military contractor Wagner Group has up to 1,200 people deployed in Libya to strengthen Haftar's forces, according to a U.N. report.
""All actors involved in the conflict in Libya must immediately suspend military operations,"" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Kelly Craft said. ""They must halt the ongoing transfer of foreign military equipment and personnel to Libya, including ... Wagner Group mercenaries."" 
The Security Council has repeatedly called on all countries to abide by the arms embargo and not to intervene or take measures that would exacerbate fighting. The council could call out states publicly or impose targeted sanctions.

Developed economies have channelled trillions of dollars into health initiatives and economic stimulus at home. But the presidents - from Kenya, Ivory Coast, Sierra Leone, Senegal and Niger - said they could not afford such measures in their own countries.
""We're not in a position to protect companies, to preserve jobs. There's an injustice that is again being exposed by COVID-19,"" Senegal's President Macky Sall said during a virtual roundtable organised by the New York Forum Institute think-tank.
While Africa, with a limited capacity to test, has recorded just a fraction of the world's coronavirus cases, it has been hit hard by the economic fallout from global trade disruptions, falling oil and commodities prices and the lockdowns deployed to fight the disease's spread.
Africa has called for a $100 billion stimulus package from wealthy nations, forgiveness of bilateral debt and a suspension of private debt service.
""More must be done,"" said Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara, a former senior official at the International Monetary Fund. ""There's been a selfishness on the part of industrialised nations for decades."" 
Last month, the Group of 20 wealthy economies backed an IMF and World Bank call for a suspension of bilateral debt service for the world's poorest countries.
Not all African countries qualify for the initiative however, and some that do have not requested relief fearing it could impact future access to capital markets. Lenders, meanwhile, have shown little appetite for broad relief on Africa's private debt.
President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, which is eschewing the G20 initiative, said the world had a duty to give Africa the fiscal space to take care of its people. 

""This is not a handout. This is support based on a crisis that was not created on the African continent,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - Rwandan genocide suspect Felicien Kabuga was arraigned before a French public prosecutor on Tuesday, three days after police swooped on his hideout in a Paris suburb, ending a 26-year manhunt.
The 84-year-old is accused of funding and arming militias that massacred about 800,000 people. He was indicted in 1997 on seven criminal counts including genocide, all in relation to the 1994 Rwanda genocide.
Kabuga arrived at the Paris Appeals Court complex under heavy police protection. Outriders flanked the convoy and armed officers guarded the entrance. The hearing began about three hours later, a judicial source said. 
The prosecutor was to set out the legal process before the case is passed to investigative judges who will decide whether to transfer Kabuga to a U.N. court handling alleged crimes against humanity.
At least one French-based genocide victim support group said it was considering legal action to unearth how Kabuga was able to go underground in France and what help he had received.
""He was our Klaus Barbie, our (Adolf) Eichmann,"" said Etienne Nsanzimana, president of support group Ibuka France, referring to two prominent Nazi war criminals. 
""How did he stay on the run for 26 years? For how many years was he in France and receiving help to live comfortably. I don't think it was just his family,"" Nsanzimana added.
Reuters has not been able to find any public comment made by Kabuga over the years about the charges. French lawyer Emmanuel Altit, who will be defending Kabuga, did not respond to a request seeking comment from his client.
Some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in 100 days of killing from April 6, 1994, orchestrated by the Hutu-led government and its ethnic militia allies. 
Kabuga, a Hutu businessman, is accused of bankrolling the militia.
It is not known when or how Kabuga, who had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head, entered France. 

France's justice ministry has said he lived under a false identity in Asnieres-sur-Seine on the outskirts of Paris.

The Mozambican interior minister said on Friday security forces had killed around 50 insurgents in recent days in the northern Cabo Delgado region that has been plagued by violence for several years.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, who chaired a summit including the leaders of Botswana, Zambia and Mozambique, cited a growing risk of religious extremism and radicalization in southern Africa, threatening peace and security.
The meeting, under the auspices of the Southern African Development Community's (SADC) defence and security organ, was assessing the security situation in Mozambique.
""The extraordinary organ troika summit plus Mozambique committed and urged SADC member states to support the government of Mozambique in fighting against the terrorists and armed groups in some districts of Cabo Delgado,"" the SADC said in a communique after the summit.
The statement did not say whether SADC would send troops to fight the militias. Mnangagwa said the situation in Mozambique called for ""an enhanced joint action given the transnational nature of the terrorist groups"".
Since 2017, infrequent but violent raids on government buildings and villages by militias in Cabo Delgado have intensified, threatening one of Africa's poorest nations.
Little is known about the insurgents, though initial attacks were claimed by a group known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama. More recently, Islamic State has claimed a number of attacks which security officials have struggled to contain.

 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Total are among big international energy companies developing natural gas projects offshore from northern Mozambique.

Taiwan lobbied hard to be included as an observer at the two-day virtual meeting and received strong support from the United States, Japan and others, but says it was not invited due to opposition from China.
""There are still a few countries determined to plead for Taiwan authorities, seriously violating relevant U.N. and WHO resolutions and undermining global anti-epidemic efforts,"" Chen Xu, the Chinese ambassador, told the virtual assembly.
""China solemnly protests and firmly opposes this behaviour.""
Taiwan is locked out of U.N. organisations such as the WHO due to the objections of China, which considers it a breakaway province with no right to the trappings of a sovereign state.
The WHO says it is bound by U.N. protocol, and that Taiwan can only be included in WHO meetings if the members make a decision to do so.
Several delegates protested at Taiwan's exclusion in their speeches, including senior U.S. diplomat Howard Solomon in closing remarks as well as Haiti and Paraguay.
Shortly after the U.S. speech, Chen dismissed the remarks as ""political hype"", saying: ""This conduct is not acceptable.""

Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, is due to say on Wednesday that the island will continue to strive to participate actively in global bodies despite the setback at the WHO.

Tsai and her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party won January's presidential and parliamentary elections by a landslide, vowing to stand up to China, which claims Taiwan as its own, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if needed.
China views Tsai, who will be sworn into office for her second and final term on Wednesday, as a separatist bent on formal independence for Taiwan. She says Taiwan is already an independent state called the Republic of China, its official name.
Tsai will say at her inauguration that Taiwan will seek to ""actively participate"" in international bodies and deepen its cooperation with like-minded countries, generally a reference to the United States and its allies, according to an outline of her speech provided by Presidential Office spokesman Alex Huang.
Taiwan sees the need for participation in WHO as all the more urgent because of the coronavirus pandemic, which was first reported in China.
Taiwan is locked out of most global organisations like the WHO due to the objections of China, which considers the island one of its provinces with no right to the trappings of a sovereign state.
Despite an intense lobbying effort and strong support from the United States, Japan, Britain, Germany, Australia, New Zealand and others, it was unable to take part in this week's meeting of the World Health Assembly.
On relations with China, Tsai will reiterate her commitment to peace, dialogue and equality, but that Taiwan will not accept China's ""one country, two systems"" model that ""belittles"" Taiwan.
China uses this system, which is supposed to guarantee a high degree of autonomy, to run the former British colony of Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. It has offered it to Taiwan too, though all major Taiwanese parties have rejected it.

Tsai will also pledge to speed up the development of ""asymmetric warfare"" capabilities, and boost renewable technologies in a move to position Taiwan as a hub of clean energy in the Asia Pacific.

NEW DELHI/BHUBANESWAR (Reuters) - India will run more special trains and buses to allow millions of distressed migrant workers to leave big cities, the federal government said on Tuesday, as concerns grew in some states over rising infections from those returning home.
Workers are walking long distances to their homes in the countryside ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed a vast lockdown in March to control the spread of coronavirus, shutting down all public transport.
After initially trying to keep them in their cities of employment, authorities are now helping them get home.
The federal home ministry said it was working with states to run special trains and buses, and set up rest stops for those on foot.
The move came as India's confirmed cases surged past 100,000 on Tuesday, outstripping China, where the virus emerged late last year.
The concern is that migrants, who are leaving coronavirus hotspots such as Mumbai, New Delhi and Ahmedabad, could be carrying the virus into the hinterland.
Since early May, around 70% of all coronavirus cases in the densely populated eastern state of Bihar have been linked to migrant workers, the state's top health official, Sanjay Kumar, said.
""The top priority is the people who are coming from Delhi because they have the highest percentage of positive cases,"" Kumar told Reuters.
In Odisha, also in the east, 851 out of 978 confirmed cases till Tuesday were returnees, mostly migrant workers, according to state data.
In the state's Ganjam district, more than 53,000 migrants have been screened and quarantined since early March, and another 200,000 are expected later this month, a health official said.
The official said managing such numbers was a challenge.

""Things are under control but we could have handled it much better had people been brought in smaller numbers in phases,"" he said.

New York-based HRW accused Congo authorities of using ""excessive force"" in dealing with the Bundu dia Kongo (BDK) group, whose leader had urged followers to chase other ethnic groups out of their core area of support in the country's west.
""Congolese authorities had a responsibility to respond to the BDK movement's messages that incite ethnic hatred,"" said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at HRW.
""However, the government response violated international standards on the use of force, causing a bloodbath,"" he said in an HRW report on the incidents in April. 
“The government needs to get to the bottom of these violent raids and hold wrongdoers to account, whatever their rank.""
In April, the interior ministry said police had killed 22 BDK members in two raids, one of which led to the arrest of BDK leader Ne Muanda Nsemi at his home in the capital Kinshasa.
But HRW's report said 55 were killed and dozens wounded during those raids and several other incidents, citing more than 50 interviews conducted with victims, witnesses, BDK members, government and U.N. officials.
Interior Minister Gilbert Kankonde did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment. 
Quoted in Tuesday's report, he told HRW that investigations were ongoing into the April 22 police raid on a house containing BDK supporters in Songololo in Kongo-Central province.
Nsemi, a self-styled prophet and ex-member of parliament, had a strong following in the west of the country where he hoped to restore the Kongo kingdom that thrived around the mouth of the Congo River for centuries before the colonial era.
Nsemi was previously arrested in March 2017 after leading violent protests against then-President Joseph Kabila, only to escape prison with the help of supporters two months later.

Balochistan is at the centre of the $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, part of Beijing's massive Belt and Road infrastructure project. 
But separatist, Islamist and ethnic violence afflicts the impoverished province, fuelling concern about the security of projects such as a planned energy link from western China to Pakistan's southern port of Gwadar.
Six of the soldiers were killed by an improvised explosive device as they were returning late on Monday night from a routine patrol to their camp in Pir Ghaib in the Mach district of Balochistan, the military's media wing said in a statement.
Another soldier was killed during an exchange of fire with militants in the Mand area of Kech district, it said.

MASERU (Reuters) - Lesotho's Prime Minister Thomas Thabane bowed to pressure to resign on Tuesday, three months after police named him and his current wife as suspects in the murder of his former wife in a case that has transfixed the southern African nation.
Thabane's departure marks the end of one of Lesotho's longest political careers, one marked by exile, intrigue, tensions with the military and a political crisis that deepened when police named him as a murder suspect in February.
""The time to retire from the great theatre of action, take leave from public life and office has finally arrived,"" the 80-year-old Thabane told citizens in a speech on Lesotho TV. 
His own All Basotho Convention (ABC) party, opposition figures and South African mediators had all been pressing Thabane to resign over the murder case.
Gunmen shot dead his previous wife, Lipolelo, on June 14, 2017, two days before he took office.
Maesaiah has been formally charged with the murder. Though named as a suspect, Thabane has not been charged. They both deny any involvement.
Lawmakers have said Thabane was not offered immunity from prosecution in return for stepping down, and it remains unclear whether he will now face any charges.
Finance Minister Moeketsi Majoro, named by parliament as Thabane's replacement, is expected to be sworn in on Wednesday.
""I plead with the entire nation... to give my successor utmost support, and for my part I wish to assure him of my support,"" Thabane said in his televised address.
Thabane's coalition fell apart last week, leaving him with no legal choice but to resign.
""It is a relief and we believe... Lesotho will be steered to greatness and good governance as well as peace,"" said Motlalentoa Letsosa, deputy leader of the Democratic Congress party, the main opposition party which will now join a new coalition government under Majoro.
Lesotho, a small kingdom encircled by a South African mountain range, has seen several coups since gaining independence from Britain in 1966.

Its political upheavals often drag in South Africa, which gets some of its water from high-altitude Lesotho.

Gholamhossein Esmaili spoke about Vahid Behzadi and his wife Najva Lasheidai, both in their early 40s but whose case had not previously been given a high profile, in a televised news conference.
Without giving any further details about the pair or their background, Esmaili said they had been sentenced to death on charges ""including disrupting the Islamic Republic's exchange and gold market"".

He said the couple could appeal the verdict within 20 days.
With the economy deteriorating due to the effects of sanctions and the coronavirus outbreak, Iran's hardline judiciary has been waging a campaign against corruption at a state and private level that they say is further eroding prosperity. 
Separately, Esmaili said two Iranian lawmakers had been sentenced to 61 months in jail each on charges of ""disrupting the country's car market"". 
Lawmakers Fereydoun Ahmadi and Mohammad Azizi both were linked to a financial corruption case at one of Iran's two major car manufacturing companies, he said. Neither lawmaker has commented publicly about the case.
In the past years, the judiciary has jailed several officials, including the brother of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, for financial crimes. 
Hardline critics say state corruption has grown to extraordinary levels since pragmatist Rouhani was first elected in 2013. The government has dismissed the claim as politically motivated.

JOHANNESBURG/HARARE (Reuters) - Petronella Mabhena, a domestic worker in South Africa, has been paying bus drivers to ferry food to her relatives in Zimbabwe for over a decade.
As with many other families from Zimbabwe whose members depend on food from South Africa, the supplies were abruptly halted when the two countries restricted movement across their border in March to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
""I was confused and did not know what to do,"" said Mabhena, 53, who sends food to her mother and daughter.
A friend told her about an app that lets people in South Africa order groceries for delivery in Zimbabwe, where prices for food and other essentials have soared amid a severe economic crisis.
Use of the app called Malaicha - Ndebele slang for the traditional way of sending goods over the border with bus and taxi drivers - surged in April, said its managing director, Sayjil Magan.
While the border has been closed to people and the taxis and buses that would normally ferry food informally, Malaicha is permitted to import goods into Zimbabwe, offering an alternative.
About a year old, the app has yet to break even, in part because its costs, including trucks and warehousing, are higher than the typical digital startup.
But if its user base continues to grow, it could emerge as a rare winner from South Africa's lockdown, one of the world's most restrictive. 
Previously, Malaicha handled an average of 20,000 to 30,000 orders a month, Magan said, but that number increased by around 200% month-on-month in April, while user numbers grew by around 100% to 75,000. 
""It's something they are going to carry on using; that's the feedback that we are getting from our customers,"" Magan said.
In Zimbabwe's capital Harare, one of five major cities where Malaicha operates, deliveries reached 200 a day in April, from an average of 20 before the lockdown, said warehouse manager Mario Ventouris.
Workers were putting in extra hours to clear long lines of people who had come to collect orders, he added.
Delivery driver Decide Sabamba said his job was tougher than before: ""It's busy, it's busy every day."" 
He brought cooking oil and diapers to Mabhena's daughter, Epiphania Moyo, and her baby - their first delivery via the app.
The family is all too familiar with the frustration of traditional malaicha deliveries, which they said cost more and don't always arrive on time or in full. Their experience with the app was different.
""They are very fast; they delivered everything. I will use it again,"" Moyo added.

U.S. and Malaysian authorities say about $4.5 billion was looted from 1MDB, co-founded in 2009 by Najib, who was voted out of power in 2018 amid widespread public anger over the scandal.
He has since been charged with 42 criminal offences linked to losses at the fund and other state entities, and has pleaded not guilty. 
Riza, a co-founder of Hollywood firm Red Granite Pictures, has agreed to give up properties in the United States and Britain as part of last week's settlement, officials have said.
The U.S. Department of Justice has said Red Granite financed three films, including 2013's Oscar-nominated ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", using funds allegedly misappropriated from 1MDB.
Red Granite paid the U.S. government $60 million in September 2017 to settle a civil forfeiture claim over the rights to the films.

The plan for a court-led restructuring of the national carrier replaces a previous proposal of a government-backed rescue package that was heavily criticised in the country.
The airline's troubles are the latest example of how the coronavirus pandemic is crippling the global airline industry.
Colombia's Avianca Holdings SA (CN:AVT_p) and  Virgin Australia  Holdings Ltd (AX:VAH) have filed for bankruptcy protection since the pandemic broke out. 
Thai Airways, though, had been in trouble even before the outbreak of the coronavirus due to stiff competition from budget airlines and bloated costs.
It posted losses every year after 2012, except in 2016. In 2019, it reported losses of 12.04 billion baht ($377.3 million).
""We have decided to petition for restructuring and not let Thai Airways go bankrupt. The airline will continue to operate,"" Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told reporters at a news briefing.
If the request is accepted by the bankruptcy court, Thai Airways would be given an automatic stay restricting legal action from creditors. 
""The Cabinet also agreed the government will reduce its holding in Thai Airways to under 50%, ending the airline’s status as a state-enterprise”, Transport Minister Saksayam Chidchob told reporters. 
Thai Airways said the plan will be implemented through the Central Bankruptcy Court and it would operate as usual as the restructuring took place. 
""Thai Airways will not be dissolved or go into liquidation or be declared bankrupt,"" Thai Airways Acting President Chakkrit Parapuntakul said in a statement.
Operations including passenger and cargo transportation will continue in parallel with the plan, he said.

Thai Airways shares surged 16.6% on Tuesday, but are still down by about a third this year.

The Court of Justice of the European Union reviewed the case of two Afghan and two Iranian nationals who arrived in Hungary from Serbia in late 2018 and early 2019 and applied for asylum from the Roszke transit zone on the border.
Their applications were rejected by Hungary, which ordered them to return to Serbia, but Belgrade would not admit them.
The EU court ruled last week that the asylum-seekers had effectively been detained in the transit zone camp on the border and that a local court should release them immediately.
""The government does not accept the ruling of the EU's top court...about the transit zones,"" Gyorgy Bakondi said, according to a government statement.
Bakondi said the transit zones were a part of Hungary's system of border protection and migrants currently stuck on the Balkans route posed a ""public health threat"" amid the coronavirus outbreak. 
He said Hungary would use all legal means to get the EU ruling reviewed. A government spokesman did not say what concrete steps the government would take but said the ruling unacceptable ""in a political sense"".
Nationalist Orban, one of the most vocal opponents of immigration into Europe, won a third term in power in 2018 on a strong anti-immigration agenda which he has pushed ever since the 2015 migration crisis. 

Then Hungary was a transit route for hundreds of thousands of migrants heading through the Balkans to western Europe. In recent years the number of migrants arriving at Hungary's border has dropped to a trickle.

The new figures come after a shocking attack last week on a Kabul maternity hospital that killed 24, including newborn babies. 
Civilian casualties attributed to the Taliban in April rose by a quarter from the same month a year earlier to 208, while casualties attributed to Afghan security forces rose 38% to 172, according to provisional data from the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan.
""I call for a halt to the fighting and for parties to respect humanitarian law that is there to protect civilians,"" said Deborah Lyons, the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative for Afghanistan.
The United States has sent an envoy to Doha and Kabul to press the Afghan government and the insurgent Taliban to start stalled peace talks, which it hopes will begin in earnest after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah signed a power-sharing deal.
Violence increased even after a Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban pact on the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees. The Taliban have rejected repeated calls for a ceasefire by the Afghan government.
After last Tuesday's maternity ward attack, which the Taliban denies involvement in, the Afghan government switched its military from a defensive to an offensive stance. 
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in a statement rejected the UN report, saying it is Kabul government ""propaganda"".

Libyan National Army (LNA) spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari said the force had carried out a ""redistribution and repositioning in the battle fronts, disengaging from some crowded residential areas"".
It has been fighting for more than a year to capture Tripoli, seat of the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations and has moved onto the front foot in the war since January with military help from Turkey. 
The LNA, under Khalifa Haftar, is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt. 
On Monday, pro-GNA forces took the Watiya airbase west of the capital after weeks of attempts, their biggest advance in a year that deprives the LNA of its only airfield near Tripoli. 
After taking the base, they paraded what they said was a captured Russian-made Pantsir air defence system mounted on a truck, along with an Arabic manual. 
Mismari said the base had been abandoned as part of a long-planned strategic decision and that only old, obsolete equipment was left there. 
GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha said on Twitter that ""Haftar's chance of success is now effectively zero"" following his loss of Watiya.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan may lift its state of emergency in more regions this week as new coronavirus infections drop, the Asahi newspaper said on Tuesday, moving to resume sorely needed activity in the world's third-largest economy, battered by containment measures.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe freed 39 of Japan's 47 prefectures last week from a blanket state of emergency, while urging people to adopt a ""new lifestyle"" of social distancing and guard against a possible spike.
This week, the government could drop the western prefectures of Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo from the list of eight remaining ones, while maintaining curbs on Hokkaido, Tokyo, and those around them, the paper said, citing an anonymous government source.
Like other world leaders, Abe faces pressure to balance protection of public health with avoiding the collapse of the economy, which is facing its worst postwar slump.
First-quarter data on Monday showed Japan slipped into recession for the first time in 4-1/2 years, as the virus ravages businesses and consumers.
With much of Japan now freed from the emergency, coffee chain Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) re-opened about 850 stores on Tuesday, including some offering only takeout in the prefectures still under curbs. Among other businesses, Toho Cinemas said it would reopen 23 more theatres on Friday.
The Japan Sumo Association is also exploring prospects of resuming a summer tournament in July, it said, after cancelling a tournament originally set to start on Sunday. 
Its decisions would take into account the results of antibody tests begun on Monday for members, including wrestlers and referees, the association added. 
The ancient Japanese sport has been hit especially hard by the virus, with several organisation members testing positive, as well as the death last week of a 28-year-old wrestler.

Trump threatened on Monday to reconsider the United States' membership of the World Health Organization (WHO) if the organisation did not commit to improvements within 30 days, and said the body had shown an ""alarming lack of independence"" from China.

290,By Reuters,"<span>May 19, 2020 03:15AM ET</span>",Defecting French lawmakers deprive Macron of outright parliament majority,"PARIS (Reuters) - Defectors from Emmanuel Macron's ruling party announced the creation of a new group in France's lower house of parliament on Tuesday, depriving the president of an outright majority and raising pressure for more left-wing policies.
Seven lawmakers are splintering from Macron's La Republique En March (LREM) party to joint the new ""Ecology, Democracy, Solidarity"" (EDS) group, which said it would initially count 17 parliamentarians in its ranks.
That means the LREM now only has 288 MPs, one short of the 289-threshold needed for an absolute majority in parliament, and down from the 314 Macron had after he dynamited the political landscape in 2017.
Macron's party, formed after the former investment banker won the presidency in May 2017, has suffered a string of defections in recent months by parliamentarians frustrated by his tight grip on decision-making and his pro-business policies.
Macron can still count on the support in parliament of a smaller alliance partner, the centrist MoDem party. However, the arithmetic may now give MoDem more leverage over policymaking in the final two years of Macron's five-year mandate.
His reform drive has been stalled by the coronavirus pandemic, just as he was seeking to regain momentum after weeks of pension reform protest and before that anti-government ""yellow vest"" protests.
Richard Ferrand, a close Macron ally and president of the National Assembly, acknowledged the loss of LREM's absolute majority but said the government could count on the votes of 342 MPs with MoDem's support. 
A parliamentary group does not have the formal structures of a party. It is, however, highly likely that any parliamentarian who joined the new group would be ejected from Macron's party.
The new group will be chaired by Paula Forteza and Matthieu Orphelin, a close ally of former environment minister Nicolas Hulot, who quit Macron's government in frustration at the president's climate change and green energy policies. 

The new group will hold a press conference later on Tuesday.

Coronavirus quarantine shelters in India were being converted to cyclone shelters, leaving authorities to manage social distancing to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus.
In neighbouring Bangladesh officials were moving people to higher ground and urged them to maintain social distance and wear masks as the country has recorded over 20,995 coronavirus cases and 314 deaths so far.
India's weather office said the Super Cyclone Amphan had reached winds of up to 240 kmh (145 mph) with gusts of around 265 kph (165 mph) over the Bay of Bengal on Monday night and was expected to make a landfall on Wednesday.
Such wind speeds, according to weather officials, could make Amphan one of the biggest storms to hit Indian in about a decade.
The cyclone comes as India eased the world's biggest lockdown imposed in April to contain the coronavirus which has infected more than 100,000 people and killed 3,163. 
The states of Odisha and West Bengal were moving families to more than 1,000 shelters in government offices and educational centres and were hastily converting coronavirus quarantine centres into cyclone shelters.
""We have just about six hours left to evacuate people from their homes and we also have to maintain social distancing norms...the cyclone could wash away thousands of huts and standing crop,"" S.G. Rai, an official in federal disaster management office told Reuters on Tuesday.
Trains plying thousands of migrant workers from the Indian capital New Delhi to eastern states, after the coronavirus lockdown of the country's rail system was eased, were diverted to avoid the cyclone's path.
India, with a coastline of 7,516 km (4,670 miles), experiences more than a tenth of all the world's tropical cyclones, the bulk of them on its eastern coast.
In neighbouring Bangladesh, officials intensified rescue operations as the cyclone could trigger the worst storm in about 15 years along the country's low-lying coast.
Bangladesh's coastal districts may experience flooding from tidal waves and heavy rainfall with winds packing speeds of up to 160 kph (98 mph) is expected during the cyclone.
""We have prepared 12,000 cyclone centres, where more than 5 million people can take shelter. We have also taken necessary steps so that people can maintain distance and wear masks,"" said Enamur Rahman, the junior minister for disaster management and relief in the capital Dhaka.
Bangladesh's coast, home to 30 million people is also regularly battered by cyclones that have killed hundreds of thousands of people in recent decades.

Taiwan, claimed by China as its own, is not a member of the United Nations, but says that as a responsible global player it is committed to ensuring sanctions are enforced to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programmes.
In 2018, independent U.N. monitors told a U.N. Security Council sanctions committee in a confidential report that they had investigated cases of ship-to-ship transfers of petroleum products in violation of sanctions and that the network behind the vessels was primarily based in Taiwan.
Tsai Ming-yen, deputy secretary-general of Taiwan's National Security Council, told Alex Wong, the U.S. State Department's deputy assistant secretary for North Korea, that Taiwan was a ""responsible member of the international community"".
Taiwan ""will continue to closely cooperate with the United States, and carry out and implement actions to comply with international sanctions against North Korea"", Tsai said, according to the foreign ministry.
The teleconference at which Tsai made the comments was also attended by representatives of Taiwan's anti-money laundering office, its justice ministry, ports authority and coast guard, the ministry added.
Taiwan has called on its companies to comply with U.N. sanctions, and in 2017 suspended refined oil and LNG exports to North Korea, as well as clothing and textile imports, to comply with U.N. resolutions.
The call between Tsai and Wong is another sign of the stepped up relationship between Taipei and Washington, which do not have formal diplomatic relations.
The Trump administration has made bolstering ties with democratic Taiwan a priority.
This has angered China, and become another source of tension in its relations with the United States.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The phased reopening of U.S. business and social life gained traction on Monday with more Americans emerging from coronavirus lockdowns and financial markets boosted by promising early results from the first U.S. vaccine trial in humans.
News of a possible vaccine breakthrough was somewhat overshadowed by President Donald Trump's surprise announcement hours later that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 preventive treatment, contrary to medical warnings about such use of the anti-malaria drug. The disclosure came during Trump's White House meeting with restaurant executives.
""All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,"" the president told reporters, saying he has taken a single dose of the drug each day for the past week and a half.
Just 10 days ago the White House confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary had tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 hours after Trump's military valet was diagnosed.
Trump initially promoted hydroxychloroquine in April as a potential COVID-19 treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus. But subsequent studies have found it to be ineffective, and the Food and Drug Administration has warned of the potential for serious side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine and an older, related drug, chloroquine.
VACCINE HOPE
Earlier in the day came word that a COVID-19 vaccine under development by Massachusetts-based biotech firm  Moderna  (NASDAQ:MRNA) Inc had produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers during a safety trial launched in March.
The findings, offering a glimmer of hope that the experimental vaccine may ultimately prove effective, sent Moderna's shares soaring 20% on Monday and helped lift the overall stock market about 3% to a 10-week high. 
Until a vaccine or cure can be found, lockdowns on commerce and social gatherings remain the chief weapon for fighting the pandemic, even while ravaging the U.S. economy.
Public health experts caution that easing stay-at-home orders and mandatory business closures is still risky while diagnostic testing remains scant in many places, leaving in doubt how much virus lurks undetected.
Although nearly all 50 states have begun reopening, only 13 had met federal guidelines for safely lifting restrictions as of Sunday, according to a Reuters analysis, raising concerns that infections and deaths could surge anew. 
While some consumers have voiced hesitancy about returning to shopping malls and restaurants just yet, others were clearly ready to do so. 
""We need to get the economy going again. People are either out of money or will be very soon,"" said Martin Bermudez, 48, as he and a companion enjoyed ham-and-cheese omelets at a cafe in Miami. 
They were among the first diners back in the eatery for sit-down table service after more than two months of takeout only.
The pandemic has afflicted the United States more than any other country, with more than 1.5 million known infections and nearly 90,000 deaths. 
A revision to an influential coronavirus mortality model periodically updated by University of Washington researchers predicted on Monday that 143,357 Americans will die from COVID-19 by early August, about 3,600 fewer than last projected.
The slightly more optimistic forecast reflects greater-than-expected adherence to social distancing and face covering by the public, Dr. Christopher Murray, head of the university's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN.
New York state, epicenter of the U.S. pandemic with 27,400 COVID-19 deaths to date, registered further evidence of improvement as its three-day rolling average of hospitalizations and tally of newly reported fatalities both declined.

FROM SPORTS TO ASSEMBLY LINES
In a sign of growing confidence in curbing the contagion, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was looking forward to professional sports teams to begin competing again, though without fans in attendance.
California Governor Gavin Newsom likewise said his state has been in talks with officials of all major sports leagues about a possible fan-free resumption of play. He added that a possible June 1 opening day would depend on development of new safety standards and the prevailing infection rates in California.
In the San Francisco Bay area, health directors in five counties said manufacturing, retail with curbside pickup and warehouse distribution could reopen, catching up with a similar loosening of restrictions elsewhere across the state 10 days earlier.
In the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry slowly returned to life from a two-month lockdown as the Detroit Three carmakers and their suppliers began restarting assembly lines in a sector that employs nearly 1 million people.
Hundreds of workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobile's (FCA) truck plant in Warren, Michigan, began lining up before dawn for the early shift. Signs overhead read: ""Let's restart."" 
The auto industry is widely watched as a test case for whether workers across a range of U.S. industries can safely return to factory floors.
""I'm a little nervous,"" said Larry Smith, 53, who works on wheel alignment away from the assembly line. ""They made all the precautions (and) they've done everything they can to prepare .... I'm trusting in God.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Children in Australia's most populated state will return to school full-time next week, a major step towards normalising public life since the coronavirus pandemic, as Qantas Airways detailed new safety measures for the resumption of flights. 
The directive from New South Wales (NSW) Premier Gladys Berejiklian lifts childcare responsibilities for the parents and carers of around 800,000 children in public schools as Australia seeks to stem a surge in unemployment and restart the economy.
The Reserve Bank of Australia warned on Tuesday the country is facing a ""significant"" and ""unprecedented"" economic contraction, though massive fiscal and monetary policy stimulus would help cushion the blow. Minutes of the RBA's meeting earlier this month showed the baseline case was for gross domestic product to fall by 10% in the first half and 6% for all of 2020.
Australia's states and territories are beginning to allow more public activity under a three-step federal government plan to end two months of shutdowns that officials have credited with keeping the country's exposure to the pandemic relatively low.
""During the period of time when children were learning from home we made sure we had everything in place to prepare our schools for a COVID-save environment,"" Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. ""From now on, we don't ever want to see a situation where all schools are closed."" 
Still, Berejiklian cautioned that it was almost certain individual schools would need to close temporarily in the future to prevent the spread of fresh outbreaks, despite plans to ramp up cleaning and observe social distancing practices.
The decision caught the state's teachers union by surprise, with Teachers Federation President Angelo Gavrielatos saying it ""caused a lot of concern, frustration and anger among teachers and principals.""
""They turned themselves inside out, not once, not twice, but repeatedly, trying to come to terms with this crisis and fulfilling their professional and social and moral responsibilities,"" Gavrielatos told Australian Broadcasting Corp television. 
""Schools are complex places,"" he added. ""It's not like turning a tap on and off.""
Public schools educate the bulk of students in NSW. Private schools have adopted differing timetables during the crisis, with some following the state guidelines while others moved more quickly to online learning.
In neighbouring Victoria, the resumption of school was continuing on a staggered basis, with full-time lessons for all pupils not due to resume until early next month.
New South Wales accounts for more than 40% of Australia's 7,060 confirmed COVID-19 infections, and almost half the 99 deaths nationally.
Qantas Airways Ltd, meanwhile, said it could restart 40-50% of its domestic capacity in July if states relax border controls, and expects to offer low and flexible fares without social distancing measures to stimulate travel demand.

The airline will introduce measures on board from June 12 such as providing masks and cleaning wipes to ensure safe travel and give passengers peace of mind during the pandemic, but will not leave middle seats empty.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a legal setback to Sudan on Monday, ruling that the African nation cannot avoid punitive damages in lawsuits accusing it of complicity in the 1998 al Qaeda bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that killed 224 people.
Siding with hundreds of people hurt and relatives of people killed in the bombings, the justices ruled 8-0 to throw out a lower court's 2017 decision that had freed Sudan from punitive damages awarded in the litigation in addition to about $6 billion in compensatory damages. Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the case. 
The ruling reinstates about $826 million out of a total $4.3 billion in punitive damages, said Christopher Curran, a lawyer representing Sudan. 
The case hinged on the Supreme Court's view of a 2008 amendment to a federal law known as the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act allowing for punitive damages. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in 2017 upheld Sudan's liability but ruled that the amendment was made after the bombings occurred and could not be applied retroactively.
Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in Monday's ruling that for claims made under federal law, ""Congress was as clear as it could have been when it authorized plaintiffs to seek and win punitive damages for past conduct."" 
The remainder of the punitive damages will be subject to further litigation as the ruling ordered the D.C. Circuit to reconsider its decision that the foreign plaintiffs who sued Sudan under state law in the United States also could not seek punitive damages. 
""As always, Sudan expresses sympathy for the victims of the acts of terrorism at issue, but reaffirms that it was not involved in any wrongdoing in connection with those acts,"" Curran said. 
Starting in 2001, groups of plaintiffs sued in federal court in Washington under the 1976 Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which generally bars claims against foreign countries except those designated by the United States as state sponsors of terrorism - as Sudan has been since 1993. 
""It's hard to imagine an act more deserving of punitive damages, and we are deeply gratified that the Supreme Court has validated our clients' right to receive this measure of compensation,"" said Matthew McGill, a lawyer for the plaintiffs. 

Twelve Americans were killed by the Aug. 7, 1998, truck bombs that detonated outside the embassies in Nairobi, Kenya and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The lawsuits involve 567 people, mostly non-U.S. citizens who were employees of the U.S. government and their relatives.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Three-year-old Sansa, a black dog with a white spot on her belly, spent nearly a year in a Rio de Janeiro animal shelter before the coronavirus pandemic restricted visitors, making her odds of being adopted even dimmer.
But then she had a lucky break. The shelter's new 'pet delivery' service found Sansa a home, bringing company to Maria Fatima Cordeiro Marques, a 73-year-old retired nurse isolating in her house alone.
""We're going through a very difficult moment... It's hard for everyone, right?"" said Marques, embracing Sansa after she arrived in the shelter's white van. ""I'm sure she'll give me a lot of love and so will I, because it's a sincere kind of love demanding nothing in return."" 
For Rio residents seeking a furry friend to pass the long days in isolation, but unable to visit the shelter, the city will now provide a delivery service. It said it has delivered more than 50 pets since early April.
Rio's undersecretary for animal welfare Roberto de Paula said demand had been strong, with more than 1,000 people expressing interest in adopting abandoned animals.
""Given social isolation rules, we had to restrict people's access to the shelter to avoid contagion, so we came up with this idea of taking the animal to each person and conducting all interviews through social media,"" he said.
After the online screening, workers identify and suggest the most suitable pets, before spaying, vaccinating and delivering them to the doorstep.
That is how 28-year-old Luaira Paraízo Rodrigues Lourenço adopted her second cat, Joao, to help her deal with the growing distress of Brazil's accelerating coronavirus outbreak. 
""I work with healthcare recruitment and I see things that have left me emotionally shaken,"" Lourenço said. ""When I'm sad, agitated or confused with something the cats come and bring me that love to restore myself. It's amazing.""

The Rio animal shelter currently has around 900 animals available for adoption.

WARSAW (Reuters) - The Catholic Church on Monday marked the 100th anniversary of the birth of Pope John Paul II but questions remained about whether he did enough against sexual abuse.
John Paul was in 1978 elected he first non-Italian pope in 455 years, becoming Poland's most famous son in modern times.
He reigned for nearly 27 years and Poles looked to him for guidance during communism and in the years following the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. He died in 2005 and was declared a saint in 2014.
""John Paul II changed world's history. Thanks to him, thanks to Solidarity, communism collapsed and we were able to build a free Poland,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said, referring to the free trade union.
Most historians concur that the changes would not have come as quickly without the pope's backing for Solidarity.
On Monday Pope Francis honoured his predecessor by saying Mass at John Paul's crypt in St. Peter's Basilica and the Angelicum, the Rome university where the future pope studied as a young priest, opened a culture institute named after him. 
In Krakow, the city where he was bishop, archbishop and cardinal for 20 years, dozens of people prayed, lit candles and left flowers below the window of the residence from where he addressed crowds during his return trips as pope.
""When I was a small girl I attended a papal Mass. I feel a bond with him,"" said Karolina Malik, 40.
But critics said his legacy was cloudy.
They have said it was still not clear how much John Paul knew about Marcial Maciel, accused of being one of the Church's worst paedophiles. He abused even the children he had fathered secretly while living a double life and being feted by the Vatican and Church conservatives, according to a report from the Legionaries of Christ Catholic religious order.
""John Paul ignored and dismissed reports of sexual abuse by clergy. He defended some of the most notorious predators of the abuse crisis, including Maciel,"" Anne Barrett Doyle of the U.S.-based abuse tracker BishopAccountability.org, said on Monday.
Although allegations against the founder of the Legionaries of Christ religious order surfaced as early as 1954, the Vatican only began slowly acknowledging Maciel's abuse in 2006, when Pope Benedict ordered him to retire to a life of ""prayer and penitence"". Maciel died in 2008.
Former Legionaries say Maciel gave huge contributions to the Vatican during the papacy of John Paul, who admired the Legionaries' orthodoxy and ability to produce vocations. 
The official who was in charge of John Paul's sainthood cause, Polish Monsignor Slawomir Oder, told reporters on Friday that the commission that investigated his life found no evidence that he neglected or covered up abuse scandals.
In Krakow, Natalia Zembrzycka, 52, said she just wanted to pray. 

""As far as paedophilia is concerned - John Paul II did so many good things for so many people and for the Church, that we want to remember him this way, and we don't want to reflect on these dirty issues,"" she said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ordered a Chinese woman who lives in Canada to pay a $250,000 fine after she admitted to paying $400,000 to secure her son's admission to the University of California, Los Angeles, through bribery as a purported soccer recruit.
Xiaoning Sui, 48, appeared before a federal judge in Boston via a Zoom videoconference, in the second sentencing to take place remotely in the U.S. college admissions scandal because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Sui pleaded guilty in February to federal programs bribery under a plea agreement that would spare her from further time in prison after she spent five months in jail in Spain, where she was arrested in September while traveling in Europe.
Prosecutors said the five months was comparable to the sentences imposed on other parents charged in the scandal. Sui's lawyer, Martin Weinberg, argued his client was ""deeply regretful"" and had been punished enough.
But while U.S. District Judge Douglas Woodlock agreed in sentencing her to time served that Sui had spent enough time in prison, he said she deserved the maximum fine possible.
""It's a money crime,"" he said. ""And it seems to me that it ought to be paid for in money, too."" 
Sui is among 53 people charged with participating in a scheme in which wealthy parents conspired with a California college admissions consultant to use bribery and other forms of fraud to secure the admission of their children to top schools.
William ""Rick"" Singer, the consultant, pleaded guilty last year and admitted he facilitated cheating on college entrance exams and bribed university sports coaches to secure the admission of his clients' children as fake athletic recruits.
The 36 parents charged since March 2019 include ""Full House"" star Lori Loughlin, who is fighting the charges.
Prosecutors said that in August 2018, Singer told Sui on a call recorded through a wiretap that it would cost $400,000 to secure her son's admission to U.S. universities including UCLA.
To obtain his admission, Singer turned to Jorge Salcedo, a UCLA soccer coach, who had already accepted $100,000 to facilitate the admission of the daughter of another of Singer's clients to the school as a soccer recruit, prosecutors said.
After Singer began cooperating with investigators, he called Sui and told her he planned to use $100,000 of the $400,000 to pay the coach, and she wired him the money, prosecutors said.

Salcedo in April agreed to plead guilty.

A group of protesters threw rocks, shouted and burned piles of wood along a street in the destitute neighborhood on Santiago's southern fringe. Images on social media and local television showed police spraying tear gas and water cannons to disperse the growing crowd. 
The municipality said in a statement that families were going hungry in the poorest sectors of El Bosque, a neighborhood where many work informally, or not at all. The city district has been under quarantine since mid-April, city officials said in a statement.
""The last weeks we have had a great demand from neighbors for food,"" El Bosque Mayor Sadi Melo, of Chile´s opposition Socialist party, told Radio BioBio. ""We are in a very complex situation of hunger and lack of work.""
Santiago is one of Latin America´s most prosperous cities. But a stark rich-poor divide and a growing sense of inequality prompted mass protests in late 2019. Many of the demands lodged by protesters last year, from increased pensions to higher pay, remain unresolved.
In a statement, Melo´s office said El Bosque had distributed more than 2,000 aid packages to the neediest families. But it warned the central government ""not to continue to burden municipalities with an economic responsibility we cannot cover.""
Chile´s center-right president, Sebastian Pinera, said in a televised address later on Monday that his government would deliver 2.5 million baskets of food and cleaning supplies directly to homes by late this week or early next.
""We will prioritize the most vulnerable families,"" Pinera said, calling the planned delivery of food ""historic."" 
The South American nation has already announced a massive stimulus package worth nearly 7% of gross domestic product to ease the economic impact of the pandemic, although opposition leaders and social groups have criticized the package as inadequate. 
The government´s proposed measures include beefed-up unemployment checks, deferred tax payments and government-backed credit lines for small business. 
Chile surpassed 40,000 cases of the new coronavirus last week amid a sharp spike in infections that has seen hospitals approach collapse in the weeks ahead of the Southern Hemisphere winter. The country now has 46,059 total cases and 478 deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI cracked the iPhone encryption of the Royal Saudi Air Force trainee who killed three American sailors in a December attack at a naval base in Florida, and found evidence linking him to al Qaeda, Attorney General William Barr said on Monday.
The shooter, Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, 21, also wounded eight people before being killed by law enforcement during the Dec. 6, 2019 attack. 
He was on the base as part of a U.S. Navy training program designed to foster links with foreign allies.
The Justice Department succeeded in unlocking the encryption on the shooter's iPhone after Apple Inc (O:AAPL) declined to do so, Barr told reporters on a conference call. Apple later disputed his version, saying it cooperated to the extent that its technology allowed.
""The information from the phone has already proved invaluable,"" Barr said.
Barr called on Congress to take action forcing Apple and other tech companies to help law enforcement agencies get through encryption during criminal investigations.
""Apple's decision has dangerous consequences,"" Barr said. ""Many of the technology companies that advocate most loudly for warrant-proof encryption ... are at the same time willing to accommodate authoritarian regimes.""
Apple said: ""It is because we take our responsibility to national security so seriously that we do not believe in the creation of a backdoor — one which will make every device vulnerable to bad actors,"" Apple said in a statement. ""There is no such thing as a backdoor just for the good guys, and the American people do not have to choose between weakening encryption and effective investigations.""
In February, an audio recording purporting to be from the Islamist militant group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) claimed responsibility for the attack, but provided no evidence.
Prior to the shooting spree, the shooter posted criticism of U.S. wars and quoted slain al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden on social media.
""The Pensacola attack was actually the brutal culmination of years of planning,"" FBI Director Christopher Wray said on Monday, adding that evidence showed Alshamrani had been radicalized by 2015.
Barr has said the Saudi government did not have any advanced warnings of the shooting.

Saudi Arabia in January withdrew its remaining 21 cadets from the U.S. military training program and brought them home, after the Justice Department's investigation revealed some had accessed child pornography or had social media accounts containing Islamic extremist or anti-American content.

The British-run region last week laid out a five-stage plan for easing the lockdown similar to Ireland's, but its omission of any dates for action raised the chances of different parts of the island reopening at different times.
The United Kingdom's constituent parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have taken a more conservative approach than England after Prime Minister Boris Johnson encouraged some people to return to work last week.
The devolved government's decision on Monday to ease the measures meant both jurisdictions on the island of Ireland entered the first phase of their exit plans in step with each other as garden centres and golf courses reopened on both sides of the open border.
Outdoor work at building sites, already allowed in the north, resumed in the Irish republic. Photographs of long queues at reopened hardware stores in Dublin were shared on social media, but these were mainly to comply with in-store distancing requirements. The Retail Ireland industry group reported that its members had experienced ""brisk but manageable trade"".
The number of confirmed cases in Northern Ireland rose by 16 to 4,401, with related deaths up six to 482. In Ireland, which has two and a half times the population and has tested more than six times as many patients, cases increased by 88 to 24,200.
It was the second day in a row where the number of cases fell below 100, and the four related deaths were the lowest number of daily reported fatalities since March 27, the day Ireland announced its lockdown.
Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Tony Holohan said only two of those deaths had occurred over the weekend, with the other two dating back to April.

If the number of new cases remained at the current low level by the middle to end of next week, he said he would be increasingly confident that Ireland could enter phase two of its reopening plan, among the most conservative in Europe, as scheduled on June 8.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's King Felipe gave a speech at a conference in Madrid on Monday attended by the economy minister and others in an audience over the size authorised for public events under the capital's strict coronavirus lockdown rules. 
Pictures on the Spanish Royal House's Twitter account showed at least 20 people at the event held by innovation foundation Cotec at the headquarters of telecom firm Telefonica (NYSE:TEF).
Spain is easing restrictions and regulations vary according to regions, but gatherings of more than 10 people are still prohibited in Madrid, Spain's health ministry press office said in an email to Reuters.
The Royal House, Telefonica and economy ministry did not comment, while Cotec's communication director Juan Gomez said only nine people had been invited, including speakers, and he did not know who the others were.
Gomez did not know of an exception to lockdown rules being requested, though he said the event was of a work rather than public event nature. The health ministry did not respond to a request for comment on any possible exception for the event.
At the event, the foundation released its annual report and held a roundtable discussion on the health crisis.
""I am sure we will overcome the challenge we are living through now, in solidarity,"" said King Felipe, Cotec's president of honour, according to a transcript from his office.
Queen Letizia, Economy Minister Nadia Calvino and Telefonica CEO Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete attended, as well as Madrid's mayor and regional head of government, the images showed.
Most attendees wore masks and kept at least two empty seats between each of them, in keeping with social distancing practice, according to the images.

Spain has been one of the world's worst-hit nations, with 27,709 deaths and 231,606 infections.

A crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war, with Moscow backing Assad and Washington supporting the opposition. Millions of people have fled Syria and millions are internally displaced.
Islamic State also took advantage of the chaos to gain a foothold in Syria.
U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen told the 15-member Security Council that since the war started too many ""fleeting opportunities to turn dynamics towards a political path were lost,"" warning that those ""missed moments were followed by renewed violence and a hardening of positions.""
""With some calm, with the common threats of COVID and ISIS, and with the Syrian people continuing to suffer, I want to stress that renewed and meaningful international cooperation, building trust and confidence between international stakeholders and with Syrians ... is essential,"" Pedersen said. 
""I believe that Russian-American dialogue has a key role to play here, and I encourage them to pursue it,"" he said. 
Pedersen is the fourth U.N. envoy to try and mediate peace in Syria. 

Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) Syria is the last major piece of territory held by rebels fighting Assad. Backed by Russia and Iran, Assad waged his latest offensive to recover the area earlier this year.

The U.S. special representative for Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, left one day after Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah signed a power-sharing deal that could help lead to peace talks to end the country's long-running war.
The three main impediments to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations, which were to begin March 10, have been a rise in violence, the pace of prisoner releases and the failure of Ghani and Abdullah to resolve a power struggle.
While in Doha, Khalilzad will meet with Taliban officials to discuss carrying out a Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban agreement that called for prisoner releases by both sides and to ""press for steps necessary to commence intra-Afghan negotiations, including a significant reduction of violence,"" the State Department said.
In Kabul, Khalilzad will meet with senior government officials ""to explore steps the Afghan government needs to take to make intra-Afghan negotiations begin as soon as possible,"" it added.

The key provisions of the Feb. 29 agreement - to which the Afghan government was not a party - involved a U.S. commitment to reduce its presence in Afghanistan to 8,600 troops by mid-July and, conditions permitting, to zero by May 2021.

The Russian Foreign Ministry said this month that supporters of the move - which would see officials fined if they do not conduct their work in the state language - were ""in a clear minority"".
Moscow also urged Uzbekistan, a former Soviet republic, to preserve the official use of Russian, saying it would ""fully correspond to the spirit of history, time and the quality of bilateral relations"".
But the Uzbek foreign ministry said in a statement that the new regulations, which are yet to be signed into law, were meant to enforce longstanding rules, and decisions on such matters were ""an exclusive prerogative of the state’s domestic policy, interference in which is unacceptable"".
The statement did not directly refer to Russia, but mentioned comments by ""certain foreign officials"". The Russian language remains in wide use in the country and millions of Uzbek migrant labourers work in Russia.
The language initiative comes at a time when some Uzbek intellectuals who initially welcomed President Shavkat Mirziyoyev’s reform policies had become more cautious about his rapprochement with Russia.
Uzbekistan decided this year to become an observer in the Russia-led Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and inked a contract with Rosatom to build a nuclear power plant last year, steps that would have been impossible under Mirziyoyev's predecessor Islam Karimov, who tried to distance the country from Russia.

Naftali Bennett also urged his successor, Benny Gantz, to maintain pressure on Iran, adding that the trend might otherwise reverse.
Iran, Israel’s arch-enemy in the Middle East, has been a key supporter, along with Russia, of President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's civil war, sending military advisers as well as material and regional Shi’ite militias that it backs.
Israel, which monitors neighbouring Syria intensively, has carried out hundreds of air strikes in Syria targeting suspected arms and troop movements by Iran and the Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas it sponsors.
""Iran is significantly reducing the scope of its forces in Syria and even evacuating a number of bases,"" said Bennett in his valedictory address.
""Though Iran has begun the withdrawal process from Syria, we need to complete the work. It's in reach.""
It was not immediately possible to get official Iranian or Syrian reaction to Bennett's comments.
Israeli officials have suggested in the past that Israel's military operations were showing signs of success.
Iran, which is struggling economically under the burden of U.S. sanctions and has also been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, has repeatedly said its military presence in Syria is at the invitation of Assad's government and that it will remain in Syria as long as its help is needed.
A senior aide to Iran's foreign minister, Ali-Ashgar Khaji, reiterated on Saturday that Tehran would continue working closely with the Assad government and Russia to combat terrorism and find a political solution to the Syrian crisis, Iran's ISNA news agency reported.
Bennett held the position of Israeli defence minister for about half a year.

His successor, Gantz, a former armed forces chief and leader of the centrist Blue and White Party, has formed a unity government with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which took office on Sunday.

Bemba's lawyers had sought nearly 70 million euros ($75 million dollars) in compensation for unlawful detention, legal fees and losses due to the alleged mismanagement of assets seized by the court.
On Monday the judges ruled that ""no grave and manifest miscarriage of justice occurred"" and rejected the claims. 
Bemba, a successful businessman and opposition politician before his arrest in 2008, was acquitted in 2018 of crimes committed by members of a militia group under his command.
The judges said Monday that because the court has no statutory limits on how long proceedings can last or on how long an accused is held in pre-trial detention, they could not compensate Bemba for his 10-year stint in the United Nations detention unit.
However they called on the court's member states to review the statute urgently and said that expeditious proceedings were one of the corner stones of the right to a fair trial. 

Lawyers for Bemba could not immediately be reached, but they have previously said they would look beyond the ICC if their claims were rejected in The Hague, possibly to the states that seized Bemba's assets including planes, boats and villas and ""left them to rot"".

KIGALI (Reuters) - One balmy Sunday evening in Kigali a lifetime ago, an 18-year-old girl at the Catholic Christus Centre sang hymns while sneaking glances at a Felicien Kabuga, a powerful businessman from her neighbourhood.
During Rwanda's genocide four years later, the militias he is accused of backing would kill almost her entire family. 
So Dimitrie Sissi Mukanyiligira, now a 48-year-old mother of five, was overjoyed when she heard that Kabuga had been arrested in France this Saturday. He'd spent more than a quarter of a century on the run after a U.N.-backed tribunal indicted him for financing Hutu militias who killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.
Among the dead: Mukanyiligira's two brothers, cut down with machetes, and her sister, killed by a grenade as she sought refuge in a hospital. Kabuga is accused of buying machetes and firearms for the death squads. 
""He did not kill one or two. He killed all of them,"" she told Reuters. ""Imagine if people were going to kill but didn’t have machetes. Providing cash, founding the RTLM (Radio Television Libre des Mille Collines). RTLM journalists were calling people in the morning asking them to check house roofs for Tutsi hiding there."" 
Reuters has not been able to find any public comment made by Kabuga over the years about the charges.
But Mukanyiligira remembers Hutu militia members coming in and out of Kabuga's house in her neighbourhood. 

“The recruits were going in that house and then when they came out they were clad in uniforms. Very excited,"" she said. ""Some of the recruits were my primary school classmates.""

PARIS (Reuters) - French intelligence agents spied on the children of Rwanda's most-wanted genocide fugitive to track him down to an apartment in a Paris suburb and end a 26-year-long manhunt, the head of the police unit who arrested Felicien Kabuga said.
The inquiry gathered pace in March after an intelligence sharing meeting between investigators from France, Britain, and Belgium, home to some of Kabuga's children, as well as Europe's Europol law enforcement agency and a team from a U.N. tribunal.
The coronavirus lockdown paralysing most of Europe meant many investigations were put on hold, allowing a focus on Kabuga's file, said Eric Emeraux, head of the Gendarmerie's Central Office for Combating Crimes Against Humanity.
The dragnet subsequently closed in on one of the alleged chief financiers of the Rwandan genocide, suspected of bankrolling and arming the militias that slaughtered 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994.
""We realised ... that trail from the children protecting their father converged on Asnieres-sur-Seine,"" Emeraux told Reuters, referring to a Paris suburb. ""We also discovered one of his children was renting an apartment there.""
Wiretaps were installed and the property placed under surveillance. Intelligence indicated there was good reason to believe that someone other than one of his offspring was residing in the apartment.
""We decided to open the door, without being entirely sure of who we would find inside,"" Emeraux said. ""I didn't sleep the night before.""
The 84-year-old fugitive had been living in a third-floor flat on the Rue du Reverend Pere Christian Gilbert in Asnieres-sur-Seine, a well-off neighbourhood on the northern fringe of Paris.
Neighbours described a frail, elderly man who said little and before the lockdown would often stroll outside of his apartment. One resident in the same block said Kabuga might have lived there for four or five years. 
GBAGBO'S LAWYER
Reuters has not been able to find any public comment made by Kabuga over the years about the charges. French lawyer Emmanuel Altit said he will be part of the defense team. He did not respond to a subsequent request seeking comment from Kabuga. 
Altit was a senior lawyer on the team which successfully secured former Ivorian president Laurent Gbagbo's acquittal on charges of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court in January 2019.
On Saturday, a squad of 16 elite officers, dressed in black and dubbed 'Ninjas' by Emeraux, forced Kabuga's front door at 6 a.m.
""Kabuga didn't put up any resistance,"" Emeraux said. He was formally identified in a DNA test, matching against a sample taken when he was hospitalised in Germany in 2007, Emeraux added. 
Kabuga's arrest marked the end of a more than two-decade-long hunt that spanned Africa and Europe. Kabuga had 28 known aliases and was using a passport from an African country, Emeraux said. 
Altit said Kabuga would be arraigned before a Paris court on Tuesday.
The court will set out the legal process before passing the case to investigative judges within eight days. The judges will decide whether to hand Kabuga to the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. If Kabuga appeals against their ruling, the matter will go France's Court of Cassation, which hears whether rulings conform with the law.
Kabuga's ability to hide to evade an international manhunt for more than 20 years has raised questions over whether he had accomplices outside of his family.
""It is difficult to imagine he could have escaped into French territory without the help of accomplices,"" said Patrick Baudoin of the International Federation for Human Rights. The federation has supported survivors in the prosecution of other Rwandan genocide suspects living in France.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Survivors of a deadly army crackdown in Thailand that killed more than 90 people were to observe the 10-year anniversary mostly in private on Tuesday amid a state of emergency prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.
The 2010 crackdown was a watershed moment in Thailand's polarised politics that pitted the royalist-military establishment against the ""Red Shirt"" movement of mostly rural and working class supporters of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra.
Thaksin supporters staged months of at times violent street protests in Bangkok in protest against a court ruling that dissolved a Thaksin-allied party that had won elections in 2008. Those elections restored democracy two years after the army staged a coup to remove Thaksin.
The standoff ended in a military operation that drove the Red Shirts from Bangkok’s prominent business and tourism district, killing more than 90 people, mostly civilians, and wounding hundreds.
Each year survivors and relatives hold commemorations, but this year’s events are expected to be subdued.
""We cannot yet organise a large-scale gathering to mark the anniversary because of the coronavirus ... but relatives of those who died will mark the occasion in various places,"" said Tida Tawornseth, a former chairwoman of the United Front for Democracy against Dictatorship (UDD), the formal name of the Red Shirts.
She said she was not hopeful for justice under the current government led by former army chief Prayuth Chan-ocha, who in 2014 overthrew a democratically elected government that had been led by Thakin’s sister, Yingluck Shinawatra.
Prayuth’s pro-army party won elections last year that critics denounced as being manipulated by election regulations and court rulings.
""Many people in power today are figures involved in the conflict 10 years ago. They and the conservative groups are holding on to power,"" Tida said.
Prayuth and the courts have denied accusations of manipulating the election results.
This year, commemoration of the 2010 crackdown was joined by the youth-oriented Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Movement, which staged a light show last week calling for investigations into the decade-old deaths.
Prayuth declined to directly comment when asked by reporters about the light show, saying the country needs to unify to fight the coronavirus.
""The recovery for our country after this period requires cooperation from all sides,"" Prayuth told reporters. ""Do not move on other things to create confusion and disorder.""

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Jose Perez and Flavia Lavorino in Buenos Aires have yet to meet their baby Manu, who was born via a surrogate mother in Kiev 8,000 miles (12,875 km) away as lockdowns around the world and shuttered borders prevented the new parents from traveling.
The Argentine couple, who have only seen pictures and video of Manu, are now trying to find ways to reach him in Ukraine, though they are struggling to obtain permission after the country imposed a ban on foreigners entering in March.
The Argentines are one of dozens of couples from around Europe and the United States who have been unable to collect their babies born to surrogate mothers in Ukraine. Surrogacy is legal in the country.
""Any parent who thinks about their child being far away knows the worry and the pain,"" father Perez told Reuters in Argentina capital Buenos Aires. ""I'd say the words 'worry' and 'pain' don't even do justice describing the feelings we have.""
""It's a very difficult situation. We get photos and video of Manu once a week. They did a video call with us when he turned one month, but it's very hard.""
The Hotel Venice where Manu and the other children are stranded belongs to the clinic BioTexCom, which released video footage of the babies to raise public awareness and spur Ukraine's government into acting more quickly.
The government says it can permit parents to enter Ukraine only if it receives a request from the relevant embassy.
Lavorino said the couple's frustration was compounded by signs of more flights opening up and other couples seemingly being able to reach Kiev with diplomatic help.
""We don't understand what the problem is. They still haven't given us a logical answer as to why this can't be worked out. There are flights,"" she said. 
""A month ago they told us that not a single flight came from Kiev, OK, so it was impossible then, but not now.""
People around the world are stuck in lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to the deaths of around 313,322 people and almost 5 million confirmed infections.
For Perez and Lavorino, however, being half a world away from their newborn Manu has proven extra hard.
    ""At one point they unofficially told us that they are dealing primarily with the most vulnerable,"" Perez said. ""And I wonder, is a 47-day-old baby not vulnerable? I think so.""

OR YEHUDA, Israel (Reuters) - Israeli inventors have developed a coronavirus mask with a remote control mouth that lets diners eat food without taking it off, a device they say could make a visit to a restaurant less risky.
A squeeze of a lever, much like a cyclist operates a handbrake, opens a slot in the front of the mask so that food can pass through. 
The process could get messy with ice cream or sauces, but more solid morsels can be gobbled up in a flash a la Pac-Man in the arcade game.
""The mask will be opened mechanically by hand remote or automatically when the fork is coming to the mask,"" Asaf Gitelis, vice president of Avtipus Patents and Inventions, said on Monday as he demonstrated the device at its offices near Tel Aviv.
""Then you can eat, enjoy, drink and you take out the fork and it will be closed, and you're protected against the virus and other people sitting with you.""
The company said it plans to start manufacturing the mask within months and had already submitted a patent. It said it would likely sell at a 3 to 10 shekel ($0.85 to $2.85) premium above the price of the simple pale blue medical masks many Israelis wear.
Outside a Juice Bar in Tel Aviv, Reuters showed customers a cellphone video of the mask in action. Opinion was divided.
""I think this mask, that enables me to eat while I'm still wearing it, is a must-have,"" said Ofir Hameiri, a 32-year-old graduate student.
But eating an ice cream cone, Ron Silberstein, a 29-year-old musician, said: ""I don't think this mask could hold this kind of ice cream - it's dripping all over. I wouldn't want to wear it afterward.""
Israel has largely reopened its economy after a dramatic drop in cases of the novel coronavirus. Restaurants are open only for takeout for the time being.

Plahotniuc left Moldova for the United States last year after his Democratic Party lost power in an election. Representatives for him were unavailable for comment on Monday although his lawyers last year denied he was involved in the theft.
Known locally as the ""theft of the century"", the scandal saw the equivalent of an eighth of the impoverished former Soviet republic's gross domestic product stolen from three of its largest banks.
The scandal triggered street protests, the International Monetary Fund and the European Union froze aid, the leu currency plunged to record lows and inflation climbed into double digits.
The prosecutor's office said the criminal case against Plahotniuc was opened on Monday and the charges included creation of an organised criminal group, extortion and fraud.
Alexander Stoeanoglo told a news briefing the investigation had irrefutable evidence that Plahotniuc was one of the main beneficiaries of the theft.
""We found that it was his firms ... that received loans from Banca de Economii in the amount of more than $100 million,"" Stoeanoglo said.
Banca de Economii is one of the three Moldovan banks that were victims of the crime. 
Moldova has already jailed former prime minister Vlad Filat and businessman Veaceslav Platon in connection with the scandal, in which money was for year siphoned overseas through dubious loans, asset swaps and shareholder deals.
It is unclear how the case against Plahotniuc might affect the political situation in Moldova, where a presidential election is expected in the autumn, and the third government in a year may resign this month.

According to local media, Plahotniuc's supporters have about 20% of the seats in parliament.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Visitors were back at the Eiffel Tower in Paris, London's Houses of Parliament and the Grand Place in Brussels on Monday, not flouting lockdowns but at the reopened Mini-Europe miniature theme park.
With many of the European Union's borders closed by the coronavirus pandemic, the park in Belgium hopes to give locals a taste of the tourism that lockdowns have made impossible.
Belgium began easing its 8-week lockdown on May 4 and reopened museums, zoos and open-air markets on Monday. Mini-Europe, with its 350 model landmarks, hopes its spacious, open-air park will be a draw.
""I saw on the television that Mini-Europe was restarting so I made the reservation online,"" said Kristof Meert, 38, at the attraction in Brussels with his two children.
Entry must be pre-booked and visitors must observe strict hygiene and social distancing measures.
Even some of the miniature model people wore face masks, including tandem riders in the Netherlands - on a suitably stretched bike - and visitors were reminded to keep 1.5 metres apart - that's three crates of beer for figures in the Belgium section.
The London models mark Britain's departure from the European Union.
""At the bottom of Big Ben, we have added a small figure of (British Prime Minister) Boris Johnson campaigning for Brexit and there are demonstrators carrying an (EU) flag and saying ... 'we miss EU already,"" the park's founder and chief executive Thierry Meeus told Reuters.
Opened in 1989, the park received almost half a million visitors in 2019, but expects just 150,000 this year.
Meeus said with an area of 20,000 square metres, ""welcoming 180 people per hour is very reassuring.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Prosecutors in Russia said on Monday that they had intervened to force hospitals to pay out coronavirus bonus payments promised by President Vladimir Putin to medics, after some staff said they had not received them.
In an April TV address, Putin pledged that healthcare workers, including ambulance drivers and medics, would get anything from an extra 25,000 to 80,000 roubles ($342 to $1,095) tax free a month for their efforts in fighting the virus.
But some healthcare workers say they never got the extra cash, which was designed to reward those working for Russia's overstretched medical sector.
Ambulance workers in Angarsk, a city of 230,000 located more than 4,000 km (2,485 miles) east of Moscow, are among the medical workers who have complained about receiving only a fraction of Putin's promised bonus or nothing at all.
""It's a shame that some have received it and others haven't,"" said paramedic Lyudmila Malova, a medical mask hanging below her nose. ""Is the Angarsk ambulance station not good enough for this money?""
Russia's Prosecutor General's office said in a statement on Monday it was carrying out checks across the country and had found violations in at least 12 of 85 regions where it had forced hospitals to pay out what they owed to medics.
Putin, whose approval rating is still high at 59% but at its lowest level in more than two decades, has stepped in and criticised officials for failing to carry out his orders. 
""Listen to me carefully,"" Putin said at a government meeting last week. ""We agreed, and this was expressed clearly, that this money needs to be paid for work done with coronavirus patients...""
Putin promised he would personally ensure the money arrived and hold regional officials responsible for any failures. 
In some cases, authorities have calculated bonuses based on the time medics spent treating coronavirus patients, something Putin said was wrong.
Several medics told Reuters payments were only being made to medical workers in connection with confirmed cases of the virus, which as of Monday had officially infected 290,678 people in the country, the second highest tally in the world, and caused 2,722 deaths.
In Russia's southern region of Dagestan, ambulance worker Albina Azizova was released from hospital last week after she developed pneumonia after coming into contact with colleagues who were sick.
She told Reuters she had yet to receive the bonus promised by Putin, or the additional funds she would be entitled to after falling ill from treating COVID-19 patients.

""We worked without protective gear, we were in contact with infected medical personnel,"" she said. ""I wish they had said that we wouldn't be getting any (extra) money regardless.""

The government plans a 14-day quarantine for most arrivals to try to prevent a second peak of the pandemic. Earlier Heathrow Airport said Britain should set up ""travel bubbles"" with low-risk countries to allow the movement of people.
""The final details of the quarantine scheme will be released soon, early next month,"" Shapps told parliament on Monday when asked about the possibility of exemptions.

ROME/MADRID (Reuters) - Italian shops, restaurants and churches reopened their doors to spring sunshine on Monday, Greece welcomed visitors back to the Acropolis - and Spain hoped for tourists to return in summer in cautious steps to ease coronavirus lockdowns.
Italians could once again sip their morning cappuccino at the bar, albeit at a distance from one another, in what Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte admitted at the weekend was a ""calculated risk"" in rolling back the curbs.
""I haven't worked for two and a half months. It's a beautiful, exciting day,"" said Valentino Casanova, a barman in Caffe Canova in Rome's central Piazza del Popolo.
Countries around the world, at different stages in the pandemic, are wrangling with decisions on when to ease restrictions, weighing the threat to life against the threat to economic survival. Summer tourism is a major earner for Italy, Greece and Spain.
World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned countries against reopening too early and said ""we have a long road to travel"".
More than 4.71 million people are reported to have been infected by the coronavirus and 312,826 have died, according to a Reuters tally. Italy has the third highest death toll after the United States and Britain.
In Greece, which has recorded only 156 COVID-19 deaths, people flocked to the seaside on Saturday and were allowed back in church the next day.
On Monday, tourists were allowed back at ancient monuments, including the Acropolis in Athens, where workers wearing masks and plastic face shields reminded the few visitors of social distancing rules as they entered the turnstiles.
""I visited the Acropolis today, a world monument that continues to inspire with its marbles shining under the sun,"" said President Katerina Sakellaropoulou.
Spain aims to reopen its borders to tourists around the end of June, Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said, after it surprised its EU partners last week by imposing a two-week quarantine on overseas travellers, effectively shutting its borders.
Abalos said it would be phased out in parallel with travel being allowed within Spain, whose regions are all leaving lockdown at different phases.
""From late June, we'll start tourism activity, I hope,"" he said. ""We must make Spain an attractive country from the health point of view.""
Neighbouring Portugal reopened cafes, and children wearing masks went back to school for the first time in months.
KISSING AND HUGGING
Four weeks into an early but gradual easing of their lockdown, Danes were again able to enjoy a latte at their local café.
""The quick shutdown and the fact that Danes actually listened to messages from authorities about good hygiene and social distancing are the main reasons we've come this far,"" said Hans Jorn Kolmos, a professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark.
Danes being less prone to hugging and kissing as a form of greeting had also been a factor, he said.
Many people across England travelled to parks and beaches to enjoy the sun at the weekend after British Prime Minister Boris Johnson relaxed lockdown curbs. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland told people they should still stay at home.
Johnson's government has been accused by the opposition Labour Party of responding too slowly and late to an outbreak that has now produced the world's second highest death toll - something the government denies.
Michael O’Leary, chief executive of the Irish budget airline Ryanair, said Britain had mismanaged its response and he denounced a forthcoming 14-day quarantine for international travellers.
""It is idiotic and it is unimplementable,"" he told BBC radio. ""This the same government that has ... mismanaged the crisis for many weeks.""
U.S. President Donald Trump has also rejected accusations, most recently from former president Barack Obama, of responding haphazardly to the crisis. Many state governors say his eagerness to reopen the economy puts too many lives at risk.
Fiat Chrysler Automobile's (FCA) truck plant in Warren, Michigan, was one of the U.S. automakers reopening its factories. Workers began lining up before 4 a.m. to start the 5 a.m. shift.
""I'm a little nervous,"" said Larry Smith, 53, who works on wheel alignment, away from the assembly line. ""They made all the precautions (and) they've done everything they can to prepare us ... I'm trusting in God.""
In Brazil, which now has one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks, President Jair Bolsonaro posed for photographs with children from a crowd of supporters on Sunday.
As he flouted public health advice, the mayor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's largest city, warned that its health system was in danger of collapse, the BBC reported.

320,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Slovenia to tighten border controls for some visitors amid lockdown easing,"LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia plans to tighten border controls for some European Union citizens to prevent a possible import of the new coronavirus, the government said on Monday, partially rowing back from a decision last week to let all EU nationals in.
The move reflects public disquiet that visitors from countries badly affected by the virus, such as neighbouring Italy, could inadvertently bring it with them.
On Thursday Slovenia became the first European country to declare an official end to its coronavirus epidemic.
The small Alpine nation of two million people has so far reported 1,466 coronavirus cases and 104 deaths. Over the past two weeks it has confirmed at most four new cases per day and has begun to relax its lockdown restrictions.
The government will regularly publish a list of EU and Schengen-area countries whose citizens are able to enter Slovenia without restrictions, spokesman Jelko Kacin told a news conference. The Schengen area is a passport-free zone comprising most EU member states and several others such as Norway.
The Slovenian government list will be based on the coronavirus situation in each country, Kacin added. He did not say when it would be published.
The first passenger flights to and from Slovenia are expected to resume on May 26 following an eight-week suspension of most air traffic, police official Melita Mocnik told the same news conference. 
Visitors from non-EU and non-Schengen countries can still be ordered into an obligatory 14-day quarantine, the government said, with exemptions for truck drivers and people passing through Slovenia without staying overnight.
On Monday Slovenia allowed all shops, bars and restaurants to reopen after the lockdown. Some pupils also returned to schools, though most will continue to follow lessons online until the end of the school year in late June.
Citizens are still obliged to wear face masks in indoor public spaces and to disinfect their hands when entering such areas. Up to 50 people can gather together but they have to respect a distance of at least 1.5 metres between them.

321,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 09:15AM ET</span>","Fast in, first out: Denmark leads lockdown exit","By Jacob Gronholt-Pedersen and Nikolaj Skydsgaard
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Four weeks after Denmark began easing its lockdown, Danes on Monday returned to cafes and restaurants, confident that the coronavirus outbreak is under control. 
Denmark last month became the first country in Europe to reopen schools, day-care centres and smaller businesses. It did not see a subsequent rise in COVID-19 cases.
""The quick shutdown and the fact that Danes actually listened to messages from authorities about good hygiene and social distancing are the main reasons we've come this far,"" said Hans Jorn Kolmos, a professor in clinical microbiology at the University of Southern Denmark.
Contrary to the French and Italians, Danes are less likely to hug and kiss as a form of greeting, which has also been a factor in limiting the spread, Kolmos said.
Coronavirus-related deaths and the 'R' reproduction rate - a measure of transmission - are falling. Health authorities on Friday reported no deaths for the first time since March 13.
Health experts now say Denmark is ""very unlikely"" to be hit by a second wave of the COVID-19 infection that has so far killed 548 people.
With a population of only 5.8 million, the death rate in Denmark is on par with that of Germany with around nine per 100,000 - less than most other European countries, including 36 in neighbouring Sweden, 33 in the Netherlands and 52 in both Britain and Italy.
The results have been achieved without mass testing and contact tracing. Denmark has not recommended the use of face-coverings, as many other countries have.
Early in the outbreak, Denmark shied away from a comprehensive testing and tracing scheme, partly due to a shortage of testing kits, despite calls from the World Health Organization to ramp up testing.
Danish authorities began testing more broadly only in late-April and said last week they would start a tracing scheme.
Denmark was one of the first European countries to announce a lockdown on March 11, restricting public gatherings and closing schools, restaurants and bars, but imposing less strict limits on daily life than in Italy or France.
BACK TO SCHOOL
A month later, the government embarked on its gradual reopening by letting the youngest children go back to school, drawing some concern from medical experts who said it was too early. 
Last week, Denmark entered Phase 2 of its easing, allowing shopping malls to reopen followed by cafes and restaurants this week.
""We now have the coronavirus under control,"" said Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen last week.
When the Copenhagen café Coffee Collective opened its doors to seated customers on Monday, it was quieter than usual. Most enjoyed their coffee alone at tables placed apart, while some sat outside at tables on the street.
""I think it was a good decision (to shut down early), because we can see now on the numbers that everything has worked better than in some neighbouring countries,"" said Ellen Vallentin Asmus, a graphic illustrator, enjoying a coffee at the cafe for the first time in two months. 
""I think in Denmark there's a strong culture of following the rules and listening to the government, and I think that has helped with everyone taking the restrictions and social distancing seriously,"" said Sydney-Johanna Stevns, a strategist at a research and design lab in Copenhagen.
""Mentally it's nice to be out and have something of a normal life again.""
Danes began returning to work this month but workplaces have restricted the number of employees allowed, leaving public transport half empty. 
The fast lockdown and reopening was partly due to Denmark's centralised government structure, which enabled quick and seamless coordination and a unified voice, said Jan Pravsgaard Christensen, professor in immunology of infectious diseases at the University of Copenhagen. 
The government's decision to shut down early contrasted with the approach in Sweden, where the death toll relative to the size of population is four times higher, as authorities have kept large parts of society open.
Frederiksen said political decisions had to be made quickly and waiting for scientific evidence would have put too many lives at risk or caused unnecessary harm to the economy. 
""The strategy we follow is a political choice,"" she said last month. ""Our approach is science-based, but we cannot wait for evidence. We would simply risk too many lives if we did.""

RABAT (Reuters) - With the usual routes to Europe closed by the coronavirus pandemic, Moroccan drug traffickers are making a circuitous journey involving food trucks and fishing boats to smuggle locally grown cannabis to market, police say.
Morocco has since March imposed an internal lockdown that has stopped most movement between cities and closed its air and sea borders in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. This has also blocked the normal drugs route. 
Smugglers previously took the cannabis grown in the northern Rif Mountains, trucked it the short distance to the Mediterranean coast and then whisked it across the sea by speed boat or concealed in the daily fleets of commercial shipping. 
But recent seizures of contraband show they have been forced to adopt an alternative, longer route - food trucks across Morocco and then fishing vessels sailing from Atlantic ports, police and domestic intelligence spokesman Boubker Sabik said. 
The police successes in disrupting the smuggling networks during lockdown point to a ""drastic shift"" in trafficking methods, he said, as gangs ""opt for coasts distant from Europe, requiring long and expensive sea trips in a bid for a safer route"". 
While only 14 km (9 miles) separates Tangier from Spain across the Strait of Gibraltar, the route up the Atlantic coast requires a long voyage and a sea rendezvous with European smugglers in international waters. 
It also involves driving the drugs for hours from the Rif to the remote beaches of Sidi Abed, 217km (135 miles) south of Rabat, using food trucks whose drivers have lockdown travel permits, Sabik said. 
Police have seized 32.6 tonnes of cannabis resin, known as hashish, during the lockdown period and 62 tonnes since the start of the year compared to 210 tonnes seized last year. 
North African and the Middle Eastern drug busts show that restrictions aimed at the coronavirus have failed to halt the narcotics trade, as European users buy more to see them through lockdown, the United Nations drugs agency said in a report. 
Morocco made big strides in cutting drug cultivation this century, offering farmers subsidies to grow other crops as the land used for cannabis fields dropped from 134,000 hectares in 2003 to stabilise six years ago at 47,000 hectares. 
However, while cannabis trafficking continues, the coronavirus restrictions have entirely stopped shipments of cocaine being flown through Morocco, once a way station on the way to Europe, Sabik said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Chinese smartphone maker OPPO suspended operations at a recently re-opened plant in India after workers tested positive for the coronavirus, an official said on Monday, underlining the challenges of easing a near two-month nationwide lockdown.
The factory, located on the outskirts of capital New Delhi, had received government permission to resume production, the company said on May 7, as part of a gradual relaxation of the shutdown that began on March 25.
OPPO had said it would resume manufacturing with 30% of its workforce, but a district official said that when the company tested its workers prior to production restarting, half a dozen people were positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
""Reports came of about six positive cases,"" Deep Chandra, senior official at the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority, which oversees the area where the plant is based, told Reuters in brief comments.
Chandra said district authorities had instructed the company to test its workers again and that operations were currently suspended.
OPPO said in a statement late on Sunday that operations at the plant were suspended and that it would only allow employees with negative test results to resume work.
A spokeswoman did not answer questions about the company's plans and when specifically operations had been suspended. 
MIGRANT WORKERS
Experts, including those directly advising the government, say that coronavirus cases will rise in coming weeks as India's lockdown is eased, and authorities have repeatedly told companies resuming operations to ensure that social distancing and other measures are taken to prevent infections.
India has seen a rapid rise in coronavirus infections in recent days, with confirmed cases at around 96,000 and more than 3,000 deaths, according to federal data.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government extended the nationwide lockdown to May 31, but relaxed rules in areas with lower numbers of cases and allowed state governments to issue their own guidelines on some matters.
With the restrictions eased, some traffic poured back onto the roads of India's capital, and hairdressers, beauty parlours, stationary shops, and butchers were among the small businesses reopening.
But schools, malls and other public places will remain mostly closed, and large gatherings are still prohibited.
The southern state of Karnataka, home to technology hub Bengaluru, on Monday lifted some restrictions on the movement of trains, taxis and buses within the state.
However, transport facilities from outside the state will remain suspended, except in the case of essential services.
Compounding the challenges for the country, hundreds of millions of migrant workers have been stranded across India for weeks, unable to return home after authorities banned all transport services in late March.
After a series of road and rail accidents, where dozens of workers died, authorities are now scaling up efforts to help them home.
In the southern city of Chennai, construction worker M.D. Rustom queued along with hundreds of others for a bus and train trip back to the eastern state of Bihar, some 2,000 km away.

""We don't have money to eat,"" he said. ""It has been over 50 days, we just want to go back now.""

In the shadow of Nelson's Column, Extinction Rebellion activists lined up the shoes across the square and unfurled a banner reading ""Covid Today > Climate Tomorrow > Act Now.""
""Extinction Rebellion are calling on the government to act on the climate crisis during the coronavirus recovery so children and young people aren't left to suffer a deeper crisis,"" the group said.
The shoes, arranged across the paving of the near-deserted central London tourist attraction, were donated by people across the city and will be given to Shoe Aid following the action. 
Extinction Rebellion wants to bring major change to the political, economic and social structure of the modern world in time to avert the devastation predicted by scientists studying climate change.
It says it wants non-violent civil disobedience to force governments to cut carbon emissions and avert a climate crisis it says will bring starvation and social collapse.
""Many young people feel suffocated by fear of what is to come, and now with this pandemic, maybe others will start to understand our fear for the future,"" said Poppy Silk, a 19-year-old activist from Extinction Rebellion.

""Even whilst healing from the pandemic, we must move towards a green transition to prevent future crises,"" Silk said.

LISBON (Reuters) - Cafes served morning coffee, creches reopened and masked pupils went back to school for the first time in months as Portugal entered a second phase of its lockdown exit on Monday.
Still, an abundance of rules to prevent a second coronavirus wave - from shifts for school classes to number limits in restaurants - showed life was still far from normal. 
Only students in the last two years of high school returned for face-to-face classes, lining up outside school gates for temperature checks before going in.
""These safety measures make sense. You have to have them because we need face-to-face classes to prepare for exams,"" said Bernardo Cruz, 17, as he waited to get in to Dom Pedro V Secondary School in Lisbon, where gloved and masked staff handed out face gear to students who had forgotten theirs.
""I've been dying to get back to classes ... we are used to understanding looks, expressions,"" added maths teacher Dulce Sousa at the same school. ""I hope they learned something online but nothing substitutes a teacher.""
""DOESN'T LOOK GOOD"" 
Emboldened by the slowdown of cases - now at 29,036 confirmed with 1,218 deaths - the government said on Friday the country was ready for the second phase of its exit plan. That meant opening kindergartens, shops up to 400 square metres, schools, restaurants, museums and art galleries.
Restaurants were doubtful they could last long under heavy capacity restrictions - and lower demand. 
""We're only allowed a third of our capacity, and we might not even get that, with tourists not around,"" said Diogo Silva, a waiter at a Portuguese food restaurant in Lisbon.
""We'll try our best, but it doesn't look good,"" he said, standing at the door and fiddling with his mask as fellow staff shuffled tables around the one-room restaurant now only allowed to serve up to eight customers at a time.
One in a hundred businesses across the country have already shut down since the start of the pandemic, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) said last Monday, while 1.3 million of the country's 4.9 million workers were temporarily laid off as businesses closed doors during the lockdown.
The country's gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 3.9% between January and March compared to the last quarter of 2019, INE said on Friday, with much of the decline explained by a drastic drop in tourism.
""Of course we want to open. But we're looking at much lower revenue with virtually the same costs,"" Ana Jacinto, head of restaurant and hotel association AHRESP, told Reuters.

""We're worried there'll be no money in the bank at the end of the month.""

MADRID/VALENCIA (Reuters) - Tourism-dependent Spain aims to reopen borders to visitors around the end of June as its coronavirus lockdown fully unwinds, a minister said on Monday, in a much-needed boost for the ravaged travel sector.
Madrid last week surprised its European Union partners by imposing a two-week quarantine on all overseas travellers and effectively keeping borders closed, saying that was needed to avoid importing a second wave of the COVID-19 disease.
But the move was meant to be temporary and Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said it would be phased out in parallel with travel being allowed within Spain, whose regions are easing restrictions in different phases.
""We can't allow foreigners to travel while the Spanish population is confined,"" he told TVE broadcaster.
""From late June, we'll start the tourism activity, I hope ... We must make Spain an attractive country from the health point of view.""
Tourism accounts for over 12% of Spain's economic output. Even with a reopening of borders in late June, the industry's revenues will fall by between 93 billion ($100 billion) and 124 billion euros ($134 billion), lobby group Exceltur estimated in a report last month.
One of the worst-hit nations with 27,650 deaths and 231,350 infections, Spain is slowly easing a strict lockdown in place since mid-March which had meant for weeks people could not even go out for exercise.
SLOW REOPENING
Restaurants and bars were gradually reopening - even though staff knew customers would be scarce.
In the Mediterranean city of Valencia, restaurant manager Cristina Gonzalo and her staff were out early preparing their beachside bar. Dressed in white shirt and matching mask, a waiter painstakingly measured out space between tables to ensure they conform with social-distancing requirements.
Gonzalo said she had doubts about the reopening but was happy to be helping staff, who had been furloughed under the government's temporary layoff program.
""They did not receive the money to shop for essentials and they were desperate,"" she said.
The epidemic has put health services under severe stress and battered the economy, which could shrink between 9.5-12.4% this year, followed by a 6.1-8.5% bounce back in 2021, Bank of Spain governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos said.
Unemployment rose sharply in March and April, pushing the number of people depending on unemployment benefits to a record 5.2 million. 
Including furloughed workers and people on medical leave, as many as 7 million people are depending on the state, almost 30% of the working population, according to data that Spain sent to Brussels in early May.
In a change from the previous morning time, the government was to announce the latest 24-hour tally of coronavirus cases and fatalities at around 5 pm (1500 GMT) from Monday onwards.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - French gendarmes arrested Felicien Kabuga, wanted for allegedly financing the Rwandan genocide, near Paris on May 16 after a global manhunt spanning more than a quarter of a century.
Kabuga, 84, is accused of funding ethnic Hutu militias that massacred about 800,000 Tutsi and moderate Hutus during the 1994 genocide. He was one of the last three major fugitives hunted by international investigators. 
WHO WANTED KABUGA? 
He was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Arusha, Tanzania. The U.N. Security Council set up the tribunal in 1995 to prosecute high-profile suspects accused of crimes during the 1994 genocide. 
The court tried senior military and government officials, politicians, businessmen, church, militia, and media leaders on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, complicity in genocide, or direct and public incitement to commit genocide. 
It also charged more than half of the suspects with rape and other forms of sexual violence as a means of perpetrating genocide and as crimes against humanity or war crimes.
DID THE TRIBUNAL WORK? 
The tribunal indicted 93 people, including Kabuga. Of those, 62 were convicted and 10 others sent to national jurisdictions for trial. A further 14 were acquitted, two indictments were withdrawn before trial and two people died before their trials concluded. The rest were fugitives. 
The tribunal closed in 2015, but passed its outstanding cases to the U.N. International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, a body empowered to try suspects from the Rwandan genocide and 1990s war in then-Yugoslavia. This body maintains an office in Arusha and another in The Hague, Netherlands. 
WHAT WAS KABUGA INDICTED FOR?
Kabuga was indicted on seven counts of genocide, complicity in genocide, directing and inciting genocide, conspiracy to carry out and attempts to commit genocide, and crimes against humanity - persecution and extermination.
WHAT PROBLEMS DID THE TRIBUNAL FACE?
Its critics, including Rwanda, accused it of being inefficient, costly and slow. Rwanda itself tried more than two million cases related to the genocide in 12,000 community courts - often held outside under trees - between 2001 and 2012.
Suspects who were acquitted by the international tribunal were often unable or unwilling to go home, and authorities struggled to find third party countries that would accept them.
The tribunal also depended on national jurisdictions' police and other security agencies to apprehend and hand over fugitives, which considerably slowed down the wheels of justice.
WHO IS STILL OUT THERE? 
International investigators are still looking for Protais Mpiranya, former commander of the Rwandan presidential guard, and Augustin Bizimana, the ex-defence minister - both Hutus.

The international tribunal referred the cases of five other fugitives to the Rwandan authorities for trial.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel Katz took over as Israel's finance minister on Monday as part of a new government, saying he planned to work towards helping the economy recover from the effects of the coronavirus while also promoting competition.
Katz -- who replaces Moshe Kahlon after a five-year stint -- said he didn't want to talk about specific economic policies, preferring to first meet the ministry's experts.
""There will be a plan,"" he told a ceremony to mark the changing of the guard. ""It will be accompanied by reforms, ... competition."" 
He has 90 days to pass a 2020 state budget. Israel has been using a pro-rated version of the 2019 base budget.
The government has approved an emergency stimulus plan of some 100 billion shekels ($28 billion) to help businesses and the economy deal with the effects of the pandemic -- pushing up the expected budget deficit this year to at least 10% of gross domestic product.‮‮ ‬‬
After weeks of a lockdown, during which jobless claims soared, Israel has begun to ease restrictions. Schools and shopping malls have reopened although restaurants remain closed.
Katz most recently served as foreign minister and previously was transportation minister, where in 2012 he signed an open skies deal with Europe that led to the entry of a host of low-cost carriers to Israel.
Israel's economy has performed well in recent years, although tax reductions and spending increases prior to the COVID-19 outbreak pushed the budget deficit higher, with an inability of the government to take any corrective steps due to a more than one-year political stalemate.
The political deadlock ended after some 500 days on Sunday when parliament approved Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new unity government with former rival, centrist Blue and White leader Benny Gantz. 
Katz is the first finance minister from Netanyahu's Likud party since 2013, as the post went to coalition partners following elections in 2013 and 2015.
""Should Netanyahu provide strong political backing, this could be one important ingredient towards the success of Katz,"" said Bank Leumi chief economist Gil Bufman, adding that cooperation with the ministry's staff, effective dialogue with the business sector, unions and the central bank ""could be what economy needs right now"".
He noted that this situation is reminiscent of a similar one in the early 2000s when the economy was in poor shape and Netanyahu, then a new finance minister, received strong backing from his prime minister, Ariel Sharon.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Some of the 15 pro-democracy activists arrested in police raids in Hong Kong showed defiance on Monday as they appeared in court to hear charges of participating in illegal anti-government demonstrations last year. 
Veteran politicians, a publishing tycoon and senior lawyers were among those arrested last month in the biggest crackdown on the movement's key figures since the protests began. The move drew criticism from rights activists and Western politicians.
At the time, China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office called the arrests ""normal law enforcement measures"" made on the basis of evidence gathered by police, adding that certain ""radicals"" were blind to the interference of outside forces.
The West Kowloon magistrates' court granted bail to all the defendants and adjourned the case until June 15 at the prosecution's request. Several defendants made defiant remarks when asked if they understood their charges. 
""Demonstrating is not a crime,"" Figo Chan, the vice-convenor of the Civil Human Rights Front, responded. ""I understand this.” 
Former legislator Leung Kwok-hung, also known as ""Long Hair"", answered, ""I understand the government is rubbish."" 
Raphael Wong, an activist with the League of Social Democrats, said ""I understand this is political prosecution.""
The Hong Kong government and police denied the arrests were politically motivated, saying they were in accordance with the rule of law.
Other held on charges of illegal assembly included Democratic Party founder Martin Lee, millionaire publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, and former lawmaker and barrister Margaret Ng.
In all, one serving and nine former legislators were arrested, including veteran activists Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum.
Last year's sometimes violent protests in the Chinese-ruled city began over a proposed bill that, if passed, would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial. But it was later scrapped.
Dozens of rival pro-democracy and pro-Beijing supporters gathered outside the courtroom, where proceedings could be seen on a screen. Western diplomats were present inside the court. 
This month, United Nations human rights experts had urged authorities to drop the prosecution, provoking a strong rebuttal from Beijing.
The arrests came amid a period of relative calm on the streets as the scale and frequency of protests ebbed since January, amid social distancing measures adopted in Hong Kong to guard against the coronavirus outbreak. 
But as the virus is being curbed, demonstrations have picked up again, drawing hundreds of participants, and are expected to gather steam as anger simmers amid a renewed push by authorities for tougher national security legislation in the city.
Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the territory was promised a high degree of autonomy for 50 years under a ""one country, two systems"" arrangement that has helped it thrive as a world financial centre.

Quarantine restrictions are gradually being lifted -- access to beaches was allowed on Saturday amid a heatwave and churches welcomed worshippers on Sunday.
""I visited the Acropolis today, a world monument that continues to inspire with its marbles shining under the sun,"" Greece President Katerina Sakellaropoulou said after a walk at the ancient ruins, one of the most visited tourist sites in the world.
Workers wearing masks and plastic face shields were on site to inform the few foreign tourists of the social distancing regulations, which require visitors to remain 1.5 metres apart.
Greece, which has contained the spread of COVID-19 infections with 2,834 cases and 163 deaths reported as of Sunday, began a gradual easing of lockdown measures on May 4.
Culture Minister Lina Mendoni said the government wanted to open archaeological sites that are safe for people to visit.
""Greece has won credibility from the way it handled the coronavirus crisis. It is a valuable achievement that will allow us a dynamic opening of the tourism season,"" she said in a statement.
People will be allowed to travel freely in the mainland and to the country's two largest islands, Crete and Evia, and shopping malls and zoos also reopened on Monday along with sports facilities for those aged over 13.
Social distancing rules must be respected and wearing masks is recommended, but not mandatory except on public transport.

The blast, during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan when tens of thousands of Afghans are fasting, is the latest in a spate of violence across the country despite a peace accord signed between the United States and Taliban in February.
The interior ministry in Kabul and provincial officials in Ghazni confirmed the attack.

Watiya air base, 125 km (80 miles) from the capital, has been an important strategic foothold for forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, who launched an offensive to capture Tripoli in April 2019.
The campaign sharply escalated a long-running conflict between factions based in eastern and western Libya and caused a surge in military intervention by foreign powers.
Forces aligned with the Government of National Accord (GNA) had taken full control of Watiya, Osama Juweili, a top military commander, was quoted as saying by official media early on Monday. 
Footage posted on social media appeared to show GNA forces driving down runways at the base unhindered. There was no immediate comment from Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).
The advance comes after GNA forces pushed back against their rivals in recent weeks with increased support from Turkey, capturing towns on the coast west of Tripoli last month.[bnL5N2C12UT]
The LNA, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Russia, has been unable to make significant advances from the outskirts of Tripoli since early on in its campaign.
The LNA lost Gharyan, its main forward base south of Tripoli, in its biggest reversal to date in June 2019, but continues to control Tarhouna, southeast of the capital.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian shops, hairdressers and restaurants finally threw open their doors on Monday as the country sped up efforts to bounce back from the coronavirus crisis after a 10-week lockdown.
Customers could once again sip their morning cappuccino at the bar, albeit well spaced from other clients, and public Masses were allowed again in churches after bishops put pressure on the government to sanction religious services.
""I haven't worked for two and a half months. It's a beautiful, exciting day,"" said Valentino Casanova, a barman in Caffe Canova in Rome's central Piazza del Popolo.
Almost 32,000 Italians have died of COVID-19 since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, the third-highest death toll in the world after the United States and Britain. 
Italy was the first European country to impose nationwide restrictions in early March, only permitting an initial relaxation of the rules on May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen.
Monday marked a major step forward on the road to recovery, with unlimited travel allowed in individual regions, friends once again meeting up and restaurants able to serve as long as tables were at least 2 metres (6.5 ft) apart. 
Telephones rang incessantly in hairdresser salons, as unkempt clients rushed to make themselves more presentable.
""I already have 150 appointments, all very urgent, all of them insisting that they must be first on the list,"" said Stefania Ziggiotto, a hairdresser in the Alpine resort of Courmayeur. ""I have a full agenda for three weeks.""
ECONOMIC FEARS
However, many business owners worried that the reopening might not magic away their many problems, with lingering fears of the coronavirus keeping many Italians at home, while foreign tourists, vital for the economy, were utterly absent.
The government has said it will open up Italy's borders with Europe and allow free travel between the regions from June 3, but no-one expects a sudden influx of outsiders.
Monica Robaldo, owner of the Pierre Alexis 1877 restaurant in Courmayeur, said she would not reopen before the end of May.
""We have a loyal clientele ... mostly tourists, so while travel between the regions and from abroad is not allowed, there is not much point in reopening,"" she said.
The Treasury is predicting the economy will contract by at least 8% in 2020, the deepest recession since World War Two, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said at the weekend he was taking a ""calculated risk"" in rolling back the rigid curbs.
Although there was noticeably more traffic on the roads of major cities on Monday morning, some people appeared hesitant to resume their old habits.
Angelo Lombardo, owner of Cocco Caffe in the northern city of Bologna, is allowed to serve a maximum four customers at any one time, but he said he wasn't having to worry about social distancing rules at present.
""A lot of people are just walking past and looking in from outside wondering whether they can come in or not,"" he said, criticising the government for doing too little to explain how the rules had changed.

""Let's give it time,"" he said. ""It's the first day.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis inaugurated the full reopening of St. Peter's Basilica on Monday and Catholic churches held public Masses for the first time in two months in the latest easing of Italy's coronavirus restrictions.
Francis said a private Mass in a side chapel where St. John Paul II is buried to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the late Polish pope's birth.
The basilica, which on Friday underwent a sanitising to make it as cornavirus-free as possible, later opened to the public for Masses by priests on other side altars after the pope had left. 
Signs in English and Italian told those entering that they had to keep at least 1.5 metres (five feet) apart, wear masks and sanitize their hands.
Churches throughout Italy began holding Masses under strict new guidelines worked out between the country's bishops and government.
The faithful will have to wear masks. Priests can celebrate most of the Mass without masks but they will have to wear one, as well as gloves, when they distribute the communion wafer. The communion is to be given in the hand and not the mouth.
On Sunday, the pope urged Italian to observe the new norms ""in order to defend each other's health and the health of the people"".
But, according to an Italian reporter inside the basilica on Monday morning, at least one priest at a side altar did not wear gloves or a mask while giving communion.
Technically, St. Peter's has remained open during the Italian lockdown which began in early March, although only for private prayer. Only very few people have entered because of increased security to avoid gatherings in the square outside.
The Vatican has not yet announced when the pope will say a Mass from the main altar before the public. His services since early March have been held in an almost empty chapel in his residence and streamed live on the internet or on television.

The Vatican has said that when St. Peter's is open for large Masses on Sundays and holy days, thermal scanners will be used to check the temperatures of those going inside.

British government ministers have said they plan a 14-day quarantine for most people arriving in the country in the coming weeks to try to prevent a second peak of the pandemic.
Airlines have warned the policy will throttle hopes for a travel recovery.
Heathrow Airport, which before the novel coronavirus grounded planes was the busiest in Europe, said that it had been working with the UK government's Department for Transport on proposals to allow some unrestricted travel.
""The proposal would create 'travel corridors' or 'travel bubbles' allowing free movement between countries or cities that are very low-risk, but potentially blocking flights from high-risk markets to safeguard public health,"" the airport said in a statement.
Such a set-up would be much less damaging to the economy than the quarantine policy, said Heathrow. 
The boss of Ryanair, Europe's biggest airline by passenger numbers, said on Monday that the 14-day policy was unimplementable and unpoliceable and would be ignored by people wanting to travel.
The government is yet to provide further details of the quarantine policy. 
Culture minister Oliver Dowden said earlier on Monday that Britain was still in talks with France over whether to exempt travellers from across the Channel.
As part of its plans to ensure international travel can restart safely, Heathrow also said it would this week start trialling thermal screening in immigration as well as UV sanitation on trays used at security gates.
All staff at the airport will also be wearing face coverings and masks will be handed to any arriving or departing passenger who wants one, the airport added. 
Airline bosses have said taking people's temperatures before departure plus wearing masks on flights could help give passengers confidence in the safety of flying.

DEPOK, Indonesia (Reuters) - Alarmed by how the coronavirus pandemic has left many Indonesians destitute, a group of volunteers are providing free meals to vulnerable daily wage earners in their neighbourhoods, ranging from rickshaw drivers to trash collectors. 
Millions of Indonesians have been thrown into poverty in recent months and are struggling to make ends meet in a country that has recorded more than 1,100 deaths from COVID-19, the highest toll in East Asia outside China from the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""This is the time for us to act,"" said 19-year-old Sherina Redjo, one of the 15 university students behind the initiative.
The volunteers jump on their motorbikes to distribute free food packages around four times a week for the fast breaking time during Ramadan in Depok, a satellite town on the outskirts of the capital Jakarta. The Muslim fasting month of Ramadan is widely observed in the Muslim-majority country.
While conceding their efforts may only scratch the surface of the problem, Redjo says no matter how small it is ""it will certainly help them"".
The group estimates they have handed out more than 660 meals since they started in the middle of March.
The coronavirus outbreak has cost some 2 million people their jobs in just six weeks, the country's finance minister said in early May, adding that the country's efforts to eradicate poverty had been set back by a decade.
The volunteers collect donations on social media to pay for the food and on a good day they can raise enough money to produce 50 packs of boxed food.
The beneficiaries are mostly daily wage earners, such as rickshaw drivers, delivery workers and garbage collectors, whose livelihoods are hit the hardest by the outbreak.
""I thank them so much for giving me this package and I pray for their generosity,"" said Bambang, a cycle rickshaw driver who uses only one name.    
The aim of the volunteers is to make sure these people have some food before they go to sleep.
""We are focusing on providing dinner so that at least they can sleep with their bellies full,"" said Luqmanul Hakim Yullyadi, 19, the group's designated cook, who learned culinary skills from his mother who runs a food catering business.

""I joined because I feel pity and sympathy for many of my friends whose parents' income was disrupted because of this pandemic and also for those people on the street whose life depends on daily wages,"" he said.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen, already pushed to the brink of famine by a five-year war, could see a ""catastrophic"" food security situation due to the coronavirus pandemic and lower remittances from the Gulf, the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said on Monday.
The conflict between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has caused what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis.
Some 80% of Yemen's population are reliant on aid and millions face hunger.
""The health system was already under heavy stress and will now be overwhelmed if COVID-19 continues to spread and in addition it will affect the movement of people and the movement of goods,"" Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, the FAO's assistant director-general and regional representative for the Near East and North Africa, told Reuters. 
""That situation could be really catastrophic if all the elements of worst case scenarios come to be but let's hope not and the U.N. are working on avoiding that.""
Yemen, alongside Syria and Sudan, is one of the most vulnerable states in the Middle East in terms of food security.
Lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus are likely to impact humanitarian supply chains keeping a large part of the population fed, the U.N. agency said in a report on Monday.
Yemen has been mired in violence since the coalition intervened in 2015 against the Houthi group that ousted the Saudi-backed government in the capital, Sanaa, forcing it to rebase in the south. 
The internationally recognised government has reported 128 COVID-19 infections with 20 deaths in areas under its control. The Houthis, who control most large urban centres, have announced four cases with one death, both in Sanaa.
The World Health Organization said last Monday the virus was circulating undetected in Yemen, increasing the likelihood of a devastating outbreak among a malnourished population that would overwhelm a shattered health system with limited testing capacity.
There are currently 15.9 million Yemenis classified as food insecure out of a population of some 28 million. 
The FAO does not currently have an estimate as to how much bigger that number could get if the disease continues to spread but it continues to monitor the situation. 
The United States said on May 6 it would provide $225 million to the World Food Programme (WFP) for Yemen, including for reduced operations in the north. 
The WFP had said it would halve aid in Houthi-held areas from mid-April over donor concerns that the group is hindering aid deliveries, a charge it denies.
The FAO said Yemen, the poorest Arabian Peninsula nation, would also be hit by an expected decline in remittances from Yemenis in Gulf countries, which amounted to $3.8 billion in 2019.
""This is a significant source of income for the country that may be considerably reduced,"" Ould Ahmed said. 
Many foreign workers in the energy-producing region have lost jobs, been put on unpaid leave or had salaries cut due to the coronavirus and low oil prices.
""Without peace we will continue to struggle with food insecurity and there will be no long term recovery,"" FAO said.
The U.N. envoy to Yemen said on Thursday that ""significant progress"" has been made toward cementing a temporary truce prompted by the coronavirus pandemic and to pave the way for a resumption of stalled peace talks.

Non-WHO member Taiwan had been lobbying to take part in the WHO's decision-making body the World Health Assembly, which opens later on Monday, saying that to lock it out was to create a gap in fighting the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan has said it wanted to share with the world its successful experience at fighting the coronavirus, having only reported 440 cases and seven deaths thanks to early detection and prevention work. 
But China, which considers democratically-ruled Taiwan its own with no right to attend international bodies as a sovereign state, strongly objected to Taiwan taking part in the assembly unless it accepted it was part of China, something the Taipei government refused to do.
""Despite all our efforts and an unprecedented level of international support, Taiwan has not received an invitation to take part,"" Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters. 
""The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expresses deep regret and strong dissatisfaction that the World Health Organization Secretariat has yielded to pressure from the Chinese government and continues to disregard the right to health of the 23 million people of Taiwan.""
Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help and information it needs during the pandemic, which Taiwan has strongly disputed.
The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow Taiwan full access to the body, helping to further fuel tension between Washington and Beijing.
Taiwan attended the assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects.
Wu said that Taiwan had agreed the issue of its participation would be put off until later in the year so the shorted assembly can focus on the coronavirus 
""Understandably, countries want to use the limited time available to concentrate on ways of containing the pandemic,"" he said. 
""For this reason, like-minded nations and diplomatic allies have suggested that the proposal be taken up later this year when meetings will be conducted normally, to make sure there will be full and open discussion,"" Wu added. 
""After careful deliberation, we have accepted the suggestion from our allies and like-minded nations to wait until the resumed session before further promoting our bid.""

341,By Reuters,"<span>May 18, 2020 03:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Huge fentanyl haul seized in Asia's biggest-ever drugs bust,"By Tom Allard
JAKARTA (Reuters) - Myanmar police say they have seized a huge haul of liquid fentanyl, the first time one of the dangerous synthetic opioids that have ravaged North America has been found in Asia's Golden Triangle drug-producing region.
In a signal that Asia's drug syndicates have moved into the lucrative opioid market, Reuters can reveal more than 3,700 litres of methylfentanyl was discovered by anti-narcotics police near Loikan village in Shan State in northeast Myanmar.
The seizure of the fentanyl derivative was part of Asia's biggest-ever interception of illicit drugs, precursors and drug-making equipment, including 193 million methamphetamine tablets known as yaba. At 17.5 tonnes, the yaba almost equalled the amount seized in the previous two years in Myanmar.
The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) said the scale of the bust was unprecedented and Myanmar's anti-drug authorities had ""dismantled a significant network"" during a two-month operation involving police and military. Also seized were almost 163,000 litres and 35.5 tonnes of drug precursors, as well as weapons. There were more than 130 arrests.
Even so, the methylfentanyl discovery was an ominous indicator for the region's illicit drug market, the U.N. agency and a Western official based in Myanmar told Reuters.
""It could be a game-changer because fentanyl is so potent that its widespread use would cause a major health concern for Myanmar and the region,"" said the Western official, who declined to be identified.
In an interview with Reuters, the head of law enforcement for Myanmar’s counter-narcotics agency, Colonel Zaw Lin, said the methylfentanyl had been verified using state-of-the-art equipment.
The seizure showed the methods of the drug syndicates were changing, he said.
Fentanyl and its derivatives have caused more than 130,000 overdose deaths in the United States and Canada in the past five years, according to government agencies. The opioid epidemic has not swept Asia, Europe or Australasia but there have been signs it is an emerging threat.
""We have repeatedly warned the region fentanyl could become a problem but this is off the charts,"" said the UNODC's Southeast Asia and the Pacific representative Jeremy Douglas.
""It is the shift in the market we have been anticipating, and fearing."" 
DEADLY MIX
While Myanmar police did not disclose the purity and exact make-up of the methylfentanyl found, it comes in two main variants, both more potent than fentanyl, according to the European Union's drug monitoring agency.
Fentanyl itself is 25 to 50 times stronger than heroin.
Increasingly, drug traffickers have been mixing fentanyl and its derivatives with heroin, meth and cocaine, adding to their potency and lethality.
Half of all heroin and cocaine overdoses in the United States included substances with traces of synthetic opioids in 2017, a Rand Corporation analysis found.
A Canadian survey found 73% of those who tested positive for fentanyl did not know they had consumed it.
Zaw Lin said the methylfentanyl and other drugs and precursors were found in clearings near Loikan village where several drug factories were located but had been abandoned when the raids took place.
""Upon interrogation, the offenders revealed most of the drugs would be distributed inside Myanmar and distributed around neighbouring countries,"" he said.
""But we are still conducting interrogations. We haven’t totally got the final destinations yet.""
Liquid fentanyl is usually converted into powder before being sold, often in tablet form, two analysts, who asked not to be identified, told Reuters.
CHEAP TO MAKE, EASY TO TRAFFIC
As well as being easier and cheaper to produce than heroin, strong synthetic opioids like fentanyl can be readily concealed and transported as only small amounts can deliver thousands of doses.
At a time when the coronavirus pandemic has closed borders and curbed movements in many countries, the UNODC is concerned that fentanyl will still spread around the world.
For decades, Asian crime syndicates in partnership with ethnic minority militias have used the Golden Triangle - centred on northern Myanmar and including parts of Laos and Thailand - to grow opium and refine heroin.
More recently, meth production by groups such as the Sam Gor syndicate has exploded in the region, in part due to a crackdown in neighbouring China.
Zaw Lin said the methylfentanyl had come from a neighbouring country but declined to identify it. Myanmar police documents reviewed by Reuters said most of the seized drugs, precursors and equipment had come from China.
China, along with Mexico, has been a major supplier of fentanyl to North America but escalating law enforcement efforts have brought a slump in Chinese exports of the synthetic opioid to the United States, according to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration. 
Mexican cartels have picked up the slack but the UNODC said recent difficulties obtaining precursors from China had crimped their fentanyl production.
Northern Myanmar's proximity to China makes it an attractive alternative for Asian drug syndicates looking to produce fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, analysts said.
""The alliances between Myanmar's ethnic militias and transnational crime groups must be broken or the synthetic drug problem will continue to deteriorate,"" said the UNODC's Douglas. 
Zaw Lin said Myanmar was stepping up efforts to disrupt the syndicates and was increasing cooperation with other nations.

""Myanmar is carrying out counter-drug operations as one of our top national priorities,"" he said.

The first public poll since the coronavirus crisis took hold showed popularity for Ardern's Labour jumped 14 points to 56.5% - the highest for any party ever.
Conversely, the biggest party in parliament - the Nationals, slumped to 30.6%, after sliding by 12.7 points.
The poll was conducted between May 8 and May 16, with half of the responses taken after the federal budget on Thursday.
As preferred PM, Ardern was at 59.5%, up 20.8 points on the last poll and the highest score for any leader in the Reid Research poll's history.
The poll took into account public sentiment in the final days of the country's strict level three lockdown, which also got massive support with almost 92% respondents saying it was the right call. 
The Pacific nation was locked down for more than a month under ""level 4"" restrictions that were eased by a notch in late April. It has continued to enforce strict social measures on many of its citizens and businesses, helping prevent widespread community spread of the virus.
Businesses in the country including malls, cinemas, cafes and gyms reopened last Thursday. (May 14) 
Ardern’s stratospheric rise to become the country’s youngest prime minister and third woman to hold the office resulted in New Zealanders coining the phrase ""Jacinda-mania.""

The rate of new cases have slowed dramatically in New Zealand in recent weeks. The virus has so far infected 1,499 people in New Zealand and killed 21. Globally more than 4.7 million cases have been reported while over 315,000 people have died, a Reuters tally shows.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia's king on Monday said the appointment of Muhyiddin Yassin as prime minister during turmoil this year was proper and constitutional, days after parliament put off a vote on an opposition challenge to his leadership.
Muhyiddin's appointment on March 1, at the end of a week of political wrangling that led to the collapse of the ruling coalition, has been challenged by the opposition who say it was not clear that Muhyiddin had majority support from among the 222 members of parliament's lower house, the Dewan Rakyat.
The lower house speaker had initially approved a motion tabled by Muhyiddin's 94-year-old predecessor, Mahathir Mohamad, seeking a vote of no confidence in Muhyiddin, but the vote was postponed indefinitely after the government shortened Monday's meeting, only allowing time for the royal address.
""Surely, every contest will have a conclusion. The country's political wrangling could not be allowed to fester without any end,"" King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah said in his address broadcast live on national television.
""Hence ... in line with provisions under the Federal Constitution, I found that Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin had the majority support of members of the Dewan Rakyat and was qualified to be appointed as the eighth prime minister,"" the king said, using Muhyiddin's honorifics.
The king's role is largely ceremonial and it is unlikely his endorsement of Muhyiddin's appointment would have any sway over a vote in parliament on his leadership.
Monday's one-day meeting was the first time parliament convened this year. Its next session is scheduled for July 13 to Aug. 27.
In February, the veteran prime minister Mahathir resigned from his second stint in the job when his coalition collapsed.
Muhyiddin, who had served as home minister under Mahathir, was unexpectedly sworn in on March 1 as the head of a government formed with the support of the old ruling party, that was tainted by corruption accusations and defeated by a multi-ethnic coalition in the last general election in 2018.
Muhyiddin has focused on managing the health and economic crisis caused by the novel coronavirus.
Malaysia, which imposed curbs on movement and business since mid-March, has reported 6,894 cases of the virus and 113 deaths.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Scuffles broke out on Monday between pro-democracy and pro-government legislators in Hong Kong over the leadership of a key committee which could pave the way for a debate on a controversial China national anthem bill.
In chaotic scenes, pro-democracy legislators charged at security guards surrounding pro-establishment lawmaker Chan Kin-Por, who had taken the chairman’s seat in the meeting against procedural objections by the opposition.
Guards hauled several legislators out of the chamber, some kicking and shouting. Some tried leaping over the guards from benchtops to take back the chairman’s seat only to be forced back. The Democrats chanted ""foul play"" and held a placard reading ""CCP (China Communist Party) tramples HK legislature."" 
""It’s an illegal meeting. I hope you can leave immediately,"" opposition lawmaker Ted Hui shouted at Chan.
Beijing has accused the former British colony's pro-democracy lawmakers of ""malicious"" filibustering to prevent some proposed bills from going to a final vote, effectively paralysing the legislature.
It was the second time in 10 days that have legislators pushed and shoved each other over the procedures of electing a chairperson. Last May, scuffles broke out in the legislature over a proposed extradition law which sparked often-violent protests and was later scrapped.
Even as the protests continued, Chan called a vote for a chairman of the committee that was won by pro-Beijing lawmaker Starry Lee.
“They can take away the rules of procedures today but I am sure the Hong Kong people won’t forget today,” said Democratic lawmaker Dennis Kwok.
The house committee's role is to scrutinise bills before a second reading in the legislative council and has built up a backlog after failing to elect a chairperson since late last year. The backlog includes one bill that would criminalise abuse of China's national anthem, which is expected to be given a second reading on May 27 despite the procedural chaos.
Protesters have been calling on social media for city-wide demonstrations on that day.
Social distancing amid the pandemic has largely put a brake on protests since January, but demonstrations are expected to resume later this year with the outbreak coming under control.
The arrest of 15 activists in April, including veteran politicians, a publishing tycoon and senior barristers, thrust the protest movement back into the spotlight and drew condemnation from Washington and international rights groups.
China's Hong Kong affairs office warned this month that the city would never be calm unless ""black-clad violent protesters"" were all removed, describing them as a ""political virus"" that seeks independence from Beijing.
Beijing blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest and says protesters are undermining the rule of law in Hong Kong.

New South Wales (NSW) state Premier Gladys Berejiklian is urging people to avoid peak-hour trains and buses as they return to work to ensure that social distancing between commuters is maintained. 
Australia's states and territories are beginning to allow more public activity under a three-step government plan after two months of shutdowns that officials have credited with keeping the country's exposure to the pandemic relatively low.
NSW, which accounts for around half of Australia's 7,045 COVID-19 cases, reported just one new infection in the previous 24 hours. The state also reported one additional death, the first nationally in almost a week, taking the nationwide toll to 99.
""We normally encourage people to catch public transport but given the constraints in the peak and the fact we are exercising social distancing, we want people to consider different ways to get to work,"" Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.
""Places in and around the CBD, but also in employment hubs, will be investigated and more pop-up parking stations will be made available,"" she added.
For people still catching trains and buses, the government is ordering ""intense and ongoing cleaning"" across the public transport network, she said.
Neighbouring Victoria state, which along with NSW accounts for more than half Australia's 25 million population, reported six new cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to Monday.
Twelve McDonald's Australia restaurants in Victoria were closed after a delivery driver tested positive to the illness, local media reported. McDonald's Australia is a separate corporate entity to McDonald's Corp (N:MCD).
""It is a difficult decision, but it is the right one to make,"" McDonald's Australia CEO Andrew Gregory was quoted telling Nine Entertainment. 
The driver was not symptomatic and no McDonald's diners were at risk of contracting the illness from the driver, Gregory added, according to the network.
The northern state of Queensland reported two new cases over the past 24 hours. 

Meanwhile, Australia is joining dozens of countries pushing for an investigation into the origins of the new coronavirus when the World Health Assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organisation, meets in Switzerland on Monday for its first annual meeting since the COVID-19 pandemic began.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's government may put off a bid to raise the retirement age of prosecutors, media reported on Monday, given an intense public backlash fueled by fears for judicial independence.
Opposition to a bill raising the retirement has been among the top-trending topics on social media this month, with singer Kyary Pamyu Pamyu and other celebrities adding their voices. 
Under the bill, prosecutors would retire at 65 instead of 63, and the cabinet would be able to defer the retirement of senior prosecutors for a further three years.
Critics say the law would jeopardize the independence of the judiciary by allowing government-friendly prosecutors to be kept on.
""Forcing this bill through would unleash public fury,"" an unidentified lawmaker was quoted as saying in the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had hoped to pass the bill during this session of parliament, which runs until June 17. If it is withdrawn, it would mark a rare instance in Japan of public opinion swaying political deliberations. 
The controversy has been a new blow to Abe, whose support has dropped after what many saw as his administration's slow response to the novel coronavirus outbreak.
An opinion poll in the Asahi newspaper on Monday showed 64% of respondents opposed the bill and 15% in favor. The same poll had Abe's approval rating at 33%, versus 41% a month ago.
Government spokesman Yoshihide Suga sidestepped questions on the issue at a news conference saying he was aware there were ""various opinions"" about the bill.
In a rare move, a group of former prosecutors has also protested to the justice ministry, saying ""prosecutors wouldn't be able to keep the trust of the people"" if they could not maintain their independence.
Abe also faced criticism this year when the chief of the Tokyo High Public Prosecutor's Office, seen as close to the premier, was allowed to stay on after turning 63.

Debate on the bill has stalled in parliament after opposition parties submitted a no-confidence resolution on Friday against the minister overseeing the legal revision.

Video shot by a witness showed two of the team's Canadair Tutor single-engine aircraft taking off. One of the planes reared up almost immediately before plunging to the ground, exploding just after the pilot ejected.
""One member of the Canadian Forces' Snowbirds team has died and one has sustained serious injuries,"" the armed forces said on Twitter.
Witnesses and officials said earlier that at least one person was injured.
Officials in Kamloops - about 320 km (200 miles) northeast of Vancouver in the West Coast Canadian province - said the jet had hit a residential home, sparking a fire.
A photo posted by local television station CFJC showed at least one house on fire in the Brocklehurst area of Kamloops, a city with a population of more than 90,000.
Federal Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan said in a tweet that he was deeply saddened by news of the crash.

It was the second recent accident involving the Snowbirds. One of the team's jets crashed into an unpopulated area last October before a show in Atlanta, after the pilot ejected.

""These journalists are members of a free press, not propaganda cadres, and their valuable reporting informs Chinese citizens and the world,"" Pompeo said in a statement.
Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the territory was promised a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years. The system formed the basis of the territory's special status under U.S. law, which has helped it thrive as a world financial center.
Pompeo announced on May 6 that the State Department was delaying a report to Congress assessing whether Hong Kong enjoyed sufficient autonomy from China to continue receiving special treatment from the United States.
He said at the time the delay was to allow the report to account for any actions Beijing might contemplate in the run-up to China's May 22 National People's Congress.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have spiked in recent weeks, as Pompeo and President Donald Trump have complained about China's early handling of the coronavirus outbreak.
The United States and China have also clashed over journalists working in each other's countries.
In February, the Trump administration said it would begin treating five major Chinese state-run media entities with U.S. operations the same as foreign embassies, requiring them to register their employees and U.S. properties with the State Department.
Beijing then expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the ""real sick man of Asia"".
In early March, the United States slashed the number of journalists allowed to work there at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously.
In retaliation, China said it was revoking the accreditations of American correspondents with the  New York Times  (N:NYT), News Corp's (O:NWSA) Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.

Beijing said the expelled journalists would not be permitted to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. The expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Wearing a face mask, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro posed for photographs with children plucked out of a crowd of supporters on Sunday, disregarding public health advice aimed at containing one of the world's worst coronavirus outbreaks.
Bolsonaro's latest flouting of social-distancing guidelines came after he lost two health ministers in a month, both of whom resisted his fight against quarantines. Brazil's confirmed cases of the virus passed those of Spain and Italy on Saturday, making it the site of the world's fourth-largest outbreak.
Health Ministry figures released on Sunday evening showed that 7,938 new cases were recorded in the past 24 hours, bringing the total above 241,000, while the death toll increased by 485 to 16,118.
In an online video, Bolsonaro said he welcomed the demonstration at the presidential palace in what has become a nearly biweekly affair, with the president and supporters defying quarantines that have the support of most Brazilians.
""Above all (the people) want freedom, they want democracy, they want respect,"" he said, adding that Brazilians want to get the economy back up and running as quickly as possible.
An opinion poll released last Tuesday showed two-thirds of Brazilians agreed with the need for social distancing to contain the outbreak, which governors and health experts recommend, while Bolsonaro tries to open gyms, hair salons and other businesses.
On Friday, Nelson Teich resigned as health minister as he and the president showed themselves increasingly out of step, with Bolsonaro calling for a rollback of state quarantines and for the widespread use of unproven drugs, such as chloroquine, to fight the virus.
""Chlo-ro-quine! Chlo-ro-quine!"" chanted Bolsonaro's supporters outside the presidential palace in Sunday, as well as ""We want to work!""
Banging drums, blowing horns and letting off fireworks, the crowd created a carnival atmosphere.
Wearing a white face mask and flanked by ministers, security and friends, including a child at his side dressed head to toe in army fatigues, Bolsonaro approached his supporters, waving, smiling and giving the thumbs up.
He mingled with the crowd less than during other recent demonstrations, but he did pose for photographs with at least three young children.
Vice President Hamilton Mourao, who went into isolation on Saturday after the diagnosis of a public servant near him last week, tested negative for the coronavirus, his office said on Sunday. 
Nationwide testing in Brazil still lags far behind European nations. Brazil had processed nearly 338,000 novel coronavirus tests in official labs by the beginning of last week, according to the Health Ministry. An additional 145,000 tests were under analysis or waiting in line.

By contrast, Italy and Spain have each run some 1.9 million official diagnostic tests for the virus.

Kabuga, 84, Rwanda's most wanted man with a $5 million bounty on his head, had been living under a false name in a five-storey apartment block in Asnieres-sur-Seine with the help of his children, according to France's justice ministry. 
Police detained him early on Saturday.
""I would see this man going out, maybe once a day, alone or with someone,"" said Jean-Yves Breneol, 72, a resident in the same block where Kabuga lived. ""He wouldn't say a word, nothing.""
Breneol said he thought Kabuga might have lived in the building for four or five years.
""We didn't know his name, nothing,"" he continued.
It is not known how or when Kabuga entered France. 
But neighbours said they were stunned to learn that a man wanted by a United Nations tribunal on seven criminal charges including genocide and incitement to commit genocide, all in relation to the 1994 Rwandan genocide, had been living among them.
""What's happened is shocking,"" said a second resident in the building who identified himself only as Jean-Guillaume, who added that Kabuga appeared weak.
""He was an old man, very old. He was sick."" 
Reuters could not find any public comment made by Kabuga over the years about the charges. It was not immediately known if he has a lawyer in France.
Kabuga is now being held in La Sante prison in central Paris. 
At the foot of an imposing outer wall made of stone and bristling with security cameras, a coat of arms in the tricolor of the French national flag hangs beside a reception kiosk. 
CASH, MACHETES
Kabuga's arrest marked the end of a more than two-decade long hunt that spanned Africa and Europe.
A Hutu businessman, he is accused of creating and making contributions to a fund that raised finances to pay the youth militias that would slaughter some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus, as well as importing huge numbers of machetes, according to the UN tribunal's indictment.
Kabuga had been an associate of president Juvenal Habyarimana, whose death in a plane shot down over the Rwandan capital Kigali in 1994 ignited the deep-rooted ethnic tensions between the Hutus and Tutsis. Two of his daughters married into Habyarimana's family, according to an amended indictment dated 2004.
One of Rwanda's richest men before the genocide, Kabuga controlled many of the central African nation's coffee and tea plantations and factories. He also co-owned Radio Television Milles Collines, whose radio station broadcast anti-Tutsi messages that fanned the ethnic hatred.
The scars of the genocide remain deeply etched in the Rwandan psyche.
""This is really good news that someone who planned and financed the genocide and has been hiding for a long time and now arrested. It is good news for everyone especially survivors,"" said Valerie Mukabayire, leader of AVEGA, a group of women survivors of the genocide.
Mukabayire, 64, said she lost family members including her husband. Her survivors’ group has slightly over 19,000 members.
""We were worried that his (Kabuga's) elderly age would impede justice but now we are happy that he is arrested,"" she told Reuters by phone. 
Kabuga's arrest paves the way for him to come before the Paris Appeal Court and later be transferred to the custody of the international court, which is based in the Hague, Netherlands and Arusha, Tanzania.
The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) was established by the U.N. Security Council and closed in 2015. The International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals is now mandated to perform some functions carried out by the ICTR and the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.
The ICTR was at the centre of efforts to set new standards in international justice, though Rwandan President Paul Kagame said it was too slow and too inefficient. Some critics said it was too focused on prosecuting Hutus.

""For international justice, Kabuga’s arrest demonstrates that we can succeed when we have the international community’s support,"" Mechanism Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said in a statement.

A senior official in U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration told Reuters on Thursday the United States was considering measures it could take in response to Iran’s shipment of fuel to crisis-stricken Venezuela.
The oil sectors of Iran and Venezuela, members of OPEC, are both under U.S. sanctions. The Trump administration official declined to specify the measures being weighed but said options would be presented to Trump.
Iran's Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi passed on a message to the ambassador on Sunday warning against any U.S. threat against the Iranian tankers, according to a report on the foreign ministry website.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also wrote a letter to U.N. chief Antonio Guterres warning that any American measures against the fuel shipment would be dangerous, illegal and a form of piracy, according to the report on the foreign ministry website.
At least one tanker carrying fuel loaded at an Iranian port has set sail for Venezuela, according to vessel tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon on Wednesday, which could help ease an acute scarcity of gasoline in the South American country.
Venezuela is in desperate need of gasoline and other refined fuel products to keep the country functioning amid an economic collapse under socialist President Nicolas Maduro. Venezuela produces crude oil but its infrastructure has been crippled during the economic crisis.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele on Saturday night declared a state of emergency to extend coronavirus measures without approval by congress, touching off a torrent of criticism that the move had been unconstitutional.
Salvadoran lawmakers and prosecutors on Sunday vowed to challenge the decree, which they said had overstepped Bukele's powers. 
Less than a year into his administration, Bukele, a brash 38-year-old leader, has repeatedly angered rights groups, who say he has shown authoritarian tendencies. In February, Bukele and a group of soldiers armed with automatic weapons briefly occupied congress. Last month, he released startling photos of hundreds of jailed gang members stripped to underwear and pressed together in formation, horrifying advocates.
Congress approved an emergency declaration in March to respond to the coronavirus pandemic, but after an extension in April, the measure was due to expire Sunday. Lawmakers planned to discuss an extension when they reconvened on Monday.
Shortly after Bukele issued his decree, the Salvadoran attorney general said in a statement that it would file a suit alleging that the move was unconstitutional with the country's top court.
But Bukele, who swept to the presidency last year with an outsider candidacy, maintained he was well within his rights.
""All presidents in the democratic history of our country have had the power to declare a state of emergency and have exercised it, without legislative approval,"" he wrote in a post on Twitter on Sunday. ""Will a president be prevented for the first time from exercising that vital power?""
Bukele's administration maintains that a civil protection law authorizes the president to declare a state of emergency if congress cannot hold a session. 
They contend that the risk of the coronavirus spreading further in El Salvador justifies the measures. The country has 1,338 confirmed cases of the virus and 27 deaths.
The emergency declaration, which will remain in force over the next 30 days, extends the suspension of classes, restrictions on movement in areas affected by the pandemic and bans on gatherings of large groups. It also authorizes additional government spending during the emergency. 
Lawmakers and civil society groups urged an investigation to determine whether Bukele had exceeded his powers. 
""What would an autocrat do if Congress did not pass a law on his behalf? I would issue a decree. This has just been done by the young Salvadoran leader (Nayib Bukele) with the state of emergency. Another serious setback,” José Vivanco, executive director for the Americas for U.S.-based Human Rights Watch, wrote on Twitter.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain could experience a transport revolution sparked by the coronavirus pandemic with up to 14 million people ready to swap cars for bikes, British Cycling believes.
However, the opportunity could be lost if towns and cities fail to follow Department for Transport guidance to provide new emergency infrastructure such as pop-up cycle lanes.
Despite a loosening of the lockdown measures designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus, travelling on buses and trains is still discouraged because of social distancing concerns.
The government has announced a 2 billion-pound ($2.42 billion) funding package for ""active travel"" such as cycling and walking, with 250 million available immediately for local authorities to make changes to their roads.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson described it as an opportunity for a ""golden age for cycling"".
British Cycling says it will work with the public and policymakers, and former Olympic champion Chris Boardman, a passionate advocate for safe cycling, is acting as Policy Adviser.
Boardman, who is helping transform Manchester's cycling infrastructure in his role as the city's Walking and Cycling Commissioner, will host a webinar with 12 city authorities.
""Our country is undoubtedly at a crossroads, and we now face a stark choice between the old routine of cars, congestion and pollution or a new future of healthy streets, happy people and cleaner air,"" British Cycling chief Julie Harrington said.
""All of our research shows that people want to cycle more, and we now urge local authorities to seize the moment and make the most of the support offered by Government.""
British Cycling said it would use its network of 10,000 volunteers to assist those wanting to return to cycling -- part of its #ChooseCycling campaign.
""Enabling more people to choose cycling is vital if we want to ease pressure on public transport,"" Harrington said.
A recent survey found that 28% of Britain's adult population cycle less than once per month, but would like to do it more.
It also claims that increasing cycling to 25% of all journeys in the country by 2050 could provide over 42 billion pounds of economic benefit, while increasing cycling by 3km per day and walking by 1km amongst urban dwellers could save the NHS 17 billion pounds over the next 20 years.
Boardman says Britain may never have a better chance to change the way it moves.
""Bike riding and walking have just proved how robust they are in any kind of crisis,"" he told Reuters.
""With people being told not to use public transport, cities have cottoned on to the fact that if they don't do something there will be massive implications.""

Kuwait's health ministry said anyone caught could face up to three months in prison, while Qatar state TV reported the maximum penalty there would be three years.
In Kuwait the maximum fine stood at 5,000 dinars ($16,200) and in Qatar 200,000 riyals ($55,000).
The six Gulf states have reported a total of more than 137,400 infections with 693 deaths from the virus. Cases in the region were initially linked to travel but later saw a spread among low-income migrant workers in cramped quarters.
Saudi Arabia, with a population of around 30 million people, has the largest count at more than 54,700 cases with 312 deaths.
Qatar, a nation of some 2.8 million, has the second highest infection count at above 32,600, with 15 deaths.

The mass, held in the town of Chalons-en-Champagne, began with priests in white robes and wearing black face masks holding a procession through the parking lot, as a hymn was played and cars honked their horns.
The local bishop, Francois Touvet, stood on a podium in front of the cars as he led the service. Priests later gave out communion wafers to the faithful as they sat in their cars.
The virus outbreak and government restrictions on all public gatherings, intended to curb the spread of the virus, have forced many people in France and around the world to come up with innovative solutions to continue their activities.
France began cautiously to emerge from its lockdown on May 11, but indoor religious services remain banned until the end of the month as the government seeks to contain the risks of a second wave of infections.
""It (the lockdown) was really a deprivation for Catholics, as it was for other religions, not being able to gather in our places of worship... We very quickly came up with the idea of this formula of a drive-in mass,"" Bishop Touvet said.
MASKS AND SANITISER 
""People are in their cars, they come from the same apartment or the same house, they have alcohol gels and masks. The cars are one metre apart from each other, we give communion, and then we wash our hands,"" Touvet added.
Worshippers are prohibited from leaving their vehicle, car-pooling is banned and a maximum number of four people from the same household are allowed per vehicle.
France has so far reported 142,291 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 27,625 deaths, among the world's highest fatality rates.
One worshipper, Michelle, was delighted to be able to attend mass again.
""There's mass on television but it's not the same as being with the community at a Sunday service,"" she said.
Similar drive-in masses have taken place in other countries including Poland, where a priest has started taking confessions from the faithful in the parking lot of his church in Warsaw.

In Greece, by contrast, after the easing of a ban on public gatherings, thousands of people returned to church on Sunday after weeks of having to stay away.

The staff members of SL Mining, who hail from the United Kingdom, South Africa, India and the United States, have not been formally charged. 
The officer who ordered the arrests, Deputy Superintendent Theophilous Koroma, said they were suspected of inciting a riot in the town of Lunsar on April 30, in which two people died. 
Police said the cause of the riots was not clear, but local media reports said they were sparked by the arrest of a local youth leader. 
SL Mining said it had already conducted an internal investigation into the riot, which occurred near the Marampa mine, and found that its staff were not involved ""in any way"". 
""We are naturally very concerned for the health and safety of our employees who continue to be detained at time when the country is in a state of emergency due to Covid-19. We strongly object to their arrest and continued detention,"" it said.
The arrests come amid a dispute between SL Mining and the Sierra Leonean government over royalty payments at the Marampa iron ore mine that resulted in the government cancelling the company's mining licence last year. 
The International Chamber of Commerce’s emergency arbitration tribunal ruled last year that the export ban should be lifted, but Sierra Leonean authorities refused to do so. 

The company estimates that Marampa holds about 1 billion tonnes of iron ore with a potential lifespan of 30 years.

MILAN (Reuters) - Shops, restaurants and hair salons prepared to reopen in Italy on Monday as the government further eased one of the world's strictest coronavirus lockdowns, saying it was taking a ""calculated risk"" to put the country back on its feet.
The euro zone's third biggest economy is slowly emerging from more than two months of hibernation, with businesses allowed to gradually go back to work as long they can enforce tight sanitary protocols and keep people at least 1 metre apart.
At Milan's upscale Rinascente department store, guards will keep count through an app of how many people are in the store at any one time. Clothes tried on in changing rooms will be quarantined for 24 hours and shop assistants will spill perfumes on paper tissues rather than having customers handle testers. Access to restaurants will be strictly limited, with only family members allowed to sit close to each other.
Rinascente's Chief Executive Pierluigi Cocchini said it was difficult to predict what appetite there would be to shop after weeks of isolation. The store is reopening with markdowns of up to 60% as, like most retailers, it needs to clear unsold stocks.
""The hope is to take a step towards normality. It won't be business as usual given all the protocols, but this is the new normal for now and we have to accept it,"" he told Reuters.
Tourists, still absent, would normally generate a third of the store's sales. 
Italy's fashion industry alone, boasting brands like Armani, Prada (OTC:PRDSY) and Moncler, accounts for 5% of gross domestic product.
Business association Confcommercio expects consumer spending for clothing, which stood at 60 billion euros ($65 billion) in 2019, to shrink by 20% this year and a quarter of the country's 115,000 fashion retailers to go bust.
""I know that for several sectors of the economy, reopening does not mean recovery,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said late on Saturday as he announced the lifting of the restrictions. 
With its economy facing severe recession and public debt expected to spiral to more than 150% of its annual economic output, the government has been desperate to get the country back to work without triggering a second wave of the epidemic.
""We have to restart,"" said Rosy Riente, which runs the Cafe de l'Ange in the posh Alpine resort of Courmayeur, even though distancing rules mean that she can now sit a maximum of 35 people at any one time in her bar instead of 100.
""So far all we have done is spend money to buy sanitising gels and disinfectants,"" she said. 
Others prefer to wait until European borders reopen on June 3. Tourism contributes 13% to the country's economic output.
""My shop looks like a hospital, with plexiglass screens at the till, sanitisers, face masks and gloves,"" said Maurizio Di Rienzo, owner of suitcase shop Pellux in central Milan, whose eight employees have been furloughed.
""90% of my clients are tourists, most of them Chinese. It doesn't make sense for me to reopen just yet.""

Slovenia became the first European country on Thursday to declare an official end to its coronavirus epidemic.
The small mountainous country of around two million people has so far reported 1,466 coronavirus cases and 104 deaths. Slovenes still have to respect social distancing and are obliged to wear face masks in indoor public spaces as well as disinfect their hands when entering such areas.
There were about 200 skiers at the Kanin resort on Sunday morning, with up to 300 expected during the whole day. The resort lies in western Slovenia, close to the border with Italy, and boasts a snow cover of at least 3.5 meters depth at present.
""Unique, fantastic, the weather, the snow, the silence, the air, being free,"" said Barbara and Franci, a couple from the capital Ljubljana.
Slovenia started easing its lockdown measures on April 20. Public transport resumed on May 11 and Kanin ski resort reopened on May 14. All shops and restaurants will be able to reopen on Monday when some pupils will also return to schools.
""The hardest thing (during the epidemic) was that I could not be fully active in sports and I can feel today that I am a bit out of condition,"" said Omer, another skiier from Ljubljana.
Although the government has provided financial help to citizens and companies hit by the coronavirus, tourist centres have seen a sharp fall in their income due to the coronavirus epidemic and the resulting lockdown.

The government expects Slovenia's economy to shrink by at least 8% this year after a 2.4% expansion in 2019.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's parliament approved on Sunday Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's new unity government, ending more than a year of political deadlock, but he still faces a trial starting next week for alleged corruption.
His decision to share power with former rival, centrist Blue and White leader Benny Gantz, opens the way for Netanyahu to proceed towards a pledged annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank, land that Palestinians seek for a state.
After three inconclusive elections, the conservative Netanyahu will remain prime minister for 18 months before handing over to his new partner.
Gantz, a former armed forces chief, will be Netanyahu's defence minister and ""alternate prime minister"", a new position that Netanyahu will hold when Gantz takes the helm.
By assuming that ""alternate"" premiership once he hands over to Gantz, Netanyahu hopes to avoid having to resign under legal rules that allow a prime minister to remain in office even if charged with a crime. 
Israel's longest-serving leader, Netanyahu, 70, first came to power in 1996 and has served three consecutive terms since 2009. He goes on trial on May 24 on charges of bribery, breach of trust and fraud, which he denies.
""The people wanted unity, and that is what it got,"" Netanyahu told parliament, citing a desire to steer clear of a fourth election and the need for a national battle against the coronavirus crisis.
Lawmakers ratified the new administration by a vote of 73 to 46.
WEST BANK
Netanyahu can now push forward his plan to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank, territory Palestinians want for their own independent state.
""These regions are where the Jewish nation was born and rose. It is time to apply Israeli law on them and write another great chapter in the annals of Zionism,"" he said.
But while Netanyahu has set July 1 as a starting point for cabinet discussions on the highly contentious issue, there is no publicly stated deadline for annexation of land that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Palestinians have vehemently opposed such a move, urging international sanctions against Israel in response. It would be certain to heighten tensions in the West Bank and Gaza. 
""These colonial and expansionist positions confirm once again his (Netanyahu's) ideological enmity towards peace,"" the Palestinian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Gantz, 60, had cited the criminal charges against Netanyahu after the latest election in March when he again pledged to his own voters that he would not serve in a government with the veteran conservative leader. 
Angering many of his supporters and splitting his own party, he made a deal in the end, saying the coronavirus crisis made national unity an imperative.
The new cabinet will have a record 36 ministers. Several new posts have been created to ensure both Netanyahu and Gantz can bring loyalists on board.

Opposition leader Yair Lapid ridiculed the public-health rationale behind the coalition, noting the number of Israeli COVID-19 victims on ventilators had fallen so steeply that the new government ""could place a minister next to each bed"".

GRAN CANARIA (Reuters) - Spain's coast guard rescued 49 African migrants from a dinghy drifting a few miles off the coast of Gran Canaria on Sunday, a spokesman for the organisation said, the latest arrivals in a months-long surge of migration to the Canary Islands. 
A fisherman spotted the dinghy and alerted the coast guard, which brought it and its occupants to the port of Arguineguin, he added. 
All the people found on board were male, and 35 of them were believed to be under 18, according to the Red Cross, which takes in illegal migrants who make it to the islands.
As they stepped ashore, Red Cross staff wearing masks, gloves and goggles took the migrants' temperature, before wrapping them in blankets and ushering them into tents set up near the harbour. 
Data from Spain's Interior Ministry show irregular migration to the Canaries is up nearly 700% so far this year, with 1,936 arrivals reported by the end of April compared with just 243 last year. 

Overall migration to Spain is down around 24% over the same period.

Fighters from the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo (CODECO) militia group, which is made up of fighters from the Lendu ethnic group, attacked the Hema village of Ndjala in Ituri province at around 1 a.m. on Sunday, the army and local authorities said.
""They cut with the machetes several of my compatriots, 20 have already died and more than 14 seriously injured,"" said Solo Bukutupa, a local administrator.
""It's unbearable to see people die like that.""
The attackers fled after United Nations peacekeepers arrived at the village and they later fired on a nearby UN base, a UN source said.
Fighting by an array of armed groups in the region has complicated Congo's response to the coronavirus pandemic and an Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 2,200 people since 2018.
CODECO split into several competing factions after the Congolese army killed its leader Justin Ngudjolo in late March.
Earlier this month Ngabu Ngawi Olivier, who claimed to have taken over the leadership of CODECO, surrendered to the army and called for the militia to lay down its weapons. 
Another faction later issued a statement denouncing Olivier as an imposter. No fighters have followed Olivier's orders yet, said army spokesman Jules Ngongo.
Rich in natural resources including gold, diamonds and coltan, Ituri province was the site of some of the country's worst fighting between 1999 and 2007, after a power struggle between rebel groups descended into ethnic violence -- much of it between the Hema and Lendu.
After several years of relative calm, tit-for-tat fighting erupted again in December 2017, reviving longstanding tensions over land.
The unrest has since evolved into more coordinated attacks by the Lendu community on the army and the Hema ethnic group.
Late last year the army launched a large-scale operation to uproot a constellation of militias operating in the east of the country, sparking a backlash that has seen at least 350 people killed by armed groups in Ituri, the UN source said.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Every day, thousands of Mexicans crowd a massive food market that is a linchpin of the capital's food supply, though it sits at the heart of a major hotspot for the virus.
Mexico City's sprawling Central de Abasto market, stretching across an area equivalent to about 327 football pitches, poses a major headache for officials trying to keep food supplies flowing without magnifying the spread of the coronavirus.
It is a daunting task in a market known to attract about a half a million people a day in normal times, according to figures from officials in Iztapalapa, a neighborhood with the highest numbers of coronavirus infections in Mexico.
In addition to shoppers and wholesale buyers who throng the market at night to supply retail outlets in the metropolis, another 100,000 workers typically cram the corridors lined with sacks of potatoes, rice and boxes of bananas.
Local officials have not detailed how many visitors the market is receiving during the quarantine, but the market's organizers say vehicle traffic has fallen by about 30%.
In early May, the capital's government included the shopping complex in a list of 89 areas deemed to have ""high-risk of contagion"" as part of efforts to prevent an outbreak.
Still, completely shutting the market that serves a sizeable swath of Mexico's 25 million people is not an option, said Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum, because it would devastate the regional food supply.
""Central de Abasto cannot be closed,""Sheinbaum said late last month. ""We are taking very strict measures so that as few people as possible go.""
Unlike those living in the leafy upscale areas of Mexico's cosmopolitan capital, the drivers, cleaners and vendors in the working class Iztapalapa area say they have no choice but to risk the virus.
""The government says to stay in quarantine. So how are we going to eat?"", asked Fernando Torres, one of the thousands of people who works in the market.
""I know that I am in the hands of God,"" added Torres, sporting a cloth mask over his face. ""If God says, 'The coronavirus will take you,' it will take me. But I try to take care of myself.""
With about 2,500 confirmed cases and more than 200 deaths, Iztapalapa accounts for about a fifth of the total number of infections and deaths related to the virus in Mexico City, the epicenter of the pandemic in the country.
Experts attribute the rapid spread of the disease in part to the location of the neighborhood, the most populous in the capital, connecting the center of the sprawling city with the dense suburbs of the state of Mexico.
Residents are further handicapped by poor public services, such as scarcity of drinking water. More than a third of the population lives in poverty in the city borough, according to government data.
Two of the four public hospitals serving COVID-19 patients in Iztapalapa were saturated on Saturday, according to government data. Area funeral homes and crematoriums have also said they were getting slammed. 
Reuters made repeated requests for an interview with Clara Brugada, mayor of the Iztapalapa area, but she was not made available in time for publication.
""CUTTING THE TRANSMISSION CHAIN""
Due to the coronavirus, the market is operating at 85% of capacity. It typically receives more than 15,000 products every day from all over the country in more than 60,000 cargo vehicles, officials say.
The decision to tighten surveillance came just after market authorities acknowledged about 25 people had been infected and reported two deaths related to the virus at the facility, where about $9 billion changes hands each year.
 As part of the precautionary measures, children and pregnant women are prohibited from entering, while health personnel have begun to carry out COVID-19 tests. Hundreds of police officers and other public employees are stationed to measure visitors' temperatures.
""What we are trying (to do) is cut the transmission chain,"" said Javier Serna, health officer at the Iztapalapa mayor's office.
    However, Serna said 34 additional cases of coronavirus were detected last week after conducting 450 tests among market personnel.
In the neighborhood around the market, dozens of shops remain open and residents can be seen walking without face masks -- in contrast to the desolate streets in more affluent areas of the capital.
Angeles Medina, 33, lost her job in a plastic factory after the coronavirus outbreak, and now sells tacos and coffee outside a metro station 10 minutes from the market.

""I am afraid of getting infected or bringing an infection to my house, but we have to work,"" Medina said.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albanian authorities began demolishing the national theatre building early on Sunday after dragging away two dozen actors and activists protecting the site, drawing a large crowd chanting ""shame"" and ""dictatorship"".
For more than two years actors, activists and the opposition have contested plans by Socialist Prime Minister Edi Rama to build a new theatre, saying the existing building was part of the country's heritage, and accused him of corrupt practices. 
A large police force showed up before dawn and removed members of the Alliance to Protect the Theatre, using pepper spray. Mechanized diggers then began demolishing its front column, bearing the words ""National Theatre"".
The fate of the building, constructed in 1939 and made into a national theatre in 1945, has divided society, with many angry that Rama had chosen to act during the coronavirus lockdown.
""This is no longer about the theatre's demolition but the downfall of democracy and freedom. We are in a dictatorship,"" an unidentified member of the alliance said on a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) video.
Rama, whose government says the theatre was decrepit and in need of modernisation, stuck to his idea he was pushing for progress, after building a new soccer stadium and market.
""These are the same people who rise against every project in Tirana. They do not want development, but they cannot stop Tirana,"" Rama said in a Facebook post.
Protesters shoved police blocking access to the site and chanted ""down with the dictatorship"", leading to 37 arrests. One policeman was hospitalized after being hit by protesters, while a Reuters witness also saw one protester with head injuries.
One of those arrested, media analyst Alfred Lela, said after his release that police had used unjustified violence and verbal abuse. Policemen kicked protesters, who threw water bottles, according to a Reuters witness.
The police said accusations of violence were untrue.
Critics of the original plan for a new theatre said the work had been awarded to one of the government's preferred partners without being subject to tender, with the construction of several new high-rise properties included in the deal.
The Socialist government withdrew that plan in February.
Protesters have claimed that a six-month period is required by law for a new project to be approved, and that the government has not secured the proper permits to carry out the demolition.
Mariya Gabriel, the European Union's Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth Commissioner, last week urged further discussions before any decision was made on the theatre. 
Opposition Democratic Party leader Lulzim Basha said the demolition was illegal, and had also ""demolished the foundations of society"".

President Ilir Meta, who holds a largely ceremonial role in government, has complained to the constitutional court about the demolition, which he has called an ""legal, moral and constitutional crime"". The court is yet to rule.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Thousands of Greeks returned to church on Sunday after weeks of staying away as a ban on mass gatherings to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus was eased.
It was a special moment for those who gathered from early Sunday morning in the courtyard of Ayios Spiridonas Church in Piraeus, where the melodious chants of the Sunday liturgy were broadcast on loudspeakers and heard down at the sea port. 
""I was moved,"" said Vassilis Kitsas, 36, after attending the service in the church, consecrated after a Cypriot-born saint credited, among other feats, of ridding the island of Corfu of the plague after islanders prayed to him. 
""I think that when you have something, you don't really appreciate it until it's gone. I think this has made us stronger than what we were,"" Kitsas told Reuters.
Greeks were not only deprived of weekly congregations but had to spend the highlight of their religious calendar, Easter, which was on April 19, indoors. The lockdown was introduced in mid-March. 
Normally adjoining pews were replaced with chairs inside the church and in its courtyard as social distancing rules applied. Chairs were set two metres apart with boundaries in the courtyard marked with red and white masking tape.
Disposable gloves and antiseptic was available at the entrance. Some individuals kissed icons, as is customary in the Greek Orthodox religion. A woman wiped the icon with an antiseptic before the next person approached.
Church warden Petros Anagnostakis, 74, said preparations to reopen the church had been ongoing for about a week. ""Today is a great celebration, we are overjoyed and touched, it's a great celebration for us,"" he said, visibly moved.
In unison, churchgoers recited the Creed, a declaration of faith in God and Jesus.
Greece has recorded a lower number of COVID-19 cases and deaths than other countries. By Saturday evening it had recorded 2,819 cases and 162 deaths. 

""I think it's a miracle that Greece didn't have that many deaths or people sick,"" said Stella Kasimati, 76. ""I believe that was help from God.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his rival Abdullah Abdullah signed a power-sharing deal to end a months-long political stalemate, Ghani's spokesman said on Sunday, a step that could smooth efforts to end the country's longrunning war.
""The Political Agreement between President Ghani and Dr. Abdullah Abdullah has just been signed,"" said Sediq Sediqqi, Ghani's spokesman, on Twitter. Abdullah would lead the council for peace talks with the insurgent Taliban and his team members would be included in cabinet, Sediqqi added.
Seddiqi said more details would be released shortly. It was not immediately known which ministerial positions Abdullah's camp would control.
Abdullah had disputed the results of an election in September and announced the formation of a parallel government earlier this year, undermining Ghani's administration at a time when the United States was trying to advance a peace process with the Taliban to end the 19-year Afghan war. 
Discussions over the final sticking points including the allocation of some key posts had been underway throughout the day, three sources said.
Abdullah had wanted to control a major portfolio such as finance or foreign affairs and while Ghani had not agreed to this, he could offer control of the interior ministry, sources said shortly before the deal was signed. 
Washington has been frustrated by the growing impasse between the two men, even after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travelled to Kabul in March to mediate. It had announced it planned to cut $1 billion in aid because the men could not agree.
It was not immediately clear whether Sunday's agreement would result in the aid commitment being reinstated. Afghanistan is facing growing fiscal pressures, with tax revenues falling and foreign aid pledges due this year expected to shrink.
Officials say a deal between the Ghani and Abdullah is crucial to launching peace talks, as Abdullah's camp represents much of the country's north-west.
But the talks face a number of stark challenges, as violence in the country increases. An attack on a Kabul maternity ward this week prompted Ghani to switch the military to an ""offensive"" stance against insurgent groups.
The Taliban has denied involvement in the attack, but the government has remained sceptical and angry at ongoing Taliban attacks against the Afghan military, fraying the momentum for peace talks, which were due to start in March.

U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said on Friday that a new date for intra-Afghan peace talks was under discussion and he would soon travel to the region and try to encourage a reduction in violence.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - About 200 Los Angeles cooks are back at work, launching a California project to use federal disaster relief money that pays restaurants to prepare and deliver thousands of healthy meals for at-risk seniors.
The program, called Great Plates Delivered, is part of the state's effort to ease suffering inflicted by the coronavirus pandemic that has left a trail of death, unemployment and hunger in its wake.
Alba Molina, 57, a cold food prep cook at downtown's Westin Bonaventure hotel, is among the workers who mask up for duty at the otherwise deserted property near the Los Angeles Convention Center.
""It's helping me pay my bills. It's not just any job, it's a good job with benefits,"" Molina said.
Next week, Molina and her colleagues at other restaurants and hotels will turn out meals for nearly 4,700 seniors in the greater Los Angeles area. ""I feel honored to be able to provide them this service,"" Molina said.
During a recent Reuters visit to the Bonaventure, the workers filled trays with baked salmon, steamed broccoli, wild rice pilaf, salad, vegetables, roast turkey, and fruit. They then packed the meals into labeled boxes and handed them to waiting taxi drivers, who make the twice-weekly deliveries.
Driver Fredy Gomez, 51, who hadn't worked for a month, filled his taxi's trunk and seats with the boxes. Clad in surgical gloves and a black face covering, Gomez ferried them up the freeway to a cluster of small single-family homes, where he delivered the meals to elderly residents. 
FEMA FUNDING
California Governor Gavin Newsom announced the project in late April with the stated goals of serving a population vulnerable to COVID-19; boosting employment from farm to kitchen; and generating much-needed tax revenue for cities.
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds cover 75% of the cost of the program, which debuted in Los Angeles in early May and is expanding to serve eligible seniors in all of Los Angeles County, participating organizations said.
The effort is spearheaded by the Hospitality Training Academy (HTA) and hotel and restaurant union Unite Here.
Some of those taking part include the University of Southern California, the Beverly Hilton, and  Compass Group 's (L:CPG) Levy Restaurants - which serves the Los Angeles Convention Center and Dodger Stadium. 
""We have the largest kitchens in the region by far - you can spread people out. We can assure that people are getting their temperatures taken,"" said HTA executive director Adine Forman. 
Some government assistance programs have come under fire for helping large rather than small businesses. In this case, the employees - who have full healthcare coverage - are the biggest beneficiaries, said Susan Minato, co-president of Unite Here Local 11.
""These are workers living on the margins,"" she said.
THREE IN ONE
Many of the Los Angeles recipients come from a temporarily shuttered service that previously shuttled them to senior centers for meals and activities, Minato said.
California pays the restaurants $66 a day to cover the cost of three daily meals, packaging, and delivery, said Rodger Butler, a spokesman for California Health and Human Services. The program for Los Angeles is slightly different, but still funded by Great Plates.
The program boosts demand in the hard-hit foodservice supply chain that provides 55-gallon barrels of butter, 5-lb bags of lettuce and other super-sized products that are perfect for restaurants, cafeterias and event companies, but too unwieldy for grocery stores and food banks.
""Anything like this helps (to make sure) food waste is minimized and our communities are helped - whether that's a farmer or a senior citizen who is at home alone,"" said Jamie Johansson, president of the California Farm Bureau Federation.
During the first week of the program, the total bill for the program in Los Angeles was $80,000.
The purchases generate sales taxes that could help offset billions of dollars in projected coronavirus-related revenue losses that California cities expect over the next two years.
""Whenever you can hit three policy goals with a program, that's really, really good,"" said Lee Ohanian, an economist at the University of California Los Angeles.

""This is something other states should be considering,"" said economic consultant George Jouganatos, a part-time professor at California State University Sacramento.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Wearing masks and keeping about a metre apart, men and women in Wuhan were dancing once again on a Saturday night by the side of the Yangtze river, which winds through the central Chinese city where the novel coronavirus pandemic began.
Wuhan's 76-day lockdown ended on April 8, and the city is slowly getting back on its feet, hopeful that the worst is passed, but worried by the emergence last week of a few fresh cases on the virus. 
While most large indoor gatherings are still banned, people are reclaiming their daily lives and hobbies, which in many parts of China includes ""square dancing"", or mass dances, usually in the evenings in public squares, plazas or parks.
On Saturday night, over a hundred masked people danced on an open-air riverside walkway in central Wuhan as loudspeakers blared out everything from electronic dance music to Japanese pop. 
Some waltzed in pairs. Others moved in sync to choreographed dance routines. All wore masks, and mostly kept apart.
""It's quite hard to breathe when wearing this mask to dance and you can't get rid of the perspiration, but my mood is great, we can finally gather,"" said Zhang Jing, 42, adding that she had rejoined her dancing group at the start of May. 
Still, worries about the virus linger.
""I do still feel a little constrained, (dancing) doesn't feel as free with a mask, and I am a little afraid that there could be cross infection,"" said Fang Yuanyuan, 50. 
COVID-19 first struck Wuhan late last year, and it became the epicentre of China's outbreak, accounting for about 80% of the country's coronavirus cases, but the strict lockdown helped stifle new infections, allowing curbs on movement to be relaxed.
Last week, however, the city reported its first cluster of new infections since the lockdown was lifted, stoking fears of a second wave, and prompting authorities to launch a campaign to test all 11 million residents for the coronavirus. 
Mainland China reported five new confirmed COVID-19 cases for May 16, down from eight the previous day, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement on Sunday.

The idea, already implemented between South Korea and China, would allow a fast-track entry of business people if they test negative for the new coronavirus before departure and after arrival, the newspaper said.
But Tokyo is cautious about relaxing border controls at this point due to fears of another spike in infections, as well as a lack of test kits for travellers, according to the report.
Japan's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday lifted his state of emergency for 39 of Japan's 47 prefectures, easing curbs on 54% of the population. The greater Tokyo area, accounting for one-third of the nation's economy, and other major cities remain under restrictions.
Japan has reported some 16,300 cases of the coronavirus, not counting infections on a cruise ship that was quarantined in Yokohama port early this year, and 748 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to public broadcaster NHK.
While Japan has avoided the kind of explosive outbreaks seen in the United States and elsewhere, its testing has also been among the lowest.

WARSAW (Reuters) - The Polish Catholic Church's most senior archbishop notified the Vatican on Saturday of a Polish bishop accused of shielding priests known to have sexually abused children.
The referral, unprecedented in the deeply religious country, will test procedures introduced by the Vatican last year to hold to account bishops accused of turning a blind eye to child sex abuse. The Vatican is now expected to assign an investigator to the case. 
""I ask priests, nuns, parents and educators to not be led by the false logic of shielding the Church, effectively hiding sexual abusers,"" Poland's Primate Wojciech Polak said in a statement published on Saturday.
""There is no place among the clergy to sexually abuse minors. We do not allow for the hiding of these crimes.""
The case came to prominence after a film by brothers Tomasz and Marek Sekielski, released on Saturday, showed how bishop Edward Janiak, based in the city of Kalisz, failed to take action against priests who were known to have abused children.
Janiak, who is still practicing, has not commented directly on the allegations. He did not respond to a request for comment by Reuters.
In Janiak's defence, the Kalisz curia said the parents of one of the alleged victims portrayed in the film did not follow the right procedure.
""The recording in the film doesn't show the whole conversation. It doesn't show the part where we say that the parents should've expressed their concerns to the prosecutor immediately,"" it said in a statement. 
The Sekielski brothers released another film last year that suggested that known paedophiles were deliberately shifted between parishes. The film has over 23 million views on YouTube. 
Victims of sexual abuse have long called for measures to make it easier to report alleged cover-ups by the Church. 
Poland's Catholic Church, an institution with close ties to the ruling nationalist Law and Justice party, has faced accusations in the past of shielding priests who abuse children.
A Church official told Reuters that Janiak's referral was partly the result of the Vatican's new procedure. 
""I believe that this is just a facade,"" said Agata Diduszko-Zyglewska, a co-author of a map marking child sexual abuse by priests around Poland. 
""For the last year, the Catholic Episcopate has known that there are bishops who covered up paedophilia cases, and yet none of them have been dismissed.""

Poland faces tension between liberals who feel the Church wields too much power and conservatives who see the Catholic faith as a key element of national identity that must be protected.

PARIS/KAMPALA (Reuters) - Rwandan genocide suspect Felicien Kabuga, who is accused of funding militias that massacred about 800,000 people, was arrested on Saturday near Paris after 26 years on the run, the French justice ministry said.
The 84-year-old, who is Rwanda's most-wanted man and had a $5 million U.S. bounty on his head, was living under a false identity in a flat in Asnieres-Sur-Seine, according to the ministry.
French gendarmes arrested him at 0530 GMT on Saturday, the ministry said.
Kabuga was indicted in 1997 on seven criminal counts including genocide, complicity in genocide and incitement to commit genocide, all in relation to the 1994 Rwanda genocide, according to the UN-established International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals (IRMCT).
Rwanda's two main ethnic groups are the Hutus and Tutsis, who have historically had an antagonistic relationship and fought a civil war in the early 1990s. 
A Hutu businessman, Kabuga is accused of funding the militias that massacred some 800,000 Tutsis and their moderate Hutu allies over a span of 100 days in 1994.
""Since 1994, Felicien Kabuga, known to have been the financier of Rwanda genocide, had with impunity stayed in Germany, Belgium, Congo-Kinshasa, Kenya, or Switzerland,""
the French ministry statement said.
His arrest paves the way for the fugitive to come before the Paris Appeal Court and later be transferred to the custody of the international court, which is based in the Hague, Netherlands and Arusha, Tanzania. He would then be brought before UN judges, an IRMCT spokesman said.
Two other Rwandan genocide suspects, Augustin Bizimana and Protais Mpiranya, are still being pursued by international justice.
""The arrest of Félicien Kabuga today is a reminder that those responsible for genocide can be brought to account, even twenty-six years after their crimes,"" the IRMCT's Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said in a statement.
He added the arrest was the result of cooperation between law enforcement agencies in France and other countries including the United States, Rwanda, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Netherlands and others.
Rwanda's justice minister, Johnston Busingye, told Reuters that a statement on the arrest would be issued but did not specify when. 
Kabuga, who controlled many of Rwanda's tea and coffee plantations and factories, was part-owner of Radio Television Milles Collines which ran a radio station that fanned ethnic hatred against Rwanda's Tutsis, told Hutus where Tutsis were to be found and offered advice on how to kill them.
He is accused of being a main financier of the genocide, paying for the militias that carried out the massacres.

His arrest ""is an important step towards justice for hundreds of thousands of genocide victims...survivors can hope to see justice and suspects cannot expect to escape accountability,"" Mausi Segun, Africa director at Human Rights Watch, told Reuters.

The shelling caused a fire at the shelter in Fornaj district, located near a frontline and home to people forced from their homes after earlier bouts of fighting, said Usama Ali, spokesman for Tripoli's emergency and ambulance service. 
Ali said the emergency services were attempting to evacuate the shelter of the remaining displaced people and relocate them elsewhere in the city, Ali said. People in the Fornaj shelter were mostly from the nearby Ain Zara district. 
The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) launched an offensive 13 months ago to capture Tripoli, seat of the Government of National Accord (GNA), which is recognised by the United Nations. 
The United Nations said last month that four fifths of civilian casualties in Libya's civil war during the first three months of 2020 were attributable to the LNA, which is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. 
The GNA has this year put the LNA onto the back foot with new help from Turkey, pushing it out of a string of towns west of Tripoli and putting it under pressure in its northwestern strongholds of Tarhouna and al-Watiya airbase. 
Turkish support for the GNA has been most effective through its deployment of anti-aircraft defences, and with its drones that have hammered LNA efforts to resupply the northwest battlefronts from the east. 
On Saturday, the LNA said it had destroyed a Turkish drone at al-Watiya. The GNA said it had destroyed a Russian-supplied anti-aircraft system at the same location, though an LNA spokesman denied that. 
The fighting in and around Tripoli has added to terrible conditions for residents, who this week faced long power and water cuts during a fierce spike in temperatures.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - India should speak with Taliban militants if it feels that it will help the peace process, Pakistan's envoy to Washington said on Saturday, after a series of attacks in Afghanistan raised questions about whether the U.S. peace effort may collapse.
In an interview with The Hindu, an Indian newspaper, U.S. Special Representative for Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad said it would be ""appropriate"" for an India-Taliban engagement.
India and Pakistan have gone to war three times since they won independence from British colonial rule in 1947 and Pakistan has guarded the influence it has over the Taliban. 
Islamabad has long been resistant to India increasing its influence in Pakistan. 
""It is for India to respond to that suggestion,"" Pakistan's Ambassador to the United States Asad Khan told Reuters. 
Asked if he was open to an Indian dialogue with the Taliban, Khan said: ""If India feels that their engagement is going to help the peace process, then we would defer to their judgment. But it's not for us to sit in judgment on what they should do or they shouldn't do.""
He stopped short of saying he was open to an Indian engagement with the Taliban or whether Islamabad favored such a move. 
However, any acquiescence by Islamabad to an Indian role could be seen in Kabul and elsewhere as a sign of growing international concern with the peace push. 
Khan said that he would hopefully be speaking with Khalilzad soon and did not go by Indian media accounts, which he said in many cases are ""fanciful"" and give their own interpretations. 
The two nuclear armed neighbors came close to another war last year after a deadly attack on Indian police by a Pakistan-based militant group resulted in air strikes by both countries.
Pakistan's role in the peace negotiations is a delicate one, with Islamabad seeking to avoid demonstrating the kind of broad influence over the Taliban that Washington has long accused it of having.
Two attacks in Afghanistan on Tuesday have complicated the U.S. push for peace. One attack, on a Kabul hospital's maternity ward, killed 24 people, including two babies. Another, at a funeral in eastern Afghanistan, killed 32.
The United States has blamed the Islamic State for the attacks.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani ordered the military on Tuesday to switch to ""offensive mode"" against the Taliban following the attacks.

Hundreds of protestors gathered in Warsaw's Old Town in the early afternoon, carrying signs saying ""Work and bread"" and ""It will be normal again."" 
Poland has been steadily loosening coronavirus restrictions in recent weeks in an effort to cushion the economy. Hair salons and restaurants are expected to reopen with new safety measures in place on Monday. 
But the protestors, who have gathered in Warsaw repeatedly in recent weeks, say restrictions need to be lifted further in order for them to sustain their livelihoods.
Police blocked the planned march, saying in a statement published on Twitter that public gatherings are still banned under the government restrictions.
""Unfortunately we are dealing with cases of aggression towards police. Due to the attacks on civil servants, we used methods of direct confrontation such as physical force and (tear) gas,"" the Warsaw police said in a tweet. 
Jacek Bury, a senator and member of Poland's main opposition grouping, the Civic Coalition, said he was detained by police during the protest and that they used force against him. 
As a senator, Bury would have immunity from being prosecuted for taking part in the protest and breaking coronavirus restrictions.
The police said on Twitter that they did not detain anyone who held state immunity, arguing the senator had entered a police vehicle himself and refused to leave it. 
Borys Budka, the head of the Civic Coalition, said on Twitter that he expected the interior minister and the head of Warsaw's police service to explain the use of force during Saturday's protest.
The organizers of the protest were not immediately available for comment. 
The government has said that some restrictions need to remain in place for some time still, to ensure public safety and prevent the virus spread from accelerating. 

Poland has confirmed 18,257 cases of coronavirus and 915 deaths.

The Metropolitan Police said that a group in central London's Hyde Park had been protesting about the government's response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and had failed to comply with repeated requests to disperse.
""It was disappointing that a relatively small group in Hyde Park came together to protest the regulations in clear breach of the guidance, putting themselves and others at risk of infection,"" Laurence Taylor, Deputy Assistant Commissioner at the Metropolitan Police, said in a statement.
""Officers once again, took a measured approach and tried to engage the group to disperse. They clearly had no intention of doing so, and so it did result in 19 people being arrested, and a further ten being issued with a fixed penalty notice.""
Last Sunday, Johnson outlined plans to ease the lockdown, and people in England are now allowed to meet with another person from a different household in a park. However social distancing must be maintained under the rules, and gatherings of large groups are not allowed.
The protesters represented a minority of those the police encountered on Saturday, Taylor said.

""It was pleasing to see that people were largely compliant with the government guidance. Where they weren’t, and after we engaged with them, they quickly were,"" he said.

People living in low-infection zones of France, so-called green zones, were able to hit the beach after the government began easing restrictions on Monday. Local officials reopened selected beaches in Northern France and Mediterranean coasts on Saturday.
But there are new rules: individual activities such as swimming, fishing or surfing are allowed, provided social-distancing is respected, but sunbathing or staying on a beach for hours is not permitted.
""I'm a bit annoyed. We could swim this morning. We could enjoy the sea which we had not seen for nearly two months. Now, we cannot yet sunbathe and lounge. We're semi-free,"" said a local bather sporting a straw hat as he strolled the rather empty pebbly beach. 
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner went to Veules-Les- Roses beach in the northern region of Normandy to check on the situation.
""The virus is still around. We must learn to live with it. One can go fishing but not linger on the beach for hours. We are all responsible in the fight against COVID- 19,"" he said.
""If the rules are not respected, we will reverse our decisions (to open some beaches),"" he warned.
The easing of France's eight-week lockdown, one of the strictest in Europe, started on May 11, allowing non-essential shops, factories and other businesses to re-open.
During lockdown, beaches, forest parks were closed to the public. Forests have re-opened and the government ruled that beaches could reopen on a case-by-case basis if local mayors applied for this. 
The country is split into ""green zones"" where the infection rate is low and ""red zones"", including the greater Paris region, where the rate is higher and more restrictions are in place. To date, France has recorded 141,919 cases and 27,529 deaths from the disease.
Theatres, restaurants and bars remain closed across the country until at least June.
The government announced measures worth 18 billion euros ($19 billion) on Thursday to support the tourism sector, which has been hammered by the coronavirus crisis and resulting shutdown of beaches, leisure attractions and hotels.

In Greece, authorities opened some 500 beaches, although with measures to ensure social distancing.

SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Thousands marched through Sarajevo on Saturday to commemorate victims of the Ustasa regime, a puppet state founded by Croat fascists and allied to Nazi Germany, and to oppose a Catholic Mass held in the city for Ustasa and their families, slain at the end of World War Two.
The Mass is part of annual commemorations that Croatia introduced three decades ago for the tens of thousands of Croatian and Bosnian Ustasa members and their supporters, who were reportedly killed by the partisans of Yugoslav communist leader Josip Broz Tito at the end of the war.
The commemorations usually take place in the Austrian village of Bleiburg, on the border with Slovenia, but this year Austrian authorities cancelled the planned open air Mass due to bans on large gatherings and travel restrictions because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The Croatian and Bosnian Bishops' Conferences then announced they would hold the Mass in Sarajevo instead, in a move which outraged anti-fascist and Jewish groups who said it would honour a regime that killed more than 10,000 Sarajevans, most of them Jews.
Saturday's protest in Sarajevo stretched from the site in the city where Ustasa militias hanged 55 local anti-fascists in spring 1945 to the central memorial for the city's World War Two liberators, Tito's partisans. 
People blocked the traffic and sang anti-fascist songs, notably Bella Ciao, the anthem of Italian anti-fascists. 
""My two grandfathers, their brothers and my grandmother were all killed by these fascists who have been honoured today,"" said retired electro-technician Cedomir Jaksic, 63. 
""It is not normal that a city such as Sarajevo, which was terrorised so much in both World War Two and the last war (in the 1990s), allows something like this to happen,"" he added. 
Billboards with photographs of the hanged anti-fascists were displayed at both sites. A red banner reading ""I am an anti-fascist too"" was displayed across Sarajevo's main street.
After the defeat of the Nazis, Ustasa supporters fled the Balkans and reached Bleiburg, before being sent back and meeting their deaths.
The Croatian parliament has sponsored the Bleiburg event as a commemoration of ""victims of the communist regime"". But in recent years it has turned into a rally used by Croatian far-right groups trying to rehabilitate the Ustasa regime. 
PROTECTED MASS
Police sealed off the area around Sarajevo's Catholic Cathedral, where Bosnian Archbishop Cardinal Vinko Puljic said Mass to a congregation of few dozen Croat dignitaries and priests.
In his sermon Puljic asked for more information on how the people had died and where they were buried, as well as for respect and forgiveness for all victims of World War Two. Smaller memorials were also held in Zagreb and Bleiburg.
The members of the Bosnian tripartite presidency condemned the Mass, as did the U.S and Israeli embassies in Bosnia.
The speaker of the Croatian parliament, Gordan Jandrokovic, said during a brief commemoration in Zagreb that they aimed to commemorate innocent victims and did not plan to rehabilitate the Ustasa.

The elite Revolutionary Guards would be in charge of organising the rallies, Rouhani said, adding that those joining in could still chant slogans from their vehicles and wave flags.
Rallies to mark Quds Day, which uses the Arabic name for Jerusalem, are held in towns and cities across the country and aim to show of support for the Palestinians. Typically those marching chant ""Death to Israel"" and burn the Israeli flag.
Rouhani said Quds Day, held each year on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan which falls on May 22, would go ahead as normal in 218 other towns and cities, where the coronavirus outbreak has been less severe than the capital.
""The coronavirus danger is still there, but our situation is better than before,"" he said. """"We have crossed the main peak.""
As of Saturday, Iran's death toll from the pandemic stood at 6,937 with 118,392 diagnosed cases, the health ministry said.
The ministry spokesman said the death toll in the past 24 hours was 35, the lowest in the past 70 days, while the number of new cases was 1,757.
Shia Muslim shrines dotted around the country are due to reopen for six hours a day after Ramadan, which is based on the lunar calendar and is expected to end around May 24 this year.
Shrines would open for three hours in the morning and three hours in the afternoon, Rouhani said, although he said some areas of the shrines, such as narrow corridors, would stay shut.
The president said restaurants would also reopen after Ramadan and sports activities would resume without spectators. Universities, but not medical schools, would reopen on June 6, Rouhani added.

Germany's death toll from the virus has been lower than most of its European neighbours and some lockdown measures have already been relaxed.
However, protests against the measures Chancellor Angela Merkel insists are needed to slow down the coronavirus outbreak have become more vocal and demonstrators have filled the streets for the second weekend in a row.
Derided on social media as ""covidiots"" who risk causing a second wave of infections that could lead to a tightening of restrictions, protesters staged demonstrations at several locations across the capital Berlin and the surrounding state of Brandenburg.
In Stuttgart, where some protesters last weekend had been flouting social distancing rules and not wearing face masks, police expected another rally of up to 5,000 people.
In Munich, organisers asked authorities to give the green light for a rally of up to 10,000 people on the Thersienwiese, a large square in the city centre on which Munich normally stages its world famous Oktoberfest beer festival.
But city officials pointed to the need to respect social distancing rules and allowed a demonstration of up to 1,000 people.
The hard core of protesters is being led by several new groups. 
One group is Resistance 2020, led by a lawyer from eastern Leipzig and a doctor from south-western Germany who question official corona statistics and view the main political parties as constructs of an elitist rule.
Another group called COMPACT describes itself as the ""sharp sword against imperial propaganda"". It declares on its website that it is helping the ""information offensive"" for the growing protest movement.
""Why aren't you telling us the truth, Mrs Merkel? How we are losing our freedom, jobs and health?"" says COMPACT.
German media have suggested Russia could be behind a misinformation campaign that is spurring on protesters.
After winning global respect for keeping the death rate low in Germany, Merkel last week bowed to pressure from some of Germany's powerful regional premiers and agreed to a gradual re-opening of schools, shops and restaurants and even soccer.
However, Merkel, a scientist, has repeatedly warned about a second wave of infections, and a brief uptick in the reproduction rate to above the critical threshold of 1 earlier this week caused fresh concern.
The new coronavirus has so far infected more than 173,000 people in Germany and killed nearly 7,900.

Most Germans approve Merkel's crisis management, with polls showing support for her conservative CDU/CSU alliance surging to 40%. A survey released on Thursday showed that 56% of the population back the current lockdown measures.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greeks flocked to the seaside on Saturday when more than 500 beaches reopened, as the country sought to walk the fine line between protecting people from COVID-19 while reviving the tourism sector that many depend on for their livelihoods. 
For many in Greece, it was a first foray into a big public venue since the country began easing its lockdown earlier this month, and it also coincided with the first heatwave of the year.
Sun-seekers were required to respect distancing rules, which even stipulated how far umbrellas must be kept apart. 
No more than 40 people were allowed per 1,000 square metres (10,750 sq ft), while umbrella poles had to be four metres (13 ft) apart, with canopies no closer than one metre, according to a government-issued manual, complete with diagram. 
At Alimos, a popular beach just south of Athens, people queued up from the early morning to nab their spot in the sunshine. 
""This is the best thing for us elderly ... to come and relax a bit after being locked in,"" Yannis Tentomas, who is in his 70s, said as he settled down under an umbrella. 
He said he was complying with distancing rules, adding: ""It's like a gun to the head.""
The manager of the beach, Nikos Venieris, said visitors were following the rules so far and he hoped they would continue to do so during the summer.
""We're travelling an unknown road, and we don't know where it's going to end up,"" he added.
At a neighbouring beach a drone buzzed over sun-loungers, with loudspeakers urging people to keep safe distances from each other.
The lifting of the lockdown comes as countries around Europe and the world look to ease restrictions imposed to curb the pandemic, in an attempt to resurrect their economies.
'TURNING POINT'
Greece has reported a fraction of the COVID-19 cases of neighbouring countries - more than 2,800 infections with 160 deaths. From May 4, it began a phased-in easing of the lockdown that had been in place since mid-March.
The country of 11 million people is one of the most dependent in Europe on tourism, which generates about a fifth of its economic output. 
Following the reopening of Greek beaches, people will be permitted to attend Church Mass from May 17, while archaeological sites, including the Acropolis, will reopen for visitors on May 18. From Monday, travel across mainland Greece and to Crete will be allowed, and from May 25 to the islands.
""This is a crucial turning point in our efforts and we must succeed,"" said Nikos Hardalias, Greece's civil protection minister.
Tourism officials say they hope to welcome back foreign holidaymakers in July.
""The message is that Greece is a very safe and hospitable country. We invite them and are waiting for them to come, as long as they follow the rules,"" Alimos Mayor Andreas Kondylis said. 
Greece's lockdown, plus the shutdown of much of the world, and most air travel, is likely to have a profound effect on a country only just starting to recover from a decade of financial turmoil and austerity.

Authorities expect anything between a 5% and 10% decline in economic output this year, before recovering in 2021.

""The court has sentenced her to six years,"" said Saeid Dehghan. 
""The branch 15 of Tehran's Revolutionary Court has sentenced her to five years jail for gathering and conspiring against Iran's national security. She was also sentenced to one year jail term for propaganda against the Islamic Republic."" 
Dehghan said he would appeal against the sentence.
Iran dropped spying charges against Adelkhah but she remained in jail on other security-related charges, Dehghan said in March.
Iran has rejected France's call to release Adelkhah, a 60-year-old anthropologist who has been detained since June 2019, saying the demand is an interference in Tehran's internal affairs. Tehran does not recognise dual nationality.
In March, Iran released Adelkhah's partner, French academic Roland Marchal, who was detained along with her. Marchal was released after France freed Iranian engineer Jalal Ruhollahnejad, detained over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions against Tehran.
A French court in May 2019 approved the extradition of Ruhollahnejad to the United States to face charges of attempting to illegally import U.S. technology for military purposes on behalf of an Iranian company which U.S. officials said was linked to Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards. 
The powerful Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - A caravan of cars packed with protesters will trek from Atlanta to the small coastal community of Brunswick (NYSE:BC) on Saturday to rally for a young black jogger killed by two white men who chased him down and shot him because they thought he was a burglar.
Video of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, ignited outrage among activists who saw his death as the latest U.S. case of white perpetrators killing a black man and going unpunished. The father-and-son suspects were not arrested until weeks after the shooting, and just days after the video surfaced online. 
""If it wasn't for the video, this would have been swept under the rug,"" said Atlanta civil rights attorney Mawuli Davis, 51, one of the organizers of Saturday's demonstration. ""If they (the suspects) were black instead of white, they would have been arrested on day one. This is not how justice should work.""
He said a newly formed organization, JustGeorgia -- a coalition of about 20 churches and activist groups including the state chapter of the NAACP, are demanding that law enforcement officials involved in the case resign.
Last week, Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr asked the U.S. Justice Department to open a probe into how the case was handled by two local prosecutors - the district attorneys for the Brunswick and Waycross judicial circuits - as well as the Glynn County Police Department.
According to Carr, both prosecutors recused themselves from the investigation, one of them, the Waycross district attorney, after providing police with a written opinion that no arrests should be made in connection with the Feb. 23 shooting.
The suspects, former police officer Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, were ultimately arrested and charged on May 7 with aggravated assault and murder, after the Georgia Bureau of Investigation began to probe the case.
Both defendants remain in jail without bond and have yet to enter a plea. No court date has so far been set.
The elder McMichael's attorneys, Franklin and Laura Hogue, said in a statement that there had been a rush to judgment in the case before the ""full story"" was known. His son's lawyer, Bob Rubin, said in a news release that ""Travis has been vilified before his voice could even be heard.""
The U.S. Department of Justice is investigating why charges were not brought sooner and whether to charge the suspects with federal hate crimes.
Atlanta civil rights and criminal defense attorney Tiffany Williams (NYSE:WMB) Roberts, 38, said she was so angered by what happened in Brunswick that she decided to help launch JustGeorgia as an umbrella group to coordinate action.
""We want to make sure that the world knows we are not satisfied with just these two arrests,"" Williams said, adding that the case reflects a justice system in the United States that is biased in favor of whites.
Under the slogan ""We are Not Satisfied,"" hundreds of protesters are expected to gather outside an Atlanta church on Saturday morning before beginning the four-hour drive south to rally in front of the Glynn County Courthouse at 2 p.m.

""We hope to pick up more followers along the way,"" said Davis. ""From every city and town we go through, we want people to join us. Our message is clear: we are unified.""

""I would like to thank you for enduring this and for being patient and responsible. Stay careful,"" Peter Pollak, who is himself a Roma, told inhabitants at the settlement in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) video posted on Friday.
Residents of the Zehra settlement in the country's east were quarantined for 37 days. The quarantine was lifted on Friday, Pollak said.
The crisis committee decided to lift the quarantine after testing all inhabitants and moving 16 infected people and their families to a temporary quarantine centre, which was already housing 26 infected people and their relatives.
Quarantines in one settlement ended on April 25 and in another three on May 1.
Roma communities across eastern Europe are impoverished, plagued by high unemployment and historically the target of discrimination, making the coronavirus outbreak another challenge for the ethnic minority.

As of Thursday, Slovakia had reported 1,480 confirmed coronavirus cases and 27 deaths. The country has fewer cases than its neighbours and has recorded one of the lowest death tolls per capita in Europe after the government moved quickly to impose tough restrictions in the early days of the outbreak in Europe.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - A truck crammed with migrant labourers trying to reach their distant homes amid a nationwide lockdown crashed in northern India on Saturday, killing at least 23 and injuring 35.
The accident occurred before daybreak, when the truck collided with another truck that was parked by a roadside eatery in the Auraiya district of Uttar Pradesh state, Abhishek Singh Meena, the top district official said.
""The rescue operation is almost complete and 23 people have been killed in the accident,"" Singh told Reuters, adding that 20 people had suffered serious injuries, while the rest had minor wounds.
The migrants mainly hailed from the states of Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal.
India locked down its 1.3 billion citizens almost seven weeks ago in an attempt to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, sparking a crisis for the hundreds of millions of Indians that rely on daily wages to survive. 
With no work - and little public transport - many urban migrants attempting to return to their home villages have set out on gruelling journeys on foot, or hitching rides in the back of trucks.
On May 13, six migrants walking to their homes in Bihar were crushed to death by a speeding truck in Muzaffarnagar, also in Uttar Pradesh. Three others sustained serious injuries. The driver was arrested. 
On Friday, UP's Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath ordered bureaucrats and police officers across the state to arrange buses and taxi cabs to ferry migrants back to their hometowns. No one should walk, cycle or travel by trucks, he said.
Coronavirus infections in India crossed 85,000 on Saturday, surpassing China, though officials credited the lockdown for slowing the contagion. [L4N2CX0ZJ]

Indian state and federal governments have provided additional funds to feed and house migrants, as well as some special buses and trains.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Hundreds of people expected to be evicted from their hillside homes in a slum of Colombia's capital Bogota on Friday, despite having nowhere to go during the country's coronavirus lockdown. 
The informal houses have been declared illegal by local authorities and will be knocked down as part of the evictions. Residents accuse police accompanying the eviction process of excessive force.
The evictions in the Altos de la Estancia neighborhood are taking place despite Colombia's months-long lockdown meant to stem the spread of coronavirus, which has killed more than 500 people.
The neighborhood was home to about 1,000 families when evictions began two weeks ago. Now just some 100 families remain, residents told Reuters.
""The majority of the people that live here are unemployed because of COVID-19 and the pandemic,"" said John Parra, 36, who moved to Bogota after being displaced by the country's internal conflict.
Though his home has been destroyed, Parra said he has nowhere else to go. Some previously evicted residents are now sleeping on the streets or outside.
Many low-income Colombians who work informally have suffered during the lockdown. About a third of the country's population lives in poverty, according to government figures.
The government promised to help poor families during quarantine with welfare payments and deliveries of supplies, but many say they have received little or no aid.
The housing minister has banned evictions through June, but officials said the Altos de la Estancia houses are illegal and the area is at risk of landslides.
""This is a high risk zone and we could not allow the occupation to continue for one more day,"" Jaime Florez, the mayor of the Ciudad Bolivar district of Bogota, told journalists.
Florez said the residents were offered new accommodation in a shelter, but people who spoke to Reuters said they fear catching COVID-19 there. 
The ESMAD riot police were gathered near the remaining houses on Friday. The force has been on hand during evictions and residents say it has used violence against them.
Venezuelan migrant Faridee Pinto said his 16-year-old son was badly injured at the start of the month by an ESMAD projectile.
""He lost part of his skull and 20% or 30% of his forehead,"" Pinto said, as his son Ysmail removed his hat to show the stitches marring his hairline. He is awaiting surgery. 
Bogota's police did not respond to a request for comment.
""I was in pain; my forehead was covered in blood,"" said the boy, clutching a toy rabbit. ""I thought I was never going to wake up again.""

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's government on Saturday approved a decree which will allow travel to and from abroad from June 3, in a major development as it moves to unwind one of the world's most rigid coronavirus lockdowns.
The government will allow free travel across the country from that same day. Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback, but Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections.
More than 31,600 Italians have died of COVID-19 since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, the third-highest death toll in the world after that of the United States and Britain. 
In a bid to contain the contagion, Italy was the first European country to impose nationwide restrictions in March, only sanctioning an initial relaxation of the rules on May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen.
Shops are due to open on May 18 and the government decided that all movement within individual regions should be allowed that same day, meaning people will be able to visit friends. 
The inter-regional and foreign travel ban will remain in place until after Italy's June 2 Republic Day holiday, preventing any mass travel over that long-holiday weekend.
But all travel curb will be lifted from June 3 -- a major milestone on Italy's road to recovery, with the government hoping to salvage the forthcoming vacation season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks.
The regions can reactivate all sectors of the economy that might still be shuttered, so long as safety protocols are followed. National health authorities will monitor the situation to make sure infections are kept in check, the decree said.
Shops and restaurants across the country are preparing to reopen under strict social distancing and hygiene rules, as recommended by health authorities.

""The challenge is huge, so big it is hard to quantify, and most of all there is uncertainty. The sense of uncertainty is dominating everything,"" said Alberto Volpe, manager of a clothing shop in central Rome.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A deadly police raid in Rio de Janeiro on suspected drug traffickers on Friday morning drew crowds into the streets of a neighborhood under quarantine, provoking criticism from residents and activists.
According to a Reuters witness and media reports, heavily armed police entered Rio's ""favela"" shantytown known as Complexo do Alemao and killed at least 10 people. Police said they came under grenade and gunfire attack, a common occurrence in areas controlled by drug gangs.
When a Reuters photographer arrived shortly afterward, residents had carried five bodies to the entrance of the favela. Dozens of people, most of whom had no masks or any other protective equipment, were gathered in a tight intersection under a drizzle. Acquaintances and family members of the dead embraced and consoled one another.
""Social distancing? For who?"" asked Fábio Felix, a left-wing lawmaker, on Twitter. ""It's incredible that the lives of the poor aren't worth anything, even during a pandemic!""
Police said in a statement the incident would be reviewed by homicide detectives, following standard practice. The police said they came under heavy grenade and gunfire attack several times while in Complexo do Alemao, and recovered dozens of high-powered weapons. One police officer was injured.
Several residents complained that the government was offering little aid to contain the novel coronavirus, but was still engaging in violent police operations that risked spreading the virus through low-income communities.
The city of Rio had registered 1,509 deaths from the coronavirus and 11,264 confirmed cases by Thursday evening, according to municipal authorities, who say those figures are likely undercounting the outbreak due to a lack of testing.
Police violence has been rising rapidly in Brazil, where authorities including President Jair Bolsonaro have encouraged police to kill more. In violent Rio, police killed 1,810 people in 2019, the highest number since record keeping began in 1998.

QUITO (Reuters) - As the coronavirus outbreak in Ecuador's largest city of Guayaquil begins to stabilize, the government is bracing for worsening spread in the highland capital Quito, where at least six people have died in the streets in the past month.
Guayaquil was at the center of one of Latin America's worst outbreaks of the novel coronavirus in March and April. Cemeteries ran out of space and families stored relatives' dead bodies in their homes or on the streets as the virus strained the health system's capacity to collect them.
But authorities' attention is now turning to Quito, whose 2.8 million residents are under a strict lockdown to contain the virus' spread. The local government said in a statement on Friday that between April 4 and May 13 it had picked up the bodies of six people who had died in the streets, in addition to seven bodies from homes and two from nursing homes. 
The government said on Thursday night that 135 of the 164 intensive care beds in the city's public hospitals are occupied, and that it plans to install some 80 more. 
""Quito's health system is reaching its limit,"" the city's mayor, Jorge Yunda, said on Friday during the opening of a temporary 380-bed hospital for coronavirus patients. 
Pichincha province, where Quito is located, has registered some 2,400 coronavirus cases and 181 deaths. That is still fewer than southern Guayas province, where Guayaquil is located, where 55% of the country's 31,467 total cases have been registered. 
But the deaths in the streets have caused alarm. On May 3 a 60-year-old merchant who had been diagnosed with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, collapsed and died after walking just a few meters on the street, Yunda told local media last week. 
Despite the strict lockdown in Quito, informal salesmen seeking income to subsist have continued to cluster in many parts of the city. The government has extended the lockdown through May 31, and is implementing a web-based system to help residents locate the nearest place to seek medical attention.
Authorities also said they will be working together with funeral homes to avoid delays in cremating bodies. 

""We have taken all the necessary measures, and we have a plan to deal with deaths at homes and at hospitals,"" Sebastian Barona, the coordinator of an industry group representing Ecuador's funeral homes, told Reuters.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Less populated areas of New York, Virginia and Maryland took their first steps towards lifting lockdowns on Friday, part of a patchwork approach to the coronavirus pandemic that has been shaped by political divisions across the United States.
Construction and manufacturing facilities in five out of 10 New York state regions were given the green light to restart operations, although New York City, the country's most populous metropolis, remained under strict limits. 
Joe Dundon, whose construction business in Binghamton, New York, was able to start up again after shutting down in March, said he had a long backlog of kitchen and bathroom remodeling projects and several estimates lined up for Friday.
""We are more than excited to get back to work,"" he said. 
New York state, home to both bustling Manhattan and hilly woods and farmland that stretch to the Canadian border, has been the global epicenter of the pandemic but rural areas have not been nearly as badly affected as New York City.
Statewide, the outbreak is ebbing. Coronavirus hospitalizations in New York declined to 6,394, a third of the level at the peak one month ago, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday. The number of new coronavirus deaths was 132 on Thursday, the state's lowest daily total since March 25, he told a news briefing.
Cuomo said New York would join the nearby states of New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware in partially reopening beaches for the Memorial Day holiday weekend on May 23-25. 
Pockets of Virginia and Maryland were allowing an array of businesses to reopen, in contrast to the region's biggest cities - Washington, D.C., and Baltimore - which extended their stay-at-home orders for fear of a spike in coronavirus cases and deaths.
The patchwork approach has largely formed along demographic and political lines. Republican governors have pushed to reopen more quickly to jumpstart the crippled economy, especially in Southern states such as Georgia and Texas which were among the first to allow stores and businesses to reopen.
Democratic governors have been more cautious, especially about big cities, citing concerns for public health from a virus that has killed more than 85,000 Americans.
New York and Virginia are run by Democratic governors while Maryland's governor, Larry Hogan, is a moderate Republican in a state that is strongly Democratic.

Political divisions were on display in Wisconsin this week after its Supreme Court invalidated the governor's stay-at-home order, causing confusion as local leaders responded in various ways across the Midwestern state.
Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett decided to keep his city's stay-at-home order in place, although he told Reuters he may relax some guidelines later this month. He said he was concerned there would be outbreaks in surrounding areas that would find their way into his city of nearly 600,000 people. 
""By definition a pandemic means that it is everywhere and the spread of the disease does not stop at city boundaries,"" Barrett said. 
The eagerness to ease restrictions reflects the devastating economic toll of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. More than 36 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims since mid-March, and government data on Friday showed that retail sales plunged 16.4% last month, the biggest decline since the government started tracking the series in 1992.
The U.S. House of Representatives cleared the way on Friday to push ahead with a $3 trillion Democratic bill that would double the amount of aid approved by Congress to ease the human and economic toll of the coronavirus pandemic.
But it lacked support from Republicans, who control the U.S. Senate.
Having staked his Nov. 3 re-election hopes on a strong economy, Republican President Donald Trump has urged states to reopen despite warnings of health experts, including some on his White House task force, that a premature lifting of lockdowns could spark more virus outbreaks. 
Trump said on Friday the U.S. government was working with other countries to develop a coronavirus vaccine at an accelerated pace but made clear his view that the country could move on from the epidemic without one.
""Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back,"" Trump told an event in the White House Rose Garden.
Trump has also voiced support for protesters, sometimes armed, who have urged states to swiftly reopen their economies.
In Pennsylvania, hundreds of demonstrators gathered on the steps of the state capitol building in Harrisburg where they waved American and Trump 2020 flags and homemade signs, calling for the governor to fully reopen the state. Motorists including a man dressed as Santa Claus in a red convertible honked their horns in approval as they drove by.
Pennsylvania ranks 12th among U.S. states in COVID-19 cases per capita, according to a Reuters tally.

Thirty of its 67 counties are under a stay-at-home order that allows only essential business and travel to take place until June 4. Businesses are allowed to be open in the other 37 counties but must follow safety orders.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Thousands of cyclists took over the centre of Ljubljana once again on Friday to protest against Slovenia's centre-right government of Prime Minister Janez Jansa, less than a day after the government called an end to the coronavirus epidemic, while loosening restrictions.
Protesters blew whistles and honked bicycle horns as they waved Slovenian flags in the capital city. Many wore face masks. They claimed the government is clamping down on civil rights by attacking the media and limiting the rights of environmental groups. Some called for the government to resign.
Among other changes, the government is pushing for legal amendments that will limit the rights environmental nonprofits in participating in the administrative review of infrastructure projects.
The government claims the change is necessary to speed up Slovenia's economic development, saying present legislation enables even small environmental organisations to significantly slow down important construction, like the building of factories or power plants.
""I am here because the government disgustingly abused the coronavirus crisis to reduce people's rights and freedoms,"" environmentalist Rok Rozman, who was among protesters, told Reuters.
Protests have taken place every week since last month when the national TV Slovenia reported government officials unlawfully favored some companies while purchasing face masks and ventilators. The government denies any wrongdoing.
Police said packed protests should not be held due to the coronavirus restrictions. 
Slovenia has so far reported 1,465 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths. It is the first European country to call an official end to its coronavirus epidemic. [nL8N2CW97N]
Although many restrictions that have been imposed in the middle of March have been lifted, people are still obliged to wear masks in indoor public spaces, disinfect their hands upon entering such spaces, stand at least 1.5 meters apart and are prohibited from gathering in groups of more than 50 people. [nL8N2CW97N]
All shops, bars and restaurants will be allowed to open starting Monday, while some students will also return to school next week. Most shops, apart from food and drug stores, and all schools have been closed since the middle of March.
Many of Friday's protesters also fear that the government will reduce media freedom as Jansa has over the past weeks called several journalists ""liars"" on his Twitter account. He is known for calling two female TV journalists ""prostitutes"" back in 2016 when he was the leader of the opposition. The government's communication office has recently linked Slovenian media to the previous communist regime, causing public uproar. 
In a Monday statement, Jansa said he supports more media competition, which is a ""precondition to democratic social order,"" suggesting most media is biased against his government. He also said that the protests violate legislation on infectious diseases, which obliges people to keep a distance from one another.
The police, which fenced off the government and the parliament buildings in the centre of the capital, was unable to immediately give an estimate of the number of protesters. Smaller protests were held in other cities. No violence has been reported so far.

Groups must stay 1.5 metres apart, deck-chairs may only be booked for the morning or afternoon, and beach sports of two people or more will not be allowed, according to the new rules.
But the police will not be keeping watch, Costa said, urging people to adhere to the measures by themselves. ""Beaches should be places of leisure,"" Costa said. ""We have to be checking ourselves.""
The Portuguese Agency for the Environment has developed an app that will use real-time mobile phone data and numbers submitted by beach businesses to establish how many people are on beaches at any given time.
The government is working with phone operators to collect data not just on the number of people on the beaches but also how spread out they are, Costa said.
The country is due to launch the second phase of a sector-by-sector plan to reopen the economy on Monday, with restaurants, museums and coffee shops reopening at reduced capacity and schools resuming for some year groups.
Portugal allowed smaller shops to open and lifted travel restrictions on May 4, but the spread of the virus does not appear to have accelerated, according to data from the ministry of health.
The virus reproduction rate - dubbed 'R' - was 0.94 two weeks ago and remains below 1 at 0.97, with the number of people in hospitals and intensive care unit beds varying by just a few percentage points.
Portugal has reported 28,583 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 1,190 deaths, a very low toll in contrast with neighbouring Spain's 27,000 fatalities.
The lockdown has reversing the economy's growth trajectory to a 3.9% contraction in the first quarter compared with the same period last year, data from the National Institute of Statistics (INE) showed on Friday.
""Unemployment has increased very significantly. That's why it's important we follow these measures ... so people have the confidence to go back out,"" Costa said.
The slide in GDP was largely due to a big drop in tourism, with the number of people staying in holiday accommodation falling by 60% in March and 18% in the first quarter as a whole compared with the figures for last year, INE's data showed.
""It's going to be tough... The costs are all still there but revenue will only return very gradually,"" Jose Theotonio, CEO of the country's biggest hotel group Pestana, which is due to re-open some of its 71 closed hotels in June, said on Friday.

The release of former Tbilisi mayor Gigi Ugulava and ex-defence minister Irakli Okruashvili was a part of a political agreement between the ruling Georgian Dream party and opposition parties reached on March 8.
The ruling party, which initially agreed to the pair's release, later refused to recognise the move was part of the deal, which also included electoral reform ahead of the vote.
The international community, including U.S. lawmakers and European politicians, have been urging Georgian authorities to fulfil promises and to release opposition politicians.
""Searching for a way out of difficult situation, easing tensions, maintaining stability, as well as maintaining the country's international prestige is my duty,"" Zurabishvili said in a televised statement.
""That is why I've made this decision and I will not allow the situation in the country to worsen, I will not allow a new polarisation and a new confrontation to take place, I will not allow that an internationally recognised agreement has not been implemented.""
Opposition leader Ugulava was sentenced to 38 months in jail on Feb. 10 on charges of misusing public funds while mayor of Tbilisi, his second conviction on similar charges.
Okruashvili, also an opposition leader, was sentenced to five years in jail on April 13 on charges of engaging in mass violence during the anti-Russian protest outside parliament in June 2019.

The opposition said that both cases were politically motivated. Several criminal cases have been opened against opposition leaders and activists amid mass protests against the government and Bidzina Ivanishvili's ruling Georgian Dream party that began last summer, and several arrests have been made.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Uruguay extradited a Mexican citizen to the United States where he is charged with international conspiracy to distribute cocaine and amphetamines, U.S. officials said on Friday.
The U.S. Justice Department said Gerardo Gonzalez Valencia, nicknamed ""Lalo,"" 43, landed at Dulles International Airport near Washington D.C. late on Thursday from Uruguay, where he was arrested in April 2016.  
A U.S. indictment charges Gonzalez Valencia with participating in an international conspiracy to distribute cocaine and methamphetamine, knowing that these drugs would be unlawfully imported into the United States. The indictment says Gonzalez Valencia’s smuggling conspiracy ran from 2003 to 2016.
He was scheduled to make an initial appearance in federal court in Washington later on Friday.
Gonzalez Valencia's lawyer, Hector Dotta, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Uttam Dhillon, acting chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Gonzalez' arrest dealt a blow to the leadership of an affiliate of the Jalisco drugs cartel, a criminal enterprise which has surged in reach and importance in the wake of U.S. moves to shut down other Mexican smuggling networks.
""Mr. Gonzalez Valencia is alleged to have distributed significant quantities of cocaine and meth and will now face justice in the United States,"" Dhillon said.
Gonzalez Valencia is part of a group called Los Cuinis, closely tied to the Jalisco New Generation Cartel. Los Cuinis are best known as the group's financial arm, responsible for laundering the cartel’s wealth and handling business in Europe and Asia. 
At the time of his arrest in 2016, Uruguayan media reported that Gonzalez Valencia was accused of buying properties in the South American country to hide drug income. 
Gonzalez Valencia's brother Abigail, the leader of the group, was arrested in 2015. In 2017, Brazilian authorities captured another brother.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday the state would join New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware in reopening beaches for the Memorial Day weekend, aiming to prevent people from crossing state borders for a respite from the coronavirus lockdown.
The move is part of a broader loosening of restrictions in New York, which gave the green light on Friday to five of 10 regions outside urban areas to start reopening their economies, starting with construction and manufacturing work.
Cuomo was following his counterpart in New Jersey, Phil Murphy, who on Thursday announced he would open his state's beaches for the traditional May 23-25 start of summer, news that was welcomed by many beach goers eyeing the Jersey shore. 
""If we don't open our beaches people will go to New Jersey beaches, I promise you that,"" Cuomo said, adding with exaggeration that he wanted to prevent ""4 million New Yorkers"" from heading to New Jersey or Connecticut to get some sun.
Even while relaxing restrictions, Cuomo stressed that New York would continue to pursue a science-based approach that was ""all about the numbers and the facts,"" warning that moving too quickly could spark a new wave of cases.
Cuomo said 132 additional New Yorkers died on Thursday from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, down from 157 a day earlier. He said hospitalizations and intubations remained on a downward trend.
Restrictions on an array of construction and manufacturing work were lifted on Friday in five regions in central and upstate New York, while a broader pause on activity in New York City and elsewhere was extended until at least May 28.
Cuomo said he was increasingly concerned about a rare inflammatory syndrome reported in 103 children across the state who have also tested positive for COVID-19 or its antibodies. To date, at least three of the cases have ended in death.
He said the syndrome reflected the ever-changing understanding of the virus. He noted the case of a young person he said had died from a stroke that appeared to have been triggered by COVID-19.
""Apparently the virus can affect the heart and the liver and other organs besides the lungs and we didn’t know that,"" Cuomo said. ""The facts here have been changing and the facts have only been getting more negative."" 
Cuomo urged adherence to social distancing guidelines, arguing that voluntary actions were key to suppressing a virus that has killed more than 27,000 New Yorkers, accounting for more than a quarter of the 85,427 total U.S. fatalities.
""When they write the history books they are going to write about how New York turned that curve,"" Cuomo said, adding that there was no way for him to enforce guidelines like wearing masks across a state of 19 million people.

""That's not government action. That's social action. Those are people who choose to do the responsible thing.""

An inconclusive election in February led to a political deadlock and the coronavirus crisis has forced Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's caretaker government to implement extensive fiscal and political policies.
But parliament cannot pass any laws until a new prime minister is picked, including those needed to uphold key parts of a 6.5 billion euro rescue package for businesses hit by the coronavirus lockdown. 
Traditional rivals Fianna Fail and Fine Gael struck an initial agreement in April to govern together for the first time and the Green Party joined talks this month in a bid to reach a majority in the fractured parliament.
""I think we should aim to have a programme for government formulated by the end of this month and obviously then it has to go to the respective party memberships for their approval,"" Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin told national broadcaster RTE.
Martin, who is expected to take over as prime minister in a role he would rotate with Varadkar, added that he thought there should be more flexibility in the acting government's plans to reopen the economy if the coronavirus is kept under control.
Varadkar announced earlier that the country would begin the partial and gradual reopening of the economy as planned from Monday. Martin said ""other sectors"" should be brought in to advise on future reopening phases.

413,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Brutal Afghan attacks highlight limitations of U.S.-Taliban deal,"By Jonathan Landay, Idrees Ali and Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two brutal attacks this week laid bare major weaknesses of the U.S.-Taliban troop withdrawal pact: nothing in it obliges the Taliban to prevent such massacres and the Afghan government's ability to thwart them will only wane as U.S. troops pull out.
The pact is ultimately supposed to promote peace between the Afghan government and the Taliban, which denied carrying out a Kabul attack in which three gunmen disguised as police killed 24 people, including two babies, at a Kabul maternity ward https://www.reuters.com/article/us-afghanistan-attacks-hospital-insight/maternity-ward-massacre-shakes-afghanistan-and-its-peace-process-idUSKBN22P2F5 and a suicide bombing in eastern Afghanistan that killed 32.
The key provisions of the Feb. 29 agreement - to which the Afghan government was not a party - involved a U.S. commitment to reduce its military footprint in Afghanistan to 8,600 by mid-July and, conditions permitting, to zero by May 2021.
In return, the Taliban promised, among other things, not to allow ""its members, other individuals or groups, including al Qaeda, to use the soil of Afghanistan to threaten the security of the United States and its allies.""
Technically, Afghanistan is not formally an ally of the United States because they do not have a mutual defense treaty. And the agreement says nothing about attacks on Afghan civilians such as the two that occurred on Tuesday.
""There's nothing in our peace agreement with the Taliban that would preclude them from killing Afghans,"" Democratic U.S. Representative Tom Malinowski, a former top State Department official for human rights, told Reuters.
""And of course the moment we're out, there's no practical deterrence either,"" he added.
U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, architect of the deal https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-afghanistan-peaceplan/attacks-deal-trumps-long-shot-afghan-peace-push-a-fresh-blow-idUSKBN22P3BH advocated by Republican President Donald Trump, acknowledged it did not bar attacks on Afghans and said it would be best if both sides began talks and efforts to combat such attacks while U.S. forces are still there.
""The agreement does not specifically (call) for them not to attack Afghan forces,"" Khalilzad told reporters on Friday. However, he said the Taliban committed to reducing violence and that a ceasefire would be among the first topics in intra-Afghan negotiations.
""We are saying that they are violating the spirit, if not the letter,"" he said.
'FULL OF HOLES'
    The Taliban has been careful not to attack U.S. and coalition forces, but have mounted more than 4,500 attacks in Afghanistan, a sharp increase in violence https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-afghanistan-taliba/taliban-step-up-attacks-on-afghan-forces-since-signing-u-s-deal-data-idUSKBN22D5S7, in the first 45 days after signing the agreement, according to data reviewed by Reuters.
More than 500 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first quarter of 2020 as violence raged even after the pact was struck, according to the United Nations.
A Western diplomat based in Kabul suggested the Taliban got the better of the United States in their deal.
""The agreement between the U.S. and the Taliban is full of holes, while it clearly lays down the U.S./NATO withdrawal plan, it expects very little from the Taliban side,"" the diplomat said. ""It’s a nebulous deal where one side makes its intentions clear but the other side makes no serious commitment.""
The United States on Thursday blamed an Afghan affiliate of the Islamic State https://www.reuters.com/article/afghanistan-attacks-usa/u-s-says-islamic-state-conducted-attack-on-kabul-hospital-idUSW1N2BU02R militant group - not the Taliban - for the gruesome hospital attack in Kabul and it renewed calls for Afghans to embrace a troubled peace push with the Taliban.
Afghan officials, however, rejected this assessment and blamed the Taliban. They also suggested that the Taliban, which earned U.S. enmity for harboring al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden, provides an environment that enables such groups.
The three main impediments to the start of intra-Afghan negotiations - which were to begin on March 10 - have been the rise in violence, the pace of prisoner releases and the failure of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his main rival, former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, to resolve a power struggle.
Further undercutting the prospects for talks, the Kabul government said it had decided to resume offensive operations against the Taliban following Tuesday's attacks.
Khalilzad said he had heard positive reports about the formation of an inclusive Afghan government and he urged the government and the Taliban to begin talks.
""There are forces such as the ISIS that doesn't see peace in Afghanistan in its interest and are trying to increase violence to undermine the prospects for peace,"" he told reporters. ""We are urging both sides not to fall into that trap but indeed to cooperate against terrorists including ISIS.

""We want this to happen as soon as possible when now, we're still there in a significant way,"" he added.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian Health Minister Nelson Teich resigned on Friday after just weeks on the job, adding to turmoil in President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of an accelerating coronavirus outbreak in one of the world's worst hotspots.
Teich, whom Bolsonaro had criticized as being too timid in the push to reopen the economy and advocate the use of anti-malarial drugs, submitted his resignation and will hold a news conference later on Friday, the ministry said.
Military members of the Brazilian cabinet are pushing for deputy health minister Eduardo Pazuello, an army general on active duty, to become the new health minister, making permanent his interim role, a government source told Reuters.
Last week, Teich said he was not consulted before Bolsonaro issued a decree allowing gyms, beauty parlors and hairdressers to open for business. Bolsonaro has also pushed for wider use of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the novel coronavirus, which Teich resisted due to a lack of scientific evidence. 
Teich is the second health minister to resign amid the pandemic in Brazil. He replaced Nelson Mandetta, who was fired April 16 for resisting Bolsonaro's pressure to promote hydroxychloroquine and fight state government social distancing orders.
This week Brazil passed Germany and France in coronavirus cases, with more than 200,000 confirmed diagnoses by Thursday, when the Health Ministry reported 844 new deaths, bringing the death toll to 13,933.
Opposition and allied politicians criticized Bolsonaro's intransigence. Lawmaker Marcelo Ramos of the centrist Liberal Party said the president would only accept a minister without regard for science-based public health policy. 
Congressional opposition leader Alessandro Molon warned that Brazil was heading toward a public health catastrophe and said the president should be impeached. 
""Bolsonaro does not want a technical minister, he wants someone who agrees with his ideological insanity, like ending social distancing and using chloroquine,"" Molon, a lawmaker from the Brazilian Socialist Party, said in a statement.

Bolsonaro's handling of the coronavirus has been widely criticized globally as he has minimized the severity of the disease and told Brazilians to ignore quarantine restrictions.

""We've got over 100 vaccine candidates that have been discovered,"" Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told Fox Business Network. 
""What we're doing now is we're narrowing those down to the core group that we're going to place huge multi-hundred million dollar bets on and scale massive vaccine domestic production so that we by the end of the year, we hope, would have one or more safe and effective vaccines and hundreds of millions of doses.""
The White House has set a target of having 300 million vaccine doses by the end of 2020. No such vaccine for this pathogen has been approved though a number are under development, and producing and distributing an effective vaccine are seen as key steps to jumpstarting the U.S. economy.
""We've got to use the full power of the U.S. government and the private sector here to compress all of those (drug trial) timelines, reduce inefficiency in development and use the power of the U.S. government to produce at risk, scale hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines even while we're running the clinical trials to prove their safe and effective,"" Azar said.

417,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Factbox: Trump-Biden healthcare showdown in the spotlight amid pandemic,"By Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - Healthcare was already a top concern among U.S. voters even before the coronavirus pandemic killed tens of thousands of Americans and eliminated millions of jobs.
The crisis is likely to shine an even brighter spotlight on the vast differences on healthcare policy between Republican President Donald Trump and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden ahead of November's election. 
Here is a look at how the two rivals clash on key issues:
OBAMACARE
After years of failed attempts by Republican lawmakers to repeal the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, Trump has turned to other tools to undermine the sweeping healthcare law: executive power and the courts.
The Justice Department is backing a lawsuit brought by several Republican-led states seeking to overturn the entire ACA, a case the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hear sometime this fall. The Trump administration has not proposed a comprehensive replacement, despite Trump's vow to deliver a better, less-costly healthcare system.
The Republican-backed 2017 tax bill eliminated the ACA's individual mandate, which required most people to maintain insurance or face a penalty. The result was increased premiums, according to experts.
In addition, Trump has used executive power to boost short-term plans, which are exempt from the ACA's requirement to cover basic benefits and guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions.
Under former President Barack Obama, those plans could only be used temporarily for three months. Trump has increased that period to three years, a move opposed by many patient advocates, hospital groups and health insurers.
The Trump administration also cut funding for staff and advertising intended to help people navigate the ACA marketplaces, where individuals can purchase private insurance, often with the help of government subsidies.
Biden has vowed to bolster the law, which passed during his first term as Obama's vice president. His own healthcare plan would cost $750 billion over 10 years and would be financed by increasing taxes on the wealthy, according to his campaign. 
Unlike his former rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator Bernie Sanders, Biden does not support a single-payer system like Medicare for All.
Instead, Biden's plan calls for a Medicare-like public option that would serve as an alternative, not a replacement, for private insurance. The public option would be available for small businesses and individuals who do not have, cannot afford or do not like their employer-based coverage.
In addition, several million people who are uninsured because they live in one of the 14 states that have refused to expand Medicaid - which provides coverage for low-income Americans - under the ACA would automatically be enrolled in the public option. He also has proposed expanding the subsidies available on the ACA marketplaces and capping cost increases.
DRUG PRICES
Trump's rhetoric has been more hawkish on prescription drug prices than that of most Republicans, but his results have been uneven.
The administration had proposed basing the price of some Medicare drugs on the cost in foreign countries, where medicines tend to be cheaper, but the effort has stalled. Another proposal, to require drug companies to disclose list prices in television advertising, was blocked by a federal court.
Biden supports a bill approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives last year that would allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices, as private insurers do.
Republicans, backed by the pharmaceutical industry, have argued it would force drug makers to spend less on research and development, and the Trump administration has said it would veto the bill.
Both Biden and Trump support some form of importing prescription drugs from foreign countries to lower costs, though some experts have questioned whether doing so is feasible.
MEDICARE/MEDICAID EXPANSION
In April, Biden proposed lowering the Medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60, a move to appeal to liberal voters. Such a change would potentially extend Medicare to some 20 million more Americans.
Trump has proposed several budgets that include cuts to Medicare and Medicaid spending. The Medicare reductions would not affect benefits but would instead change how providers are paid, according to Tricia Neuman, a Medicare expert at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The administration has supported imposing work requirements and other limitations on Medicaid eligibility, as well as installing caps on Medicaid spending growth and converting Medicaid to block grants - all moves that experts say would result in fewer people covered.
The impending insolvency of the Medicare trust fund, which was projected for 2026 even before the economy cratered, casts a shadow over all of these proposals.

""Whichever president comes in will face some really difficult decisions, as will Congress,"" Neuman said.

The four-time Venezuelan youth karate champion was upset when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the cancellation of international tournaments in El Salvador, Bolivia and Mexico that he had been preparing for.  
But his family quickly turned the home into a full-time karate gym, or ""dojo"", rearranging furniture to leave a tatami mat in the center of their living space where he works out and also leads classes via Zoom for children and other youth athletes. 
On other days, with Venezuela under lockdown since mid-March, he trains on the roof of his building, with imposing views of the valley of Caracas.
""We have to have faith that all of this will come to an end,"" said Perez after leading an online class. ""We have to take the time to give classes to kids so that they'll feel different ... so that the quarantine will be a little easier.""
The hardest part is not being able to spend time with his trainers and other athletes he has grown close to, said Perez, a member of Venezuela's national karate team who has won gold medals in South American and Pan-American tournaments.
Leading online classes usually starts with several minutes of struggling with Venezuela's patchy internet, and often requires working around Zoom's 40-minute cut-off for online meetings. 
In a session on Thursday night, he counted out exercises in Japanese, his white uniform snapping crisply with each punch.
""How do you feel, good?"" he asked during a water break. ""Hydration is super important.""
His mother Solange, 46, father Ricardo, 48, and sister Alejandra, 10, take advantage of the setup to do their own workouts to YouTube exercise videos. 
""It's what he's passionate about, it's what he loves, so for him it's easy to do this,"" said Solange.

""As parents we have to support him.""

Sadiq Khan said the plan, which covers major cross-town routes, would transform parts of central London into one of the largest car-free zones in any capital city.
""COVID-19 poses the biggest challenge to London's public transport network in TfL's (Transport for London) history,"" he said. 
""It will take a monumental effort from all Londoners to maintain safe social distancing on public transport as lockdown restrictions are gradually eased.""
Passenger numbers on London's Underground network have fallen by 95% since Britain went into lockdown in March, while the number of bus journeys has fallen by 85%.
Earlier on Friday, the transport operator said it had secured 1.6 billion pounds ($2 billion) in government funding to cover a shortfall in revenue until October.
TfL has said the requirement to maintain a two-metre distance from other people will mean buses and the tube will only be able to carry 13-15% of the normal number of passengers even when full services had been restored.
Khan said many more Londoners would therefore have to walk and cycle to keep the city moving. 
Streets between London Bridge and Shoreditch, Euston and Waterloo and Old Street and Holborn may be limited to buses, pedestrians and cyclists, his office said.
Waterloo Bridge and London Bridge could also be restricted to people walking, cycling and buses only, with pavements widened to enable people to safely travel between busy railway stations and their workplaces.
London's congestion charge, payable by vehicles driving in a central zone, and ultra low emission zone will be reintroduced on Monday, the office said.
Under the proposals, the congestion charge could increase to 15 pounds ($18.24) a day from 11.50 pounds next month and the hours of operation extended as part of a package of temporary changes, it said.

But in Badiucao's version of the photograph, which came to be one of the most recognisable images of the 20th century, the tank is carrying a huge particle of the new coronavirus. 
The work was unveiled on Friday in front of the Danish parliament in Copenhagen, three days before start of the trial in Hong Kong of 15 pro-democracy activists, including veteran politicians and a publishing tycoon, on charges of ""organising and taking part in unlawful assembly"".
Badiucao said his work, ""A New Tank"", is a protest against the Chinese government which he believes is utilising the diversion created by the global pandemic to crack down on Hong Kong pro-democracy movement.
""Because of the pandemic situation and as countries are busy controlling it, the Hong Kong government will do more to crack down on the protests and the leaders and activists of the movement, and they will see it as an opportunity to do it quietly,"" Badiucao told Reuters in a video conference from Australia, where he lives. 
The Chinese embassy in Denmark was not immediately reachable for a comment when contacted by phone and email by Reuters. China has previously denied meddling in Hong Kong and blames the West for stirring up trouble. 
The artwork will be displayed on boards and banners by an eight-metre high copper sculpture called ""Pillar of Shame"" made by Danish sculptor Jens Galschiot, that was unveiled in Copenhagen in January. The sculpture is one of four, one which stands in Hong Kong.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic will take major steps to relax its coronavirus lockdown measures from May 25, opening restaurants, hotels and pools and allowing gatherings of hundreds of people, health officials said on Friday.
Czechs will also be able to ditch face masks outdoors as the government seeks to jump-start an economy hard hit by the outbreak.
The central European country of 10.7 million has reported less than 100 new cases a day throughout May.
As of Friday morning, it had recorded a total of 8,352 cases of which 5,249 have recovered. It has reported 293 deaths, a small fraction of the toll seen in western Europe.
Health Minister Adam Vojtech said indoor dining and hotel stays could resume on May 25 under strict hygiene rules.
In restaurants, which were allowed to open outdoor dining areas on Monday, groups of customers should remain 2 metres (6 feet) apart and tables will be disinfected after each use. Hotels can provide buffet breakfasts served by staff, while plexiglas is recommended at reception desks.
Pools and saunas will reopen but not steam rooms.
Shop and border closures in March helped the country contain the outbreak. While incoming foreign travellers still face restrictions, with some exceptions like business travel from European Union states, the government has reopened shops in phases, with shopping malls returning this week. 
""After May 25, there won't be establishments in retail which would be generally closed,"" Vojtech said.
From that date, gatherings of up to 300 will be allowed, rising from the current limit of 100. The number will rise to 500 and then to 1,000 in June, when kids' summer camps are also set to start.
The Czech soccer league will be among the first in Europe to kick off again, starting on May 23 - a week after Germany - but without spectators at first.
Masks will still be required in closed spaces like public transport or cultural venues.

The study by EU agency Eurofound, which seeks to improve living and working conditions, found that over a third of people working in the 27-nation European Union had started teleworking as a result of the pandemic.
Of those, 26% live in households with children under 12 and a further 10% with children aged from 12 to 17. Of those living with younger children, 22% reported difficulties in concentrating on their jobs all or most of the time.
That compared with 5% of households with no children and 7% with older children.
Mary McCaughey, Eurofound head of unit for information and communication, said the health and economic implication of the pandemic were understandably dominating the thoughts of the public and policymakers.

""However, the toll this pandemic has taken on family life cannot be ignored. Parents are facing unprecedented challenges, particularly now that most cannot avail of childcare services, and many are required to supervise schooling at home,"" she said.

The family of Collins Khosa, who died in the poor township of Alexandra on April 10, launched the case to try to combat what they described as torture and brutality by security forces since South Africa began a lockdown to contain the coronavirus. 
In his ruling, Judge Hans Fabricius said the rights to life, freedom and security, and treatment with dignity and respect, were among those provided for in South African law that ""may not be derogated from even in a state of emergency"". 
All members of the South African National Defence Force (SANDF) and the Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department (JMPD) who were present or near Khosa's home should be placed on suspension, he ruled. It was not clear how many people the ruling applied to.
Spokespeople for the SANDF, South African Police Service and JMPD did not immediately comment on the ruling. 
The SANDF has said previously its members are expected to abide by the law as they enforce the lockdown and any action ""outside the law"" will not be condoned. The defence minister has expressed regret over the incident.
The judge called on the SANDF and police to develop and publish within days a code of conduct for a state of disaster and to circulate guidelines to the public on circumstances under which force can be used and how to lodge complaints. 
The ruling follows a spate of complaints about brutality by the security forces implementing the lockdown.
Wikus Steyl, representing Khosa's family, said soldiers entered Khosa's home after seeing in his yard a cup of what they said was alcohol, sales of which are banned during the lockdown.
Khosa, who had been inside eating dinner, was assaulted and beaten with a rifle and died from what a coroner concluded was blunt force trauma, Steyl said. 
The SANDF members are to be placed on suspension with full pay pending the outcome of disciplinary procedures, the judge ruled. The JMPD officers will be suspended while an investigation into accusations of misconduct is launched.

Steyl said the decision was ""bitter-sweet"" for Khosa's family, who will seek compensation from the government.

Austria flattened its curve of infections with an early lockdown and has been loosening curbs for a month. Shops have reopened in phases and on Friday, restaurants, bars, cafes, churches and some museums followed suit, under strict social-distancing rules and with face masks required in many places.
Theatres and cinemas, however, have remained closed and the conservative-led government has come under growing pressure from the cultural sector to allow events, to the point that the junior minister for culture resigned on Friday.
""We will in a first step allow cultural events of up to 100 people both indoors and outdoors,"" Health Minister Rudolf Anschober told a news conference. ""We will in a second step do the same for artistic and cultural events of up to 250 people from July 1. That is a big step, a very big step.""
Cinemas would also be allowed to open from July 1, with the same capacity limit, he added. There will be a general requirement that people in an audience stay 1 metre apart.
From Aug. 1, events of up to 500 people would be allowed, Anschober said, with the possibility of holding events of up to 1,000 people when a ""special security concept"" is prepared for the event in question.
The formerly imperial nation is a heavyweight in classical music and German-speaking theatre. It also hosts many cultural events, particularly in summer, like the Salzburg Festival of opera, theatre and classical music, where German Chancellor Angela Merkel is a frequent visitor.
Austria and Germany, which have similarly low coronavirus infection and death rates, said on Thursday they had agreed to reopen their shared border on June 15. Kurz said on Friday the same deal was reached with Switzerland and Austria.

Austria's tourism sector contributes about 8% of economic output in a normal year, and it relies heavily on German visitors. Hotels and other forms of tourist accommodation will be allowed to reopen on May 29, the government has said.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Hungary's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, said on Friday he expected to renounce a set of much-criticised emergency powers to fight the coronavirus this month.
Parliament granted Orban the right in March to rule by decree indefinitely to fight the pandemic. The law has triggered criticism from opposition parties, rights groups and Europe's main rights forum, the Council of Europe.
""We expect the government will be able to return the special powers to tackle the coronavirus pandemic to parliament at the end of May,"" an announcement on Orban's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page read.
After meeting his Serbian counterpart Aleksandar Vucic in Belgrade, Orban said this would ""give a chance to everyone to apologise to Hungary for the unjust accusations"".
""There was no basis for the criticisms,"" he added, ""and once they apologise, we also expect their admiration for the success of Hungary's defence (against the virus),"" he said. 
So far, Hungary has confimed 3,417 coronavirus infections and 442 deaths. 
Orban and his ruling Fidesz party have been repeatedly accused in the past by rights watchdogs and members of the opposition of abuses of power and of putting pressure on media to give more loyal coverage, accusations that they deny. 
Serbia this month ended its own state of emergency designed to curb the coronavirus, which had meant the closure of borders and airports, a curfew and restrictions on movement: at weekends and holidays for most, and all week long for the elderly.
Opposition groups and rights watchdogs in Serbia have also accused Vucic and the ruling coalition led by his Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party, which faces an election on June 21, of a heavy-handed approach to the pandemic. 
So far, Serbia, a candidate for EU membership, has confirmed 10,374 infections and 224 deaths among its 7 million people. 
Vucic, a nationalist firebrand during the Balkan wars of the 1990s who later adopted a pro-European agenda, dismissed international criticism of Orban's emergency powers. 
""And so I'll 'have to appear' before some liberal-left or anarcho-leftist circles ... and some newspapers to criticise our Hungarian friends,"" Vucic said. ""That won't happen."" 

Last week, in its annual report, the Freedom House rights watchdog accused Serbia and Hungary of leaving ""the group of democracies entirely"".

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Some children, many with face masks, returned to school on Friday as Belgium further eased a two-month coronavirus lockdown.
With a population of 11.5 million, Belgium is one of the worst virus-hit European nations. It started lifting some of the restrictions at the start of May.
Primary and secondary schools have been given the green light to restart smaller classes of final-year pupils under strict social distancing rules next week, although some did a trial run on Friday.
At the Nellie Melba primary school in Brussels, 7-year-old Lena smiled gingerly as a white-masked teacher tested her temperature before letting her into the premises, while another teacher pointed out direction arrows painted on the floor as part of social distancing measures.
""My daughter is very happy to go back to school because it was difficult for her not to see her friends and her teacher. Now she is too small to put on a mask. Fortunately, she has no health problems so I am reassured,"" Lena's mother and hospital counsellor Vanessa del Carpio said.
""For me, it is important that children can come to school if they are in good health. It is necessary for their development,"" she said.
School director Rita Janssens said the school, which has 200 students, has taken protective measures.
""For example, for teachers, we have provided them with face shields as well as masks. The secretariat is equipped with a screen, and of course, all the classes are equipped with hand hygiene products so that the children can wash their hands and the professors can protect themselves,"" she said.
""When the children come back, we will also take their temperature so that we can be sure that no sick child or teacher enters the school,"" Janssens said.
She said of the 55 pupils expected to come to school on Friday, only 34 showed up. The school expects a full house on Monday.

Belgium, whose capital Brussels hosts the headquarters of the European Union and the NATO military alliance, has to date reported 54,644 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 8,959 deaths.

WARSAW (Reuters) - The interim head of Poland's Supreme Court resigned on Friday, deepening judicial and political turmoil in a country struggling to choose its top judge and decide when presidential elections that were due in May will eventually be held.
Kamil Zaradkiewicz, an ex-justice ministry official, had been named acting Supreme Court chief to oversee the election of a successor to Malgorzata Gersdorf, a critic of the conservative nationalist government whose term ended in April.
Critics said Zaradkiewicz's appointment was meant to enable the choice of candidates to head the top court that would be acceptable to the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party.
In a televised statement, Zaradkiewicz accused judges who opposed him of trying to impose their own rules on the selection process and intimidating new judges appointed under PiS reforms. ""I no longer intend to tolerate such practices,"" he said. 
The PiS is at loggerheads with the European Union's executive body over judicial reforms which critics say have eroded the independence of the judiciary, flouting EU standards on democracy and the rule of law.
PiS leaders have said the overhaul of judicial ranks will improve the efficiency of the judiciary and remove the residue of Poland's Communist-era legal system.
During Zaradkiewicz's tenure both he and his opponents called for intervention by President Andrzej Duda, a close PiS ally, to either change selection rules or dismiss the interim court chief himself.
With the selection process stalled by procedural issues, Duda appointed Aleksander Stepkowski, a founder of ultra-conservative think tank Ordo Iuris, to replace Zaradkiewicz.
""Stepkowski is a former politician. I expect him to continue PiS's policy of taking over the Supreme Court,"" said Bartlomiej Przymusinski, a judge and spokesman for the Iustitia judges association. 
OPPOSITION'S ELECTION CANDIDATE DROPS OUT
Poland is expected to hold a presidential election at the end of June or start of July, after the original May 10 date was scrapped due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska, presidential candidate of the main liberal opposition Civic Platform (PO), dropped out of the election on Friday in the face of a plunge in support below 5% from above 20% in February.
Kidawa-Blonska had urged Poles not to vote at all if the election were held in May as scheduled, a plan opposition critics saw as reckless at a time of coronavirus contagion.
Duda leads the race with a 45% support followed by independent candidate Szymon Holownia at 19%, the agrarian PSL party's Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz 17% and far-right candidate Krzysztof Bosak 9%, according to a recent opinion poll.
Warsaw Mayor Rafal Trzaskowski and ex-foreign minister Radoslaw Sikorski are seen as most likely to replace Kidawa-Blonska and help Civic Platform recover anti-PiS votes.

432,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Hong Kong police watchdog report branded 'superficial',"By Jessie Pang and Sarah Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's police watchdog called on Friday for a review of guidelines on the use of tear gas and training for officers in public order policing, in a long-awaited report that some democracy lawmakers decried as ""superficial"". 
Relations between the police and public have plummeted during months of anti-government unrest, with allegations that officers used excessive force against demonstrators, and ordinary people often emerged on the sidelines of protests to hurl abuse at police.
In its 999-page report, the Independent Police Complaints Council (IPCC) studied officers' behaviour in the months after June 2019, when sometimes violent protests brought parts of the city to a standstill and plunged it into its biggest political crisis in decades.
The IPCC said that while it didn't tackle the individual accountability of officers, the police acted within guidelines although there was room for improvement.
And it said accusations of police brutality must not be used as ""a weapon of political protest"", adding it was a ""legal and not a political matter"", in an apparent response to the pro-democracy protesters calls for an independent inquiry.
In comments on one of the most controversial episodes, the IPCC said it did not find evidence of police collusion with gang members during a mob attack on July 21 in Yuen Long district.
The report, however, did identify deficiencies in police deployment and other actions during the incident, in which a mob of white-shirted men beat up black-shirted anti-government protesters and ordinary people with sticks and poles.
The Yuen Long attack fuelled more protests and intensified a backlash against police who some accused of deliberately responding slowly to the mob violence.
Opposition lawmaker Kenneth Leung, a former member of the IPCC said the report failed to satisfy the demands of the public for an independent commission of inquiry. 
""Many of these recommendations are really piecemeal, superficial and general,"" Leung said.
""They cannot just rely on the IPCC report alone to pretend that all these issues have been dealt with and settled.""
Many protesters are furious about what they saw as police brutality and the arrest of more than 8,000 people. Rights groups including Amnesty International have accused police of a disproportionate use of force and other abuses in handling the pro-democracy demonstrations. 
""The report has turned a blind eye to disproportional police brutality,"" pro-democracy lawmaker Fernando Cheung said.
""This report has eliminated what little credibility is left of the IPCC.""
""ERA OF TERRORISM"" 
The long-awaited report said the former British colony appeared to be getting dragged into an ""era of terrorism,"" echoing recent comments by senior Hong Kong and Beijing authorities.
Police have repeatedly said they were reactive and exercised restraint in the face of high levels of violence.
In some of the most intense clashes during the months of unrest, protesters, many clad in black and wearing masks, threw petrol bombs at police and central government offices, stormed the Legislative Council, trashed metro stations and blocked roads.
Police responded with tear gas, water cannons, rubber bullets and several live rounds fired in the air, in many cases warning the crowds beforehand with a series of different coloured signal banners.
On the force's handling of protests on July 1, when protesters stormed the Legislative Council, the IPCC said the police could have prevented the break-in by erecting stronger barriers.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus and strict rules to curb its spread brought a lull in anti-government protests this year but the movement is gearing up again as the city's efforts to curb the spread of the disease appear to be working.
The protests started as a campaign against a now-shelved extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to mainland China for trial but evolved into broader calls for greater democracy and an independent enquiry into police action, separate from the IPCC's.
Resisting those calls, embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam has insisted that the IPCC was capable of conducting an unbiased investigation. 
Members of the IPCC, which is tasked with reviewing the work of the Complaints Against Police Office, an internal police department, are appointed by Lam. 
The credibility of the review was dealt a blow in December when a panel of five foreign experts quit from advisory roles to the watchdog because of doubts about its ""independent investigative capability"".

Police handling of protests came under fresh scrutiny at the weekend when officers pepper-sprayed journalists and made some kneel in a cordoned-off area. In a rare move, the police chief said on Tuesday his officers should have acted more professionally in dealing with the media.

Italy was the first European country to impose rigid nationwide restrictions in March in an effort to halt the disease and is slowly rolling back the curbs as the number of new cases fall.
The draft decree, which is expected to be approved later on Friday but could still be modified ahead of time, said all movement within separate regions would be allowed from May 18, with inter-regional travel bans due to be lifted on June 3.
The end to travel curbs will represent a major milestone on Italy's road to recovery, with the government hoping to salvage the forthcoming holiday season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks.
The country's factories were allowed to start up on May 4 and shops are scheduled to reopen on Monday. 
The regions can reactivate all sectors of the economy that might still be shuttered, so long as safety protocols are followed. National health authorities will monitor the situation to make sure infections are kept in check, the decree said.
It added that mayors can intervene and close public places if social distancing proved impossible.
Almost 31,400 Italians have died of COVID-19 since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, the third-highest death toll in the world after that of the United States and Britain.

The number of confirmed cases amounts to 223,096, the fifth highest global tally behind those of the United States, Spain, Britain and Russia.

Rather than declaring a full lockdown, Sweden has adopted a mix of legislation and recommendations in response to the virus that foreign newspapers and broadcasters have widely labelled a relatively soft policy.
Stefan Lofven said he rejected that narrative, ""the image that Sweden is doing so totally different than other countries. That's not the case."" 
The Swedish model for managing society was built on trust between citizens - who had ""a responsibility to do the right thing"" - and lawmakers and other authorities, he told a briefing with foreign media.
""Life is not carrying on as normal in Sweden. It is not business as usual.""
The government has banned large gatherings, high schools and universities are closed and authorities recommend social distancing, protecting the elderly, working from home and staying at home if unwell.
Elementary schools however remain open, people have not been obliged to stay indoors and can meet in small groups, and stores have not been forced to close.
Sweden has registered more than 3,500 coronavirus-linked deaths - a toll far lower than many large EU countries but around five times higher than Denmark and more than ten times that of its other Nordic neighbours.
Some of Denmark's politicians have expressed hesitation about re-opening its border to Sweden, pointing to the higher COVID-19 death toll.
Sweden, whose population is around twice that of other Nordic countries, has no plans currently to ease its coronavirus regime, Lofven said. 
""This fight against COVID-19 is a marathon and the measures have therefore been chosen because we strongly believe they are viable for the long haul,"" he said. 
While there was ""no one-size-fits-all response"" to the pandemic, he said better cooperation was needed as countries started to ease lockdown curbs.
""Strong EU cooperation is key now to fighting the crisis, to handling the health issues and the economic consequences. The global response also needs to be stronger,"" he said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Chinese survey ship that had been involved in a month-long standoff with a Malaysian oil exploration vessel in the South China Sea (NYSE:SE) has left Malaysia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), shipping data showed on Friday. 
Since mid-April, the Haiyang Dizhi 8 had been surveying in the EEZ, close to where a drillship contracted by Malaysian state oil firm Petronas had been operating in waters claimed by Malaysia, Vietnam as well as China.
The West Capella, the ship contracted by Petronas, left the disputed waters on Tuesday after completing its planned work, its operator said. 
On Friday, the Haiyang Dizhi 8 moved out of Malaysia's EEZ heading north towards China and escorted by at least two Chinese vessels, according to data from ship tracking website Marine Traffic. 
Data from the past month showed the ship had moved within Malaysian waters in a hash-shaped pattern consistent with carrying out a survey, as it did during a tense standoff with Vietnamese vessels last year.
Malaysia's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. It had earlier called for disputes over the South China Sea to be resolved by peaceful means. 
China has denied reports of a standoff, saying that the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was conducting normal activities.
The incident had prompted the United States to call on China to stop its ""bullying behaviour"" in the disputed waters.
U.S. and Australian warships have conducted joint exercises in the South China Sea close to the West Capella in recent weeks, shortly after the Haiyang Dizhi 8 arrived. 
The Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) has said the China-Malaysia standoff had been going on for months.
China claims almost all of the energy-rich South China Sea, also a major trade route. The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.
The United States has also accused China of taking advantage of the distraction of the coronavirus pandemic to advance its presence in the South China Sea. 
A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman last month accused U.S. officials of smearing Beijing.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan officials on Friday blamed the Taliban for a bloody attack on a maternity hospital in the capital, Kabul, this week, rejecting a U.S. assertion that it was carried out by Islamic State militants.
Three gunmen disguised as police attacked the hospital on Tuesday, killing 24 people including two babies in a clinic run by the international humanitarian organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF).
No group has claimed responsibility. 
The Taliban, who struck a deal with the United States in February clearing the way for the withdrawal of U.S. troops and the end of America's longest war, denied responsibility.
U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, the architect of the pact with the Taliban, blamed Islamic State militants for the attack, saying they opposed any Taliban deal and sought to trigger an Iraq-style sectarian war in Afghanistan.
But Afghan officials in Kabul dismissed the Taliban denial.
""Neither the Taliban hands nor their stained consciousness can be washed of the blood of women, babies & other innocent in the latest senseless carnage,"" Afghan Vice President Amrullah Saleh said on Twitter.
Saleh, a former intelligence chief, did not mention Khalilzad's assertion but said earlier some people were naive for accepting Taliban lies and blaming the ""fictional"" Islamic State faction in Afghanistan for the attack.
The Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State Khorasan, after an old name for the region, first appeared in eastern Afghanistan in 2014, and has since made inroads into other areas.
The Islamic State militants, who battle government forces and the Taliban, and have claimed some of the deadliest attacks in urban centres in recent years, and will not be part of the deal between the United States and the Taliban.
The group did claim another attack on Tuesday, a suicide bomb attack on the funeral of a policeman in the eastern province of Nangarhar in which 32 people were killed.
'EVIDENCE'
A senior Afghan government official said the patterns of recent attacks showed the involvement of the Taliban and the affiliated Haqqani Network, whose head, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is the deputy chief of the Taliban, in the Kabul attack.
The official, who declined to be identified questioned Khalilzad's assessment as ""premature"" adding that all the evidence suggested it was not Islamic State who carried out the raid on the hospital.
The Taliban, who condemned the hospital attack, said the Afghan government had attempted to pin the blame on them ""without any expert investigation"". 
A spokesman for the group called for a ""transparent and impartial investigation"" to find the perpetrators.
President Ashraf Ghani ordered the military to switch to ""offensive mode"" against the Taliban in response to Tuesday's violence, presenting another setback to U.S. President Donald Trump's plans to bring the troops home.
The comments by Khalilzad, who has already been criticised in Afghanistan for what some see as his rush to push the deal with the Taliban, angered parliamentarians, some of whom went as far as calling for him to be banned from entering the country. 
""We will start collecting signatures and ask for a proper session in the parliament regarding the peace process and Khalilzad,"" independent parliamentarian, Belqis Roshan, told Reuters.

KABUL/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Delkhah Sultani scrubs laundry outside her home in Kabul as her young daughter watches on. She says she once got paid around $3 a day to wash clothes for other households but since the coronavirus outbreak hit, work has dropped and she now earns $1 every few days to support her and her four children.
Like millions of Afghans, Sultani is facing economic distress and hunger from two disasters - the pandemic and the damage from decades of civil war.
""Since the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan (in late April), I have not been able to find jobs for myself because people don't invite me to their homes to wash their clothes anymore due to the fear of the coronavirus,"" said Sultani. She said her husband was killed six years ago in a suicide bomb attack. 
""I don't have money to take my son to the barbershop or buy food. Most of the time, we don't even have anything to eat to break our fast.""
At least 6,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus in Afghanistan and 153 have died, straining the country's weak health infrastucture. Officials warn that the actual number of infections is likely to be much higher because few people have been tested.
""We are facing increasing needs across the country and this pandemic is expected to severely impact the livelihoods of communities across the country for years to come,"" said Parvathy Ramaswami, deputy country director at the World Food Programme Afghanistan. 
The coronavirus pandemic that has derailed even the world's top economies is hitting Afghanistan as the government faces the prospect of a fiscal crunch and reinvigorated Taliban insurgents. Despite an ongoing peace process being brokered by the United States, attacks are taking place daily.
""There is a conflict...and with everything happening at once an already weak state is going to have less time and energy to do even basic policing,"" said Andrew Watkins, senior Afghanistan analyst at the International Crisis Group. 
The stepped-up violence and a harrowing attack on a Kabul maternity ward, suspected to have been conducted by Islamic State this week, prompted the government to switch the military to an 'offensive' stance.
HEADED FOR DISASTER
The United States is drawing down troops in Afghanistan under its deal with the Taliban and foreign donors consumed with their own pandemic bail-out packages are expected to have less to spend on aid. 
Aid pledges made in 2016 run out this year and one diplomat said Afghanistan was headed for disaster if replenishments fell short.
""That's exactly where Afghanistan is heading. Add their internal conflict on formation of government, derailed peace process, Taliban insurgency, ISIS attacks and the COVID-19 pandemic. Now imagine where Afghanistan stands in 2021,"" said the senior diplomat in Kabul.
Grants make up roughly 75% of the Afghan government's expenditure and any government revenue that comes from taxes is at serious threat as the pandemic hits the economy.
Government revenues have already fallen by almost a quarter in the first four months of the fiscal year compared to the same period last year, according to economic think tank the Biruni Institute. 
Omar Joya, head of research at the institute, said the think tank was projecting an additional 8 million people could fall into poverty this year, pushing the poverty rate from 55% to 80%. 
The government has been ramping up distribution of food aid, and in Kabul more than 250,000 families have started receiving free food, including Sultani. She says making it last is a stretch.

""Most of the time, we don't have even a loaf of bread at home for my kids to eat,"" she said. ""May Allah remove the virus, so the needy people can live a normal life.""

440,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","Special Report: Caught in Trump-China feud, WHO leader under siege","By Kate Kelland and and Stephanie Nebehay
(Reuters) - When the head of the World Health Organization returned from a whirlwind trip to Beijing in late January, he wanted to praise China’s leadership publicly for its initial response to the new coronavirus. Several advisers suggested he tone the message down, according to a person familiar with the discussions.
After meetings with President Xi Jinping and Chinese ministers, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was impressed by their knowledge of the new flu-like virus and their efforts to contain the disease, which by then had killed scores in China and started to spread to other countries.
The advisers encouraged Tedros to use less effusive language out of concern about how he would be perceived externally, the person familiar with the discussions said, but the director general was adamant, in part because he wanted to ensure China’s cooperation in fighting the outbreak.
“We knew how it was going to look, and he can sometimes be a bit naive about that,” the person said. “But he’s also stubborn.”
The WHO chief’s subsequent lavish public praise of China’s leadership for its efforts to combat the disease came even as evidence mounted that Chinese officials had silenced whistleblowers and suppressed information about the outbreak. His remarks prompted criticism from some member states for being over the top. U.S. President Donald Trump has led the charge, accusing the WHO of being “China-centric” and suspending American funding of the health agency.
The internal debate over the WHO’s messaging around China provides a window into the challenges facing the 72-year-old United Nations organization and its leader as they engage in battles on two key fronts: managing a deadly pandemic and coping with hostility from the United States, its largest donor.
Interviews with WHO insiders and diplomats reveal that the U.S. offensive has shaken Tedros at an already difficult time for the agency as it seeks to coordinate a global response to the pandemic. COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has killed more than 300,000 people and continues to spread. The virus is thought to have emerged in a market in Wuhan, China, that sells live animals.
Tedros is “obviously frustrated” by Trump’s move and feels the WHO is being used as a “political football,” the person familiar with the discussions said.
""We're in the middle of the fight of our lives - all of us around the world,” said Michael Ryan, the agency’s top emergencies expert, about the challenges facing the WHO. In an interview with Reuters, Ryan said the WHO is focused on helping health systems to cope, developing vaccines and drugs, and getting economies back on track.
“That's a big enough task to worry about for any organization,” said Ryan. “I've got to now deal with the potential that we'll have a significant disruption in funding in front-line essential health services in many fragile countries in the coming months.”
“It's bending the system,” added Ryan, an Irish doctor and epidemiologist, “but it's not breaking it.​”
The WHO said Tedros was not available for an interview. He has strongly rejected criticism that he was too quick to praise Beijing, saying China’s drastic measures slowed the virus’ spread and allowed other countries to prepare their testing kits, emergency wards and health systems. He has also said he hoped the Trump administration would reconsider its freeze, but that his main focus is on tackling the pandemic and saving lives.
Tedros knew there was a risk of upsetting China’s political rivals with his visit and his public show of support, according to the person familiar with the discussions -- an account backed by a WHO official. But the agency chief saw a greater risk - in global health terms - of losing Beijing’s cooperation as the new coronavirus spread beyond its borders, the two sources said.
“That’s the calculation you make,” said the person familiar with the discussions.
During the two-day Beijing visit, Tedros secured agreement from China’s leadership to allow WHO experts and a team of international scientists to travel to China to investigate the origins of the outbreak and find out more about the virus and the disease it was causing. That delegation included two Americans.
Ryan, who accompanied the WHO chief on the trip, said he and Tedros both thought it was important to support China once they became aware of its containment plans and found them solid. The WHO’s aim was to ensure the response was implemented “as aggressively, as fast and as successfully as possible.” He added: “You want to ensure that that commitment to doing that is absolute and you want to ensure that you keep the lines of communication open if there are problems with that implementation.”
The WHO, in a follow-up statement, said it expressed appreciation to China “because they cooperated on issues we had sought support on,” including isolating the virus and sharing its genetic sequence, which enabled other countries to develop tests. At a meeting of the WHO’s executive board in early February, the agency said, “most countries overwhelmingly praised China for its response to this unprecedented outbreak.""
The Trump administration, which has come under fire at home for its own handling of the outbreak, isn’t easing off its recent attacks on the WHO and China.
A senior U.S. administration official told Reuters the WHO “repeatedly failed to acknowledge the growing threat of COVID-19 and China’s role in the spread of the virus.” Noting that the United States has been a larger contributor to the WHO than China, the official said the WHO’s actions were “dangerous and irresponsible” and had contributed to the public health crisis “rather than aggressively addressing it.”
The U.S. official alleged that “poor coordination, lack of transparency, and dysfunctional leadership have plagued its response” to the threat of COVID-19, among other health crises. “It’s time for the United States to stop giving millions of dollars to an organization that does more to impede global health than to advance it.”
China - whose combined contributions to the WHO’s current two-year budget were due to be about a third of what the United States was expected to pay - has stood by the WHO chief.
“Since the outbreak of COVID-19, WHO, under the leadership of director general Tedros, has been actively fulfilling its responsibilities and upholding an objective, scientific and impartial position,” China’s foreign ministry said in a statement to Reuters. “We pay tribute to the professionalism and spirit of the WHO and will continue to firmly support the WHO's central role in global cooperation against the pandemic.”
China also rejected American criticism of its response to COVID-19. Beijing has been “open, transparent and responsible” in sharing information about the virus, the foreign ministry said. It added Beijing had maintained close communication and cooperation with the WHO, and it “appreciates” the positive comments the agency has made about China’s response to the outbreak.
China’s State Council, or cabinet, didn’t respond to a request for comment.
“GRINDING OF TEETH”
The WHO has come under fire before. Its 2009 declaration of the H1N1 flu outbreak as a pandemic later drew criticism from some governments that it triggered countries to take expensive measures against a disease that ultimately turned out to be milder than originally thought. The agency and its then-director general Margaret Chan also faced sharp criticism for not reacting fast enough to the deadly Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in December 2013.
Chan has defended her decision to declare the H1N1 flu outbreak a pandemic but admitted that the WHO was “overwhelmed” by the Ebola outbreak, which she has said ""shook this organization to its core.”
As COVID-19 has spread, 55-year-old Tedros has become the public face of the global fight against it, holding near-daily news conferences, calling heads of state when the virus reaches their doorstep to offer support, and tweeting frequently to his 1.1 million followers. He teamed up with pop music superstar Lady Gaga to organize a benefit concert for health workers that was broadcast online last month.
The son of a soldier, Tedros was born in Asmara, which became the capital of Eritrea after independence from Ethiopia in 1991. Tedros lost his younger brother to a childhood disease that the WHO said was suspected to be measles. A microbiologist by training, Tedros served as Ethiopia’s minister of health and then foreign minister.
In 2017, Tedros became the first African to lead the WHO, winning the top job despite potentially damaging questions surfacing late in the race about whether he had any role in restricting human rights or covering up cholera outbreaks in Ethiopia. He denied the accusations, as did Ethiopia.
As head of the global health agency, which has offices in 150 countries and 7,000 staff, he has drawn praise from world health experts and senior colleagues for implementing fundamental changes at the WHO, including re-establishing the emergency-response department that Ryan now heads.
When a disease breaks out, Tedros is often quick to visit the epicenter in person. He made at least 10 trips to the Democratic Republic of Congo during a nearly two-year Ebola epidemic that erupted in August 2018. That outbreak had been close to being halted before resurging last month.
A Western diplomat recalled having witnessed Tedros cry after a Cameroonian doctor working for the WHO was shot dead at an Ebola hospital in Congo in April 2019. “I've seen that passionate style. He takes things personally,” the diplomat said.
China informed the WHO on Dec. 31, 2019, of a concerning cluster of pneumonia cases. On Jan. 14, the WHO said in a tweet that preliminary investigations by Chinese authorities had found “no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission.” That statement would later be cited by Trump as a sign the agency wasn’t being skeptical enough toward China. The same day, a WHO expert said it was possible there was limited transmission occurring. On Jan. 22, a WHO mission to China said there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan but more investigation was needed to understand the full extent.
In late January, Tedros and three colleagues flew to Beijing. “I think we got the official invitation at 7:30 in the morning and we were on the airplane at 8:00 p.m.,” said Ryan.
During the Jan. 28 meeting with China’s president, the WHO chief discussed the sharing of data and biological material, among other collaboration. Tedros tweeted a photo of himself and Xi shaking hands, saying they’d had “frank talks” and that Xi had “taken charge of a monumental national response.”
At a press conference the following day in Geneva, Tedros praised Xi’s leadership, saying he was “very encouraged and impressed by the president's detailed knowledge of the outbreak.” The WHO chief added that China was “completely committed to transparency, both internally and externally.”
By contrast, during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, in 2003, the WHO chief at the time, Gro Harlem Brundtland, was openly critical of China when it was slow to report and share information about the emerging epidemic.
“Tedros has a different approach” than Brundtland, another WHO official said. “It took a lot of phone calls and patience.”
Brundtland, in a written response to Reuters, said she spoke out publicly because China hadn’t provided access to the WHO. “This time was different,” she said, without elaborating.
Publicly criticizing governments can make them reluctant to share information about disease outbreaks or otherwise cooperate, WHO veterans say. Michel Yao, head of emergency operations for WHO's Africa region, said he had seen some nations shut down access to the WHO when they felt under pressure. This happened on several occasions when the WHO announced cholera outbreaks in Africa, Yao told Reuters, without naming the countries. ""You lose access to data, and you lose access to capacity to at least assess the risk of the particular disease.""
But Tedros’ warm words for Beijing grated on some. “When he refers to China with praise, there is always a grinding of teeth,"" one European envoy who attends Tedros’ weekly briefings for diplomats of member states told Reuters.
DEATH THREATS
The World Health Organization has limited leverage over member states. It has no legal right to enter countries without their permission, nor does it have any power of enforcement. So, the main tools at Tedros’ disposal are politicking and cajoling its 194 member states into abiding by the International Health Regulations framework they agreed to in 2005.
Tedros has praised a number of governments battling the new coronavirus, including Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan. On March 30, he publicly complimented Trump’s daughter and presidential adviser, Ivanka Trump, for an article she wrote about the U.S emergency relief bill, tweeting, “very good piece.”
Among WHO insiders, the perception in March was that relations with the United States were “good,” said the first WHO official. Ryan said in the interview that communications between the WHO and Washington in early 2020 were part of the “normal bump and grind of multilateral organizations.” He added: “I certainly for my part did not perceive that there was a major, major issue brewing.”
During a March 23 call, Tedros and Trump had a “good and cordial” discussion regarding the COVID-19 response and “nothing was raised on the funding issue,” the WHO said in its statement.
Trump initially voiced repeated praise of China and its president for their response to the crisis. By mid-March, he was ramping up his criticism of Beijing’s handling of the virus, saying Beijing should have acted faster to warn the world. His own administration’s response to the pandemic was coming under wide criticism at the time, including its troubled effort to roll out tests for the disease. Trump, who staunchly defends his performance, faces a re-election campaign as the coronavirus has claimed tens of thousands of American lives and ravaged the U.S. economy.
At the same time, the United States and other countries had been pressing WHO's leadership for several months to make stronger statements about the need for transparency and the timely sharing of accurate information by member states, “and those concerns were not acted upon by the WHO,” a Western diplomatic source said.
Andrew Bremberg, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva and a former White House official, had met regularly with Tedros to discuss the WHO’s response and voice concerns, two European envoys said.
The WHO, in its statement, said Tedros asks all countries to share information under the international regulations that member states have agreed to.
On April 7, Trump threatened to withhold WHO funding, criticizing the agency for being too close to China and too slow to alert the world to the epidemic, an accusation the agency strongly rejects. The threat had teeth, as Washington is the WHO’s largest funder. For the current two-year period, ending in December 2021, it was due to contribute $553 million in combined membership fees and voluntary contributions, or 9% of the agency’s approved budget of $5.8 billion, according to the WHO. That’s nearly three times China’s $187.5 million share, WHO figures show.
Tedros appeared rattled the following day during a regular news conference, at one point disclosing he had been the target of “racist” comments and even death threats, and gave long, impassioned responses to questions from reporters.
In a 12-minute reply to a question about Trump’s criticisms of the WHO and his funding-cut threat, Tedros called for unity, adding, “we will have many body bags in front of us if we don't behave.” In response to accusations that the WHO was too close to China, he replied, “we’re close to every nation.”
The WHO, in its statement, said Tedros was calm and measured during the news conference and that he said the U.S. decision was regrettable. During his three years in office, Trump has criticized other multinational organizations and withdrawn funding from other U.N. agencies.
Trump announced the funding freeze a week later. Countries typically contribute to the WHO through membership dues and voluntary contributions. A second senior U.S. administration official said Washington already has paid almost half of the $122 million of the membership dues it owed for 2020. The official added that Trump’s freeze means Washington will likely redirect the remaining $65 million in dues payments and more than $300 million in planned giving to other international organizations.
Two Western diplomats said the U.S. funding suspension is more harmful politically to the WHO than to the agency’s current programmes, which are funded for now. But they also voiced concern that the freeze could have long-term impact, especially on central programmes such as those targeting polio, AIDS and immunization that are supported by Washington’s contributions.
“It has been a big blow to WHO and to Tedros,” said the second WHO official.
Tedros, asked about relations with the United States, told reporters on May 1: “We are actually in constant contact and we work together.” A WHO spokeswoman said dialogue and technical collaboration continue between the agency and Washington. The U.S. mission to the U.N. in Geneva declined comment.
“SHOT IN THE ARM”
Trump isn’t the only one prodding the WHO. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has called for an independent review of the outbreak and the WHO’s response. The European Union has proposed a resolution calling for a timely evaluation of the pandemic response, including by the WHO, an idea that’s due to be considered at the WHO’s annual assembly of ministers next week.
The WHO said Tedros has promised to conduct a post-pandemic review of the agency’s performance, including by the WHO’s independent oversight body, which is standard practice after a health crisis.
But so far, most major donors have closed ranks around the WHO. France, Germany and Britain have voiced support for the agency, saying now is the time to focus on fighting the outbreak rather than apportion blame. A German government official described the U.S. approach of focusing on past events rather than joining the fight against the outbreak as “absurd.” French President Emmanuel Macron is supportive of the WHO because he believes it is essential to an effective response to the crisis, one of his advisers said.
China’s foreign ministry, in its statement, said that Beijing is supportive of the WHO director general setting up a review committee to evaluate the global response to COVID-19 “at an appropriate time after the pandemic is over.” It added it objects to the eagerness of some countries to start reviewing the WHO and trace the origins of the virus, which it said were attempts to “politicize the epidemic” and interfere with the WHO’s work.
WHO insiders saw a victory of sorts in a webcast launch of an agency initiative on April 24 that turned into a public show of support for the organization and its leader. During the event, which was on the topic of accelerating the development of tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19, world leaders appearing via video link offered thanks and praise to Tedros and the WHO.
France’s president, addressing Tedros as “my friend,” urged major countries to come together to support the initiative, including China and the United States. “The fight against COVID-19 is a common human good and there should be no division in order to win this battle,” said Macron.

“It felt like a shot in the arm,” the second WHO official said. “It felt like there are people out there who are battling with us.”

The current 14-day mandatory quarantine for everyone traveling into the state, which began in March, will certainly be extended until the end of next month, Ige said in an online question-and-answer session late on Thursday.
Tourism is a big part of Hawaii's economy - more than 10.4 million visitors came to the islands last year, supporting some 216,000 jobs in a population of around 1.4 million, according to the state tourism authority.
The state at one point considered sweeping use of GPS-enabled ankle bracelets or smartphone tracking apps to enforce stay-at-home orders given to arriving air passengers.
However, that plan was put on the back burner after the Hawaii attorney general's office raised concerns.
In a talk streamed live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Ige said that he was looking at ways to allow more businesses to reopen, such as restaurants with dine-in service, hair salons and barber shops, adding the state was looking at guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
Hawaii has had over 630 cases of infection and 17 deaths from the new coronavirus, as of late Thursday. The state's average of one death per 100,000 people is among the lowest in the United States, Reuters calculations show.

The United States has recorded over 1.4 million cases of coronavirus infections as of late Thursday, with over 85,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally.

KABUL (Reuters) - An Afghan man cut off his wife's nose with a kitchen knife after she asked for a divorce, officials said on Friday, amid a surge in domestic violence triggered by the coronavirus lockdown.
The 24-year-old victim, mother of a seven-year-old boy, was trying leave an abusive husband who had prevented her from moving out of their house in the southwestern province of Paktika, said Khoshboo Maidanwal, head of the provincial women's affairs department. 
""Her husband hit her and chopped off her nose with a sharp kitchen knife,"" she said. ""She wanted a divorce because he abused her and beat her frequently."" 
The attack happened this month and police arrested the husband this week. His wife was sent to her father's home after treatment.
Maidanwal said her office has registered 13 violent cases of domestic abuse in the past two months.
""The lockdown due to the coronavirus has made domestic situation even worse for women,"" she said, adding that one reason behind the increase could be that more women are reporting abuse.
Afghanistan ranks near the bottom of global indices on gender equality, with forced marriages, honour killings and domestic violence prevalent nationwide.
Rights groups estimate that more than half Afghan women face domestic abuse at some point in their lives.
A Feb. 29 deal between the United States and the Taliban called for a phased U.S. troop withdrawal and for the government and Taliban to release some prisoners by March 10, when peace talks were to start.
Intra-Afghan peace talks have yet to take place. Many women fear losing freedoms hard-earned since U.S.-backed Afghan forces overthrew the austere Islamist militants in 2001.
During their 1996-2001 rule, the Taliban banned women from education and work and only let them leave their homes in the company of a male relative. Overnight, women disappeared behind the all-enveloping burqa, their activities restricted to their homes.

The job advert posted by e2i, an employment initiative under the National Trades Union Congress, said applicants had to be medically fit with no history of chronic disease, and proficient in English. Medical experience was not required.
""Currently hiring swabbers,"" said the job advert, explaining successful applicants would be trained to conduct nasopharyngeal swabs - a method of gaining samples from the back of the nose and throat by inserting swabs into the nostril.
Island nation Singapore has nearly 27,000 cases, the highest per capita infection rate in Asia, largely due to mass outbreaks in cramped bunk-bed accommodation housing foreign labourers. 
The government, which has ordered a nationwide lockdown due to run until June 1, said it aims to test all 323,000 foreign workers living in dormitories in the coming weeks as it looks to get people back to work. 
To do so, it aims to ramp up its daily testing capacity to 40,000 from around 8,000 currently.
The job advert received some backlash over the offered salary, which at S$3,800 a month is higher than that of entry-level nurses whose salaries start at S$3,300 a month. 
Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) user Willie Kan said the authorities should consider raising the minimum pay for other healthcare workers such as nurses and paramedics to S$3,800 per month during the pandemic. ""It's only right and proper,"" Kan wrote on the Facebook page of Singapore's parliament speaker who had shared the job ad. 
Singapore's health ministry in a statement sought to explain the pay discrepancy by saying that unlike other full-time healthcare workers, the swabbers - hired under an initial six-month contract - are not offered career progression or additional allowances or bonuses. 
Others said that the salaries for the six-day-a-week job were warranted given the dangers of working in quarantine zones such as migrant dorms, facilities for recovering COVID-19 patients and nursing homes. 

The salary was removed from the job postings on e2i's website on Friday afternoon.

Rights groups believe at least two boats carrying Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority from Myanmar, are off the coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, but officials said they had no clear information.
Spokesmen for the Western Fleet of the Indonesian navy as well as Aceh's disaster mitigation agency and search and rescue team told Reuters they were trying to confirm the location of the vessels.
Refugees from two other boats have landed in Bangladesh since mid-April, many starving and emaciated after weeks at sea. Survivors from one said dozens died on board.
Saad Hammadi, from the South Asia Regional Office of Amnesty International, said the refugees could have been sailing for several weeks or even months without food or water, citing information from humanitarian agencies and local news reports.
In a virtual news conference he urged Indonesia and Australia, who chair an anti-people smuggling and trafficking forum known as the Bali Process, to ensure the refugees are allowed to land safely ""so that we don’t see the sea become an invisible graveyard.""
The Australian foreign ministry said it could not immediately comment and a spokesman for the Indonesian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Rohingya have made perilous voyages to Malaysia, Thailand, and Indonesia for years, fleeing persecution in Myanmar and poverty in refugee camps in Bangladesh.
More than one million live in squalid conditions in sprawling camps in the south of Bangladesh, with as many as a dozen people sharing one shelter and scarce access to soap and water in some areas.
The vast majority fled a military crackdown in Myanmar in 2017 that the U.N has said was executed with genocidal intent. The Myanmar authorities deny genocide, saying it was a legitimate response to attacks by Rohingya militants.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Two sisters dressed up as clowns are visiting shelters packed with Indian migrants, trying to bring a moment of levity to poor families stranded in cities where they can no longer afford rent or food.
Millions of workers have fled large towns and cities after losing their jobs due to India's nationwide lockdown, which is aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Many others have stayed put, unable to return to their native villages as trains and buses have largely ground to a halt.
""If staying at home we can be so unhappy or so sad and stressed, then their level of stress (must) be very high,"" said Sheetal Agarwal, a medical clown and counselor who has been visiting shelters in the capital New Delhi.
""I don't think I am very scared catching the infection, I am more scared of: 'What if I am not able to make them laugh?'.""
On a recent afternoon, that fear was unfounded. 
Agarwal, a 34-year-old sociologist by training, and her sister Khushboo, an activist, weaved their way between mats set out in a makeshift shelter at a New Delhi sports complex housing some 650 people.
Wearing red clown noses, bright wigs and baggy trousers, they delighted children by squeezing their noses, playing with a hula hoop and dancing to a popular Bollywood song. 
Parents, many of them wearing masks, were also amused.
""For a brief time, my mind is feeling a little bit free, it is getting diverted and I am not thinking about my problems,"" said Susheela Kumari, who comes from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh.
She used to iron clothes, but work has stopped since the lockdown and she is stranded at the shelter with her family.

Under lockdown since late March, India has reported more than 81,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among its 1.3 billion population, with over 2,600 deaths.

As of Friday, Bali had reported 343 coronavirus cases and four deaths, a much lower fatality rate compared with 16,496 cases and 1,076 deaths in the whole archipelago.
If the infection curve continued to improve, the tourism ministry is looking to revitalise destinations and do promotional work for some parts of the country, including Bali, between June and October, Ni Wayan Giri Adnyani, secretary of the ministry, said in the statement.
Partial reopening of those areas, which also include the city of Yogyakarta and Riau islands province, may begin in October, she said.
Bali's economy depends largely on visitors. Its gross domestic product (GDP) contracted 1.14% on-year in January-March, compared with a 2.97% GDP expansion nationally.

Foreign tourist arrivals into Indonesia plunged more than 60% in March, compared to the year-earlier month, with Chinese arrivals sliding more than 97%.

LOWER MAKEFIELD, Penn. (Reuters) - With Pennsylvania's June 2 presidential primary fast approaching, local Republican leader Mark Hrutkay took to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to remind supporters they have the option to vote by mail as coronavirus sweeps the state.
Instead of thanks, Hrutkay said he got an earful from angry devotees of Republican President Donald Trump.
""I had one woman, using a lot of four-letter words, tell me 'didn't you know Trump hates mail-in balloting,’” said Hrutkay, the Republican chairman of Washington County, a Trump-friendly region just outside Pittsburgh.
Trump has made no secret of his disdain for mail-in voting, proclaiming frequently - without evidence - that such balloting is riddled with fraud. Hrutkay and other Republican leaders say they don't like it either and share Trump's skepticism about the integrity of the process.
But they said the president's messaging may be hurting the party's chances to win in Pennsylvania, a critical battleground state, where Democrats are dominating a surge in requests to vote by mail in the midst of the pandemic.
With less than three weeks to go before the primary, 1,178,475 Pennsylvania voters have applied for absentee ballots, a 14-fold increase from 2016. Nearly 70% of those requests have come from registered Democrats, state data as of May 13 show. That margin is far wider than the 55% to 45% registration advantage held by Democrats in the state.
Pennsylvania’s June election includes the presidential nominating contest for the major political parties. That decision has effectively been made already because Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden are running unopposed for their respective nominations. But the balloting also features competitive statewide and local races whose outcomes could be determined by the large contingent of absentee voters.
That's a worrisome harbinger for Republicans looking ahead to the general election, if coronavirus remains a health threat and Democrats continue their mail-in advantage, according to Lee Snover, head of the Republican Party in Northampton County, about 70 miles northeast Philadelphia. Northampton is one of three Pennsylvania counties whose voters flipped to Trump after supporting Democrat Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. 
Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016 by the slimmest of margins - just 45,000 votes, or less than a percentage point. At stake are 20 Electoral College votes, out of 270 a candidate needs to win the presidency. Pennsylvania is one of a handful of former industrial “Rust Belt” states that could decide this year’s election.
“It’s a real problem and could be really troubling come November,"" Snover said. Trump supporters ""simply don’t trust the process, and the president’s comments have not helped things, for sure.""
It's not just Pennsylvania. Republicans nationwide appear less eager to embrace voting by mail. Just one-third of Republicans said they are at least somewhat likely to vote by mail in November, compared to two-thirds of Democrats and half of independents who said so, according to an April 30-May 4 Monmouth University poll.
The Republican National Committee said it has had a team on the ground in Pennsylvania since 2016 and is aggressively educating volunteers and supporters about the process to vote by mail.
""Republican voters are much more traditional, they generally like to vote in person,"" said Rick Gorka, a senior member of the Republican National Committee and part of the Trump Victory re-election campaign. ""Some level of discomfort is expected, but that’s why we are diligently working to retrain voters."" 
    
IN TRUMP THEY TRUST
But Pennsylvania Republicans such as Frank Miller, a 51-year old business owner, could prove tough to persuade. He lives in Luzerne County, a politically divided region in the northeastern part of the state. Miller says there is no way he would vote by mail in November, pandemic or no pandemic. 
""Most Trump supporters are like me - we trust Trump but no one else,"" Miller said. ""When I see Democrats pushing it, I know there must be a sinister reason for it."" 
Mail-in balloting has emerged as another highly charged issue in America's polarized politics. Republicans in states across the country are engaged in legal battles to stop Democratic attempts to expand mail-in voting in response to the biggest U.S. health crisis in a century.
In Texas, the Democratic Party and a coalition of voters and civil rights groups have filed several lawsuits to expand mail balloting in light of the coronavirus. The Republican-led state government opposes those efforts, arguing mail ballots are prone to fraud and there's not enough time or money to implement such a sweeping change.
In Nevada, several conservative groups have sued to block Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak's plan to hold congressional and local primaries in June entirely by mail, arguing that, among other things, it violates the U.S. Constitution. 
Lawmakers in Pennsylvania, which has a Democratic governor and a divided legislature, have gone the other way. Last year the state passed legislation making it easier for citizens to vote by mail.
November will mark the first general election in which any registered voter in Pennsylvania can request an absentee ballot without having to provide an excuse such as illness or travel, and evidence to back it up. Those restrictions severely limited the number of people who could vote absentee in the past; mail ballots accounted for just 4.6% of all ballots cast there in the 2016 general election.
Both parties recognize the need for a massive education campaign to let Pennsylvanians know about the changes.
Joe Foster, the Democratic Party head of Montgomery County, the largest suburban county in Pennsylvania, said his party's central focus is getting voters familiarized with the new voting process in a crucial election year. Pennsylvania ranks among the states hardest-hit by coronavirus; more than 63,000 of its residents have been infected and more than 4,200 have died.
“There is not a phone call or email that I am on where the issue of signing up voters for mail-in ballots is not emphasized,"" Foster said.
Those efforts are paying off. Nearly 81,000 Montgomery County voters have requested mail-in ballots for the June primary, fully 78% of them Democrats, according to local officials. Four years ago, roughly 5,670 people in the county voted by mail in the primary, divided about equally between Republicans and Democrats.
Statewide, Democrats have sent texts to at least a million supporters, logged 500,000 calls and hosted over 1,200 attendees in online training sessions, according to the state party.
Republicans, too, are gearing up. Even as Trump denounces mail balloting, his campaign has organized virtual training in Pennsylvania to teach volunteers how to get Republicans to register for absentee ballots, which can be done online or by mail. 
""Republicans have always supported absentee voting with safeguards in place,"" RNC spokesman Michael Joyce said. ""What we oppose is a nationwide experiment that would eliminate those safeguards, invite fraud and weaken the integrity of our elections."" 
In states with expansive mail balloting, Republicans have sought to purge voter registration rolls of people who have moved, died or failed to vote in several election cycles, an effort they say is needed to avoid fraud, but which Democrats say often removes eligible voters. Republicans have also sought to clamp down on so-called ballot harvesting, where volunteers collect absentee ballots from voters and submit them to be counted.
Past studies by election researchers have shown neither party has an advantage in states with a history of mail balloting and where officials automatically mail ballots to all registered voters.
In California on Tuesday, for example, Republican Mike Garcia defeated Democrat Christy Smith in a runoff for a congressional seat in the Los Angeles suburbs. That special election was conducted largely by mail in a district where Democrats hold a registration advantage.
'WE COULD PAY A PRICE'
Voting-rights advocates have denounced Republican efforts to limit mail-in voting as particularly unfair to minorities and low-income Americans, who tend to vote Democratic and also have been hit hardest by the coronavirus outbreak.  
But the Republican Party has created risks for itself by sewing doubts among its own members about casting absentee ballots in the midst of a public health emergency, said Robert Stein, a political science professor at Rice University who has studied mail balloting.
""It's a terrible mistake for Republicans,"" Stein said. ""There is one party embracing innovation and there's another fighting an obstacle, the president.""
Stein said the party that does the best job mobilizing supporters to vote by mail could gain the advantage if coronavirus is still raging in November and depresses in-person turnout.
In Pennsylvania, that prospect is worrying Sam DeMarco, head of the Republican Party in Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh. He said if his party continues to lag Democrats badly in mail-in voting, Republicans will be under tremendous pressure to get their supporters to the polls on Election Day to overcome the absentee-ballot deficit, a big gamble in a pandemic. 

“We don’t want to start the election down 500,000 votes,” DeMarco said. ""Republican leaders in the state need to embrace it or else we could pay a price.""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orban on Friday said a Supreme Court ruling awarding damages to schoolchildren from the Roma minority who were put in separate classes was unfair and pledged to change the law to prevent any future such decisions.
Orban, who has gradually assumed control over many aspects of life in post-communist Hungary, sparked protests in Budapest when he hinted in January that the state should disobey any order to pay restitution to the Roma, and train them instead.
The case concerns an elementary school in Gyongyospata, an eastern town that has been a flashpoint of ethnic tensions. The Supreme Court ruled on Tuesday that it had given substandard education to the Roma children after confining them to the ground floor.
It ordered the school district and the town to pay the students a combined $310,000 in damages, confirming a finding by ombundsman for the minority, who reported in 2011 that the Roma had been segregated for years.
Orban has said the school was trying to prevent Roma children bullying others. The ombudsman's report said there were scattered incidents of bullying but that tension was fuelled by vigilante marches through the nearby Roma settlement.
""I am a law graduate, and this court ruling is wholly unfair,"" Orban told state radio. ""It provides legal services, not justice. From downtown Budapest, where the court is, the justice of Gyongyospata is invisible. But we will find it.""
He said the government would decide how to honour the ruling and was putting the finishing touches on new legislation to prevent such rulings in the future. He did not go into detail.
The nationalist leader has come under fire from fellow European Union members for measures to tighten controls over the country's courts, which have so far withstood his efforts.
Rights activists say Roma in Hungary, who make up 5-7% of the population, live in disproportionate poverty, suffer from prejudice in schools and workplaces and have been subject to intimidation and occasionally deadly violence by the far right.
Orban said the Gyongyospata case was rooted in principle.
""It's unacceptable for a majority to feel ill at ease in their own towns, or country, and it won't happen while I am premier,"" he said. ""This is a country of natives, after all, this is our country.""

He said rights groups funded and controlled by his longtime nemesis, the Hungarian-born billionaire philanthropist George Soros, start and use cases such as the Gyongyospata one to ""grab money and attack the majority"".

451,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 06:03AM ET</span>",First Hong Kong protester to admit 'rioting' gets four years' jail,"By Sharon Tam and Jessie Pang
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A 21-year-old Hong Kong lifeguard, the first anti-government protester to plead guilty to the charge of rioting during last year's unrest, was sentenced to four years' jail on Friday for a ""direct attack on the rule of law"". 
Sin Ka-ho was among thousands who surrounded the Legislative Council on June 12 in a bid to stop legislators from giving a second reading to a since-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
A few dozen protesters, many wearing black and holding a banner reading ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times"" gathered outside the court, chanting “there’s no riot, only tyranny"".
As Sin was driven away in a van, some protesters knocked on its windows and shouted ""Stay strong!""
The protest at the Legislative Council was the first of many last year that police cleared with tear gas and rubber bullets, angering moderate Hong Kong people in a pivotal moment for the anti-government movement.
Demonstrations turned more confrontational and broadened to demands for democracy in the Chinese-ruled city amid anger at Beijing's perceived meddling with its freedoms.
Sin admitted to pushing police barricades and hurling umbrellas and other objects at officers, but denied planning the assaults.
The defendant's actions were ""a direct attack on the rule of law,"" District Court Justice Amanda Woodcock said in the sentencing, which is seen as potentially laying down a marker for the nearly 600 protesters who have been charged with rioting, risking up to 10 years in jail.
Neither Sin nor his lawyer commented on the sentence.
Sin has been the only one so far to plead guilty, in a symbolic blow for the protest movement, whose demands include amnesty for all those arrested and the government dropping its characterisation of the protests as ""riots"".
Hong Kong, a former British colony, returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the guarantee of many freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland, including an independent judiciary. Communist Party rulers in Beijing deny interfering with those freedoms.
The protesters' main demands are universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into police's handling of the demonstrations.
Accusations of police brutality must not be used as ""a weapon of political protest"", the police watchdog said in a report on Friday, adding that the city appeared to be getting dragged into an ""era of terrorism"".
More than 8,300 protesters were arrested between June 2019 and mid-May this year. Over 1,600 have been prosecuted and 595 face rioting charges.
Sin's sentence was reduced from six to four years due to his clear record and guilty plea.

Demonstrations are likely to pick up in the summer after a relative lull this year due to social distancing measures taken to fight the coronavirus outbreak, which has largely been brought under control.

The government introduced a state of emergency on March 14 that imposed travel bans, closed schools, restaurants and shopping malls, and prompted many businesses to limit or halt operations due to restrictions and reduced demand.
It started easing the partial lockdown in late April but continued to enforce strict social measures on many of its citizens and businesses, helping prevent widespread community spread of the virus.
Bulgaria, a country with a population of less than 7 million, still requires social distancing in public places and keeps its borders closed.
After meeting with Bulgaria's retail association, Borissov agreed that all shops in commercial centres across the country will be allowed to resume operations from Monday. 
The decision comes a day after Bulgaria's biggest business organisation, the Bulgarian Industrial Association (BIA)employers, expressed concerns that no date has been set for reopening of the shopping malls.
Nearly 300,000 people work in the retail sector, according to BIA, which said that many of them could go bankrupt if the malls remain closed. 

As of Friday, Bulgaria has 2,138 confirmed coronavirus cases, including 102 deaths.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Silence gradually replaced the screams around Dejene Degefa as his fellow travelers suffocated one by one inside a locked metal container. He struggled to stay conscious but finally passed out, only waking to the sounds of rescue. 
Dejene was one of only 14 people rescued alive from the back of a truck on the Malawi-Mozambique border on March 24. Police found 64 bodies inside. 
""I was beating sides of the container; I was even beating people near me,"" said 18-year-old Dejene. ""I knew that others are dying, and I felt in my heart that I was dying too."" 
He and the other survivors were taken to hospital and then an immigration centre in Mozambique, where they were held for weeks before being repatriated to Ethiopia by the International Organization for Migration, a United Nations body that helps governments and migrants.
Desperate to see their families, the group had to undergo 14 days in quarantine until they tested negative for COVID-19. Dejene spoke to Reuters the day they were released. 
Dejene and his friends decided to escape poverty at home by seeking jobs abroad on the so-called ""southern route"", which takes migrants to South Africa rather than Europe.
He said the migrants had balked at crowding into the small container to make the border crossing, but smugglers lashed out, forcing the desperate group inside. 
A woman fainted in the hot dark within 15 minutes, he said. Panic spread quickly; a mass of arms and legs flailed out. He was kicked, passed out and woke up with a body on top of him. 
Dejene's friend Mulugeta, 19, told Reuters how he had helped save the group by beating on the side of the truck when he heard voices at a checkpoint. When the doors spilled open, he carried the unconscious Dejene outside.
""When I opened my eyes ... I saw was a cloudy sky and that is how I knew that I was alive,"" Dejene told Reuters. 
A fifth-grade drop out from Ethiopia's southern region, he'd left his village in September 2019 with 3,000 birr ($90) and an identification card. Dejene will never try to go back to South Africa, he said. All he wants is to see his family.
""I would rather beg to feed myself than go back,"" he said. ""I wish I could hug everyone I know but given the current circumstance, I only can greet them from afar.""

WESTVLETEREN, Belgium (Reuters) - Belgian Trappist monks who brew one of the world's most coveted beers have reopened for business after a two-month break, though COVID-19 restrictions mean they can only supply local rather than international demand.
The Saint-Sixtus abbey, home to 19 monks, launched an online sale on Thursday evening of 6,000 crates, with pick-ups starting Friday. Exceptionally, customers can buy three crates. Normally it is just two.
Customers can come as usual by car, but are told not to leave their vehicles while queuing until they pass a newly installed traffic light before the pick-up point.
There, a lay worker in mask and gloves passes their 24-bottle crates through a small gap in a plastic screen. Payment must made electronically, not with cash. The nearby cafe serving the beers remains closed.
Demand is no issue. Brother Godfried said there were 5,000 new online accounts created from Wednesday to Thursday, bringing the total to 35,000. 
""The picture is a bit distorted as for now we can only offer on the Belgian market. The borders are shut, even though the beer draws a certain international interest,"" he told Reuters.
The monks sold a few cases in advance to test their new system. Thomas Vuylsteke, a 33-year-old lawyer, was one of the lucky recipients.
""Well it has been selected a few times as the best beer in the world and it is really tasty. It's always great,"" he said.
Flor Holvoet had driven two hours to get to the abbey.
""For me it was very important because actually it was the first opportunity to do a real trip again, have a reason to come out again,"" he said.
The abbey has been brewing its Westvleteren beers since 1839 and selling to the public since 1878, but production and sales were limited to ensure brewing never took over monastic life or earned more than was needed.
The monks opted to sell only at the abbey gates since World War Two, but the quiet local lanes filled with traffic after beer rating websites hailed the 10% Westvleteren XII as one of the world's best beers.

The monks put in place a telephone reservation system in 2005, replacing it with internet ordering last year, though customers can still sit for hours in a virtual queue before being able to order.

The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) mayors of the eastern provinces of Igdir, Siirt and districts of Baykan and Kurtalan were detained at their houses, according to the source and to Anadolu.
President Tayyip Erdogan's government accuses the HDP of having links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, leading to prosecutions of thousands of its members and some leaders. The HDP denies such links. 
Since March 2019 local elections, mayors have been replaced by trustees in more than half of the roughly 65 municipalities won by the HDP. Ankara has appointed governors and other local authorities as trustees in those districts.
The former co-leaders of the HDP have both been jailed since 2016 on terrorism charges, with several other prominent party members accused of supporting terrorism over what the government says are links to the PKK.

LONDON (Reuters) - After 600 years of painstakingly slow evolution, Britain's parliament took a leap into the future when the coronavirus pandemic struck, transforming its deeply traditional debating chamber into a modern videoconferencing hub.
Where lawmakers once forced their way into rowdy debate by ""bobbing"" up and down out of their seats, and cheered on their leaders with hearty ""hear hears"", flat screen televisions now beam choreographed questions into a near-silent chamber.
The hybrid parliament model launched last month has allowed democracy to keep functioning as Britain endures a virus outbreak now linked with more than 40,000 deaths that stopped the country - and parliament - in its tracks in March.
""It's like a giant TV studio,"" said Matthew Hamlyn, a senior parliamentary official who helps manage proceedings in the House of Commons. ""Only, rather than having your six guests on ... you have maybe 60, all over the country.""
Officials were given just two weeks by House of Commons speaker Lindsay (NYSE:LNN) Hoyle to modernise a system that prides itself on maintaining tradition, and has historically resisted technological change.
They met that challenge on April 22 when parliament held its first ever hybrid sitting, including a virtually hitch-free session of Prime Minister's Questions, known nationwide as PMQs - the highlight of the weekly political calendar.
This week members conducted their first ever remote vote, eschewing a complicated and archaic system of lawmakers physically walking through voting corridors to register their approval or disapproval.
""I've been working in software engineering for 20 years and this is probably the pinnacle,"" said Matt Stutely, Director of Software Engineering in the Parliament Digital Service.
""The House of Commons has voted remotely for the first time ever, and it's existed for hundreds and hundreds of years."" 
The future of the new system, always billed as a temporary fix rather than a permanent step, remains in the balance.
The government's leader of parliamentary business Jacob Rees-Mogg has told lawmakers it is time to return to work in parliament itself but others say it is not yet safe and want the virtual system to continue.
The architects of the system, the army of procedural clerks, IT experts and fixers working behind the scenes, say the new parliament is not a like-for-like swap with the old way of doing business.
""Everybody recognises that this is very much a needs-must situation. It is not ideal,"" said John Angeli, director of parliamentary audio-visual.

""There are clearly some advantages. It's allowed the chamber to sit. But I think that members will be reflecting on whether or not this is sort of a sustainable way of wanting to do democracy.""

The Pacific Islands meeting, with China's vice foreign minister, Zheng Zeguang, on Wednesday, came a day after Zheng held a teleconference with nine Caribbean nations, and ahead of a World Health Assembly (WHA) meeting starting on May 18.
A resolution calling for an investigation into the coronavirus pandemic, which China opposes, is expected to be debated at the WHA.
China has reacted angrily to calls from Australia for a coronavirus investigation, and accused the United States of inciting other nations to support Taiwan's attendance as an observer at the World Health Assembly (WHA).
Beijing considers Taiwan to be a wayward province. Under World Health Organization (WHO) rules Taipei is not able to attend its meetings as it is considered to be represented by Beijing.
Papua New Guinea's Foreign Minister Patrick Pruaitu co-chaired the meeting with China's allies in the Pacific, where 10 nations talked about their COVID-19 response, his office said.
The Vanuatu Daily Post reported the Pacific nations had given ""firm support of the one-China principle"" in the meeting.
China's provision of aid funding and medical supplies to combat COVID-19 was discussed at the meeting attended by foreign ministry officials from Fiji, Samoa, Papua New Guinea, Vanuatu, The Federated States of Micronesia, Cook Islands, Tonga, Niue, Solomon Islands and Kiribati.
Taiwan's 15 diplomatic allies are concentrated in the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean. Last year, the Solomon Islands and Kiribati switched their allegiance to Beijing.
A statement issued by Chinese embassies in several Pacific nations and Canberra said attendees on the conference calls had pledged to ""oppose any attempt at stigmatisation, politicising or labelling the virus"".
They had also ""commended China for its open, transparent and responsible approach in adopting timely and robust response measures and sharing its containment experience"", the statement said.
Washington has accused Beijing of covering up its early response to the coronavirus outbreak.
The Caribbean nations had also pledged to ""adhere to the one-China principle"" and support China on its ""core interests"", according to a statement from the Chinese foreign ministry.
Australia, the largest aid donor to the Pacific Islands, is wary of rising Chinese influence in the region, and has stepped up coronavirus aid in the past week. 
Australia provided funding for the WHO to supply the Pacific with 150,000 COVID-19 tests, and airlifted some test kits and military personnel to Papua New Guinea on Monday. Australia on Thursday provided A$12.25 million ($8 million) in funding for Fiji's COVID-19 response.
Taiwan has also sent virus aid to its Pacific allies - Palau, Nauru, Tuvalu and the Marshall Islands - and 14 of its 15 allies have lodged proposals with the WHO to allow Taiwan into the WHA.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry this week expressed its ""sincere thanks"" for the backing of its allies and other ""like-minded countries"".
But China's Foreign Ministry said countries backing the Taiwan proposal are ""seeking to severely disrupt this WHA and undermine global anti-pandemic cooperation"".
Beijing says Taiwan's participation at the WHA must be arranged with the permission of Beijing, and it has refused permission since 2017.

461,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>",Chinese official hails 'incomparable' improvement in air quality as virus hits industry,"By Muyu Xu and David Stanway
BEIJING (Reuters) - China's air quality saw ""incomparable"" improvements in the first quarter of this year as a coronavirus outbreak led to rapid declines in industrial activity and transportation, an environment ministry official said on Friday.
The number of ""blue sky days"" rose by 6.6 percentage points in the first quarter of 2020, said Liu Bingjiang, head of the air pollution office at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.
""That was a level we didn't even dare imagine,"" he said, noting the target for the whole 2016-2020 period was 3.3 percentage points.
China has for several months been grappling with a coronavirus outbreak, which has spread around the world and infected more than 4 million people, forcing governments to impose strict lockdowns, severely hurting economic activity.
With millions staying home, concentrations of small lung-damaging floating particles fell by nearly 15% in more than 300 Chinese cities in the first three months of the year, according to official ministry data. 
Emissions in the city of Shanghai fell by nearly 20% in the first quarter while Beijing's average emissions levels stood still in the first three months of the year, the data showed. 
In Wuhan, where the pandemic originated, monthly averages of particulate matter emissions dropped more than a third. 
Normally the country's smoggiest province, Hebei also saw PM2.5 concentrations, a measure of air pollution, fall 15.7% in the first four months of 2020. 
The province, however, attributed the drop to its crackdowns on pollution rather than the coronavirus.
NEW NORMAL
China has gradually loosened the lockdown since late March in several cities and Liu said the resumption of normal economic activity had not led to a noticeable decline in air quality so far.
He also attributed the improvements in China's air quality to its strenuous anti-pollution efforts over the last few years.
China declared ""war"" on pollution in 2014 after a spate of politically damaging outbreaks of smog in Beijing and other regions and has been strict to punish those breaking the rules.
The country normally sets targets over the October-March winter heating period, forcing cities to make improvements in air quality compared to the previous year. 
But Liu said the steep declines in emissions brought about by the virus would make it too difficult for cities to make further year-on-year cuts next winter, so China would not make the targets a ""decisive element"" of compliance over the period.
He said China would continue to eliminate small-scale coal use this year and further promote the replacement of coal by gas or electricity in households throughout northern regions, noting that the policies and financial support were now in place.
China is currently working on a new anti-smog plan that would further target ground-level ozone pollution, a rising health risk caused mainly by vehicle exhaust fumes and sunlight.

It will also extend the ""blue sky"" campaign to other regions, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Shandong and Henan, he said.

462,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 02:21AM ET</span>",Japan's regions emerge from virus emergency while Tokyo enters 'new normal',"By Rocky Swift
TOKYO (Reuters) - Large parts of Japan marked the first day out of a state of emergency on Friday while Tokyo's governor asked residents to prepare for the ""new normal"" as restrictions stay in place in the capital and major cities.
Softbank (OTC:SFTBY) Corp. and McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) Japan said they would start returning to normal operations in 39 of Japan's 47 prefectures that are now exempt from the emergency declaration. The 39 prefectures account for about 55 percent of Japan's 126 million people.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted the state of emergency for these prefectures on Thursday but said the urban centres of Tokyo and Osaka and six other prefectures will remain under restrictions until there is convincing containment of the coronavirus. The emergency gives governors more authority to tell people to stay at home and to close schools and businesses, but there is no penalty for non-compliance.
""Even in areas where the emergency has been lifted, we would like to see people refrain from moving between prefectures as much as possible, at least during this month,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said on Friday. ""We hope that people will be able to return to their daily lives in stages.""
Restrictions in the capital would remain in place until at least the end of May, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters, laying out a road map of conditions that need to be met before measures can be eased. New daily infections should be below 20, while restrictions on businesses will be eased in stages.
""We need to solidify a 'new normal' in view of a long fight against the virus,"" Koike said. ""Telecommuting and staggered commuting would be among the concepts that we'd like to create with residents.""
New cases in Tokyo have been trending downward of late, and were at 30 on Thursday. Even so, the true number may be much higher.
TEN TIMES OFFICIAL FIGURES
Kyodo News reported that antibody tests of 500 Tokyo residents conducted by the health ministry indicated that 0.6% had been exposed to the virus. That would correlate to about 55,000 cases, based on the 9.2 million population of Tokyo's 23 central wards, more than 10 times the official figure of infections. 
Softbank said its mobile phone shops would return to normal operations in the 39 prefectures. McDonald's, which had done take-out only, said it would resume in-store dining in those regions.
But it was unclear how soon the regional economies could snap back. Little movement is expected at least until the end of the month, said Gardner Robinson, an American who runs a hotel and restaurant in Nagano prefecture, where the state of emergency is over. 
""A lot of local, prefectural and federal support is tied to staying closed until then,"" Robinson said. 
""But lifting the declaration will make it easier to get guests coming back for the green season,"" he added, referring to the non-ski season in the winter sports destination. 
Japan's economy will recover only modestly in the second half of this year from a steep contraction in the current quarter, a Reuters poll of analysts showed on Friday.
Nationwide, Japan has reported 16,203 cases of the coronavirus and 713 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK. The figures are much lower than in most industrialized nations, but the pandemic cost Tokyo its chance to host the Summer Olympics this year.
The International Olympic Committee said on Thursday it expects to bear costs of up to $800 million related to the postponed Games, now due to be staged in Tokyo next year. The figure does not include any costs Tokyo Games organisers and the Japanese government have to incur due to the delay.

463,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 12:55AM ET</span>",U.S. says Islamic State conducted attack on Kabul hospital,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday blamed Islamic State militants -- not the Taliban -- for a gruesome hospital attack in Afghanistan this week that killed two newborn babies, and it renewed calls for Afghans to embrace a troubled peace push with the Taliban insurgency.
But it was unclear if the U.S. declaration would be enough to bolster the peace effort and reverse a decision by the Kabul government to resume offensive operations against the Taliban.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani ordered the military on Tuesday to switch to ""offensive mode"" against the Taliban following the hospital attack in Kabul and a suicide bombing in Nangarhar province that killed scores of people.
U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad blamed Islamic State for both attacks in a statement issued on Twitter, saying the group opposed any Taliban peace agreement and sought to trigger an Iraq-style sectarian war in Afghanistan.
""Rather than falling into the ISIS trap and delay peace or create obstacles, Afghans must come together to crush this menace and pursue a historic peace opportunity,"" Khalilzad said.
""No more excuses. Afghans, and the world, deserve better.""
An affiliate of the Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the Nangarhar bombing, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. No one has claimed the hospital attack. 
The Taliban denied involvement in either attacks, but the government accused the group of fostering an environment in which terrorism thrives or of working with other militant groups who could have been involved, straining U.S. efforts to bring the insurgents and Afghan government together.
The attacks were another setback to U.S. President Donald Trump's stalled plans to bring peace to Afghanistan and end America's longest war.
A Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban deal called for a phased U.S. troop withdrawal and for the Afghan government and Taliban to release some prisoners by March 10, when peace talks were to start. 
Intra-Afghan peace talks have yet to occur and there is some bitterness within the Afghan government, which was not a party to the Feb. 29 deal, that the United States undercut their leverage by negotiating directly with the Taliban.

Ghani's decision to revive offensive operations is supported by many opposition figures, who believe Washington's sole focus is to keep the U.S. troop withdrawal plan on track to help Trump win a second term in the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election.

465,By Reuters,"<span>May 15, 2020 12:30AM ET</span>",Taiwan rejects China's main condition for WHO participation,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's health minister rejected on Friday China's main condition for the island to be able to take part in the World Health Organization (WHO) - that it accepts it is part of China - ahead of a key meeting of the body during a pandemic.
Non-WHO member Taiwan has lobbied to take part as an observer in next week's World Heath Assembly (WHA), drawing strong objections from Beijing, which considers Taiwan to be one of its provinces.
Taiwan says the coronavirus pandemic has made it more urgent than ever that it be allowed proper access to the WHO.
China says Taiwan can only participate under the ""one China"" principle, in which it accepts it is a part of China. 
China's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday that Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party refused to do this, and so the political foundation for Taiwan's WHO participation had ""ceased to exist"".
Speaking at a news conference in Taipei to press home Taiwan's desire to take part, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said there was no way Taiwan would do this.
""I have no way to accept something which does not exist,"" Chen said, adding that Taiwan would not give up efforts to attend the health assembly, even though it has not received an invitation.
The issue has taken on broader diplomatic significance thanks to the strong support from the United States and Japan in particular for Taiwan to attend the WHA, to China's anger.
China says it has the right to represent Taiwan on the international stage. Taiwan says that only its democratically elected government can speak for the island's 23 million people.
""We can represent our own people,"" Taiwan Deputy Foreign Minister Kelly Hsieh told the same news conference in Taipei. ""We hope the WHO can set aside political considerations, and be neutral and professional.""
Taiwan attended the WHA as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations were warmer.
But China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects.

The WHO says it has no mandate to invite Taiwan to the WHA and that only member states can decide.

466,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 11:15PM ET</span>",Awkward greetings and long queues as Hong Kong's financiers return to work,"By Sumeet Chatterjee and Scott Murdoch
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The greetings are awkward and the skyscraper lifts half-empty. But Hong Kong's cafes are filling and taxis are harder to find as the first wave of financial professionals return to their offices after an easing of coronavirus lockdown rules.
The re-emergence of facemask-wearing bankers, investors, lawyers and their clients in Central, Hong Kong's main business district, is being closely watched by other major financial centres looking forward to resuming business.
Few, however, have described it as anything like a return to a pre-virus normal.
""Everything takes time these days, and there are queues everywhere,"" said Alex, a bank worker lining up for the lifts in the 88-storey IFC 2 tower, which houses UBS, Nomura, BNP Paribas (OTC:BNPQY) and others. 
""Everyone is very cautious ... you literally have to think before you do anything - literally anything - even doing a high-five with a buddy.""
Greetings have proved a particular minefield as face-to-face meetings resume. 
Handshakes are sometimes offered, producing awkwardness over whether to accept, while others report an uptick in ""namaste greetings"", with palms pressed together, or the Chinese-style fist pressed in a palm. Foot and elbow bumps are also popular. 
Face masks are de rigeur on the streets – and increasingly uncomfortable in Hong Kong's sweltering summer weather – and several bankers report their use inside offices, even though not all firms demand it.
""It’s not the nicest thing in the world but you get used to it,"" said one banker at a European institution. ""Also you aren’t being particularly respectful if you are not wearing one.""
Banks including Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), and  Morgan Stanley  (NYSE:MS) are now allowing meetings of up to eight people, although all meetings at Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) remain virtual, sources said.  Citigroup  (NYSE:C) allows meetings of up to 10 people if they can't be avoided.
Morgan Stanley has changed the algorithms for its dedicated lifts in the 108-storey ICC tower – also home to  Credit Suisse  (SIX:CSGN) and  Deutsche Bank  (DE:DBKGn) – to allow a maximum of eight people, while Citigroup is installing plastic partitions in higher-density areas like trading floors.
Office staffing levels at the banks vary from around 50% to just 15%.
Private bankers have noticed a pick-up in meeting requests – particularly among their older clients. 
“The family offices are fine because they would have proper set up… but some of the high net worth individuals who are older may not be that tech-savvy,” said Anthony Chan, chief Asia investment strategist at Union Bancaire Privée. 
Many bankers are still leery of face time, however. One senior dealmaker at another institution says while some of his team attend a regular Monday meeting together, he dials in from his office in the same building.
DRESSED-DOWN EFFICIENCY
With the bulk of interaction still being online, dress codes have become markedly more casual. Few expect that to change soon, with travel banned and external meetings so limited.
Several banks have said “smart casual” will suffice for office goers and some staff think a more relaxed dressing style could become permanent. The dealmaker not attending his team meeting in person said his tailor told him some bankers were asking for casual shirts and jackets, not suits.
Mahendra Kumar, Asia Pacific head of financing for financial sponsors at Deutsche Bank, has swapped his suits for business causal and stubble for now.
""I'm not going to the tailor ordering a few suits at once like I usually do every January. He is not going to be my friend anymore.""
However, Kumar sees private equity activity picking up later in the year, which would mean a return to his monthly China trip and in-person client meetings.
The chances, and merits, of a return to regular travel are hotly debated. Before the crisis, about a third of investment bankers in Hong Kong could expect to be travelling at any one time.
“One thing has been shown during the coronavirus shutdown was that so much more can be achieved using technology,” said one chino-wearing capital markets lawyer. 
Previously, travelling to Beijing from Hong Kong for one meeting could take up two days of your time, he said.
INFECTION CAUTION
Hong Kong this week broke a 23-day run of zero local infections with a family cluster of three positive tests, but some government officials say they do not currently plan to tighten restrictions.
Bars in the city re-opened last Friday, observing a 1.5 metre gap between tables, while restaurants and cafes can now seat groups up to eight at similarly distanced tables, leading to long queues at popular banker hangouts.
One group of bankers this week gave up on a team coffee and returned to their office after waiting for a table.

“Even going out for coffee with colleagues has become such a big pain now,” said one of the group. “It’s refreshing to come back to the office, but with so many restrictions, I now wouldn’t mind working from home once in a while.”

467,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate votes to extend government surveillance tools,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate comfortably approved a 2-1/2-year extension of parts of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) on Thursday, two months after the divisive provisions allowing government data collection expired.
The Senate backed the reauthorization by 80-16, far more than the 60 votes needed for passage.
The measure must be approved, however, by the House of Representatives before it can be sent to the White House for President Donald Trump to veto or sign into law. On Thursday, the Republican-led Senate amended the measure approved by the Democratic-led House in March to improve legal protections for those subject to surveillance.
It was not immediately clear when the House would vote. House members were due to return to Washington on Friday to vote on a coronavirus relief package.
The authorities that would be renewed until December 2023 cover the FISA court's approval of warrants for obtaining business records, allow surveillance without establishing that a subject is acting on behalf of an extremist group - the ""lone wolf"" provision - and allow continued eavesdropping on a subject who has changed cellular telephone providers.
Backers of the three provisions insist they are essential tools for combating extremism and catching foreign spies.
But they face stiff opposition from privacy advocates, including liberal Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans, who say they do too little to protect Americans' privacy.
As it considered amendments on Wednesday, the Senate blocked by one vote an amendment that would have prevented law enforcement from collecting information on Americans' internet habits without a warrant.
Republican Senator Rand Paul said in a Senate speech before the vote that the legislation renewing the surveillance authorities constituted ""a false exchange of liberty for a false sense of security.""
The White House has not said whether Trump will sign. 
Attorney General William Barr wrote the bill with congressional Democrats and Republicans. But the Republican president recently has resurrected in comments on Twitter his anger over the use of FISA by Democratic former President Barack Obama's administration.

468,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 09:40PM ET</span>","'Wild, wild West': Wisconsin reopens for business","By Brendan O'Brien
PORT WASHINGTON, Wis. (Reuters) - As a handful of patrons sat at the bar nursing beers and watching a rerun of a Milwaukee Bucks basketball game on a cloudy Thursday afternoon, Junior Useling prepared for what he hoped would be another busy night at the Patio Bar & Grill.
It was just last evening that the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled the governor does not have the power to impose a statewide coronavirus lockdown, sparking a mix of hope and confusion among struggling business owners across the Midwestern state.
Useling, 71, considers himself one of the lucky ones: Port Washington is part of Ozaukee County, which unlike a half-dozen other counties and cities across Wisconsin has interpreted the court's decision as an unfettered green light.
""Why would I stay closed? ... I got mortgages and bills. My god, if we kept on going we would all be broke,"" he told Reuters. ""This country is supposed to be free to do what you want.""
The court sided with a legal challenge from Republican lawmakers who argued the state's top public health official, Andrea Palm, exceeded her authority by imposing a stay-at-home order through May 26.
Not long after the ruling was announced, some beer-loving Wisconsinites rushed to bars for their first taste of freedom in nearly two months, and pictures appeared on social media of maskless crowds of revelers nowhere near 6 feet apart.
The rift over how and when to reopen in Wisconsin reflects its status as a key battleground for the Nov. 3 presidential election, along with neighboring Michigan and Pennsylvania, which Trump won by a hair in 2016. 
At a media briefing on Thursday, Palm urged state residents to continue to stay home even if their local leaders said otherwise, warning that relaxed restrictions risked ""increasing our cases and deaths.""
Wisconsin had recorded 11,380 coronavirus cases and 433 deaths as of Thursday.
The owner of Remington's River Inn, Amy Ollman, said she had already made up her mind to reopen before the ruling, a decision endorsed by a patron who shouted ""open up America"" as she described cleaning tables and chairs for the past two weeks. 
""Top to bottom, left to right, we cleaned this entire place,"" she said from behind her bar in the village of Thiensville, about 20 miles (32 km) south of Milwaukee and also part of Ozaukee County. ""It's time to get back to normalcy.""
WRESTLING WITH DECISIONS
The court's decision came as state leaders wrestle with how and when to relax mandatory business closures and other restrictions on social gatherings that have proved successful in slowing the outbreak but have devastated the economy.
Like most of his counterparts, Wisconsin Governor Tom Evers has had to weigh the interests of cities such as Milwaukee and Madison against less populated areas that have seen fewer cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
Evers' one-size-fits-all approach rankled Republicans in his state and drew fire from President Donald Trump, who took a swipe at the governor on Twitter on Thursday saying Wisconsin was ""bustling"" and ""people want to get on with their lives.""
But the court's ruling also triggered confusion as some local leaders in cities such as Milwaukee and Appleton, as well as in Dane, Brown and Kenosha counties, kept their lockdowns in place. 
Kristine Hillmer, president of the Wisconsin Restaurant Association, sent out guidance on Thursday telling her group's 7,000 mainly independent eating and drinking establishments to follow local restrictions if they exist.
""The rest of the state they can open 100% however they want,"" she said. ""It's a little bit of the Wild Wild West right now.""
Mike Eitel said his phone ""blew up"" after the court ruling with patrons wanting to know if Milwaukee's Nomad World Pub and the other establishments he owns would be opening that night. He said it was a clear sign of pent up demand.
But like other owners, Eitel said he has struggled to buy masks, gloves and other protective equipment for his workers, is faced with rising meat prices and wonders if a bar can even be profitable with strict social distancing rules.
He has also had to straddle two worlds: while the Nomad cannot open its doors until May 26 at the earliest under city rules, the outdoor bar and water sports rental shop he runs in neighboring Waukesha County has been free of any restrictions as of Wednesday night.

""There is massive confusion on what it all means,"" Eitel said. ""It's insane.""

469,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 09:10PM ET</span>",U.S. Senate approves bill to pressure China over Uighur rights,"By Patricia Zengerle and David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate approved legislation on Thursday calling on President Donald Trump's administration to toughen its response to China's crackdown on its Uighur Muslim minority, the latest push in Washington to punish China as Trump blames Beijing for worsening the coronavirus pandemic.
The bipartisan bill, introduced by Republican Senator Marco Rubio, calls for sanctions against those responsible for the repression of Uighurs and other Muslim groups. It specifically singles out a member of China's powerful Politburo as responsible for ""gross human rights violations"" against them.
The Republican-led Senate passed the bill by unanimous consent, without a roll-call vote. Passage sends the measure to the Democratic-led House of Representatives, which must approve it before it is sent to the White House for Trump to sign into law or veto.
The Senate move comes amid steadily worsening relations between the Trump administration and Beijing over the global COVID-19 pandemic, which Washington has blamed on China's lack of transparency about the initial outbreak there. [L1N2CW0TS]
China denies mishandling the outbreak and has condemned moves to pass legislation in support of the Uighurs as malicious attacks and a serious interference in its internal affairs that would affect bilateral cooperation.
The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps in China's Xinjiang region in recent years. China denies mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps provide vocational training. 
In November, the U.S. House overwhelmingly approved a bill calling for sanctions against senior Chinese officials responsible for the Xinjiang crackdown and specifically named the region's Communist Party secretary, Chen Quanguo, who, as a Politburo member, is in the upper echelons of China's leadership.
The Senate bill also mentions Chen, as well as Xinjiang's former deputy party secretary, Zhu Hailun, as bearing direct responsibility for the abuses.
China has warned in the past of retaliation ""in proportion"" if Chen were targeted.
Its embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Senate move.
The Senate bill also calls on U.S. companies or individuals operating in the Xinjiang region to take steps to ensure their supply chains are not ""compromised by forced labor"" there. 
Rubio co-sponsored a separate bill in March aimed at preventing goods made from forced labor in Xinjiang from reaching the United States.
Republican James Risch, who chairs the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, and its senior Democrat, Bob Menendez, called Thursday's move ""an important step in countering the totalitarian Chinese government’s widespread and horrific human rights abuses.""

They urged the House take up the legislation quickly and send it to the president to be signed into law.

470,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 08:43PM ET</span>","Without wearing a mask, Trump tours Pennsylvania mask distribution center","By Steve Holland
ALLENTOWN, Pa. (Reuters) - Without wearing a face mask himself, President Donald Trump toured a mask distribution center in Pennsylvania on Thursday and announced plans to replenish the U.S. strategic stockpile of medical equipment depleted by the coronavirus outbreak.
Trump, a Republican who is running for re-election in November, has resisted wearing a mask in public despite his administration's guidance to Americans to wear them and new White House rules requiring that staff wear them at work. 
The president toured the Owens & Minor Inc distribution center, which the White House said has sent millions of N95 masks, surgical gowns and gloves to hospitals and surgery centers across the United States. Company officials wore masks.
Trump visited a mask production facility in Arizona last week, when he also did not wear a face covering, though he said he tried some on backstage.
Pennsylvania is a political swing state wooed by both Republicans and Democrats in presidential elections. Though the Thursday event was arranged by the White House, it had campaign overtones, with music similar to what is played at Trump's rallies and a pejorative reference by the president to his expected Democratic challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden.
Trump accused the Obama administration of allowing the stockpile to be depleted. Trump has been in office for three years; the coronavirus outbreak started hitting the United States earlier this year.
Trump said his administration would seek to have three months' worth of supplies on reserve rather than one to three weeks' worth.
""I'm determined that America will be fully prepared for any of the future outbreaks, of which we hope there's going to be none,"" he said during remarks after his tour. 
The president has previously sought to downplay the possibility of the coronavirus returning in the fall, though doctors have said it is very likely.
A senior administration official told reporters earlier on Thursday that the Trump administration was seeking to add 300 million N95 masks, the respiratory protective devices that are key to protecting medical workers fighting the deadly coronavirus, to the U.S. stockpile by the fall.
The official said the administration hoped ultimately to replenish its strategic national stockpile, which had only 13 million N95s at the beginning of the outbreak, to 1 billion in total. 

The administration is seeking to shore up medical supplies as part of a bid to prepare for future flare-ups of coronavirus cases, as states nationwide begin to reopen after lockdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the virus.

A dozen Estonian border guards removed all signs directing vehicles to stop at the border and huddled together at the roadside for cake and coffee. 
""We have the little celebration because the border is now open again"", officer Martin Maestule told Reuters on Friday just after midnight as the first cars sped through on the reopened main road of the region.
Citizens and residents of the three generally sparsely populated Baltic nations are now free to travel within the region, though anyone entering from outside will need to self-isolate for 14 days.
""The Baltic Travel Bubble is an opportunity for businesses to reopen, and a glimmer of hope for the people that life is getting back to normal,"" Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis said in a statement.
The Baltic neighbours opened as the EU executive seeks to coax the 27 member states to reopen internal borders and restart wider travel, albeit with safety measures such as requiring people to wear face masks on airplanes.
New coronavirus infections in the three Baltic republics have slowed to a trickle with none of the countries reporting more than seven new cases on Wednesday. Authorities have loosened lockdowns since late April.
The region as a whole has recorded fewer than 150 deaths from the disease - far below individual larger euro zone countries such as Italy, Spain, France or Germany. 
""The Baltic states are close partners, have a similar epidemiological situation and their economies are well integrated, so the free movement of people as well as goods is very important for the region,"" said Arnoldas Pranckevicius, the European Commission representative in Lithuania.
""Opening the borders is up to the member states, and the European Commission expects them to talk to each other, to coordinate their actions and to not discriminate against nationals of other EU members.""
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - the three poorest members of the euro zone - expect their economies to shrink by 7-8 percent this year, in line with the rest of the currency union. Lithuania has warned of a ""double digit"" drop if economies are not reopened by the summer.
Estonia has given an emergency loan of 100 million euros ($108 million) to Baltic Sea (NYSE:SE) shipping firm Tallink, badly hit by the region's lockdowns, while Lithuania is setting up a state-run facility to provide loans or assume assets of key companies if they do not survive the crisis.
The Baltic countries were quick to close their borders and impose lockdown measures to slow the spread of the virus.
""There is no reason to fear that opening the border will cause the spread of the virus,"" Estonian Interior Minister Mart Helme said.
Travel restrictions were eased between Finland and Estonia, as well as between Poland and Lithuania this week but only for those on the move for business or education.
But neither Poland nor Finland are rushing join the full ""travel union"" with their Baltic neighbours as yet, despite an invitation to do so.
""At first glance, I think that, for instance, Poland and Finland would be logical and potentially good candidates,"" Latvian Prime Minister Krisjanis Karins said.

Poland and Finland have also reported relatively low numbers of coronavirus infections and deaths.

ATLANTA (Reuters) - Hopes of finding a new witness in the case of an unarmed black jogger whose fatal shooting in Georgia triggered a national outcry were dashed Thursday afternoon.
The note found at the memorial of Ahmaud Arbery reading ""I should have stopped them"" was left by a person ""expressing their condolences"" and not a new witness in the case of the jogger who was shot after being chased by an ex-cop and his son, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) said in a Twitter post.
""We received numerous tips and inquiries related to this and wanted to be sure to update the public.""
The community and the family of Arbery, 25, saw the note, which drew national media attention, as a potential sign of new evidence, said James ""Major"" Woodall, Georgia state president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).
""The main thing was that we wanted this preserved and examined by law enforcement,"" said Woodall. ""It was potential new evidence.""
A GBI spokesperson did not respond to phone calls or emails seeking additional comment.
BLACK LIVES MATTER
The single-page, unsigned note was discovered earlier this week by a television news crew at the memorial, set up in the victim's hometown of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), about 300 miles (480 km) southeast of Atlanta.
More two months after the Feb. 23 slaying, a white former law enforcement officer and his son, who were seen on the video chasing the 25-year-old jogger, were arrested last week and charged with aggravated assault and murder.
The shooting was reminiscent of a spate of killings of black men in recent years that involved white police officers or former officers. Outrage over the killings and the response to them by the U.S. criminal justice system led to the formation of the Black Lives Matter movement and national protests. 
""Ahmaud - I am so sorry. I should have stopped them. I am so sorry,"" the note reads in full. It was posted on the internet by multiple media outlets.
The two suspects, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, were arrested and charged on May 7, after the local district attorney asked the Georgia Bureau of Investigation to probe the case.
Their arrests came just days after the release of the video, which set off the national furor led by civil rights activists and celebrities.
The video was taken by William ""Roddie"" Bryan, who told the police he was a bystander and uninvolved.
The U.S. Department of Justice has launched an inquiry on why charges were not brought sooner and whether to charge the suspects with federal hate crimes.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Hundreds of Venezuelans seeking to return home gathered in a makeshift tent camp outside their embassy in Santiago on Thursday, as the coronavirus outbreak spurs a reverse migration wave of those who fled their crisis-stricken country in recent years.
Cases of the coronavirus have spiked in the past week in Chile, prompting increasingly tough lockdown measures that have left many out of work and Chile's once stable economy in tatters.
Venezuelan immigrant Iramairys Chacón told Reuters she had previously cleaned houses and worked as a nanny to support her 3-year-old son. Now, she was unemployed and homeless.
""I owed two months of rent... so they evicted me,"" she said as she waited outside the Venezuelan embassy in a posh Santiago neighborhood. ""I am desperate.""
Chacon was one of at least 400 that had gathered outside in the tent camp and on mattresses on a leafy street beside the embassy, as well as in a church storage building nearby.
Venezuela's economic collapse unleashed the biggest migratory crisis in recent South American history. But thousands of migrants from Colombia to Ecuador to Chile have sought to return home in recent weeks, finding that the often informal jobs they do in service and retail sectors have dried up during coronavirus-related lockdowns.
Alejandro Parada, who described himself as a spokesman for the group, said an embassy worker told them Caracas was aware of their plight, and would alert them to any available flights back to Venezuela. Most travel in the region has been suspended.
""She told us... that we have to wait because Venezuela's borders are closed, so it is difficult to send a plane here,"" Parada said.
Venezuela's Communication Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Parada said there had be no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the group that had gathered outside the embassy. But as the southern hemisphere winter approaches in Santiago, he said many were on edge.
In early May, the Venezuelan foreign ministry said it planned to bring home citizens from countries throughout South America. Since then, the crowd outside the embassy in Santiago has grown by the day, city officials said.
Parada acknowledged the situation in Venezuela was difficult, but said it was better to be home in times like these. 
""You have your family, your loved ones,"" he said.

(Reuters) - The beaches and boardwalks of the New Jersey shore, made famous by the music of Bruce Springsteen, will reopen for Memorial Day weekend as the state that was among the hardest hit by the coronavirus emerges from lockdown, Governor Phil Murphy said on Thursday.
While beachgoers will need to keep their distance from one another, opening the Jersey shore in time for the traditional May 23-25 start of summer will enable to the state to fire up a key economic engine and showcase one of its crown jewels.
""The Jersey Shore, after all, is where memories are made,"" Murphy said at his daily press briefing. ""The last thing any of us wanted was for a summertime down the shore to be a memory.""
The state's ban on gatherings of more than 10 people and six-foot (1.83 m) social distancing requirement will remain in effect except for families, couples and household members, Murphy said.
""We highly recommend that you wear a face covering, particularly when social distancing is difficult to maintain, such as waiting in line for a slice of boardwalk pizza,"" he added. 
The move, following, the limited reopening of non-essential retail stores planned for Monday, was made in coordination with more than two dozen shore-community mayors who actually control beach access, Murphy said.
The neighboring states of Connecticut, New York and Delaware, all of which have beach communities, were also consulted, Murphy said.
New Jersey's oceanfront and boardwalks were the setting for the reality TV show ""Jersey Shore"" and the 1920s gangster series BoardWalk Empire, received worldwide notice in several songs recorded by Springsteen, a native son who referenced many of its landmarks in his songbook.
The shore towns that dot the state's 130-mile (209 km) coast between the lighthouses at Sandy Hook and Cape May are ""a tremendous driver of local jobs and revenues,"" Murphy said.
Small business owners who had been pressing for the reopening, were cheered by the decision, according to Leonard Desiderio, an elected official of Cape May County and mayor the Sea (NYSE:SE) Isle City.
""In Cape May, and particularly in Sea Isle, they are now waving to me with five fingers,” said Desiderio, who was with Murphy at his briefing.

Although several key coronavirus measures show the outbreak abating recently, New Jersey is still second only to New York in infections and total deaths, and leads the country in its rate of COVID-19 hospitalizations and newly reported deaths.

The bombing in the Montecristo rural area of Bolivar province was a joint operation between the air force, army troops and the police, Defense Minister Carlos Holmes Trujillo said.
""Alias 'Mocho Tierra' was considered a high-value target and was involved in the planning and execution of terrorist acts against the civilian population and the armed forces,"" Trujillo said.
The leader, whose identity was not disclosed, was an ELN member for nearly three decades and participated in a 1999 kidnapping of airline passengers.
He was in charge of drug trafficking and illegal mining in the region that generated monthly revenues of about 4 billion pesos ($1 million), Trujillo said.
The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union, declared a unilateral ceasefire during April in what it said was a humanitarian gesture amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The group renewed attacks following the ceasefire, with the army blaming it for a series of bombings against oil pipelines.
The ELN, which has some 2,000 combatants, has repeatedly requested peace talks with the government of President Ivan Duque, who has refused to begin negotiations unless the group halts all kidnappings, forced recruitment of minors and the use of landmines.
The guerrillas have held unsuccessful talks with previous governments, but Duque called off dialogue after a rebel attack on a police academy in January 2019 killed 22 cadets.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations is looking at different ways to hold its 75th annual gathering of world leaders - traditionally held in New York City - because ""we're not going to have business as usual in September,"" a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday. 
New York City is an epicenter for the global coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes the respiratory illness COVID-19 and has killed hundreds of thousands of people globally.
""It's hard to imagine that the traditional General Assembly with thousands and thousands of people descending on New York and on the U.N. compound can be held this September as if nothing happened,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said. 
Dujarric was responding to questions about an interview given by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to Paris Match. Guterres said it was ""unlikely"" the United Nations could bring together in New York thousands of people from around the world.
""We are studying different alternatives that digital technology offers to enable us to hold this General Assembly which would correspond to the 75th anniversary of the U.N.,"" Guterres said. ""It will be up to the member states to decide.""

VISAKHAPATNAM, India (Reuters) - A clogged cooling system was the likely cause of a temperature surge in a storage tank which led to a gas leak at a chemical plant in India, killing 12 people, three state government investigators told Reuters. 
They said workers at LG Polymers, a unit of South Korea's LG Chem near the southern city of Visakhapatnam, did not use a warning system to alert local residents but informed company management after the leak in the early hours of May 7.
The three investigators asked not to be named as they are not authorised to publicly discuss the investigation, launched by the government of Andhra Pradesh state.
LG Polymers said the situation at the plant was now under control but it, and LG Chem, did not respond to detailed questions from Reuters for this article.
About 800 people taken to hospital after the leak, and some were asleep when gas drifted over their homes. Police have filed a culpable homicide complaint against LG Polymers.
When a Reuters witness visited the Venkatapuram village adjoining the plant on Tuesday, leaves on trees exposed to the gas looked shrivelled and had turned brown.
The Andhra Pradesh state government declined to give any details of its investigation. 
The three investigators said the temperature inside the oldest of the three storage tanks holding styrene monomer, a raw material used in polystyrene products, rose to over 150 degrees Celsius (302°F), more than six times the permitted level.
""The chiller unit was clogged because of a polymerization process, which occurs when temperature exceeds certain levels,"" one of the officials said. 
    To slow the polymerization process, a chemical reaction that generates heat, styrene monomer must be stored at 20-30 degrees Celsius with a cooling system and chemical compounds, or inhibitors, typically used to keep temperatures under control. 
If unchecked, the heat generated from the polymerization process causes the chemical to vaporize.
But the cooling system was clogged and the likely cause of the blockage was a chemical reaction inside the tank holding the styrene monomer, the three investigators said.
The skeletal workforce at the facility overnight was unable to bring the situation under control, they said.
""When temperatures started rising, the staff at the plant were not able to use the cooling system,"" one said. 
    LG Polymers said in a statement on Thursday that it planned to ship remaining styrene monomer inventories to South Korea.
""The team of production, environment, and safety experts are currently investigating the cause of the incident,"" it said.
The team would work with authorities ""to analyse the cause of the incident, prevent a recurrence, and support damage recovery.""
RAPID ESCALATION
Company officials told investigators the temperature within the storage tank was in the allowed range till temperature rapidly rose early on May 7, the three officials said.
    Experts say it generally takes weeks for the temperature in a Styrene monomer storage to rise to up to 65 degrees, before a runaway polymerization process occurs, leading to the liquid chemical reaching its boiling point of 145 degrees in minutes. 
    But conditions in parts of a storage tank - such as corners or the surface - could provide an environment or ""localized hotspots"" where the process can accelerate, and subsequently lead to a rapid escalation in temperature.
One of the officials said they were investigating the possibility of a localized hotspot at the surface.
Control operations were hampered by a lack of inhibitors to slow a runaway polymerization process in the event of a cooling system failure, two other investigators said.
The factory had been in the process of re-opening after a weeks-long nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus. 
Workers said they first noticed a dense vapour near the base of one of the plant's three storage units and sprinkled water on it, but minutes later spotted thick smoke coming out of the top of the same storage unit. 
One of the investigators said the gas leak was a result of a lack of safety precautions. 

""It was clearly a crime of omission,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Chinese-born former employee of the Cleveland clinic was arrested on fraud charges related to $3.6 million in federal grants, the FBI said on Thursday, the latest move in a U.S. crackdown on alleged attempts by China to steal American scientific advances.
The FBI and other federal enforcement agencies searched the Shaker Heights, Ohio, home of Dr. Qing Wang, and arrested him on charges of false claims and wire fraud on Wednesday.
Prosecutors said Wang accepted grants from the National Institutes of Health without disclosing that he was serving at same time as dean of the College of Life Sciences and Technology at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology. That was a violation of the terms of the grants, they said.
They said Wang is a Chinese-born U.S. citizen specializing in genetics and cardiovascular disease who has been affiliated with the Cleveland Clinic since 1997.
""Dr. Wang deliberately failed to disclose his Chinese grants and foreign positions and even engaged in a pervasive pattern of fraud to avoid criminal culpability,"" said Eric Smith, head of the FBI's Cleveland office.
U.S. investigators say China and its citizens and operatives have long made extensive and aggressive efforts to steal unclassified American technology, ranging from military materiel to medical research, but U.S. agencies only launched a broad effort to stop alleged Chinese espionage in the United States in 2018.
The FBI alleged Wang was a participant in the Thousand Talents program, a scheme which U.S. officials say the Chinese government created to engage with individuals who had access to foreign technology or valuable data.
Investigators said that through Wang's participation in the Thousand Talents program, China provided $3 million in research support to enhance facilities and operations at the institutions he was affiliated with in China. 
The Cleveland Clinic said that it had fired Wang after learning of his failure to disclose his ties to China.
""Cleveland Clinic has cooperated fully with the NIH and with federal law enforcement as they conducted their own investigations into these same subjects and will continue to do so,"" it said in a statement.
In one of several recent cases involving alleged Chinese efforts to steal U.S. technology, a Harvard biology professor in January was accused of lying to the Pentagon and NIH about his involvement in the program.

A lawyer representing Wang declined immediate comment.

482,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 04:00PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. considers returning Cuba to list of state sponsors of terrorism - source,"By Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is considering returning Cuba to its list of state sponsors of terrorism, a senior Trump administration official told Reuters on Thursday, a move that would mark another major blow to increasingly tense relations between Washington and Havana.
There is a “convincing case” that Cuba should be placed back on the U.S. blacklist, in part because of its continued backing for socialist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and the refuge it gives to leaders of Colombia’s ELN rebel group, the official said.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the official did not rule out that a decision on Cuba’s re-listing could come by the end of the year.
In what was possibly a preliminary step, the Trump administration said on Wednesday it had put the Communist-ruled island back on a separate list of countries that do not cooperate fully with its efforts to counter terrorism.
Havana, which has long denied any link to terrorism, dismissed Wednesday's State Department announcement as ""spurious.""
Returning Cuba to the blacklist would be a further rollback of the detente that former President Barack Obama orchestrated between the old Cold War foes. His decision to formally remove Cuba from the terrorism list in 2015 was an important step toward restoring diplomatic ties that year.
Trump’s toughened stance on Cuba, as well as Venezuela, has gone down well in the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, an important voting bloc in a key political swing state as he seeks re-election in November.
Designation by Washington as a state sponsor of terrorism, which carries the potential for sanctions and trade restrictions, would put Cuba in the company of Iran, North Korea, Syria and Sudan.
CUBA'S ROLE IN VENEZUELA
Any decision to put Cuba back on the list would take into account Havana's support for Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries. The U.S. government indicted him and much of his inner circle in March on charges of ""narco-terrorism"" conspiracy, corruption and drug trafficking.
The United States and dozens of other nations recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president last year. But Maduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet, remains in power, backed by Venezuela's military as well as Russia, China, Cuba and Iran.
Some U.S. officials have said privately that this has been a growing source of frustration for Trump.
The senior official said the U.S. government was also considering designating several of Venezuela's security services as terrorist organizations, in part for alleged links to drug trafficking. Those include the national intelligence service, the military counterintelligence agency and elite police unit, in addition to paramilitary groups loyal to Maduro.
The deliberations on whether to re-list Cuba are focused heavily on legal questions required to justify naming a country a sponsor of terrorism, the official said. 
Also figuring into the discussions is Cuba's refusal of Colombia's request to extradite ELN leaders after the group claimed responsibility for an attack at a Bogota police academy in January 2019 that killed 22, the official said.
The leaders of the National Liberation Army (ELN), the largest active guerrilla group in Colombia, traveled to Havana as part of peace negotiations that collapsed last year after the car bomb attack.
Cuba has received broad plaudits in the past for hosting the successful peace talks between the Colombian government and the former FARC rebel army.
Another issue expected to weigh on Washington's decision is Cuba's harboring of several U.S. fugitives, some of whom have lived on the island for decades.
A re-listing of Cuba would have heavy symbolic meaning for Havana, which had chafed for decades under the U.S. designation.
It is unclear, however, how much practical impact there would be.
The designation carries a prohibition on U.S. economic aid, a ban on U.S. arms exports, controls on “dual-use” items with military and civilian applications, and a requirement that the United States oppose loans to Cuba by international financial institutions such as the World Bank and International Monetary Fund.

But many of those restrictions are already in place - or have even been tightened by Trump - and a decades-old U.S. economic embargo remains and can only be lifted by Congress.

KIEV (Reuters) - Lying in rows of cots in a small hotel on the outskirts of Kiev, 51 babies born to surrogate mothers are stranded in Ukraine as the coronavirus lockdown is preventing parents from the United States, Europe and elsewhere from collecting them.
Ukraine imposed a ban on foreigners entering in March, and most parents have only seen their newborns through pictures and video calls with the clinic. 
Rafa Aires from Spain managed to get in before the lockdown. He was united with his daughter Marta but cannot leave as Kiev has suspended almost all flights and he needs to finish the paperwork. 
It means a stressful wait for his wife Maria, who was unable to travel with him due to work. 
""Every day I make video calls with my wife for one hour or an hour and a half for her to see the baby,"" he said. ""It is very difficult.""
""Nurses and medical personnel in this hotel are wonderful. They make my life easier,"" he said.
The government says it can only permit parents to enter Ukraine if it receives a request from the relevant embassy. 
The Hotel Venice belongs to the clinic BioTexCom, which released video footage of the babies to raise public awareness and spur the government into acting more quickly.
Reaction from the authorities was swift. 
Lyudmyla Denisova, the human rights ombudsman for the Ukrainian parliament, said the video showed the country had a ""massive and systemic"" surrogacy industry where babies were advertised as a ""high quality product"". 
She suggested looking into changing the law to allow only Ukrainian parents to use such services. 
""We were prepared for this negative reaction,"" the clinic's founder Albert Tochilovsky said. ""Given that parents need to be quarantined for 14 days, I want to speed up the process.""
Denisova ordered checks on the clinic but said she found that BioTexCom was following all procedures correctly. Surrogacy is legal in Ukraine. 
The Hotel Venice is surrounded by a high fence with barbed wire. The building is usually where parents stay while picking up their babies. At BioTexCom, a surrogate mother receives about $15,000-$17,000.
Parents arrive from all over the world including the United States, China, Britain, Sweden and Ireland. The parents of sixteen of the babies have been able to travel to Ukraine so far. 
""The children are all provided with food, a sufficient number of employees look after them, but there is no substitute for parental care,"" said Denis Herman, BioTexCom's lawyer.
""We try to send photos of children to the parents, we try to make conference calls, but this cannot replace communication in direct contact,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - China rejected on Thursday a planned push by the United States to extend a United Nations arms embargo on Iran and, if that fails, Washington's assertion that it could trigger a return of all sanctions on Tehran at the U.N. Security Council. 
U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, publicly confirmed the U.S. strategy on Wednesday, two weeks after a U.S. official, speaking on condition anonymity, said the United States had told Britain, France and Germany of its plan.
China's mission to the United Nations in New York said that by quitting the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, Washington had ""failed to meet its obligations"" under a 2015 Security Council resolution that enshrined the agreement. 
Tehran was given sanctions relief under the deal with the United States, Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France that prevents Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The deal - known as the JCPOA - allowed for a so-called snapback of sanctions, including the arms embargo, if Iran violated the deal.
China's U.N. mission posted on Twitter that the United States ""has no right to extend an arms embargo on Iran, let alone to trigger snapback. Maintaining JCPOA is the only right way moving forward.""
Under the nuclear deal, a U.N. arms embargo is due to expire in October. 
Hook said that the United States has drafted a Security Council resolution to extend the arms embargo on Iran. A resolution needs nine yes votes and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to be adopted.
Russia has already signaled its opposition to extending the arms embargo on Iran and the U.S. claim that it can trigger the return of all sanctions on Tehran.
U.S. President Donald Trump branded the accord from Barack Obama's presidency as ""the worst deal ever."" Washington argues it can trigger a return of U.N. sanctions because the Security Council resolution still names the U.S. as a participant.
Diplomats say the United States would likely face a tough, messy battle if it tries to spark a return of sanctions, though it was not immediately clear how or if a Security Council member could stop such a move.
Iran has breached several central limits of the deal, including on its stock of enriched uranium, in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of sanctions that have slashed Iran's oil exports. Britain, France and Germany are trying to save the deal, but have made little progress.

Israel - population nine million - has reported 16,579 cases of the novel coronavirus and 265 deaths. With the new case rate levelling out in the past few weeks, it has lifted bans on gatherings, eased travel and reopened malls and markets. 
A partial reopening of schools began on May 3, with the first three grades of elementary school and the last two grades of high school redistributed in classes capped at 15 pupils to enforce social-distancing. Kindergartens joined a week later. [L8N2CL042]
In a written statement, Netanyahu said that from Sunday all children, from the age of zero, may go back to school on a voluntary basis. Those in outbreak epicentres, however, would have to stay home for now. 
Under instructions to enforce social distancing, maintain proper hygiene and have children grade four and up wear face masks, it was up to municipalities to decide when each school in its jurisdiction was fully prepared to reopen, Netanyahu said.
Schools reopening full time could help the economy contend with the fallout of weeks of coronavirus lockdown, relieving working parents from having to stay at home and mind their children. 
More than 1.1 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, which would be equal to a jobless rate of about 27%. They include employees put on unpaid leave, some self-employed, as well as those who have lost their jobs entirely.

But in a statement later on Thursday, police denied holding the MDC members in their custody and said law enforcement agents wanted to interview the activists in connection with the protest that drew a few dozen people.
That has raised fears about the whereabouts and safety of the three in a country where activists often disappear and later turn up at police stations claiming to have been tortured.
""We demand their unconditional and immediate release,"" the MDC said in a statement.
The embassies of Britain, Canada and the United States and the European Union mission in Harare expressed concern via social media over the missing activists and said police should swiftly establish their whereabouts and wellbeing.
The Harare-based legal group Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights said it had approached the High Court on behalf of the families of the MDC activists to compel police to determine their whereabouts.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - People attending Masses in St. Peter's and other papal basilicas in Rome will have their temperature checked as part of measures to contain the spread of coronavirus, the Vatican said on Thursday.
It did not say when the new measures will take effect. Public Masses will resume in churches in Italy on Monday under strict conditions outlined in a protocol signed last week by Italy's bishops conference and the government.
St. Peter's is on Vatican territory and the other three papal basilicas - St. Paul's Outside the Walls, St. John's In Lateran and St. Mary Major - have sovereign, extra-territorial status and so technically are not part of Italy.
The new rules for churches in Italy include limiting numbers, distancing and masks but they do not impose thermal scanning, meaning the papal basilicas will have even stricter rules.
Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said thermal temperature scanning will be used at least during services on Sundays and religious feast days.
He said officials at each basilica will decide the maximum number of people who can safely enter and that Vatican police, Italian police and volunteers will control the flow.
Bruni did not say when the new provisions would take effect and when Pope Francis would next say a Mass from the main altar of St. Peter's.
He is due to say a private Mass on Monday at a side chapel where the St. Pope John Paul is buried, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of John Paul's birth.
Thousands of people usually attend major papal events in St. Peter's and the other basilicas but it is unlikely that those numbers will be allowed in again for some time.
The pope has been saying Masses in either an empty St. Peter's or the chapel in his residence and the faithful have been watching on television or the internet.
Technically, St. Peter's has remained open during the Italian lockdown, which began in early March, although only for private prayer and few people have entered because of increased security. 
It was still not clear when it and the other basilicas will be reopened to tourists.

Italian museums will reopen on Monday but the reopening of the Vatican Museums, which received 7 million visitors last year, will likely be further delayed while safety measures are put in place, according to a Vatican source.

Footage by Reuters showed people standing in miles-long queues on a dirt track near the Mooiplaas and Spruit informal settlements on the outskirts of the capital Pretoria.
The Spruit Community Support Forum, a diverse group of religious, charity and community organisations, gave out around 10,000 bags of maize meal, vegetables, face masks, soap and sanitisers.
Charity workers asked people to keep a metre apart, separating men and women into different queues. In late April they distributed 8,000 food parcels in the same place.
Mating Molise, a 31-year-old mother of two, said times were hard. ""Things are very tough, I can't do anything because no one is working,"" she said.
Many people from Mooiplaas and Spruit are from nearby southern African countries, meaning they don't always qualify for government aid, non-governmental organisations say.
Edmore Mhlanga, a 34-year-old from Zimbabwe who worked for a construction company before the coronavirus struck, said: ""Life is difficult here at the squatter camp, it's hunger only.""
Africa's most industrialised nation has recorded 12,739 cases of the coronavirus and 238 deaths, far fewer than many countries in badly affected continents like Europe, partly because of the tough restrictions in place.
President Cyril Ramaphosa said on Wednesday that the lockdown had prevented infections from rising uncontrollably and health facilities from being overwhelmed.

He acknowledged that the restrictions had brought great hardship and said his government would support those in need.

LONDON (Reuters) - London's ""Square (NYSE:SQ) Mile"" financial district said it will close some streets to cars to create more space for pedestrians and cyclists so that workers can observe social distancing when the coronavirus lockdown is lifted.
Britain began easing restrictions this week but said people who can work from home should continue to do so, as most financial sector staff have been doing since March.
The financial district is home to the Bank of England, the London Stock Exchange and Lloyd's of London insurance market, and many of its pavements are too narrow for the 522,000 people who work there to maintain safe social distancing, a report for City of London councillors said.
It proposed widening pavements, and shutting some roads to cars completely or during business hours, which a panel of the City's councillors approved on Thursday.
""While most people who work in the Square Mile can work from home it is likely that people will begin travelling to work over the coming weeks,"" the report said.
""Any meaningful return to the workplace will need to be primarily by walking, cycling and public transport.""
But 74% of commuter journeys to the City are longer than 10km (6 miles), making public transport the only feasible option for many, the report said.
Separately, London's transport system said it was increasing services over the next week but capacity would be cut to about 15% to maintain social distancing for passengers.
Furthermore, Britain's Financial Conduct Authority reiterated this week that only a limited number of staff designated ""key workers"" can go to the office for now.
Bankers said this week that some staff could be working from home for up to a year before they return to the City or Canary Wharf, London's other financial district.

ZURICH (Reuters) - As Europe gingerly eases its coronavirus lockdowns, many governments are scrambling to buy antibody tests to find out how many of their citizens were infected, in the hope that will help them craft strategies to avoid a second wave of COVID-19 cases. 
But exactly how - or even if - the information will be of use remains unclear, raising the risk that public funds and government time are being wasted.
Switzerland, home of diagnostics powerhouse Roche which has developed its own COVID-19 antibody test, is one of the countries holding back from the dash to place orders. 
""The government up to now has not bought any antibody tests,"" a Federal Health Ministry spokesman told Reuters on Thursday. 
""Their ability to inform us remains simply too uncertain for them to be part of an easing strategy,"" he said, referring to the relaxation of restrictions, such as on free movement. 
That hasn't stopped makers of antibody tests including Roche, U.S. rival Abbott, Germany's Siemens Healthineers, as well as Chinese suppliers, from receiving a flurry of orders and expressions of interest from governments. 
On Thursday, Britain announced it was talking to Roche about getting hundreds of thousands of its tests per week, describing them as a potential ""game changer"".
That's after Germany said last week the Swiss drugmaker would sell it three million tests in May and five million a month thereafter. 
So concerned about its ability to secure supplies, Finland is making its own tests. 
The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) initially began using tests from ""a European vendor"" it declined to name, but switched strategy on learning the supplier couldn't guarantee timely delivery for 30,000 tests it wanted this year.
""Availability was questionable so we couldn’t continue down that road,"" THL's chief researcher Arto Palmu told Reuters, adding initial assessments of the accuracy of its domestic version judged it ""at least as good"" as commercial options.
BEING FAIR
Antibody tests are designed to detect immune-system proteins that people develop in response to an infection, and which typically are a sign of some protection against catching the disease again.
Accuracy, or specificity, is everything, however, since false-positive tests could give people a false sense of security if they believe they had the disease and have some immunity, when in fact they may never have been infected. 
The United States had to tighten rules on the tests it allowed, for fear of fraud under initially lax regulations meant to speed assays to market.
Roche has said its tests have 99.81% specificity.
Abbott has said the specificity and sensitivity of its test are 99.5% and 100% respectively. 
Italy's DiaSorin has said its Liason XL test has 97.4% sensitivity and 98.5% specificity.
There are other tests out there, too.
Denmark, one of Europe's first countries to re-open schools, on Monday started its first antibody study, which includes testing 2,600 people, using a kit from China's Wantai. 
The Dutch Health Ministry said on May 5 it had ordered one million kits, also from Wantai. 
Italy has picked Abbott to supply 150,000 kits.
Roche declined to comment on differences in numbers of tests being delivered to various countries, but said its goal was to be ""fair"". 
It does not want to become embroiled in a political row like Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA did when it said the United States would be the first to get its COVID-19 vaccine, should it prove successful.
""We have one price for the test worldwide,"" a Roche spokesman said. ""We are working with customers, non-profit and government organizations and regulatory bodies to make sure our tests have the greatest patient and community impact."" 
A Siemens Healthineers spokesman said there were currently several large national tenders for mass antibody testing ongoing in which the company was participating.
'NO EVIDENCE' 
Not all countries are quite so far along. 
In Hungary, for instance, a government spokesman said on Thursday it had no information about plans to do broad antibody testing.
Cillian De Gascun, head of Ireland's national virus laboratory, told a news conference the country was evaluating and validating tests and, if all goes well, could have some by June. 
But being slow off the mark may not be disadvantage, as there is currently little agreement over what countries should do with the information provided by the tests. 
Some, such as Chile, have floated the idea that ""immunity passports"" - potentially allowing free movement - could be issued to those who have had COVID-19 and recovered, given they may be protected from re-infection.
But the World Health Organization has cautioned against such passports, saying there was ""no evidence"" people who have recovered from the virus cannot catch it again.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn also said last week the idea of confining people just because they don't have specific antibodies raised ethical questions. 

For Switzerland, the strategy is the same as in countries such as South Korea and Taiwan that have had some success in containing COVID-19 - test anyone who shows symptoms, trace everybody who has been in contact with an infected person, and require them to isolate until they are clearly free of disease.

491,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Cabinet post disputes delay Israeli government inauguration,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The planned inauguration on Thursday of an Israeli unity government headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been postponed until Sunday, an official statement said, in last-minute wrangling over cabinet appointments.
Under a coalition agreement with his former election rival, centrist Benny Gantz, Netanyahu would serve as prime minister for 18 months before the former armed forces chief replaces him.
Their power-sharing deal ends more than a year of political deadlock in which three inconclusive elections were held and Netanyahu was indicted in three criminal cases on corruption charges he denies. 
Gantz agreed to delay the government's swearing-in ceremony to give Netanyahu more time to allocate cabinet posts to members of his Likud party, a joint statement said. 
Their pact split Gantz's centrist party, Blue and White. He cited the coronavirus crisis as a main reason for reneging on campaign promises not to partner with a prime minister under a corruption cloud.
The unity agreement would leave Netanyahu in power throughout a trial due to begin on May 24, the first such proceedings against a sitting Israeli prime minister, enabling him to maintain a powerful public pulpit in fighting back against what he has termed a political witch-hunt.
It also opens the way for the right-wing Netanyahu to move ahead with a pledged de facto annexation of territory in the occupied West Bank - land that the Palestinians seek for a state and which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Netanyahu has set July 1 as a starting point for cabinet discussions on his plan to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank. He has given no stated deadline for implementing the move.
Annexation, vehemently opposed by the Palestinians who have urged international sanctions against Israel in response, would be certain to heighten tensions in the West Bank and Gaza that could ignite violence and draw international outrage. 
On an eight-hour visit to Israel on Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in an interview with the Israel Hayom newspaper that West Bank territorial steps were an Israeli decision that Netanyahu had a right to make.
Pompeo noted, however, that the issue was complex and required coordination with Washington, which has formed a joint team with Israel to map out new territorial lines in the West Bank under a Middle East peace plan announced by U.S. President Donald Trump in January.

That proposal envisages the vast majority of West Bank settlements being incorporated into ""contiguous Israeli territory"".

The Court of Justice of the European Union was reviewing the case of two Afghan and two Iranian nationals who arrived in Hungary from Serbia in late 2018 and early 2019 and applied for asylum from the Hungarian Röszke transit zone on the Serbian-Hungarian border. 
Their asylum applications were rejected by Hungary, which ordered them to return to Serbia, but Serbia would not admit them. The asylum seekers appealed Hungary's bid to send them back to their countries of origin. 
""The conditions prevailing in the Röszke transit zone amount to a deprivation of liberty because the persons concerned cannot lawfully leave that zone of their own free will in any direction whatsoever,"" the court said.
""The placing of asylum seekers or third-country nationals who are the subject of a return decision in the Röszke transit zone at the Serbian-Hungarian border must be classified as 'detention',"" it said.
""If, following judicial review of the lawfulness of such detention, it is established that the persons concerned have been detained for no valid reason, the court hearing the case must release them with immediate effect,"" it said.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, one of the most vociferous opponents of immigration into Europe, won a third term in power in 2018. 
During the peak of the migration crisis in 2015 he had effectively sealed Hungary’s southern border with a fence. Hungary was a transit route for hundreds of thousands of migrants heading through the Balkans to western Europe.

493,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 12:30PM ET</span>",Why the United States might not open up to international travelers any time soon,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government largely shut down international travel to the United States in March with a series of rapid-fire moves, but restarting it will likely be a longer, more piecemeal process that could be complicated by rising tensions with China.
Even as President Donald Trump pushes for U.S states to begin reopening their economies, U.S. borders remain shut to travelers from China and Europe.
Any decision on easing travel restrictions will depend in large part on what safety protocols all countries put in place to limit the spread of the novel coronavirus and whether those countries in turn grant entry to Americans, U.S. officials told Reuters.
White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said last week that Trump and U.S. health officials were examining the issue of international travel but did not provide further details.
Trump implemented a temporary ban on most travelers coming from China, the source of the novel coronavirus outbreak, in January and put similar restrictions on travelers from Europe in March. The United States also halted nonessential travel across its shared borders with Canada and Mexico in March and suspended routine visa services in most U.S. consulates abroad.
Some U.S. airlines would like to resume limited service to China - a major market for them - in June, but the possibility of the Trump administration lifting travel restrictions will be complicated by China’s own restrictions on foreign carriers, according to a senior U.S. official who requested anonymity to discuss the matter. 
China limits foreign airlines to one flight into the country per week, and planes are only allowed to fly with 75% of passenger capacity.
Domestic politics may also influence which countries' travelers are first granted renewed access to the United States. While a nationwide regime of screening, testing and quarantine has vastly reduced the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in China, Trump and top aides have questioned the accuracy of information from China, angering Beijing.
China reported a far lower death toll from the virus than the United States and other hard-hit countries. It has denied allegations that it has suppressed important data.
A senior Department of Homeland Security official said DHS questions the accuracy of coronavirus-related information coming from Beijing but stressed that the United States could use its own intelligence to make a decision about travel restrictions.
The official also said U.S. business ties with China would factor in to any decision about whether to lift the restrictions.
RECIPROCITY 
The discussions within the Trump administration on how and when to reopen the United States to international travel have not yet crystallized into a plan, U.S. officials said, as the situation is still fluid and there are still fears of a resurgence of the virus in countries now reporting lower caseloads.
But Washington is clear on one thing - people from other countries should not be allowed into the United States if Americans still are not allowed to travel to those nations, the senior U.S. official said.
However, with the virus still rampant in the United States, which has the highest number of cases in the world, some countries may be hesitant to accept U.S. travelers any time soon.
The European Union on Wednesday pushed to reopen internal borders and restart travel, but recommended Europe’s external borders remain closed for most travel at least until mid-June.[L8N2CV2U0]
While there has been some talk in the administration of reopening borders to travelers from Europe first, officials are mindful that many of the initial infections in the United States originated in Italy.
“I think coordination between governments is going to be key,” Virginia Messina, managing director with the World Travel and Tourism Council, said. “You are going to need those bilateral agreements.”
When the United States restricted travel from Europe it was effectively a blanket ban. Unwinding that ban and replacing it with agreements with individual European countries could be a much longer process.
Lifting the restrictions will also require a series of choreographed steps by different U.S. government agencies.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the State Department will need to dial back travel advisories calling for Americans to avoid all international travel before the United States can allow in travelers from restricted countries, according to Lora Ries, a senior research fellow with the Heritage Foundation and former Trump administration homeland security official. 
The blanket advisory is likely to be replaced by more country-specific warnings, depending on the state of the pandemic in the relevant countries or region.
Restoring the flow of travelers into the United States could help boost the economy in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak. The Washington-based U.S. Travel Association estimated that spending by international travelers supported 1.2 million U.S. jobs and $33.6 billion in wages in 2019, economic activity that has been wiped out by the pandemic.
But the priority is to restore confidence in U.S. domestic air travel before turning attention to international travel, said Tori Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Barnes, an executive vice president with the U.S. Travel Association, a pro-industry nonprofit organization.

“I think that it will be a slow opening, unfortunately,” she said.

""The new government will have to work on recovering the economy, and we want to seek another term in office now. The epidemiological situation is favourable,"" Plenkovic said.
President Zoran Milanovic must now officially call the parliamentary election. Possible dates for the vote include June 21 or 28, or July 5 or 12.
The most recent opinion poll showed the conservative Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), a senior partner in the current conservative-liberal ruling coalition, has the support of 30.2% of voters while the biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats, trail them with 27.8% support.
The poll suggests that the third force would be the nationalist and eurosceptic block Domovinski Pokret (The Homeland Movement) with 10.1% support.
The election was originally planned for the autumn, but the HDZ wants to bring it forward, citing the currently favourable situation related to the coronavirus pandemic. Croatia has so far reported 2,221 cases of the disease with 94 deaths.
Many observers believe the HDZ wants to take advantage of growing support among voters in recent weeks after Croatia managed to bring the spread of virus under control.

Due to COVID-19, Croatia, which relies heavily on tourism, expects its economy to contract 9.4% this year and then grow 6.1% in 2021.

Violence has flared in the territory in the past week in the run-up to the planned inauguration later on Thursday of a new Israeli ""unity"" government headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
Its agenda includes possible de facto annexation of Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, with cabinet deliberations on the move, vehemently opposed by the Palestinians, set to begin in July.
Palestinians seek to establish a state in the West Bank, land captured by Israel in a 1967 Middle East war, and regard Israeli settlements in the territory as illegal, as do many countries.
The military said that a vehicle driven by a Palestinian hit a soldier in a car-ramming attack at an army post outside Negohot settlement near the city of Hebron and that he was shot dead by another soldier. The injured soldier was taken to hospital.
The Palestinian Health Ministry first confirmed the driver's death, after the military originally said only that he had been ""neutralised"". There was no immediate Palestinian comment on the circumstances of the incident.
On Wednesday, Israeli soldiers shot dead a 15-year-old Palestinian in Fawwar refugee camp in the West Bank. The military said soldiers, on an arrest raid, had responded with live fire after being attacked with rocks and fire-bombs.
On Tuesday, a rock thrown from a rooftop in the West Bank village of Yabad killed an Israeli soldier taking part in an operation to detain suspected militants.
In a separate incident in the West Bank that day, a Palestinian was shot and wounded by police after he tried to stab security staff at a checkpoint, a police spokesman said.
There was no immediate official Palestinian comment on the Fawwar refugee camp or checkpoint incidents.

SAN CRISTOBAL/CARACAS (Reuters) - Since Venezuela went into its coronavirus lockdown, dozens of needy people have been lining up at a slaughterhouse in the western town of San Cristobal to pick up the only protein they can find for free: cattle blood. 
Mechanic Aleyair Romero, 20, goes twice a week. He lost his job at a local garage and says boxes of subsidized food from the government of President Nicolas Maduro arrive too slowly.
""I have to find food however I can,"" said Romero, holding a coffee thermos dripping with blood the slaughterhouse gives away.
Though cow's blood is a traditional ingredient for ""pichon"" soup in the Venezuelan Andes and neighboring Colombia, more people have been seeking it out since the COVID-19 crisis.
In a proudly carnivorous nation, few are happy about eating more blood instead of meat - a kilo of which costs about two times the monthly minimum wage.
Increased consumption of cattle blood is, like stripped mango trees, a striking symbol of hunger as Venezuela's economy, already suffering six years of hyperinflationary implosion, has been nearly shuttered in response to the pandemic.
Though numbers of reported deaths and cases from the virus appear modest, Venezuelans are suffering from the economic shutdown and delays in the state food distribution program known as CLAP, for years the most important source of food for many.
The situation is hitting the provinces hardest because distribution is tilted toward major cities including Caracas, according to nutrition-focused charity Citizenry in Action. 
The government has for years given the capital priority access to services including water and power.
In Caracas, 26.5% of families receive CLAP boxes, compared with only 4% of families in areas such as ""Los Llanos"" (The Plains) region, Citizenry in Action says.
""It's not the virus that's going to kill them, it's hunger,"" said Edison Arciniegas, director of the group.
Even before COVID-19, the United Nations called Venezuela one of the world's 10 worst humanitarian crises in 2019, noting that 9.3 million of the 30 million population consume insufficient quantities of food. 
Some 5 million people have migrated as a result, it says.
'SURVIVING ON BLOOD' 
Maduro's leftist government blames the problems on U.S. sanctions meant to force him from power, and says international aid agencies exaggerate the extent of migration. The information ministry did not reply to a request for comment. 
Official figures show Venezuela has 440 cases of coronavirus and 10 deaths - though critics believe there are more.
Soup kitchens describe a big increase in use since the quarantine began in mid-March and delays in food box deliveries, which in many cases come every six to seven weeks rather than monthly as promised at the start of the programs in 2016.
The government sends boxes ""whenever it wants,"" said Romero.
At a soup kitchen in the poor Caracas neighborhood of Carapita run by the Feeding Solidarity group, workers say they were accustomed to providing meals for 80 children but under quarantine are now also feeding some 350 adults.
Upon receiving a bowl of soup and a ham-and-cheese sandwich, some mothers remove part of the ham and cheese for their children to have for breakfast the following day. They, too, complain the state food boxes are slow and meager.
""It's not enough for us to get through this,"" said Ysimar Pernalete, 38, a mother-of-two, of the CLAP boxes. 
""How can you tell a child 'I don't have anything to give you'? You give them rice without anything else and they cry.""
The government in 2016 began distributing food directly to millions of Venezuelans in what authorities said would prevent merchants from overcharging for good. 
Critics call it a social control mechanism that allows the government to limit dissidence and protest.
At the San Cristobal municipal slaughterhouse, thirty to forty people arrive every day to request cattle blood, according to one employee, who recalled that blood would be thrown away back in more prosperous times.
""We're going hungry,"" said Baudilio Chacon, 46, a construction worker left unemployed by the quarantine measures as he waited to collect blood at the slaughterhouse.
""We are four brothers and a 10-year-old boy, and we're all surviving on blood.""

498,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 11:47AM ET</span>",Booking apps and electronic tags? Italy's beaches seek to salvage summer,"By Antonio, Parrinello, Stephen Jewkes and Giulio Piovaccari
TAORMINA/BOLOGNA/MILAN (Reuters) - Visitors to Italy's famous beaches could be in for a surprise this summer. Umbrellas will be spaced far apart, hand gel will be readily available and even electronic tagging and booking systems have been proposed.
These are just some of the changes resorts are considering to be able to reopen in time for the peak season, as the country slowly emerges from a strict lockdown imposed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
Despite the challenges, Claudio Ambrogetti, who has run Taormina's Il Delfino beach for the past 15 years, remains upbeat.
""This has been a difficult period for our city, but the beach establishments are ready to reopen as soon as we have the guidelines,"" he said.
Like many ""bagnini"", or beach managers, along Sicily's sun-drenched shores, he is hoping health protocols and distancing rules - which still need to be signed off before shutters can be lifted - will allow trade to start in June, even if it is likely to be local.
For small family beach businesses, many already cramped for space, proposals including a minimum 5 metres between umbrellas, one-way tourist-flow systems, hand gel dispensers and regular sanitization of restrooms could prove costly.
Italy, one of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic, began easing restrictions, but Italians are still not allowed to travel outside their regions and foreign travel has ground to a halt.
""We are ready to reopen, but if tourists do not come back, if borders are not reopened, and if hotels do not fill up, the costs of running a restaurant will be unsustainable,"" said Salvatore Parisi, owner of Baronessa, one of Taormina's top restaurants.
TOURISM VITAL TO ITALY
Brussels is pushing to reopen borders for summer tourism, but governments are likely to have to do so at different speeds.
Italy is heavily dependent on tourism, which accounts for 13% of GDP and employs around 13% of the workforce. It has been hit hard by the pandemic, which forced borders to close, restaurants and hotels to shut and airlines to ground flights.
Italy's National Tourism Agency Enit said it would take three years for the industry to recover to 2019 levels.
According to think-tank Nomisma, around 500,000 summer jobs could be at risk this year due to fallout from the virus, while 100 billion euros could be lost as holiday-makers stay away.
Italy's roughly 8,000 km-long coastline, home to around 11,000 beach businesses, accounts for 37% of tourist revenue. That share is much higher in islands like Sicily and Sardegna and the less wealthy south.
To date the south has escaped the level of damage suffered by regions in the north, where the virus first struck.
In the Isole Eolie area around Sicily there have been only a handful of cases and authorities there have called for the creation of a Safe Zone to help get tourists back.
Christian Del Bono, chairman of the area's hotel association Federalberghi, said town mayors had sent a letter to Rome to ask to set up tests and health protocols to screen flows.
""Noone's thinking of making money, our aim at this stage is simply not to go bankrupt,"" he said. 
NO MORE HUGGING
The rich northern region of Emilia Romagna earns some 13 billion euros from its closely-packed Riviera beaches near Rimini, around 70% of its tourist revenue. Beach owners there are fretting over their livelihoods.
""This business is all about shaking hands and hugging people. Now we'll have to make do with a little wave and a smile of the eyes over a mask,"" Danilo Piraccini told Reuters.
He has been running the Bagno Milano beach in Milano Marittima with his sister Silvana for years.
Piraccini is hoping to start by June. With foreign tourists virtually out of the picture and distancing rules set to eat into business, he expects some 60% less fare than last year.
Prices may have to rise but costs will go up too since he'll need more people to sanitize outbuildings, steward the beach and stop small children getting too close. Insurance costs could also rise if COVID-related risks are to be properly covered.
""But anyway we have to open even if it means losing money. We have no choice. The alternative is we lose clients,"" he said.
Tourism, like other industries, is looking for help.
The Italian government last month approved an emergency scheme to offer over 400 billion euros worth of liquidity and bank loans to firms hit by the coronavirus crisis.
On Wednesday Rome approved a further decree scrapping some tax payments scheduled for June.
But the beach business has traditionally been based on debt and cash flows, and some are concerned delays in processing state-backed loans from banks could create a shortfall. 
To manage flows, bagnini are being urged to consider solutions including booking systems and apps to assign time slots and electronic bracelets to count and control beachgoers.
To improve protection, one company has even offered to build plexiglass booths for beach owners to create safe spaces.

""We'll be coming up with a few innovative measures of our own but the plexiglass idea is out,"" said Piraccini. ""You may not get coronavirus, but you'll get everything else from sunburn to exhaustion.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The warring parties in Yemen have made ""significant progress"" toward agreeing a ceasefire, U.N. Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths told the Security Council on Thursday.
Griffiths made a renewed push for a truce in Yemen after a call by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' on March 23 for a ceasefire in global conflicts so the world can focus on fighting the coronavirus pandemic. 
He gave the government of Yemen and the Houthi group - who have been fighting for more than five years - draft proposals on a nationwide ceasefire, humanitarian and economic measures, and the urgent resumption of the political process.
""We have seen significant progress on these negotiations, in particular with respect to the national, nationwide ceasefire,"" Griffiths told the 15-member Security Council. 
""However, the ceasefire is part of the broader package that needs to be agreed in full. And differences remain on some of the humanitarian and economic measures in that package,"" he said.
Griffiths said those humanitarian and economic measures were also needed to combat the coronavirus ""which is spreading at an unknown rate, given very low levels of testing."" 
Around 80% of Yemen's population - 24 million people - need humanitarian aid and aid groups fear a catastrophic outbreak of the coronavirus given Yemen's shattered health system and the widespread hunger and disease after years of conflict.
Deputy U.N. aid chief Ramesh Rajasingham said there were so far 72 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, including 13 deaths. The new coronavirus causes the respiratory illness COVID-19 and has killed hundred of thousands of people globally.
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-allied Houthi group ousted President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government from the capital Sanaa in 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition in 2015 intervened in a bid to restore the government. 
""The people of Yemen are right to be frustrated about the slow pace of these negotiations. We all hope to see these negotiations soon come to a successful close,"" Griffiths said.

500,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 11:42AM ET</span>",Palestinians look to a digital future to connect with their past,"By Rami Ayyub and Stephen Farrell
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Virtual reality tours have replaced flag-waving rallies as Palestinians facing coronavirus restrictions create digital spaces to lament the loss of their physical homeland in 1948.
Cellphone apps and Zoom video chats are among the other online tools Palestinians are using to mark the Nakba, or ""Catastrophe"", when they and their descendants were forced from their villages or fled in the war that surrounded Israel's creation. 
The Nakba is generally marked on May 15 – the day after Israel's Independence Day in the western calendar. 
Last year Israeli troops wounded nearly 50 Palestinians during Nakba protests, but rallies were cancelled this year. In the West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas authorized digital activities to mark the anniversary.
While the Palestinians still have no state on the ground, many are finding new ways to remember their past and express their identity online.
Palestine VR, a free app, is one of several new tools that aim in part to connect millions of diaspora Palestinians with their forefathers' towns and villages, some of which now lie abandoned in Israel.
""Coming to Palestine is transformational, especially for Palestinians who aren't allowed to visit,"" said Ramallah-based Palestine VR founder Salem Barahmeh, 30, as he guided Zoom participants through the app's 47 virtual tours of Gaza, Jerusalem and the West Bank.
""We want to share Palestine with them, and help them feel and understand this place."" 
Majd al-Shihabi, a Palestinian refugee born in Syria, is part of a team that developed Palestine Open Maps, an interactive database of Palestinian villages and Jewish towns as they stood in 1948.
""Palestinians anywhere can see visual details of their villages, reinforcing our understanding of what Palestine was like before the exodus,"" Shihabi, 31, said from Beirut.
The new initiatives highlight a ""digital nation"" that has also formed around Palestinian culture, food and fashion, according to activists and entrepreneurs. 
Joudie Kalla, a Palestinian-British chef and author of Palestine on a Plate, says vigorous recipe debates amongst her 124,000 Instagram followers are evidence of a growing community. 
""No one can stop Palestinians from connecting on social media - even if it's impassioned discussion over whose village makes the best kibbeh,"" Kalla, 42, said from London, referencing a traditional Arabic meat pie. 
STATEHOOD ELUSIVE
Palestinians want a state in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip with East Jerusalem as its capital. Israel captured and occupied those territories in the 1967 Middle East war, later annexing East Jerusalem in a move not recognised internationally and withdrawing from Gaza in 2005.
In 2012, the U.N. General Assembly approved the de facto recognition of the sovereign state of Palestine. But full Palestinian statehood has remained elusive.
Many Palestinians abroad fear losing touch with their roots.
This has prompted ""fusion"" projects that are transforming Palestinian fashion staples like the keffiyeh - a black or red-and-white checkered scarf now available in multiple colours.
Clothing company Threads of Palestine makes keffiyeh tee-shirts, hoodies, and onesies for babies, sourcing fabric from the West Bank's last keffiyeh factory.
""The keffiyeh, it oozes with Palestinian culture,"" said manager Abed al-Aziz al-Karaki at Hebron's Hirbawi factory.

501,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>","Trump administration issues global maritime advisory on sanctions, with industry input","LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday issued guidelines to help ship owners and insurers avoid sanctions risk, that industry players and a senior State Department official said followed months of discussions with industry.
The guidelines, known as a Global Maritime Advisory, concern sanctions on Iran, North Korea and Syria. Three industry sources said global commercial players had argued that an initial plan, outlined in March by a senior State Department official, would have disrupted international trade.
""The United States remains committed to disrupting shipping activities by malign actors worldwide — including sanctions evasion and smuggling — which may facilitate criminal activity and threatens international peace and security,"" the State Department said in a release about the advisory.
The advisory was announced on March 9 by David Peyman, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of State. He said the advisory would among other things warn shippers not to turn off transponders and to not store Iranian oil. 
Peyman has since left that role to take another job at the State Department, four sources said. The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment about Peyman. 
A maritime source said the industry was concerned the original outline of the advisory, which encouraged ship captains to take photographs of parties conducting ship to ship transfers that would be available to certain authorities, would have run into legal issues. 
“One of the concerns we have is that the expectation that industry sectors should share personal data on suspicions of sanctions breaches will be problematic with data protection laws in Europe and elsewhere,” one maritime industry source said.

502,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 10:57AM ET</span>","As China pushes back on virus, Europe wakes to 'Wolf Warrior' diplomacy","By Luke Baker and Robin Emmott
LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Earlier this month, Europe's ambassador in Beijing submitted to Chinese censorship.
Seeking to mark an anniversary of the European Union's relations with China on May 6, he and the EU's 27 ambassadors co-wrote an opinion piece titled ""EU-China ties vital amid global crisis,"" for publication on embassy websites and in China Daily, an English-language newspaper controlled by the state.
""The outbreak of the coronavirus in China, and its subsequent spread to the rest of the world over the past three months,"" said the carefully orchestrated piece, had ""temporarily side-tracked"" plans for meetings. 
But in the China Daily version, the reference to the virus starting in China was deleted. 
The change emerged as the article appeared on EU embassy websites, causing alarm among representatives of member states. Diplomats said the ambassador, French diplomat Nicolas Chapuis, had not consulted his bosses in Brussels or his fellow envoys about the change. He had, the EU executive said on May 7, unilaterally decided to accept it, with ""considerable reluctance.""
Chapuis told a news conference the omission was ""regrettable;"" his boss, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, subsequently spoke out against censorship by China's state controlled media. Borrell also said that accepting the cut ""was not the right decision to take,"" though Chapuis kept his job. 
China Daily did not respond to requests for comment, but the paper's bureau chief in Brussels, Chen Weihua, responded to the EU ambassador on Twitter, saying, ""You did nothing wrong. I don't think those people should make a big fuss of the editing out of such a phrase.""
As the new coronavirus casts its shadow over geopolitics, the episode highlights concern among European diplomats over what they see as an increasingly conflictual relationship with Beijing. 
As China is seeking to control the damage the pandemic threatens to its global reputation, the government of President Xi Jinping is pushing hard to control the story from Berlin to Bratislava, diplomatic cables seen by Reuters and interviews with more than a dozen diplomats, advisers and officials show. 
In a campaign of increasingly assertive and at times aggressive diplomacy, China has sought to pressure European countries that criticise its handling of the outbreak, Reuters found. At a time when Europe's ties with the United States are already strained by President Donald Trump's 'America First' policy, the fallout from the coronavirus underscores how the EU is caught between two powers - needing both, but reluctant to side with either.
On the one hand, officials in Brussels and European capitals argue they need to show China that the European Union – the world's largest trading bloc and a wealthy market of 450 million consumers – won't be pushed around.
On the other, countries within Europe are rarely unanimous. States such as Germany have large trade relationships with China that they don't want to jeopardise. German manufacturers, for example, depend on China, Germany's biggest trading partner, to both supply components and to buy their cars.
""We don't have the structure or culture to reciprocate the assertiveness or use power plays like China,"" one diplomat said. ""The aim of European diplomacy since the Second World War has been all about finding a compromise. China doesn't necessarily look at things the same way at all.""
China's foreign ministry and its officials declined to respond to questions posed by Reuters for this story. The European Commission, the EU's executive body, declined to comment on the diplomatic contacts.
CREATE A NARRATIVE
This year was meant to be an important one for Sino-EU ties. Until the virus emerged in Wuhan in December, the EU had started to make progress with Beijing after tense summits in 2016 and 2017 ended without any joint declarations. Last year, the European Commission dubbed China an economic competitor and ""systemic rival.""
Beijing in April 2019 acquiesced for the first time on key issues such as equal treatment of European companies in China, after months of negotiations, according to senior EU officials. That accord was to be followed this year by an EU-China summit in Beijing and a meeting between Chinese leader Xi and EU national leaders in Leipzig, Germany, in September. 
But now, besides practical obstacles to such meetings from social distancing, both sides are pushing back against each other.
In China, the virus has compounded an already more pugnacious approach to international affairs - dubbed ""Wolf Warrior"" diplomacy in both Western and Chinese media - after two popular Chinese movies in which the action hero outguns and outsmarts nefarious U.S. special agents. 
Spurred by Xi's calls for the country to be more imposing, Chinese diplomats have pushed back against criticism of its handling of the outbreak, in every forum from social media to TV, newspaper op-eds, and diplomatic correspondence.
A striking example was on April 12, when the Chinese embassy in Paris posted an unsigned article on its website that suggested care workers in Western nursing homes had abandoned their jobs, leaving residents to die. China's ambassador in Paris, Lu Shaye, was summoned by the French foreign ministry and wrote a post saying ties between China and France remain strong, but did not withdraw the comments, which France rejected.
Chinese foreign ministry officials told EU diplomats that the issue was one for France and China, not the wider EU, and that ""it was now at an end,"" according to a diplomatic cable from the EU delegation in Beijing to Brussels from April 22. 
On April 26, China's embassy in France posted another article on its website complaining of ""China bashing"" and claiming that ""some Westerners are beginning to distrust liberal democracy."" The article said that ""in the response to the epidemic, socialism with Chinese characteristics has demonstrated its ability to concentrate resources in the service of great achievements.""
Janka Oertel, head of the Asia programme at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said China is transferring its domestic approach to controlling public perception to the diplomatic arena.
""China is desperately trying to get its coronavirus story out there and as far as it's concerned set the record straight,"" she said. ""It's trying to do what it does domestically, which is create a narrative and protect its reputation.""
DIVIDE AND RULE
Chinese diplomats have also approached German government officials to persuade them to make positive statements on how Beijing is handling the pandemic, a letter dated April 22 from the German interior ministry to a German parliamentarian Margarete Bause showed. 
The letter, reviewed by Reuters, said the diplomats had made individual contact with German officials to seek ""positive public statements about the coronavirus management of the People's Republic of China."" It said Germany had not complied.
And senior Chinese foreign ministry officials on several occasions pressured EU diplomats to block publication of an EU report analysing alleged Chinese disinformation online about the virus, according to documents seen by Reuters and diplomatic sources. The Chinese foreign ministry said the report would be ""very bad for cooperation,"" according to the April 22 EU diplomatic cable.
The internal version of the report, dated April 20 and reviewed by Reuters after parts were previewed by Politico, noted as a main finding that ""China has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image."" 
In the public version, published on April 24 as a ""snapshot overview,"" criticism of China was given less prominence. 
Top EU diplomat Borrell, called before the European Parliament on April 30 to explain the discrepancy between the versions, said there had been no watering-down, the published document was directed at a different public and while diplomatic pressures always exist, ""We have not bowed to anyone."" 
Beijing has long played on tensions between the EU's founding states and its newer, formerly Communist members, through a special contact group of mostly east European countries called the 17+1, in which China is the 1. China has promised billions of dollars to countries which otherwise rely on EU development funds or outside investment to build railways, roads, airports and power stations.
China's close relationships with such states make it harder for them to stand up to Beijing when Brussels wants them to, EU officials and diplomats say.
Even before the pandemic in the first two months of 2020, one diplomat said, Slovenia and Slovakia had requested help from the European Commission in pushing back against China's pressure to take its side on issues including human rights. He said the states had effectively sent the message: ""Help us: We don't have the political clout to stand up to the Chinese.""
Slovenia's foreign ministry said it had not sought such help, but did not know if others had. In a statement to Reuters, it said ""very intensive"" talks had been going on for an accord to be agreed at the EU-China summit which ""will balance out the relations between the EU and China."" Slovakia did not respond to a request for comment.
MASK DIPLOMACY
When COVID-19 hit Italy and Spain, two large and influential member states, fellow EU members such as Germany initially came under fire for offering scant help. But China sent hundreds of thousands of testing kits and facemasks to them and other countries.
Italy, in particular, has been grateful. A poll of 800 people in Italy, carried out by the SWG research institute between March 20 and April 12, showed more than 50% of Italians consider China a friendly country, while other polls have shown once-solid support for EU membership falling.
China's 'mask diplomacy' also spurred a dramatic change of tone from Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis. Before the pandemic, he had called for the removal of the Chinese ambassador after a threatening letter from the embassy over a Czech lawmaker's planned visit to Taiwan. 
But as COVID-19 infections spread, Babis raced to the airport to personally greet a planeload of medical supplies from China, and publicly thanked the ambassador he had wanted withdrawn. 
Babis said there was no connection between those actions. ""When I did not like the communication of the ambassador, I said so,"" he said in a statement to Reuters. ""The same way, I did not have any problem to thank him publicly when he did his share."" 
Not all responses have been as simple. Dutch, Spanish and other European authorities have questioned the quality of equipment sent - the Netherlands recalled some masks that had been distributed to hospitals on the grounds that they were not surgical, the Dutch health ministry said. 
China rejected such complaints, saying for example that faulty test kits in Spain were provided by a company without a proper licence that had nothing to do with government shipments.
SUMMITRY
In the EU headquarters in Brussels and in European capitals, discussions are underway about how to respond to China's toughening line.
Europe is intent on ensuring closer cooperation with Beijing on landmark issues like climate policy, especially after the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris climate accord. EU and Chinese representatives spoke on May 11 about opening up on trade. But there is little clarity on the diplomatic road.
The EU-China summit may take place on June 3, according to a European Commission planning note, but by video conference, rather than in person in Beijing. 
The last time China policy was discussed by the EU's 27 envoys in Brussels in March, Ireland's envoy expressed concern that China's ""huge propaganda machine"" may win the narrative on trade, cooperation and the summit, according to the minutes seen by Reuters.
France's representative to Brussels urged the EU to demand China be more transparent on such issues, as well as coronavirus. 

""We need to preserve our position,"" he said.

503,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 10:55AM ET</span>",Big police presence expected at Michigan protest of stay-at-home order,"By Michael Martina
(Reuters) - A demonstration protesting Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's stay-at-home order is set to take place on Thursday in the state capital of Lansing, with fears some might carry weapons inside the Capitol building.
Whitmer recently extended the state's stay-at-home order - one of the strictest in the United States - until at least May 28 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and the respiratory disease it causes, COVID-19.
The protest is organized by Michigan United for Liberty, which says it is a nonprofit with nearly 8,000 members, organized and formed in response to Whitmer's first stay-at-home order in April, which it views as unconstitutional.
Hundreds of protesters, some armed, gathered at Michigan's State Capitol building in Lansing on April 30 to protest against Whitmer's request to the state legislature to extend emergency powers to combat COVID-19.
The rally started on the statehouse steps with members of the Michigan Liberty Militia, who later moved inside the Capitol along with several hundred protesters and demanded to be let onto the House floor, which is prohibited. Some protesters with guns — which are allowed in the statehouse — went to the Senate gallery. 
In a joint news release, Michigan State Police (MSP) Col. Joe Gasper and Attorney General Dana Nessel said demonstrators should be safe and respectful and warned that refusing to obey law enforcement or brandishing a firearm with the intent to create fear in others could be subject to criminal prosecution.
""While our desire is to interfere as little as possible in demonstrations, we will not allow unlawful, threatening or intimidating behavior,"" Gasper said in a statement. ""Based on safety concerns expressed following previous demonstrations, attendees can expect to see an increased MSP presence on Thursday.""
The Republican-led legislature has declined to outlaw weapons inside the Capitol building, something the Democratic governor lamented in an interview on CNN on Wednesday.
""No one should have to go to work and feel intimidated,"" said Whitmer. ""Making the capitol a gun-free zone is important in making people feel they can do their job safely.""

Michigan had the fifth highest toll from COVID-19 in the United States as of Thursday, at 4,714 dead among its 48,021 confirmed cases.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Commuters squinted as they streamed into a bus station in the South African township of Soweto on a bright Thursday, but not because of the glare - they were being sprayed with a solution meant to fight the coronavirus. 
Filing one by one through a metal tunnel, they were hit with a cold mist containing a disinfectant supposed to kill the pathogen. Some recoiled as the fog hit their faces, while others spun around to get an even coating.
Scientists have cast doubt on the effectiveness of mass disinfecting against the pandemic. Some commuters, though, said it gave them peace of mind amid the bustle of the station. 
""I'm happy as long as they are trying to sanitise it, it shows ... they are doing something,"" said Bright Shabani, a 34-year-old merchandiser, who described going to work every day in the rush hour as traumatic. 
South Africa has recorded just over 12,000 cases of the virus, with 219 deaths. Thursday was the first day the booth was operating at the bus station as a pilot project, but similar installations are in use at other locations including a train station and a mine. 
Keen to show they are doing all they can to protect people, governments around the world have rolled out disinfectant tunnels, sprayed pavements with bleach and used drones to spray public spaces. 
But scientists say that while disinfectants can kill the coronavirus on surfaces, the sprays tend to degrade quickly, so these efforts are far less important than personal hygiene and social distancing. 
""Any individual who walks through a tunnel who is infectious, remains infectious on the other side of the tunnel,"" Kerrin Begg and Nandi Siegfried, of the University of Cape Town's college of public health medicine guidance team, said in a written response to questions.
They added that infected individuals will immediately begin to spread the virus again unless they follow guidance on hygiene and distancing. 
Vuyelwa Toni Penxa, managing director of Real African Works Industries, which makes the booths, said the fog they use is plant-based and tests have shown it is 99.9% effective against bacteria and other pathogens, including a virus similar to the novel coronavirus. 
The company is awaiting tests to prove its effectiveness on this strain, so while they can't yet be 100% certain, she was confident the tunnels could make a difference. 

""We are hoping to reduce the number of people that are infected,"" she said, adding however: ""No one solution can be prescribed to combat COVID-19.""

Protesters waved party and national flags and chanted ""resignation"" and ""mafia"", to express their frustration that the centre-right government of Prime Minister Boyko Borissov extended restrictions until June 14.
This is the first public protest after the Balkan country introduced a state of emergency two months ago that closed schools, restaurants and bars and prompted many businesses to limit or halt operations due to restrictions and reduced demand.
Bulgaria started easing the lockdown in late April, but still requires social distancing in public places and keeps its borders closed. 
The protest by the Vazrazhdane party, which has around 1% support nationally, was largely peaceful, but several people were detained when they tried to break through a police cordon around the country's parliament. 
The protesters accused the government of providing confusing information and incompetent handling of the COVID-19 crisis.
""We do not think we should live as slaves, we should live a normal life,"" said Kostadin Kostadinov, chairman of Vazrazhdane. ""Оur patience is over and we want this government to go.""
Borissov returned to power in 2017 for his third term since 2009, promising that his coalition government would spur economic growth and increase incomes in the European Union’s poorest member state.
His GERB party remains the most popular political formation, according to the latest opinion polls with most of Bulgarians approving of the measures that have largely contained the spread of the infection.

As of Thursday, Bulgaria has 2,100 registered cases, including 99 deaths.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Prosecutors dropped money-laundering charges against Riza Aziz - a Hollywood producer and the stepson of Malaysia's former prime minister Najib Razak - on Thursday after a deal that officials said included the recovery of $107.3 million of overseas assets. 
Riza, the co-founder of Red Granite Pictures that produced the hit movie ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", was charged with five counts of money laundering last year over allegations that he had received $248 million misappropriated from state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB).
U.S. and Malaysian authorities say a total of about $4.5 billion was taken from 1MDB - an institution co-founded in 2009 by then-premier Najib.
A sessions court judge ruled on Thursday that the charges against Riza would be withdrawn after state prosecutors said they had reached a deal with the accused.
Riza's lawyer Hariharan Tara Singh confirmed a deal had been reached and said his client was ""pleased to make good on his obligations to the authorities and looks forward to beginning the next chapter of his life.""
The government is expected to recover overseas assets estimated to be worth $107.3 million as part of the agreement, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission said in a statement. 
""Based on the agreement, the accused is required to pay a compound to the government... which is punitive as an alternative to the charges that have been brought against him,"" the commission said.
The court said the dropping of charges did not amount to an acquittal. Steps would be taken to ensure a full acquittal upon completion of the deal, failing which charges could be reinstated, lead prosecutor Gopal Sri Ram said during the hearing.
The U.S. Department of Justice has said Red Granite financed three films, including ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", using funds they suspect were stolen from 1MDB.
Red Granite paid the U.S. government $60 million in September 2017 to settle a civil forfeiture claim over the rights to the films.
The United States has returned or assisted Malaysia with recovering around $600 million from the sale of assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds. 
Since losing an election to Mahathir Mohamad in 2018, Najib has been slapped with 42 criminal charges tied to losses at now-defunct 1MDB and other state entities. He has pleaded not guilty and has consistently denied wrongdoing.
Najib told Reuters in March, days after Mahathir unexpectedly resigned amid political turmoil, that he now expected an atmosphere more conducive to a fair hearing.

The case has also led to scrutiny of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which Malaysia has accused of misleading investors over bond sales totalling $6.5 billion that the bank helped raise for 1MDB. Three units of the bank have pleaded not guilty.

508,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 09:30AM ET</span>",Trump envoy accuses Germany of undermining NATO's nuclear deterrent,"BERLIN (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador in Berlin has accused Germany of undermining NATO's nuclear deterrent, taking aim at Chancellor Angela Merkel's junior coalition partners after some of their leaders called for nuclear disarmament.
Rolf Muetzenich, parliamentary leader of the Social Democrats (SPD), called earlier this month for the withdrawal of all U.S. nuclear weapons from Germany - a view that divides his left-leaning party and is not shared by Merkel's conservatives.
In an opinion piece for German newspaper Die Welt, Ambassador Richard Grenell wrote: ""Instead of undermining the solidarity that forms the basis of NATO's nuclear deterrence, it is now time for Germany to meet its commitments to its allies and to continuously invest in NATO's nuclear participation.""
""Germany's political leadership, especially that of the SPD, must now make it clear the federal republic is honouring these commitments and standing by its allies,"" added Grenell, who is also U.S. President Donald Trump's acting national intelligence chief.
The remarks are the latest twist in relations between Berlin and Washington that have often been strained during Trump's presidency. The president has pressed Germany to raise its defence spending and accused Berlin of being a ""captive"" of Russia due to its energy reliance. 
But Grenell's comments also come a day after Merkel cited ""hard evidence"" that Russia was behind a 2015 hacker attack on her Bundestag office -- an assault that she said ""pains me"". 
""The dangers threatening peace in Europe are not an 'anachronism', as some would have us believe,"" Grenell said.
""The Russian invasion of Ukraine, the deployment of new nuclear-weapon-capable missiles by Russia on the periphery of Europe and new capabilities of China, North Korea and other countries make it clear that the threat is all too present.""
The coalition agreement between Merkel's conservatives and the SPD cites successful disarmament talks as a prerequisite for the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons stationed in Germany and Europe.
However, the debate over nuclear weapons was sparked by news last month that the Defence Ministry wanted to purchase 45 F-18 fighter jets from Boeing (NYSE:BA) to replace ageing Tornado aircraft and take over the German military's task of so-called nuclear sharing - under which the planes would carry U.S. nuclear bombs to target in a crisis.

If Germany does not buy new jets, the nuclear sharing would end with the planned retirement of the Tornadoes from service in 2030.

509,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>",India to provide free food grains to millions of migrant workers,"By Aftab Ahmed and Manoj Kumar
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will provide free food grains to millions of migrant workers hardest hit by a weeks-long lockdown as well as offer employment under a rural jobs program, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Thursday.
The government will spend 35 billion rupees ($463.06 million) on food for nearly 80 million migrant workers over the next two months, Sitharaman told a news conference. 
The allocation is part of a 20 trillion rupee ($266 billion) fiscal and monetary package to prop up the ailing economy. Millions of workers have fled large towns and cities after they lost their jobs during the lockdown, which is aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus.
""The government is concerned about migrant workers,"" Sitharaman said, and had provided funds to states to provide shelter, food grain and transport for migrants. 
Since April, the government has spent 100 billion rupees to offer work to near 23 million unemployed people in rural areas under the ongoing rural job guarantee program, she said.
The government also plans to extend a bank loan interest subsidy program for affordable housing to rented housing for migrant workers, she said. 
On Wednesday, it announced new credit lines by offering bank guarantees on loans of over $60 billion to small businesses, shadow banks and power companies.
In an address to the nation on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the package was equivalent to 10% of India's gross domestic product, and was meant to support workers and businesses reeling from the impact of the prolonged shutdown.
Under lockdown since late March, India has reported more than 78,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 among its 1.3 billion population, with over 2,500 deaths from the lung disease.
Economists said new measures would have a limited impact on the government's fiscal spending as large parts of funding for migrant workers, farmers and small businesses was through state- run banks and financial institutions. 
Nevertheless, Sonal Varma, an economist at Nomura, estimated that the federal fiscal deficit is expected to touch 7% of GDP in 2020/21, double an earlier estimate of 3.5%, mainly due to a sharp fall in revenue collection.
In April, the unemployment rate rose to 23.5% from 8.7% the previous month, data released by the Center for Monitoring Indian Economy, a Mumbai-based think tank, showed.
Sitharaman said street vendors and farmers would get new subsidized bank loans, and that nearly 30 million farmers had so far benefited from a three-month moratorium on bank loans amounting to 4.22 trillion rupees. 
Economists and rating agencies expect the Indian economy could contract by up to 5% in the current financial year beginning April, a steep fall from earlier government estimates of 6% growth.

The attack was carried out by armed individuals in a vehicle as two municipality personnel and a civilian returned from aid distribution to a quarantined neighbourhood around midday, the governor's office said in a statement.
Turkey's communication director Fahrettin Altun said Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) was responsible for the attack, adding that Turkey would bring them to account.
Authorities have quarantined more than 100 neighbourhoods, villages and towns around Turkey as part of measures to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. Essential aid is provided by municipalities and local volunteers in those areas.
An operation to catch the perpetrators of the armed attack was launched, the governor's office said, adding the wounded person was being treated at a nearby hospital.
The PKK, which has waged an insurgency against the Turkish state since 1984, is designated a terrorist organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict.

The antibody tests - also known as serology tests - show who has been infected, although it is not yet clear whether the presence of antibodies to the new coronavirus confers permanent immunity.
""We've talked about in the future the potential for some kind of health certificate related to whether or not you have antibodies but we need a better understanding of the immune system response to the virus and the length and level of immunity following infection to better understand the potential of the test,"" the spokesman told reporters.

PARIS (Reuters) - Parisians are rushing to buy new bicycles or hauling old ones to the repair shop in an attempt to avoid crowded buses and metro trains and minimise the risk of coronavirus infection.
As in other cities worldwide, authorities in Paris are keen to encourage a safer, and environmentally friendly, form of transport as they try to halt the spread of COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the new coronavirus that has so far killed more than 27,000 people across France.
""It is clearly impossible to respect social distancing safety measures (on public transport),"" said commuter Claire Bouvet as she took a bike she had not touched for 10 years for a tune-up.
""It is better to cycle and breathe fresh air than to be locked up in underground transport systems or the train,"" said the social media manager.
Paris already had more than 1,000 km (620 miles) of bike lanes before the virus hit.
Mayor Anne Hidalgo, who has campaigned against car use in the capital since entering City Hall in 2014, has added a provisional 50 km of additional cycling lanes in the past few weeks as she seeks to capitalise on the shifting public mood.
Hidalgo has long wanted to transform Paris into a world-leading eco-city. She has pedestrianised roads along the River Seine and hiked parking fees as well as expanding bike highways, but the car has remained king in Paris - at least until now. 
""We could achieve five to 10 years of bike advocacy progress in the space of only a few months,"" said Olivier Schneider, head of the French bicycle users federation.
""Both Amsterdam and Copenhagen, great cycling capitals, used to be just as car-dominated in the 1970s,"" he said, adding they had switched to encouraging cyclists during an economic crisis.
DETHRONING THE CAR?
In the past, Hidalgo has faced opposition from the city's other powerful female politician, Valerie Pecresse, president of the greater Paris region, who has dismissed the mayor's eco-vision as impractical.
A staunch defender of motorists' freedoms, Pecresse has focused in her transport plan ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics on improving public transport and the road network.
But the coronavirus crisis is prompting her too to rethink.
""Bicycles are one tool that will allow us to maintain social distancing,"" she said in late April.
At the ""Ca redemarre"" ('It works again') repair shop, Kiki Carbonneau said she was taking in 200 bikes a day, compared to 30 before the coronavirus outbreak. Many had long been neglected, with flat tyres and worn-out rubber. 
To encourage cycling, the government is offering to pay the first 50 euros of repairs. City Hall already offered a subsidy of up to 400 euros for new electric bikes. 

""I just did not want to get into the metro and stand so close to people. I feel this is the best way to move through the city from now on,"" said Clare, an Australian artist living in Paris and owner of a new bike.

NEW DELHI/AHMEDABAD (Reuters) - The U.N. labour agency urged Indian states thinking of relaxing workers' rights to help industry survive the coronavirus to consult workers first as a union linked to India's ruling party said it would protest the planned moves.
Six states, including most populous Uttar Pradesh and the commercial hub of Gujarat, have said they plan to suspend some laws on wages and working hours to help industry recover from a seven-week lockdown.
""Certain states in India are moving towards relaxing labour laws with a view to revitalize the economy from the impact of COVID-19,"" the UN's International Labour Organisation said in an emailed statement on Thursday.
""Such amendments should emanate from tripartite consultation involving the government, the workers' and the employers' organisations and be compliant with the international labour standards.""
The states, many of which are ruled by the Bharatiya Janata Party led by Narendra Modi, say the changes are needed to kickstart the economy reeling under the impact of the shutdown.
""Economic growth and industrial activity have been hit hard by the lockdown because of the COVID-19 outbreak,"" a senior Gujarat government official told Reuters.
""The relaxations in labour laws are needed to attract new industries to Gujarat and to create employment opportunities.”
In April, the government in Gujarat allowed factories to increase workers’ shifts from eight to 12 hours.
There is also a proposal to increase the threshold of the number of workers employed for factories to need prior government permission for layoffs, retrenchment and closure, from 100 to 300.
But the proposals have angered trade unions, including the Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, the labour wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, itself the ideological parent of Modi's ruling group.
""Many other states are readying to follow the trend. This is unheard in history and is rare even in most undemocratic countries,"" general secretary Virjesh Upadhyay said in a statement, urging people to demonstrate on May 20.

517,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 07:21AM ET</span>","Japan lifts emergency in most areas but not in Tokyo, Osaka","By Linda Sieg and Kaori Kaneko
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted a state of emergency in large parts of the country on Thursday but said it would remain in place in Tokyo until the novel coronavirus is contained.
Abe lifted the emergency in 39 of Japan's 47 prefectures but left it in force in the capital and in the second-largest urban area of Osaka, as he tries to cushion the economic blow while stopping the virus.
Abe said he would begin work on a second extra budget and as part of the economic stimulus, the government would take more steps to ease corporate funding strains, if needed.
""While controlling the spread of the virus as much as possible by acting on the premise that the virus is all around us, we will restore ordinary work and daily life,"" Abe told a news conference. 
The world's third-largest economy declared the nationwide state of emergency a month ago, urging citizens to reduce person-to-person contact by 80% to slow the spread of the virus and ease pressure on medical services.
Economists said normalisation would be gradual as the government keeps a wary eye on the possibility of a second wave of infections, as seen in countries such as South Korea and China. 
The emergency gives governors more authority to tell people to stay at home and to close schools and businesses, but there is no penalty for non-compliance. 
Some non-essential businesses, even in areas hit hard by the coronavirus, have started to reopen, even before Thursday's announcement, and the scope of restrictions has varied across the country.
Osaka's governor has announced criteria for gradually lifting some restraints on businesses including eateries and bars.
THREE WHEELS
The 39 prefectures in which the emergency has been lifted account for 54% of Japan's population but the greater Tokyo area accounts for a third of the economy. 
""Tokyo is the heart of the Japanese economy. It's like driving a car with three wheels,"" said Jesper Koll, chief executive of asset manager WisdomTree Japan.
The government is set to add four economists to its advisory panel for combating the epidemic and a review will be conducted again in about a week. 
Fast Retailing Co (T:9983), owner of casual clothing chain Uniqlo, which has started to reopen outlets, said it planned more reopenings from Friday after the state of emergency is lifted.
In Ina city, Nagano - among the 39 prefectures where the emergency was lifted - Kazue Tominari said earlier she would wait and see before re-opening her restaurant, which is now offering take-out only.
""It depends on how everyone feels,"" she said by telephone. 
""If news comes out about more infections, people will probably go back to self-restraint mode. Until there are effective drugs or vaccines, I don't think we will be able to go back to the way we were before.""
Japan has reported 16,120 cases of the coronavirus, not counting infections on a cruise ship that was quarantined in Yokohama port, and 697 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK.
While Japan has avoided the kind of explosive outbreaks seen in the United States and elsewhere, its testing has also been among the lowest, at 188 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests per 100,000 people, compared with 3,159 in Italy and 3,044 in Germany.
Hardest-hit Tokyo has conducted just 50,000 tests, of which about 5,000 were positive.
Although Japan's emergency lacks enforcement powers, mobility data has shown a marked drop in the movement of people.

The government this week reported a 20% fall in the number of hospitalised COVID-19 patients in the nine days to May 7, to 4,449. In Tokyo, new cases fell to just 10 on Wednesday.

The compulsory quarantine, one of a series of measures taken by Slovakia to curb the spread of the coronavirus, has been criticized by Slovaks living abroad as well as by the state ombudswoman, who has said it potentially breaches basic human rights.
Health Minister Marek Krajci said the launch of the application allowing a ""smart"" quarantine could be launched next Monday after it is approved by parliament.
""This smart solution will allow returnees to self-isolate at home if they agree to install the application after crossing the border,"" he said.
Details on how the app will work are expected to be announced on Monday but one of the options is that it would use face-identification technology. 
Prime Minister Igor Matovic had defended the quarantine's role in helping detect infections and prevent the coronavirus's spread. Official figures show people who are or were at the state-run centres account for almost 13% of the 1,477 positive cases confirmed in the country.
Slovakia, a European Union member state of 5.5 million, has recorded 27 deaths. Like other European countries it is gradually easing its lockdown measures.
The quarantine system has affected mostly Slovaks returning home, since foreigners are barred from entry, unless they have a right to stay.
The government has also approved a phone app tracking contacts of infected people.

It is not clear when that app will be launched, however, as the Constitutional Court on Wednesday suspended parts of the existing law allowing state authorities to access data collected by telecommunications operators, saying some of its clauses were insufficiently clear.

Security Council does not extend an arms embargo on Tehran, state media reported.
The U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, on Wednesday publicly confirmed the strategy two weeks after an official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that Washington had notified Britain, France and Germany of its plan.
The U.N. embargo is due to expire in October under a 2015 Iran nuclear deal that U.S. President Donald Trump quit in 2018.
Washington argues it can trigger a return of U.N. sanctions because a 2015 Security Council resolution enshrining the deal still names the United States as a participant. 
""Foolish claims by US officials is nothing new,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Zarif told reporters.
""It is no surprise to hear such things from people who recommend drinking disinfectants to ward off the coronavirus - to contend they are still a party to the agreement after officially leaving it,” said Zarif.
This appeared to refer to Trump's suggestion for research into whether the coronavirus might be treated by injecting disinfectant into the body.
Meanwhile, a foreign ministry spokesman ridiculed a 2019 U.S. State Department report released on Wednesday that Iran and four other countries had not cooperated fully with U.S. counter-terrorism efforts.

""With a history of founding, funding and arming different terrorist groups, a record of state terrorism, and its outright support for another terrorist regime, U.S. is not a good yardstick for measuring anti-terrorism efforts,"" spokesman Abbas Mousavi tweeted.

520,By Reuters,"<span>May 14, 2020 06:07AM ET</span>",Israel offers peek at new normal for air travel during pandemic,"BEN GURION AIRPORT, Israel (Reuters) - Arrive four hours early, in a mask and without any escort. Get checked for a fever, disinfect your hands, watch out for the fleet of robotic cleaners, and again disinfect your hands.
This is what passengers leaving Israel should expect to encounter, according to a pilot programme launched on Thursday, as air travel slowly returns to normal after weeks of very few flights.
The idea, Israel's airport authority said, is to create a ""coronavirus-free area"" at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv, which is already well-known for its rigid security.
Similar measures aimed at preventing contagion could be adopted by airports around the world, and Israel has been conferring about them with authorities in Europe and the United States, said Shmuel Zakai, Ben Gurion's managing director.
Representatives from the French embassy, for example, were checking documents of French passengers at check-in so they would not have to enter quarantine after returning home.
""This kind of process we will see more and more,"" Zakai said.
The challenge will be enacting policies that are not too much of a burden.
""We would like to see again the smiles on the faces of the children, the smiles on the faces of the passengers,"" he said.
The new restrictions begin at the entrance to the terminal. Only boarding pass holders are allowed in and passengers are instructed to maintain social distancing. Check-in will be mostly digital to minimise interaction with airport staff.
Hygiene stations and cleaning machines will be ubiquitous.
Incoming travelers will face even more hurdles, but with tourists not allowed into Israel until the end of the month, those measures have yet to be decided, the authority said.
It is also trying to develop a platform to check in real time whether passengers have been tested for the virus or its antibodies.

Israel, with a population of about nine million, has reported 16,548 cases of the novel coronavirus and 264 deaths. With the new case rate levelling out, it has reopened shopping malls and markets and part of its educational system.

China, which considers Taiwan its territory, has been angered by the Trump administration's strong support for the island, such as increased arms sales. 
Beijing-Washington ties have also been buffeted by fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and disputes over trade.
The U.S. Pacific Fleet, in a statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, said the USS McCampbell had transited the narrow strait that separates Taiwan from mainland China on Wednesday, showing pictures of the ship under way.
Taiwan's defence ministry said the ship had sailed south on what it termed an ""ordinary mission"", adding it was continuing in that direction.
In Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China ""paid close attention"" to the passage of the U.S. ship.
""We hope the U.S. side can appropriately handle the relevant issue, and play a constructive role in regional peace and stability, not the opposite,"" he said.
Tsai, who will be sworn in for her second and final term next Wednesday, won re-election by a landslide in January, vowing to defend Taiwan's democracy and stand up to China.
Both China and the United States have ramped up military activities near Taiwan in recent months, including regular U.S. sailings through the Taiwan Strait, and regular Chinese air force drills near the island.
Last Friday, Taiwan said a Chinese air force Y-8 aircraft had briefly crossed into Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone, prompting Taiwan jets to warn it to leave.
China operates the Y-8 both as a transport and early warning and electronic warfare aircraft.
Taiwan has denounced the Chinese drills as attempts at intimidation and has told Beijing it should focus its efforts on fighting the coronavirus rather than menacing the island. 
China considers Tsai to be a separatist, an accusation she strongly denies.
Late next week, China will open its delayed annual meeting of parliament, where it is expected to release its defence budget for the year, a number closely watched around the region as President Xi Jinping oversees a military modernisation plan.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Thousands of travellers queued cheek by jowl at an airport terminal in the Indonesian capital Jakarta on Thursday, ignoring regulations on social distancing and despite an official lockdown slated to run until the start of June.
Photographs posted on social media, days after the government announced that several airlines could conditionally resume operations, showed passengers queuing to enter the airport and crowding inside the terminal.
One traveller, who asked to remain anonymous, said that confusion reigned as officials attempted to ensure all airline passengers underwent health checks and get flight approval letters stamped. 
""Once I entered terminal 2E, there was no clarity,"" said the 27-year-old, who was travelling for work, one of the designated travel exceptions. ""The crowd even reached to the entrance door without any physical distancing measure implemented.""
According to guidelines issued by the transportation ministry, airport operators are required to implement health protocols such as temperature checks and manage physical distancing to avoid crowds and queues. 
In a statement, state airport operator Angkasa Pura said lines had thinned by afternoon and efforts were underway to ensure physical distancing.
But the scenes have raised fears that the coronavirus is not being sufficiently contained. 
""This is worrying because people can take this virus to the regions, especially to villages and this will prolong our misery and our fight against COVID-19,"" said Alvin Lie of the ombudsman office, which investigates complaints about government agencies.
Despite social restrictions and a ban on the annual visit home by millions of Indonesians at the end of the Muslim fasting month, the government announced last week that migrant workers returning home and people in select industries could fly.
The Islamic holy month of Ramadan ends on May 23 with the Eid al-Fitr festival. 
The transport ministry’s director general of aviation said airlines would be sanctioned if they flouted social distancing rules, or exceeded seating capacity limitations of 50% on flights.
Travellers are required to provide a clean bill of health, and a letter from their employer stating the purpose of travel to be able to board an airplane. 
Health experts have described the moves as risky and premature, coming at a time that Indonesia’s coronavirus caseload continues to rise. 
On Thursday, the Southeast Asian nation reported 568 new infections, taking the total number to 16,006.

MONTIJO, Portugal (Reuters) - Maria das Merces struggled to hold back tears after she saw her 90-year-old father at a Portuguese care home - chatting to him from inside a glass booth erected in front of a window to allow elderly residents to visit family during the coronavirus pandemic. 
""Makes you want to hold him,"" Merces, 63, told Reuters after a 15-minute visit to the ""box of emotions"", as the contraption is known.
""I don't think I would be able to resist if the glass window wasn't here.""
Opened earlier this month at the Montepio nursing home in the town of Montijo across the River Tagus from Lisbon, the air-conditioned glass box sits outside the building alongside one of the rooms. Residents can sit and talk with their relatives using a microphone set up on both sides. 
Merces is one of the many Portuguese with relatives in care homes who are finding it tough to cope with a ban on visits imposed to protect the frail residents from contagion as part of a lockdown declared nearly two months ago. 
Around 14% of the around 2,500 care homes in Portugal reported coronavirus cases, according to the government.
Portugal, which has reported more than 28,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 1,175 deaths - a fraction of the toll in neighbouring Spain, started to ease the lockdown on May 4. 
Care homes will start to open doors again on May 18 under restrictions, including social distancing between visitors and residents. 
Chief nurse Patricia Soares believes care homes should remain shut for longer to protect the vulnerable group.
""We want to keep the virus out,"" she said. 
More than 90 elderly people live at the Montepia care home, with many suffering from dementia, making it hard for some to understand why they were not able to see their relatives. 
""There were people who didn't understand it, some still don't and think their families abandoned them,"" said care home president Pedro Santos. ""The 'box of emotions' brought joy."" 
Fatima Sousa, 58, has already used the box three times to visit her 89-year-old aunt Rosa Gordo. 

""When we got in and saw her on the other side with her hand on the glass...it was not easy and it's still not easy,"" said a tearful Sousa.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) has ""forgotten"" its professionalism and neutrality in locking Taiwan out of the body for political reasons, Taiwan Vice President Chen Chien-jen said on Thursday.
Taiwan says China and the WHO have conspired for political purposes to keep it out of key meetings, that the WHO has not responded to requests for coronavirus information and has misreported the number of its infections.
The WHO and China have strongly dispute the accusations, saying Taiwan has been given all the help it needed, but that only China, which claims democratic Taiwan as one of its provinces, has the right to fully represent it in the WHO.
Chen, a U.S.-trained epidemiologist, said the WHO had been putting politics above health.
""Unfortunately, because of political reasons, Taiwan's 23 million people have become orphans in the global health system,"" he told reporters at the presidential office in Taipei.
""The WHO pays too much attention to politics and has forgotten their professionalism and neutrality. This is quite regrettable.""
While the WHO has done good work and contributed to world health in the past, its record on the virus has not been as good, Chen added.
""On the Wuhan pneumonia, we mostly criticise them for acting too slowly,"" he said, referring to the central Chinese city where the virus first emerged late last year, before spreading worldwide to infect 4.3 million people and kill 295,000.
Chen, who was Taiwan's health minister during the 2002-2003 SARS crisis, said the world needed to be cautious with China's virus numbers, and urged Beijing to be more transparent.
He wished China well in its fight, however.
""Here I give my blessings to them and hope that they can contain the Wuhan pneumonia as early as possible and avoid a second wave,"" said Chen, who leaves office when President Tsai Ing-wen is sworn in for her second term next week. 
Taiwan has lobbied to attend next week's meeting of the WHO's decision-making World Health Assembly as an observer, but China objects.
In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said Taiwan's basis for participation in the WHO was damaged by the refusal of its ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party to recognise that the island is part of China.
There is no legal basis for a ""non-sovereign region"" to participate as an observer, Zhao added.
The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow Taiwan full access to the body, helping to further fuel tension between Washington and Beijing. 
Taiwan's tally of 440 virus infections and seven deaths is far lower than many of its neighbours, thanks to early and effective prevention work and an efficient public health system.

PARIS (Reuters) - France has summoned Venezuela's envoy over accusations President Nicolas Maduro's government has been harassing its embassy in Caracas, including by cutting water and electricity to the ambassador's residence, diplomats said on Thursday. 
France is among dozens of nations which do not recognise Maduro's disputed 2018 re-election and consider opposition leader Juan Guaido to be Venezuela's rightful president. 
Maduro has previously accused French ambassador Romain Nadal of meddling in internal affairs, and diplomats say the services to his home in Caracas have been cut since the start of May.
""France strongly condemns the measures taken in recent days, which hinder the normal functioning of our diplomatic mission in Caracas,"" deputy foreign ministry spokesman Olivier Gauvin said in a statement, adding that the measures contravened the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
""French officials expect these measures to be rescinded without delay in order to restore normal operations at our diplomatic mission.""
Venezuela's embassy in Paris could not be immediately reached for comment. 
President Emmanuel Macron welcomed Guaido at the presidential palace in January, reiterating calls for free and transparent elections in the country. 
Diplomats said that this, and the fact French diplomats were at the airport when Guaido returned to Caracas in February, may have prompted Maduro's government to ramp up pressure on European countries in the Venezuelan capital.
""There are too many factors to think that this is a coincidence and other diplomatic missions have also been affected by this,"" said a French official.

Social distancing measures to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus are likely to complicate efforts to move thousands of people into evacuation centres, such as classrooms and school gymnasiums.
Provincial disaster officials said they had asked the education department for more schools they could use as temporary shelters.
The Philippines has reported more than 11,000 cases of the new coronavirus, most in the capital Manila, and more than 700 deaths. 
Authorities told people in areas in the path of the Category 2 typhoon to brace for intense rain and to be on alert for landslides, storm surges and floods. 
An average of 20 typhoons a year hit the Philippines, an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Can't bear to eat alone? 
One restaurant in Thailand is ensuring it meets new social distancing guidelines, and providing lonely diners a bit of company, by seating stuffed pandas at its tables.
Thailand earlier this month relaxed some restrictions on businesses as the number of coronavirus cases slowed, allowing restaurants to reopen but with strict rules in place to reduce the risk of the virus spreading.
""Earlier we had only one chair for the tables where the customer came alone. But for me, it felt strange, so I thought I'd give them some company,"" said Natthwut Rodchanapanthkul, the owner of Maison Saigon, a Vietnamese restaurant in Bangkok. 
Sitting opposite one of the panda dolls, diner Sawit Chaiphuek said he was happy to have some company as he stepped out to eat for the first time in months. 
""The doll makes me feel less lonely eating by myself,"" said Sawit, 25. 
Siriporn Assavakarint, another customer, said the new seating rules often bamboozled diners, and the army of plush pandas made things much clearer. 
""It's a lot easier to understand compared to other restaurants where people always get confused about where to sit and end up sitting too close to each other.""
Thailand reported one new coronavirus case on Thursday and no new deaths, bringing the total to 3,018 cases and 56 deaths since the outbreak started in January. 

On Wednesday, it reported zero new cases for the first time since early March, before the lockdown began.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's pubs may be shut, but one east London brewer has found a novel way to keep the beer flowing - by packing his kegs into a van and pulling pints on people's doorsteps.
Driving a white van with the slogan ""tactical beer response unit"" on the side, Peter Brown, the director of Forest Road Brewing Co., spends his day fulfilling delivery orders.
But rather than delivering boxes of cans or bottles, Brown fills pint glasses for his customers out of taps on the side of the van.
""It doesn't fit as much beer as our bar would do on a normal Friday or Saturday, but what we do get is the pure joy on the customers' faces when they see a cold glass of beer for the first time in six weeks,"" he told Reuters.
""The look on their faces is just irreplaceable.""
Britain's pubs and bars have been closed for nearly two months. Government first advised people avoid them, then demanded they close and on March 23 imposed a countrywide lockdown in response to the spread of the coronavirus.
Under the restrictions of lockdown, food and drink suppliers can still offer delivery services.
Even as many firms turn to delivering cans, last month the Society of Independent Brewers said many breweries were facing closure as beer sales had fallen 82%.
Brown said he had seen strong demand for his pint deliveries: he was booked up until the end of May, and was investigating acquiring another van to serve different postcodes. 
Customers are big fans of the service, and one suggested that Brown, who already delivers with a bandana over his mouth, should add to his outfit to reflect his superman efforts.
""The man's a hero, simple as that. Not all heroes wear capes, but this guy should,"" said Nick Bateson, a customer who is a festival organiser from London.
""Amazing beer, quick delivery, love it.""

JALALABAD/KABUL (Reuters) - A truck packed with explosives blew up near a court in the eastern Afghan city of Gardez on Thursday, killing at least five people in an attack claimed by Taliban insurgents.
The explosion comes two days after at least 56 people were killed in attacks elsewhere in the country, including women and newborn babies, dealing a setback to peace plans in the war-ravaged nation.
""A car bomb explosion took place near a military court in Gardez city, which is a populated area. Dozens of civilians are feared to be dead and wounded,"" said Tariq Arian, an interior ministry spokesman. 
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid in a statement said the rebel group was responsible for the attack.
Emal Khan Momand, a military spokesman in Paktia province where Gardez is located, said the attack was carried out by a truck packed with explosives. Five people were killed and 14 were wounded, he said.
Arian blamed the militant Haqqani network, which has ties to Taliban rebels and the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba militant group. These groups rarely publicly claim responsibility for attacks.
The blast comes after gunmen attacked a maternity hospital in Kabul, killing 24 people, including new mothers and newborn babies, on Tuesday. A suicide blast claimed by the Islamic State at a funeral in eastern Nangahar on the same day killed 32.
President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attacks and said he had ordered the military to switch to offensive mode rather than the defensive stance it had adopted as the United States withdraws troops and tries to broker talks with the Taliban.
The Taliban denied any involvement in those attacks, but the government accused the group of fostering an environment in which terrorism thrives or of working with other militant groups who could have been involved, straining efforts by the United States to bring the insurgents and the Afghan government together.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States publicly threatened on Wednesday to trigger a return of all United Nations sanctions on Iran if the U.N. Security Council does not extend an arms embargo on Tehran that is due to expire in October under the Iran nuclear deal. 
U.S. special envoy for Iran, Brian Hook, confirmed the strategy two weeks after a U.S. official, speaking on condition anonymity, said the United States had told Britain, France and Germany of its plan.
Hook wrote in the Wall Street Journal that ""one way or another"" Washington would ensure the arms embargo remains. He said the United States has drafted a Security Council resolution and ""will press ahead with diplomacy and build support.""
A resolution needs nine yes votes and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain to be adopted by the 15-member Security Council. Russia has already signaled it is opposed to extending the arms embargo. 
""If American diplomacy is frustrated by a veto, however, the U.S. retains the right to renew the arms embargo by other means,"" Hook wrote, citing the ability of a party to the Iran nuclear deal to trigger a so-called snapback of all U.N. sanctions on Iran, which includes the arms embargo.
Tehran was given sanctions relief under a 2015 deal with the United States, Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France that prevents Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The deal allowed for a return of sanctions if Iran violated the deal. 
U.S. President Donald Trump quit the agreement in 2018, saying the accord from Barack Obama's presidency as ""the worst deal ever."" But Washington argues it can trigger a return of U.N. sanctions because a 2015 Security Council resolution enshrining the deal still names the U.S. as a participant. 
""This is ridiculous,"" Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters on Tuesday. ""They are not members, they have no right to trigger.""
Diplomats say the United States would likely face a tough, messy battle if it tries to spark a return of sanctions, though it was not immediately clear how or if a Security Council member could stop such a move. 
Iran has breached several central limits of the deal, including on its stock of enriched uranium, in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of sanctions that have slashed Iran's oil exports. Britain, France and Germany are trying to save the deal, but have made little progress.

The case comes weeks after advocacy group Human Rights Watch said it believed Burkina Faso security forces summarily executed 31 unarmed detainees during operations against Islamist militants.
The prosecutor, Judicael Kadeba, said in a statement late on Wednesday the incident took place the town of Fada N'Gourma, around 220km (137 miles) east of the capital Ouagadougou.
He said 25 people were arrested during the night of May 11 - 12 by Burkina Faso security and defence forces for suspected terrorism in a village in the Fada N'Gourma area.
""Unfortunately 12 of them died during the same night in cells where they were being held,"" Kadeba said.
Burkina Faso has been battling armed Islamist insurgents, some with ties to al Qaeda and Islamic State, since 2017. 
The militants have strengthened their foothold in the northeast and eastern parts of the country around the tri-border region with Niger and Mali, known as the Liptako-Gourma region.
HWR said in April the militants have killed more than 300 civilians in Burkina Faso, while the government has killed several hundred men for their alleged support of the groups.
Burkinabe officials have promised to investigate similar allegations in the past, but rights group say the government has not done enough to hold perpetrators accountable.

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian province of Ontario is allowing its education staff, including teachers and custodians, to voluntarily redeploy into the province's long-term care homes, the provincial government said on Wednesday, as the coronavirus outbreak at just one Toronto-area home alone has killed dozens.
Coronavirus deaths in long-term care nursing homes account for 815 of 1,765 total deaths in Ontario, Canada's most populous province, according to provincial data released on Wednesday.
Camilla Care Community recorded 56 deaths, according to the home's owner, Sienna Senior Living, on Wednesday. The regional health authority reported 179 residents and 39 staff have tested positive at the facility.
In March, Ontario closed schools in an effort to stop the spread of the virus, requiring many educators and other staff to leave their jobs. This latest redeployment focuses on training and moving any employees who volunteer into nursing homes.
Ontario has previously moved workers from hospitals into long-term care homes, and Wednesday's announcement expands the province's support for the facilities, which have been hit hard by the virus.
The province also issued an emergency order on Wednesday morning, allowing the provincial government to issue mandatory management orders to any long-term care home struggling to deal with an outbreak.
Open roles include custodial and social work positions, and workers can volunteer ""knowing that they will be fully trained, that they will be provided with PPE (personal protective equipment), that they will continue to maintain their employment relationship with the school board,"" Ontario's education minister, Stephen Lecce, said at a briefing on Wednesday.
The news comes as provinces around the country take steps to gradually loosen social restrictions in place since March.
The Pacific province of British Columbia is allowing religious gatherings as of next week of up to 50 people, provided that social distancing rules can still be followed. The provincial health officer, Bonnie Henry, urged religious leaders to consider keeping services short and held in the largest space possible.
""Now is our time to very cautiously, thoughtfully, move ahead with opening things up again,"" Henry said at a press briefing on Wednesday.
Quebec, Canada's epicenter, is allowing the resumption of some leisure activities, including golf and tennis, from May 20, officials said. 
Alberta, which has the third-highest number of infections among provinces, will implement the next phase of its reopening plan on Thursday except in Calgary and Brooks, where combined cases make up 75% of the provincial total. The same restrictions will lift in those cities more gradually.
The western province's daily case numbers and hospitalizations have peaked, allowing the province to open more of its economy, including restaurants at 50% capacity and hair salons, Premier Jason Kenney said. He warned that residents need to maintain physical distancing limits.
""If we slack off, people in our communities, and maybe people we love, will suffer,"" Kenney said.

WASHINGTON/MUMBAI, India (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's stalled plans to bring peace to Afghanistan have suffered a new setback with a decision by Kabul to resume offensive operations against the Taliban following two attacks on Tuesday that killed scores of Afghans.
Washington cast the attacks - one at a Kabul hospital where gunmen killed at least 24 people, including two newborns, and a suicide bombing at a funeral in Nangarhar province that killed at least 32 people - as a moment for the Afghan government and the Taliban to unite to combat such violence and to negotiate a peace deal.
An affiliate of the Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility for the bombing, according to the SITE Intelligence Group. There has been no claim for the hospital attack in Kabul.
The Taliban denied involvement in both attacks.
Four sources - a U.S. official, a U.S. congressional aide, a European diplomat and a former Afghan official, all speaking on condition of anonymity - said the attacks were more likely to undermine the U.S. sponsored peace process than to achieve any government-Taliban reconciliation.
The government had largely suspended offensives against the Taliban since a U.S. troop reduction plan was unveiled on Feb. 29 but Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's stated intention to resume operations could start a cycle of violence, the U.S. official said. The decision could have a decisive impact on the peace deal, the official said.
""The Taliban was (probably) not ever committed to making this deal work with the Afghan government and this is the fig leaf of an excuse that will blow up (it up) and give everybody an excuse to walk away,"" the official said.
The hospital attack did not seem consistent with Taliban tactics, the official said.
    The official said Washington still planned to cut the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan to 8,600 from about 13,000 when the deal was struck and then assess whether to go lower.
    ""Very clearly our assessment is that the conditions are not being met"" to go below 8,600, the official said, adding that it would ultimately be a political decision.
The State Department, which has led U.S. diplomacy to try to achieve an Afghan peace deal, declined comment for this report, as did the White House national security council.
""If the Afghans are going on the attack, I don't see how you can keep a deal going,"" said a U.S. congressional aide who asked not to be named. ""I can’t see how the continued violence would allow the United States to continue decreasing below the 8,600.""
Asked if he was concerned that the peace effort was unraveling, Trump stressed his desire for Afghans to handle their own security rather than relying on U.S. forces.
""We've been there for many years, we're like a police force. We're not fighting in Afghanistan, we're a police force in Afghanistan and at some point they're going to have to be able to take care of their country,"" he told reporters.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Twitter on Wednesday that the United States remained committed to a ""lasting peace"" in Afghanistan and ""stand by our Afghan partners.""
'BACK IN WAR MODE'?
The Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban deal called for a phased U.S. troop withdrawal and for the government and Taliban to release some prisoners by March 10, when peace talks were to start.
Intra-Afghan peace talks have yet to occur and there is some bitterness within the Afghan government, which was not a party to the Feb. 29 deal, that the United States undercut their leverage by negotiating directly with the Taliban.
A former senior Afghan official said Tuesday's attacks gave Ghani the ""cover"" he wanted ""to defy the Americans on the peace talks"" because he and his government see the U.S.-Taliban deal as a ""sellout.""
On Twitter after the attacks, Ghani's national security adviser, Hamdullah Mohib, said the government was concerned from the start of the process that the Taliban could not control the violence and said there ""seems little point in continuing to engage Taliban in 'peace talks.'""
Ghani's decision to revive offensive operations is supported by many opposition figures, who believe Washington's sole focus is to keep the U.S. troop withdrawal plan intact to help Trump win a second term in the Nov. 3 election, the former Afghan official said.
A European diplomat based in Kabul said Ghani's stance made sense given the Afghan public's horror at Tuesday's violence. However, the diplomat said U.S. support for Afghan forces in going after the Taliban could scotch the peace process.
""Now it is for the U.S. to decide whether they help Afghan forces intensify their attacks,"" the diplomat said. ""That could  lead to the (deal's) collapse and we are back in war mode.""
A second U.S. official said there was growing U.S. concern about the increasing violence but it was too early to say how much it might worsen. Much will depend on how aggressive Afghan security forces become and whether the Taliban respond in kind, the official said.
The Taliban said in a statement it was ""fully prepared to counter all enemy movements and offensives and to robustly defend its people.""
There had appeared to be some movement toward Afghan peace talks because some prisoner releases have occurred and talks were underway to resolve an election dispute between Ghani and his main political rival, former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah.
Some analysts still see hope for peace, in part because U.S. and Afghan forces have failed to defeat the Taliban for two decades and the alternative is more violence.

""When those are the options in front of you, I think ultimately the only real option is to try to get back to some kind of a peace process,"" said Andrew Wilder, an Afghanistan expert at the U.S. Institute of Peace think tank.

NIKSIC, Montenegro (Reuters) - Montenegrin police clashed on Wednesday with dozens of hardline believers of the Serbian Orthodox Church in the northern city of Niksic who were protesting the detention of a bishop and priests charged with violating coronavirus-related restrictions.
Police used stun grenades and pepper spray to disperse the protesters, who demanded the release of Bishop Joanikije and seven priests who were taken for questioning on Tuesday, after a procession that was held despite a ban on public gatherings imposed in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus. 
""Release the bishop, dogs,"" chanted the crowd gathered in front of Niksic's main police station. 
Several protesters were taken away by police, a Reuters witness said.
Similar protests have been held in the Montenegrin town of Pljevlja where police also used teargas to disperse the crowd, the Podgorica-based Vijesti TV reported
The protest in Niksic follows months of tensions between the Serbian Orthodox Church and the government over a law passed in December allowing Montenegro to seize some religious property. 
Nikola Janjusevic, deputy director of Montenegro's police, said the clergymen were taken for questioning after failing to seek a permit for a procession against the religion law. 
""No one informed police the procession would be held,"" Janjusevic told state-run RTCG TV earlier in the day.
The church fears the religion law could be used to target its assets and status, while the government has accused Serbia and Russia, which are closely aligned with the church, of using it to undermine Montenegro's independence.
A pilgrimage in a neighbouring diocese was held without tensions on Tuesday. Montenegro eased some restrictions on religious gatherings, but requirements for two-metres distance and the wearing of surgical masks remained.
The Serbian Orthodox Church is the largest Christian denomination in Montenegro, a country of 620,000 people, which is a NATO member and a candidate to join the European Union. The church has about 12 million followers, mainly in Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro.
So far Montenegro has reported 324 cases of coronavirus infections and nine deaths, far less than its neighbours where dozens, and in some cases hundreds have died.

Instead of using tear gas to disperse the inmates during a protest at Los Llanos Penitentiary Center, members of the National Guard, which oversees prison security, ""unfortunately, for containment, used firearms,"" Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab said.
Prison director Carlos Graterol will be charged as an accomplice in ""introducing firearms into penitentiary centers"" that the inmates used, Saab said. The five soldiers will be charged with intentional homicide and intentional homicide ""in a degree of frustration"" as well as ""abuse of power."" 
Los Llanos is located on the outskirts of the city of Guanare, the capital of Venezuela's central Portuguesa state. 
Venezuela's Public Ministry almost never reports charges against officials in cases of prison massacres or escapes, but this case garnered public attention.
The day after the massacre, the United Nations Human Rights Council expressed grave concern and called for an investigation into the killings at the prison.
Venezuelan rights groups criticized the government's silence. More than a week after the incident, in which another 69 people were injured, officials had yet to comment. 
Saab said the deaths occurred because a gang leader inside the prison ordered inmates to protest ""over alleged irregularities during visits."" The inmates' relatives reported officials had been stealing food the families brought.
Like many of the prisoners in Venezuela's overcrowded and violent penitentiaries, Los Llanos' 4,000 inmates normally subsist on food brought by relatives. But authorities banned visits due to a coronavirus quarantine imposed in March.
The guards, desperate themselves amid national shortages, began stealing the little food that was getting behind bars, inmates said. Around midday on May 1, inmates crowded the entrance in protest and some attempted to escape, according to two witnesses and three other people familiar with the incident.
""In the absence of a response to their claim, the prison population crossed the fence,"" said the prosecutor, adding that four gang leaders will be charged with homicide and arms trafficking.
Deadly riots are common in Venezuela's teeming prisons, where crime groups hold control, often with penitentiary authorities’ consent, according to rights groups.

537,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 04:20PM ET</span>",U.S. says Cuba is not cooperating fully on counterterrorism,"HAVANA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Wednesday it had put Cuba back on the list of countries that do not cooperate fully with its efforts to counter terrorism, in a further escalation of U.S. tensions with the Communist-run country.
The State Department justified the move by Cuba's refusal of Colombia's request to extradite leaders of the ELN rebel group after it claimed responsibility for an attack at a Bogota police academy in January 2019 that killed 22.
The leaders of the National Liberation Army (ELN), the largest active guerrilla group in Colombia, traveled to Havana as part of peace negotiations that collapsed last year after the car bomb attack.
Cuba has said it must respect the protocols of the talks it had been hosting, which provide guarantees for guerrilla leaders to return to mountainous or jungle areas of Colombia with security from military attack for an agreed period.
The country has received broad plaudits in the past for hosting the successful peace talks between the Colombian government and the former FARC rebel army. 
But the State Department said in a statement that Cuba's refusal of Colombia's extradition request ""demonstrates that it is not cooperating with U.S. work to support Colombia’s efforts to secure a just and lasting peace, security, and opportunity for its people"".
The department also said that ""Cuba harbors several U.S. fugitives from justice wanted on charges of political violence, many of whom have resided in Cuba for decades.""
The State Department did not immediately respond to a Reuters query on whether its move was a preliminary step toward returning Cuba to the list of state sponsors of terrorism (SSOT), a designation that carries tougher penalties.
But there is a strong overlap between both lists, from which the administration of former President Barack Obama removed Cuba following a 2014 breakthrough between the two Cold War foes and ahead of the restoration of diplomatic relations.
Some analysts say President Donald Trump's administration is slowly meting out tougher sanctions on Cuba and its leftist ally Venezuela in a bid to win over anti-socialist voters ahead of November's U.S. presidential election. 
""We always knew this administration planned to return #Cuba to the SSOT,"" tweeted Ricardo Herrero, a director of the Cuba Study Group, a Miami exile organization that supports closer ties with Cuba. ""Now starts the slow election-year rollout for maximum theatrical effect. Just for you, Miami.""
The Cuban Foreign Ministry's general director for U.S. affairs, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, said on Twitter that Cuba had long been a victim of ""terrorist acts committed by the US government or with its complicity.""
Cuba has designated the gun attack on its embassy in Washington two weeks ago, in which no one was hurt, as a terrorist attack.
According to U.S. court documents, the gunman said he was taking medication for a mental disorder, heard voices and was convinced Cuban crime groups affiliated to the Cuban government were after him.

The measure replaces a state of emergency introduced in the middle of March, under which the Balkan country imposed travel bans, prohibited socialising in public spaces and closed schools, restaurants and bars.
Bulgaria has started easing the lockdown, opening up inter-city travel and access to parks, but still requires people to wear protective face masks on public transport and advocates social distancing to avoid a new wave of contagion. 
As of Wednesday, Bulgaria had registered 2,069 confirmed infections including 96 deaths among its 7 million people.
""We had to declare the epidemic emergency so that the measures to contain the spread of the coronavirus can continue,"" Health Minister Kiril Ananiev told a news briefing.
Schools and shopping malls will remain closed, Ananiev said, and infected people or those who have been in contact with them will have to stay in quarantine. 
The government has allowed the reopening of outdoor bars and outdoor restaurants, guest houses and small hotels, but will keep its borders closed to most travellers for the time being, Ananiev said. 
Bulgaria currently bars citizens of all countries outside the European Union as well as many of the bloc's member states with serious COVID-19 outbreaks from entering, and requires 14-day quarantine for those who are allowed to enter.

As part of plans to revive its hard-hit tourism sector, Bulgaria will hold talks with neighbouring Greece, Serbia and Romania to try to reach an agreement on easing travel restrictions, Ananiev said.

The potentially fatal bootleg alcohol contains dangerous substances such as methanol in some cases, and is being distributed as brewers such as Heineken (OTC:HEINY) and Grupo Modelo have suspended production in line with government directives to halt non-essential activity.
Local authorities have launched investigations to identify the suppliers, and urged citizens not to consume alcoholic drinks of unknown origin.
The fatalities, reported by states including Jalisco, Yucatan, Puebla and Morelos since the start of the month, appeared to spike after Mother's Day in Mexico on Sunday, according to officials and local media reports.
The toll rose to 20 on Wednesday in the municipality of Chiconcuautla in the central state of Puebla on Wednesday, a day after it declared a health emergency following 17 deaths from consuming tainted beverages. The local government said it had confiscated 200 liters (352 pints) of a local alcohol known as ""refino"" and was conducting studies to determine its contents.
In Yucatan, where local media reported a wave of deaths from the drinking of adulterated alcohol, the state government in April restricted alcohol sales to prevent domestic violence as more people stay home during the pandemic.
Federal health regulator COFEPRIS said last week it was investigating the sale of adulterated alcohol.
In its earnings call last month, Mexican conglomerate Femsa, which owns the popular Oxxo convenience store chain, said it had about 10 days' worth of inventory of beer.

""We want the Belgian judiciary to lift the veil on this case and punish any individual or company who may be found guilty of corruption,"" Fred Bauma, a Congolese pro-democracy activist and one of the petitioners, said in a statement.
Luc Stalars, a lawyer for Semlex, whose headquarters are in Belgium, said in an email that he was not aware of the civil action.
He referred Reuters to a company statement from 2017 that denied allegations of impropriety, calling them part of a ""defamatory smear campaign"". 
The company statement said Semlex's ""economic success, in particular on the African continent, has apparently given rise to increasing jealousy or even strategic frustration.""
The Belgian federal prosecutor's office declined to comment on the action. 
In a 2017 special report http://www.reuters.com/article/us-africa-passports-karaziwan-specialrep/special-report-how-to-make-millions-selling-passports-to-africa-idUSKBN1EG0YY, Reuters detailed how Semlex, which supplies passports to various African countries, won a contract to produce biometric passports in Democratic Republic of Congo. 
The deal greatly increased the price citizens have to pay for passports, and documents showed a Gulf company owned by a relative of Congo's then-president received almost a third of the revenues.
A lawyer representing Semlex, Francois Koning, said at the time that the company's chief executive would not comment for the Reuters special report, saying that unidentified third parties were manipulating Reuters with the aim of damaging him and Semlex.
Belgian prosecutors launched an investigation into possible money laundering and corruption soon after Reuters' report and raided the company's headquarters in 2018, but they have not made any further comment on the investigation since then. 
Stalars, the lawyer for Semlex, said the company's passport contract ""has been performed, to our knowledge, to the satisfaction of the Congolese authorities and citizens"". 
By becoming a civil party to the Belgian prosecutors' investigation, the petitioners can ask for case records and request further investigative measures.
The civil party petition was filed with the investigative judge in the case last Friday by 51 Congolese citizens, according to a statement by Congo Is Not For Sale, an anti-corruption campaign which brought the petitioners together. 
Three international anti-corruption and human rights organisations, including the International Federation for Human Rights and Belgium's League for Human Rights, also joined the case.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters gathered in shopping malls across Hong Kong on Wednesday, flouting coronavirus-related social distancing rules to mock unpopular Chief Executive Carrie Lam on her birthday.
Police, both in riot gear and plainclothes, entered some of the malls and at least one arrest was made after officers pushed back a crowd using pepper spray. Most shops had to close.
It was the latest sign social unrest was resurfacing in Hong Kong as the city has proven relatively successful at tackling the coronavirus, having recorded 1,051 cases and four deaths.
While the government has allowed bars, gyms and cinemas to reopen and civil servants to come back to work, it maintains that group gatherings should be limited to eight people.
Lam, who turns 63, is the Chinese-ruled city's least popular leader since its handover from Britain in 1997, having tried to push a bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China last year, sparking large-scale, often violent protests.
""I wish Carrie Lam can live a long life so that she can bear the responsibility of the decisions she made,"" 20-year-old protester Ken said. ""We will continue to resist. If we don’t try to fight, they will just try to suppress us more severely.""
In the New Town Plaza mall in the working class Sha Tin district, protesters hung up banners reading ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our Times,"" and chanted ""There are no rioters, only tyranny"" and ""Disband Hong Kong police.""
Last week, Lam said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that a purse sent by post as a gift from her family for Mother's Day had security staff on their toes after repeated bomb threats in recent months.
In Sha Tin, protesters taped posters with her face on glass windows, one reading ""Happy birthday and go to hell soon"" and another ""Because of you, many didn't have a happy Mother's Day."" 
Social distancing rules imposed to help contain coronavirus contagion has largely put a brake on protests since January. 
But, after clashes with the police at the weekend in which 230 were arrested, demonstrations are expected to pick up steam again into the summer, especially amid fears the coronavirus is distracting the international community, potentially offering a window of opportunity for a stronger security crackdown.
Although the extradition bill has been scrapped, protesters continue to demand an independent inquiry into the police handling of protests last year, as well as universal suffrage - a promise enshrined in the city's mini-constitution.
Pro-democracy demonstrators are further incensed by renewed calls from Beijing and pro-government officials in Hong Kong to enact national security legislation, known as Article 23, which is also a requirement of the Basic Law. 
A previous attempt to pass such legislation in 2003 was met with mass protests amid fears it would erode the city's liberties, agreed with Britain as part of the ""one country, two systems"" handover deal in 1997.
Communist authorities in Beijing deny interference in Hong Kong, blaming ""foreign forces"" for protracted unrest.

China's Hong Kong affairs office warned last week that the city would never be calm unless ""black-clad violent protesters"" were all removed, describing them as a ""political virus"" that seeks independence from Beijing.

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - Slovakia acted fast when it was hit by the coronavirus pandemic, quickly going into lockdown and keeping the number of cases lower than in most other European countries. 
But as the government eases its lockdown restrictions, one of the measures still in place is increasingly under fire -- compulsory quarantine for Slovaks returning or visiting from abroad. 
When they enter the central European country, they are escorted by police to state-run facilities where they must stay at least five days, or much longer if they test positive for the virus.
People staying in the centres - ranging from drab student dorms to hotels - pay no fees but must cover meal charges.
State ombudswoman Maria Patakyova has said the quarantine potentially breaches basic human rights and that a ""large number"" of complaints have been made about unsanitary conditions.
She ""drew attention to the shortcomings in implementing the state quarantine"" when she met Slovakia's interior minister on Tuesday, her office said.
Prime Minister Igor Matovic has defended the system's role in helping detect infections and prevent the coronavirus's spread. Official figures show people who are or were at the centres account for almost 13% of the 1,469 positive cases confirmed in the European Union member state of 5.5 million. 
Almost 17,000 people have spent spells in quarantine in Slovakia, which has reported 27 deaths across the country.
CRITICISM
Samuel Zubo, head of the Srdcom Doma (My Heart is at Home) association representing Slovaks abroad, says compulsory quarantine should be replaced by self-isolation, or people should be exempted from quarantine if they can present a negative test for the virus.
He said the government treats people as if they are irresponsible.
""(The system) is not based on any data,"" he said. He has decided not to return from Prague to visit relatives in Slovakia with his nine-year-old daughter because he does not want to spend time in a quarantine centre.
His criticisms were echoed over social media when enforced quarantine kept many from seeing elderly parents when Slovakia celebrated Mother's Day on Sunday.
One woman, Viktoria Fricova, said she was forced to stay in cramped living quarters and had to share a bathroom with other women when she spent seven days in a facility after returning from India. She said it would have been better to self-isolate.
""We learned that we would have to stay together only on arrival. We were not offered any alternative,"" she told Reuters.
Prime Minister Matovic has said he is open to a face-identification mobile phone application that could help ease the quarantine, and that this could be ready by the end of this week. But no final decision has been taken on the centres.

""The judicial committee has decided to hear Attorney General Michel Lauber at its next meeting,"" the parliamentary committee said on Wednesday.
""It will then decide whether to open impeachment proceedings against him."" The committee's next meeting is due to take place on May 20.
The committee of lawmakers from both houses of the Swiss parliament took note of a highly critical report by the attorney general's independent watchdog (AB-BA), as well as Lauber's counter arguments.
The watchdog's report said Lauber, who has been attorney general since 2012, has committed serious breaches of his duties including lying, acting disloyally and obstructing AB-BA's investigation, the committee said.
""For his part, Michael Lauber denies the form and content of the accusations made against him and accuses the AB-BA of numerous procedural errors, exceeding its authority, and bias, among other things,"" the judicial committee said in a statement.
Lauber has been accused by anti-corruption campaigners of bungling a fraud trial over payments linked to the 2006 World Cup in Germany.
The case has clouded the international reputation of Switzerland's judicial system, which is also probing high-level corruption cases linked to the Brazilian state oil firm Petrobras and the Malaysian state development fund 1MDB.

545,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>","Exclusive: FBI probes Mexican, European firms over Venezuela oil trading - sources","By Marianna Parraga, Matt Spetalnick and Ana Isabel Martinez
MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI is probing several Mexican and European companies allegedly involved in trading Venezuelan oil as it gathers information for a U.S. Treasury Department inquiry into possible sanctions busting, according to four people familiar with the matter.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams told reporters late last month the State and Treasury departments were investigating whether several firms were violating sanctions imposed on Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA since January 2019.
The sanctions are part of a campaign by Washington to strangle the revenues of President Nicolas Maduro, which has failed to break his grip on power. U.S. officials say privately that is a source of frustration for President Donald Trump, whose administration has tightened the implementation of sanctions in recent months.
Three of the people who provided information to the FBI - who asked for anonymity to discuss the matter - said the agency was investigating three Mexican companies: Libre Abordo, Schlager Business Group, and Grupo Jomadi Logistics & Cargo.
Reuters could find no record of Venezuelan oil purchases by those companies prior to sanctions. 
The people also said the FBI was gathering information on two Europe-based oil trading companies that do have a track record of dealing in Venezuelan oil or selling fuel to PDVSA: Elemento Ltd and Swissoil Trading SA.
One of the sources familiar with the matter in Washington said any action against the Mexican and European companies could be postponed or cancelled if the firms halted trade with Venezuela. The three others said the probe by the Treasury and the State departments could potentially lead to action in the coming weeks.
A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Justice, which handles media enquiries for the FBI, declined to comment, as did a State Department spokesperson. The Treasury Department did not reply to a request for comment.
Emails and phone calls seeking comment from Elemento and Swissoil went unanswered, and a lawyer for Elemento did not respond to a request for comment. Emails sent to an address on Jomadi's website bounced back.
Libre Abordo and its affiliate Schlager said in a statement to Reuters, citing legal experts they hired, that two contracts they signed in June 2019 with Venezuela's Corporation for Foreign Trade (Corpovex) to provide food and water trucks in exchange for Venezuelan crude - known as an oil-for-food agreement - were permitted under the sanctions as long as no cash payment reached Maduro's government. 
""Neither Libre Abordo nor shipping companies hired to move PDVSA's hydrocarbons are the subject of sanctions,"" read the statement. 
The firms declined to identify the legal experts but provided Reuters with their interpretation of Venezuela sanctions, which the companies said they sent to several shipping firms and other partners. 
The undated memorandum said the oil-for-food deal did not contravene U.S. measures because Corpovex was not specifically named on the Treasury Department's list of sanctioned people and entities, unlike PDVSA, and because there were exceptions under the sanctions for humanitarian goods.
Neither Corpovex, PDVSA nor Venezuela's trade ministry responded to requests for comment.
    
VENEZUELA RELIANT ON SWAP DEALS
The two small Mexican companies have emerged as the largest middlemen for Venezuelan oil in recent months, according to internal PDVSA export documents, reviewed by Reuters. 
OPEC member Venezuela has come to rely on trading oil and gold to pay for essential imports using complicated swap agreements because Washington's sanctions bar Maduro's government from using the U.S. financial system. 
The PDVSA export documents show that Libre Abordo and Schlager have quickly ramped up trading of Venezuelan oil since receiving a first cargo in December, after a second wave of U.S. sanctions in August 2019 barred non-U.S. oil companies from doing business with PDVSA.
These secondary sanctions blocked the U.S. property of anyone worldwide ""materially assisting"" Venezuela's government, including PDVSA and other governmental bodies - though it did not specifically name Corpovex. While the measures permitted shipments of food, clothing and medicines, none of the Venezuela-related executive orders issued by Trump specifically allowed oil-for-food agreements. 
Whether that ambiguity potentially has created a loophole for companies is a matter of disagreement, some experts said.
Richard Nephew, a senior researcher at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy and a former State Department official dealing with sanctions policy toward Iran, said that while food deals were permitted under sanctions there was no special dispensation for them to be paid for in oil and the involvement of PDVSA could still prompt Treasury to take action.
However, Peter Harrell, an expert on sanctions at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS), said that in oil-for-food swaps the companies ultimately supplying the food could be protected from sanctions provided they had no role in physically receiving, transporting or selling the oil. 
Harrell added that some U.S. policymakers might be reluctant to impose sanctions on companies involved in a deal to supply basic goods to a nation suffering a humanitarian crisis. 
""Policymakers will be concerned that sanctioning an oil for food barter would play into a...narrative that U.S. sanctions are causing humanitarian challenges in Venezuela,"" Harrell said.
        
DECISIONS ON SANCTIONS
While the FBI's principal focus is on domestic intelligence and security, its agents also carry out overseas investigations to aid decisions on sanctions by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which often also seeks input from the State and Commerce departments, U.S. embassies and the intelligence community.
Libre Abordo and Schlager's oil-for-food deals with Venezuela obliged them to deliver 1,000 water trucks and 210,000 tonnes of corn to the country, the companies said. While some of the trucks have been delivered, the firms said they have not so far supplied any of the food as low oil prices have affected the original delivery schedule.
In exchange, they have so far received more than 26 million barrels of Venezuelan oil for resale, according to PDVSA's export documents.
In just four months, Libre Abordo and Schlager increased their intake of PDVSA's oil from less than 3% to 39% of the Venezuelan company's total exports, which averaged 850,000 barrels per day in April.

The agreements threw a lifeline to Maduro, whose administration is struggling to afford imports of everything from food to medicine and industrial equipment.

546,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 01:35PM ET</span>",Myanmar's army investigating soldiers over video of abuses,"(Reuters) - Myanmar's army said on Wednesday it was investigating soldiers filmed beating and threatening to kill suspected insurgents in the western state of Rakhine, where dozens of people have been killed during an upsurge of fighting in recent weeks.
""It is found out that some of the security force members conducted unlawful interrogations,"" the army said in a statement posted on its website.
In footage shared widely on social media since Saturday, five men can be seen slumped on the floor of a boat, blindfolded, hands tied behind their backs, as men in military fatigues stamp on their chests and slap and kick their faces. The men whimper and plead that they are civilians.
""I am a civilian, sir,"" one says, according to subtitles in the video. ""What civilian? Why are you fighting against us?"" a soldier shouts, grabbing him by the hair and smacking his cheek. ""Let them die, let them break,"" says another. One man is hit repeatedly in the face with a shoe.
Reuters could not determine who filmed the video or independently verify its authenticity. The army said the video was shot on April 27 in Rakhine state's Ponnagyun township.
The military statement said the men who were beaten had been arrested on suspicion of belonging to the Arakan Army, an insurgent group fighting for greater autonomy for the western region. It said they were being transported to the state capital of Sittwe when the beatings happened.
Brigadier-General Zaw Min Tun, a spokesman for the armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, told Reuters by phone a tribunal had been formed and soldiers had been detained.
Zaw Min Tun said the men who were beaten were connected to the Arakan Army and were being held in Sittwe. He did not specify exactly where, which unit of the security forces was detaining them, whether they had been charged or whether they had legal representation.
Reuters was not able to contact the men or to establish whether they had lawyers. Police in Sittwe did not respond to a request for comment.
The Arakan Army, which Myanmar has designated a terrorist organization, did not immediately comment. 
A relative of one of the men in the video said he was not an insurgent. The relative, who asked not to be named for fear of retribution, said the family had met the man at Ponnagyun police station on Tuesday. Police in Ponnagyun did not respond to a request for comment.
The army said the men were from Kyauk Seik, a village where eight people were killed in mid-April. Two local officials and a resident said they were killed in a shelling, but the army said reports that civilians there had been shelled were fabricated.
Government troops have been battling fighters from the Arakan Army, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist majority, for more than a year in Rakhine and neighbouring Chin states. 
Dozens of people have been killed and tens of thousands displaced in a recent intensification of fighting, according to the United Nations.
Rakhine state is the region from where 730,000 ethnic Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority, fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during a military crackdown in 2017. 
Myanmar is facing charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice in the Hague over the violence, which the army says was a legitimate security operation against Muslim militants.

It was not clear if the soldier had intended to use his weapons to carry out an attack. Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said the military would not tolerate members who ""act in a radical way.""
The Dresden Prosecutor General said ""a large amount of evidence"" was confiscated during the raid at the property of the 45-year-old German man in Nordsachsen near Leipzig in the eastern state of Saxony.
He is suspected of violating Germany's Weapons Control Act.
The Dresden prosecutor said the raid had been carried out based on information from the army's counterintelligence unit.
It did not say if the soldier had been detained, but Kramp-Karrenbauer said he may no long wear an army uniform or enter military premises.
Germany is struggling to tackle a rise in far-right radicalism which has culminated in attacks including a shooting rampage in Hanau in February when a racist gunman killed 11 people, including migrants and himself.
This has coincided with efforts by the German army to root out extremism in its ranks after a scandal in 2017.
A report by the military intelligence in March said Germany had uncovered eight right-wing radicals in the armed forces and 27 individuals who have reservations about the post-war democratic constitution. 
The radicals were discovered after a military intelligence unit investigated 592 individuals suspected of holding broadly anti-constitutional views.
The investigations were prompted by the arrest in 2017 of an army officer who was suspected of planning a racially motivated attack. Legal proceedings in that case are continuing.
Also in 2017, Nazi memorabilia, including Nazi-era Wehrmacht helmets, was found at a barracks.
Given Germany's Nazi past, many lawmakers insist on ""zero tolerance"" for far-right extremism and have demanded action.

The details of the video surfaced on Tuesday and marked the latest political storm for Bolsonaro, a right-wing populist who has been widely criticized abroad for his handling of the coronavirus crisis.
Domestically, he is dealing with a more typical political crisis set off by the resignation last month of his former justice minister, Sergio Moro, who accused Bolsonaro of improper meddling in law enforcement. 
The video is a recording of a cabinet meeting on April 22 in which, according to a source familiar with its contents, Bolsonaro said he wanted to change the federal police chief in Rio because his family was being persecuted there. 
""If it's up to me, I'll release it,"" Bolsonaro told reporters on Wednesday. 
Bolsonaro said he never uttered the words ""federal police"" and ""investigation"" in the taped meeting, but that he did talk about the need for better security for his sons in Rio. 
One of his sons faces a criminal investigation in Rio by state police for suspicious financial transactions.
The video was shown on Tuesday to prosecutors and witnesses as part of an investigation into Moro's accusation of attempted meddling by Bolsonaro's police work. The former minister, who rose to fame for jailing former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on corruption grounds, said it confirmed his allegations of wrongdoing. 

Brazil's prosecutor general will decide whether to charge Bolsonaro with obstruction of justice or abuse of power. If the Supreme Court and two-thirds of the lower house of Congress see merit to any charges, he would be suspended from office and would stand trial before the top court.

KABUL (Reuters) - After struggling to get pregnant for years, Zainab, 27, gave birth to a baby boy on Tuesday morning at a small hospital in the southwestern corner of Kabul. She was overjoyed and named the boy Omid, meaning 'hope' in Dari.
At around 10 a.m. (0530 GMT), an hour before she and her family were set to return home to neighbouring Bamiyan province a three-hour drive away, three gunmen disguised as police burst into the hospital's maternity ward and started shooting.
Zainab, who rushed back from the washroom after hearing the commotion, collapsed as she took in the scene. She spent seven years trying to have a child, waited nine months to meet her son and had just four hours with him before he was killed.
""I brought my daughter-in-law to Kabul so that she would not lose her baby,"" said Zahra Muhammadi, Zainab's mother-in-law, unable to contain her grief. ""Today we'll take his dead body to Bamiyan.""
No group has claimed responsibility for the massacre of 24 people, including 16 women and two newborns. At least six babies lost their mothers in an attack that has shaken even the war-torn nation numbed by years of militant violence.
""In my more than 20-year career I have not witnessed such a horrific, brutal act,"" said Dr. Hassan Kamel, director of Ataturk Children's Hospital in Kabul.
The raid, on the same day that at least 32 people died in a suicide bomb attack on a funeral in the eastern province of Nangarhar, threatens to derail progress towards U.S.-brokered peace talks between the Taliban and the Afghan government.
President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attacks and ordered the military to switch to offensive mode rather than the defensive tactics it adopted while U.S. troops withdraw from the country after a long, inconclusive war.
The Taliban, the main militant group, has denied involvement in both attacks, although trust among officials and the broader public has worn thin. An offshoot of Islamic State is also among the suspects: it admitted it was behind the Nangarhar bloodshed.
WE NAMED HIM 'HOPE'
Muhammadi, the mother-in-law, said she saw one of the attackers firing at pregnant women and new mothers, even as they cowered under hospital beds.
""We gave him the name Omid. Hope for a better future, hope for a better Afghanistan and hope for a mother who has been struggling to have a child for years,"" she told Reuters by telephone in Kabul.
The gunmen then turned to target the cradle where Omid had been asleep. As the sound of bullets reverberated through the ward, Muhammadi said she fainted in fear. 
""When I opened my eyes, I saw that my grandson's body had fallen to the ground, covered in blood,"" she recalled, as she wailed with grief.
The Kabul attack began in the morning when gunmen entered the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital, throwing grenades and shooting, government officials said. Security forces had killed the attackers by the afternoon.
The 100-bed, government-run hospital hosted a maternity clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French name Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Just hours before the attack, MSF had tweeted a photo of a newborn in his mother's arms at the clinic after being delivered safely by emergency caesarean section.
On Wednesday, the group condemned the attack, calling it ""sickening"" and ""cowardly"".
""Whilst fighting was ongoing, one woman gave birth to her baby and both are doing well,"" MSF said in a statement. ""More than ever, MSF stands in solidarity with the Afghan people.""
Deborah Lyons, head of the U.N. mission in Afghanistan, condemned the hospital assault in a tweet. ""Who attacks newborn babies and new mothers? Who does this? The most innocent of innocents, a baby! Why?""
'LITTLE POINT' IN PEACE TALKS
In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday condemned the two attacks, noted the Taliban had denied responsibility and said the lack of a peace deal left the country vulnerable to such violence.
Pompeo also described the stalled peace effort, which planned for intra-Afghan peace talks to begin on March 10, as ""a critical opportunity for Afghans to ... build a united front against the menace of terrorism."" Talks have yet to start.
The Pentagon declined to comment on Ghani's stated intent to restart offensive operations, saying only that the U.S. military continued to reserve the right to defend Afghan security forces if they are attacked by the Taliban.
Relations between the government in Kabul and the Taliban movement, which was ousted from power in 2001 by a U.S.-backed assault in response to the Sept. 11 attacks, are already frayed, and Tuesday's events will make any rapprochement harder.
""There seems little point in continuing to engage Taliban in 'peace talks',"" Afghan National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib said in a tweet.
For Afghanistan, the hospital attack also risks further disrupting a healthcare network that is creaking amid the challenges of dealing with the new coronavirus pandemic.
More than a third of the coronavirus cases in Kabul have been among doctors and healthcare staff, Reuters reported in early May.
The high rate of infection among healthcare workers has already sparked alarm among medics and some doctors have closed their clinics. At least 5,226 people have been infected by the coronavirus and 132 have died, according to the health ministry.
KABUL MEDICAL COMMUNITY SHAKEN
The attack has shaken the small medical community in Kabul to its core.
Nurses and doctors who survived the hospital attack said they were in shock, and resuming duties would be an emotional challenge on top of the uncertainty caused by the pandemic.
""Last night I could not sleep, as scary scenes of the attack kept crossing my mind,"" said Masouma Qurbanzada, a midwife who saw the killings.
""Since yesterday my family has been telling me to stop working in the hospital, nothing is worth my life. But I told them 'No, I will not stop working as a health worker'.""
Officials at MSF said they were working to try to normalise operations and had received support from other hospitals to treat dozens of infants and adults wounded in the attack.
Some medics at the hospital, however, said it would be hard to move on.
""The gunmen blew up a water tank and then started shooting women. I saw a pool of water and blood from the small gap of a safe room where some of us managed to lock ourselves,"" said a nurse with MSF, who spoke on condition of anonymity.

""I saw patients being killed even as they begged and pleaded for their life in the holy month of Ramadan. It is very hard for me to work now.""

""We're really pleased to be back,"" said Josh Novell, 23, manager of the Polhill Garden Centre near Sevenoaks, southeast England.
""These months are our bread and butter. The sun was out over the Easter weekend and normally we would be jumping up and down excited about that.""
The centre would normally see as many as 4,000 customers pass through its doors on a busy day but distancing restrictions have limited numbers and imposed their own difficulties.
""It's definitely not business as usual,"" said Novell. 
""We think we've made it as safe as we possibly can.""
The centre has had to create a one-way system, install shields around the tills, and ship in lots of hand sanitizer and personal protection equipment for staff.
Now Novell and many other garden centre managers are waiting to see how soon other aspects of their businesses, such as their restaurants and play areas, can reopen.
Neither have all staff on furlough been able to return to work yet.

Belgium, with a population of 11.5 million, is among the European nations worst hit by COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, but it began a phased easing of the restrictions at the start of May.
Wilmes said the reopening of non-food shops this week had proceeded smoothly even if there were now queues outside some stores.
""We have taken a new step, for some too big, for others too small. Improvements are coming, but we must be patient. We cannot do everything at once,"" Wilmes told a news conference.
Belgium, whose capital Brussels hosts the headquarters of the European Union and the NATO military alliance, has so far reported 53,981 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 8,843 deaths.
However, the rate of new cases, hospital admissions and deaths has fallen steadily from early April peaks and the government's team of health experts on Wednesday described the trend as ""encouraging"".
From next Monday, primary and secondary schools will restart smaller classes of final-year pupils under strict social distancing rules.
Museums, historical buildings and zoos can also admit their first visitors from Monday, although they will have to sell time-specific tickets online and set up a one-way system showing how people must move through their rooms and galleries.
Hairdressers and beauty salons will reopen for appointments only. Markets comprising up to 50 stalls will be allowed, with masked stall-holders and one-way systems of passage marked out.
Sports clubs will resume training in the presence of a coach and with no more than 20 people present. Libraries too can reopen.
However, cafes, restaurants and sports and cultural centres will have to remain closed for at least another three weeks. No sports or cultural events will take place before June 30.

CAIRO (Reuters) - While Egypt's economy has stumbled due to the coronavirus outbreak, construction at a new capital taking shape east of Cairo is continuing at full throttle after a short pause to adjust working practices, officials say. 
The level of activity at the desert site - where trucks rumble down newly built roads and cranes swing over unfinished apartment blocks - reflects the new city's political importance even as the government grapples with the pandemic.
Known as the New Administrative Capital, it is the biggest of a series of mega-projects championed by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi as a source of growth and jobs. 
Soon after coronavirus began to spread, Sisi postponed moving the first civil servants to the new city and moved back the opening of a national museum adjoining the pyramids to next year. 
Productivity dipped as companies adapted to health guidelines and some labourers stayed home. 
But officials have sought to keep the mega-projects going to protect jobs, and after 10 days of slowdown construction had fully resumed at the new capital with a shift system, said Amr Khattab, spokesman for the Housing Ministry, which along with the military owns the company building the city.
""The proportion of the labour force that is present on site doesn't exceed 70%, so that the workers don't get too close,"" he said as he showed off the R5 neighbourhood, which includes about 24,000 housing units. ""We work less intensively, but we do two shifts."" 
Sisi, who publicly quizzes officials responsible for infrastructure projects about timetables and costs, launched the new capital in 2015.
Designed as a high-tech smart city that will house 6.5 million people and relieve congestion in Cairo, it includes government and business districts, a giant park, and a diplomatic quarter as yet unbuilt.
One senior official said last year the cost of the whole project was about $58 billion. While some Egyptians see the new capital as a source of pride, others see it as extravagant and built to benefit a cocooned elite. 
'RUNNING ON TIME' 
""We have clear instructions from his excellency the president that the postponement of the opening is not a delay to the project,"" said Khattab. ""The project is running on time.""
Disinfection and other protective measures were visible at the construction site 45km (30 miles) east of the Nile, though some workers were only ordered to don masks when journalists started filming and others drove by crammed into a minibus. Egypt has confirmed more than 10,000 coronavirus cases, but none at the new capital.
Delays in payments to contractors and to imported supplies were additional risks, said Shams Eldin Youssef, a member of Egypt's union for construction contractors. Khattab said the government had contractors' payments in hand.
The Housing Ministry expects to deliver two residential districts by late 2021, while the business district should be finished by early 2022, said Ahmed al-Araby, deputy head of the new capital's development authority. Private developers and the army are building six other neighbourhoods.
In the government district, which Khattab said was 90% complete, ministry buildings fronted with vertical strips of white stone and darkened glass lead to an open area being planted with palm trees and mini obelisks in front of a domed parliament building.
To one side a large, low-rise presidential palace is under construction. 
Sisi has urged people seeking work to head to new cities being built around the country, including the new capital, which Khattab said employs some 250,000 workers. 
Critics have questioned the diversion of resources away from existing cities, including Cairo, parts of which are in slow decay.
""The question about how rational this is - whether it makes sense economically, whether it is doable, whether it's the best course of action - this question is not even asked,"" Ezzedine Fishere, an Egyptian writer and senior lecturer at Dartmouth College in the United States, said by phone. 
On the other side of Cairo at the new museum next to the Giza pyramids, work has also been continuing at a slower pace. 

In mid-April staffing levels sank to about 40%, with plans to recover gradually to 100%, said General Atef Muftah, who oversees the project.

MAENNEDORF, Switzerland (Reuters) - Love led a young Swiss doctor to emigrate to South Africa, his wife's home country. Years later, love for his disabled child brought him back to Switzerland.
The know-how Stefan Metzker gained on his journey - first as a Cape Town intensive care specialist, then supplying African doctors with Chinese-made surgical scrubs and now as a Swiss hospital CEO - prepared him to help when COVID-19 struck.
Answering a call from Zurich officials desperate for face masks, surgical gowns and gloves, Metzker leveraged a Chinese business contact he had forged decades ago to secure 23 million items of medical gear.
Since April, passenger-turned-cargo jets belonging to Lufthansa unit Swiss Air Lines have made 15 non-stop flights from Shanghai to Zurich.
The 16th and final flight, with the last of what amounted to 230 tons of equipment, is due later this month.
""I wouldn't have recommended it if I hadn't known the people in China for years through my activities in South Africa,"" Metzker, 59, told Reuters.
""Based on trust, and the long relationship I had, it was possible to pay up front. That allowed us to secure large volumes at reasonable prices, at a time when raw materials were extremely scarce.""
Business leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s Tim Cook, Twitter's Jack Dorsey and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM)'s Marc Benioff have used connections or pledged personal wealth to secure medical supplies or finance coronavirus relief.
The air bridge Metzker helped organise underscores how people far from the limelight have also tapped their experience to make a difference.
SWITZERLAND TO SOUTH AFRICA
After apartheid's collapse, Metzker and his wife, Christine, left Switzerland in 1995 for Cape Town's Tygerberg Hospital, for a job treating intensive care patients.
There, he watched aghast as surgeons clad only in traditional cotton scrubs became soaked with blood of patients, many of whom had AIDS.
Since South African hospitals could not afford expensive protective clothing, Metzker said he enlisted university partners in the early 2000s to develop affordable, re-usable medical textiles.
""We developed a fabric to protect us against blood and body fluids,"" Metzker said. ""Through this business, I made relationships with international suppliers.""
In 2009, however, Metzker's family returned to Switzerland so his son, who has a severe neurological disease, could safely attend school in his electric wheelchair. Metzker took a job as CEO of Spital Maennedorf, a 150-bed, 950-employee hospital on Lake Zurich.
As COVID-19 rolled over Switzerland in February and March, officials in Zurich feared a three-month protective equipment supply in the nation's emergency stockpile would not last.
With nations everywhere clamoring for equipment, Zurich's government pharmacy put out an all-points bulletin, asking for help from anybody who could get their hands on masks, gloves and scrubs.
Metzker remembered his Chinese contacts and stepped forward.
""I thought to myself, ""Oh, man! It can't be that a country like Switzerland is heading toward a disaster without the protective material we need,"" he said.
There were challenges. 
A sudden change in Chinese regulations stalled one early April shipment at Shanghai customs before the Swiss consulate in China intervened to finally get the plane aloft, the Swiss Foreign Ministry said.
Zurich officials acknowledged Metzker's role in the deliveries but did not comment on details including their cost. Metzker said the regional government reacted swiftly, paying in advance after he reassured them the Chinese supplies would come through.
RISING PRICES
Zurich opted to have gear shipped directly from Shanghai, not via another country, for fear other governments might seize it. Germany accused the United States of ""modern piracy"" in early April in a case of masks diverted from an airport in Bangkok.
There was another reason for haste: Prices were rising as demand skyrocketed. A surgical gown he bought for less than $2 now costs about $8, Metzker said.
Metzker's hospital doubled the number of ICU beds with ventilators to 12, though they were never completely filled.
Still, he said, it was ""mind-blowing"" just how much protective equipment was needed, with doctors and nurses discarding layer after layer every shift.
With Zurich-area hospitals' shelves now stocked and COVID-19 infections waning, Metzker believes they are prepared should the virus flare up again, which some fear as Switzerland joins other countries in gradually relaxing restrictions.

""We probably could even afford the luxury of shipping by sea or by train in the future,"" Metzker said. ""We're ready for a second wave, if there is one.""

Babis said the neighbours were thinking about how to open their borders at the start of the summer tourist season after making similar progress in controlling the coronavirus pandemic. Measures to stop the virus spreading have stalled economic activity worldwide. 
""I think it could somehow work out that on June 8 or 15, our three countries would open together,"" Babis said in online interview at blesk.cz news website.
The three are among at least 17 members of the ""Schengen"" area, where borders are normally invisible between 26 EU and other European countries, to impose emergency controls since March to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Babis said negotiations were not currently underway with Germany, the Czech Republic's biggest trading partner, to lift travel restrictions because the coronavirus situation there was not as stable as in its other neighbours.
The European Union pushed on Wednesday for a safe reopening of borders, while insisting on protective measures such as masks on planes, to try to salvage the lucrative summer season for the ravaged tourism sector as coronavirus infections recede.
Nearly all travel has been halted in Europe, a devastating blow for tourism, which normally contributes almost one-tenth of the EU's economic output.
The Czech Republic, which had reported 8,223 cases of coronavirus as of Wednesday morning with 284 deaths, has eased restrictions in recent weeks to allow travel across the border under certain conditions.

This includes EU business travellers and students as well as some non-EU citizens for seasonal and healthcare work.

GYONGYOSPATA, Hungary (Reuters) - Hungarian minority Roma said on Wednesday they felt vindicated by a court ruling that a school had unlawfully segregated Roma children for years and the award of $310,000 in compensation, but they feared renewed tension.
Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, at odds with the European Union for his perceived erosion of the rule of law, sparked protests when he hinted in January that the state should disobey any court order to pay restitution to the Roma and provide training instead.
The Kuria (Supreme Court) case involved an elementary school in Gyongyospata, an eastern town that has been a flashpoint of ethnic tensions which have hit other schools.
""It's important that we too can be right at last,"" said Niki Csemer, 20, who was a student at the time the school operated separate classes for Roma and majority white students between 2003 and 2017.
According to a 2011 report by minority rights ombudsman Erno Kallai, the school kept classes for Roma on the ground floor and white classes on the upper floors. 
""Gypsy classes were placed in clusters, away from the other classes,"" Kallai wrote in his report, demanding that the school end the practice.
Csemer, whose attended the school, said she felt vindicated.
""For once we are not oppressed and the courts, even the Supreme Court, is on our side,"" she told Reuters.
Csemer's husband, David Berki, 22, went to the same school. He expects ethnic tension to rise because majority whites will not accept the payments to the Roma, working out at around $5,000 per child.
""They will pick us apart, but we'll take it in stride,"" he said. ""There will be no kind of peace here.""
Roma believe their education has been sub-standard.
""If you count it, each kid will get about 1.5 million forints ($5,000),"" said Geza Csemer, Niki's uncle and the chair of the local Roma government. ""Would you give up your education for that? Knowledge is forever, and these kids were denied that.""
Roma in Hungary live in disproportionate poverty, suffer from prejudice in schools and workplaces and have been subject to intimidation and occasionally deadly violence by the far right, rights activists say.
Ilona, a retiree who declined to give her last name, said her grandchildren went to the Gyongyospata school and the classes were separated based on academic performance, not race.
""What kind of a court is this, slapping this village with that amount of fine?"" she asked. ""This is not fair.""

The Islamist Boko Haram insurgency erupted in northeastern Nigeria in 2009 and continues to grind on, with attacks frequently spilling over into Chad, Niger and Cameroon a little further to the south.
The operations on Monday followed a series of Boko Haram attacks on military positions near the southeastern Nigerien border town of Diffa, the ministry said in a statement late on Tuesday.
It said 25 insurgents were killed in fighting around 75 km (46.6 miles) south of Diffa and a further 50 in air and artillery strikes by joint Nigerien, Nigerian and Chadian forces in the Lake Chad area. 
It added that weapons were seized and a logistics base used by the insurgents destroyed.
The U.N. refugee agency said on Tuesday violence in northwestern Nigeria had forced about 23,000 people to flee into Niger since April and raised concerns about the deteriorating security situation in that region.

Azimjon Askarov's imprisonment sparked a spat with the United States in 2015 when Washington granted him a human rights award. Almazbek Atambayev, Kyrgyz president at the time, responded by terminating a cooperation accord with the United States; a new one is yet to be signed.
Askarov, a 69-year-old ethnic Uzbek, was convicted of organising mass disturbances and stirring up ethnic hatred leading to the death of a policeman during clashes in southern Kyrgyzstan in June 2010, when more than 400 people were killed.
The Supreme Court, which heard the appeal by Askarov, a journalist and human rights activist, said in a brief ruling on Wednesday it had been rejected.
Hoping for change under Atambayev's successor, Sooronbai Jeenbekov, several human rights groups this year asked the Kyrgyz leadership to release Askarov.

The tentative step, aimed partly at helping the tourism sector, comes as the European Commission prepares to urge a return to ""unrestricted free movement"", though that push will stop if there is a major second wave of infections.
Germany introduced lockdowns in mid-March, early in the outbreak, and has managed to keep the death rate per capita relatively low compared to many of its European neighbours.
Seehofer said that blanket border controls agreed with France, Switzerland and Austria due to end on May 15 would be extended to June 15, but as many crossings as possible would be reopened and systematic checks would give way to spot checks.   
""The goal is that from mid-June we want to have free travel in Europe,"" he said, adding that controls could be re-imposed if there are new outbreaks.
Earlier, Austria said its border with Germany would fully reopen in a month. The Alpine country has been lobbying Germany hard to reopen the border, not least to boost its important tourism industry.
Germany's border with Luxembourg can be completely opened and Seehofer said he was also ready to reopen crossings to Denmark from May 15 but that no formal agreement had been reached yet.
Controls at the EU's external borders will remain until June 15, said Seehofer, adding it was too early to ease controls with Italy and that he would have big problems allowing travel to the United States. Both have been harder hit by the crisis. 
However, he said he could imagine that people in safe parts of China could re-enter Germany after June 15.

In an indication of the toll the pandemic is having on the travel sector, tour operator TUI said earlier it needs to reduce its fixed cost base by 30% and cut thousands of jobs in response to the crisis.

The comments came in response to rights group Amnesty International, which said in a report that the campaign that has seen 55,000 people arrested had led to torture and caused dangerous prison overcrowding while fuelling corruption.
Amnesty cited interviews with dozens of people who described arbitrary arrests by police and torture in prison and drug treatment centres.
Khieu Sopheak, a spokesman for the Ministry of Interior, acknowledged that human rights may have been violated but defended the drug war.
""When it is an anti-drug campaign, there is never a respect for human rights,"" Khieu Sopheak told Reuters. 
""During the anti-drug campaign, human rights need be put aside, so it is clean,"" he said.
The spokesman denied, however, Amnesty's assertion that police made arbitrary arrests and solicited bribes from detainees to keep them out of prison.
Cambodia's prison population has soared by 78% since 2017, and its largest prison, known as CC1, has 9,500 inmates – nearly five times its estimated capacity, Amnesty said, calling the overcrowding a dangerous breeding ground for disease such as COVID-19.
Nearly 60% of all inmates in Cambodian prisons are held on drug-related charges, the rights group said.
Chin Malin (OTC:MLLNF), a spokesman at the Ministry of Justice, told Reuters the government planned to announce measures to address prison overcrowding next week.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia on Wednesday suspended the use of some Russian-made medical ventilators after two fatal hospital fires reported to involve the machines, a setback in its fight against the novel coronavirus. 
The ventilators' safety was called into question a day earlier after a fire at Saint George's Hospital in St Petersburg in which five people died. That followed another fire at a hospital in Moscow which killed one person on Saturday.
In both cases, sources told the TASS news agency that the source of the fires had been faulty Aventa-M ventilators. 
Authorities have procured hundreds of Aventa-Ms to help hospitals cope with coronavirus patients. Though Russia has so far suffered a low number of virus-related deaths compared to other countries, at 242,271 its infections tally is now the second highest in the world after the United States. 
Russia sent a batch of the same ventilators to the United States in early April, though U.S. officials say the machines were not needed in the end.
Roszdravnadzor, the state healthcare regulator, said in a statement it was suspending the use in Russia of all such machines made after April 1.
It gave no explanation for the suspension, but noted that the ventilators had been used in the two hospitals where the recent fires had taken place which it said a day earlier it was looking into. 
It was not immediately clear exactly how many new ventilators the suspension would cover.
Public procurement data cited by the Interfax news agency said that the Saint George Hospital in St Petersburg spent 441 million roubles ($6 million) last month on buying 237 Aventa-M ventilators. 
The procurement contract was finalised on April 24, it said. Each ventilator cost 1.86 million roubles.
The ventilators are made at the Urals Instrument Engineering Plant (UPZ) in the region of Sverdlovsk. 
Radio-Electronic Technologies Concern (KRET), which controls UPZ, said on Tuesday that its ventilators had passed all the necessary tests and had been used by medical facilities in Russia since 2012 without any safety concerns.
It urged people to avoid rushing to conclusions until the outcome of official investigations into the fires was known.

Land borders with France and Portugal have been closed since a state of emergency was declared in mid-March to fight the pandemic, pushing the economy to a near stand-still and hitting its key tourism sector hard.
Spain has started easing the lockdown for its residents as the pandemic gets under control and decided in parallel to apply a two-week quarantine for foreign travellers, practically shutting the border to air and maritime travel to avoid importing new cases from other countries.
The quarantine measure is due to expire on May 24 when the state of emergency lapses, but both can be extended. In any case, restrictions on travel are likely to remain in place for much longer than May 24, no matter how crucial tourism is for the Spanish economy, the sources told Reuters.

China says that Taiwan is part of ""one China"", and that this principle must be accepted by any country with which it has diplomatic relations. Arms sales to Taiwan are always highly sensitive and regularly prompt a strong reaction from Beijing. 
Taiwan is mostly equipped with U.S.-made weapons, but in 1991 France sold Taiwan six Lafayette frigates, to China's anger. France also sold Taiwan 60 Mirage fighter jets in 1992.
Taiwan last month said it was seeking to buy equipment from France to upgrade the ships' missile interference system.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said China resolutely opposed any arms sales to Taiwan.
""We have already expressed our serious concern to France,"" he told a daily news briefing.
""We again urge the French side to abide by the one China principle and withdraw the arms sale plan to Taiwan to avoid harming Sino-French relations.""
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said in response on Wednesday that the navy has said it is following related procurement regulations for the arm purchase to meet its ""combat needs"". It declined further comment.
Taiwan says it needs to upgrade its armed forces to deal with the growing threat from China, which has in recent months stepped up its military drills near the democratic island.
China describes Taiwan as its most sensitive and important territorial issue, and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Taiwan has shown no interest in being ruled by autocratic China.

A notice published in the government gazette on May 11 alters the circumstances under which South African officials can perform inspections to verify that customers are not transferring weapons to third parties.
Some of the main buyers of South African arms, including governments in the Gulf and North Africa, had refused to agree to the inspections because they considered them a violation of their sovereignty.
Reuters reported in February that the government was planning to change the inspection clause in an arms export document following months of lobbying by defence firms and trade unions who said thousands of jobs were at stake.
The clause will now read: ""It is agreed that on-site verification of the controlled items may be performed, through diplomatic process,"" according to the notice signed by Defence Minister Nosiviwe Mapisa-Nqakula. 
The previous wording of the clause had been: ""It is agreed that on-site verification of the controlled items may be performed by an inspector designated by the minister.""
Defence sources have told Reuters that countries including the UAE are more comfortable with the new wording, which should unlock the stalled weapons exports. 
That is a boost to state defence firm Denel, which said last week that the COVID-19 pandemic and the government's subsequent lockdown of the economy had brought its operations to a standstill. Denel also has a local joint venture with Germany's Rheinmetall, Rheinmetall Denel Munition, that stands to benefit from the new wording.
In the meantime, however, South Africa's defence sector has been upended by production and export disruptions caused by the pandemic.
South Africa, whose arms industry traces its roots to the apartheid era, manufactures defence products from ammunition to missiles and armoured vehicles for its own military and countries around the world. 
Saudi Arabia and the UAE have between them bought at least a third of its arms exports in recent years, at a time that they have been engaged in a war in Yemen.

Last week, the speaker approved a motion seeking a vote of no confidence in Muhyiddin's leadership, brought by 94-year-old Mahathir Mohamad who resigned as prime minister in February as his ruling coalition fell apart due to political wrangling.

Dubai, the most populous of the seven emirates that make up the UAE, on April 24 eased a full curfew to eight hours at night, and allowed dine-in restaurants and shopping malls to reopen at limited capacity.
Public parks are now open for groups of up to five people, state news agency WAM reported late on Tuesday. Hotel guests must practise physical distancing at beaches. 
Tram and ferry services also resumed and groups of up to five can now practise recreational activities in open areas. Mosques, cinemas, public beaches and nightclubs remain closed.
Other emirates have followed Dubai in easing restrictions. In the UAE capital Abu Dhabi, some malls have resumed business, while Sharjah reopened malls and dine-in restaurants.
The UAE has so far reported 19,661 infections and 203 deaths from the virus, the second highest death toll among six Gulf states. It does not disclose numbers for individual emirates.
The UAE, like other Gulf Arab countries, had ramped up testing after recording a spread of the disease among low-wage migrant workers living in overcrowded accommodation.
On Tuesday, the UAE announced that tests would now be free for all Emirati citizens and domestic workers, in addition to the disabled, pregnant women and residents over 50 years of age.

576,By Reuters,"<span>May 13, 2020 03:10AM ET</span>",Murder case claims turbulent career of veteran Lesotho PM,"By Tim Cocks
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A love triangle murder case that made front page news proved one problem too many for Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, who survived repeated security crises to become Lesotho's dominant politician but is expected to submit his resignation on Wednesday. 
The 80-year-old's ruling coalition collapsed in parliament on Monday, leaving him until May 22 to leave office. On Tuesday night French news agency AFP quoted him as saying he would inform King Letsie III of his intention to leave in a letter the following day.
His departure brings down the curtain on a career marked by exile, political feuding, intrigue and strains with the military. 
Thabane leaves nearly three years after the event that stunned his fellow citizens and overshadowed his second term in office, the unsolved killing of his then wife Lipolelo in June 2017.
Police this year accused his current wife, Maesaiah, of assassinating Lipolelo. Police also accuse Thabane of being involved, but have yet to bring their charges to court.
Both he and Maesaiah have repeatedly denied having anything to do with the killing of Lipolelo, who was shot dead while driving her car towards her home just outside of the capital.
But the charges plunged the country into turmoil and battered Thabane's prestige and influence. Voices in his own party began pushing for him to be declared unfit for office. 
It is not the first time Thabane, a stocky, shaven-headed figure fond of quoting Bible passages, has been at the centre of intrigue.
In 2014, he fled the mountainous kingdom to neighbouring South Africa after accusing the military of having staged a coup against him, which the military denied at the time. South African security forces had to escort him back.
Thabane was born on May 28, 1939, in what was then Britain's colony of Basutoland, composed of mountains running along South Africa's Drakensberg range. Lesotho is often nicknamed the 'kingdom in the sky' because its lowest point of elevation is higher than any other nation's.
Though small and with a population of not much more than 2 million, its political upheavals often draw in its bigger neighbour, South Africa, a parched country that gets essential supplies of tap water from Lesotho's well-rained mountains.
MILITARY JUNTA
Thabane began his career in the civil service in 1966, the year of Lesotho's independence. He stayed there for two decades before the military seized power in a 1986 coup, one of several since independence.
The military junta promoted him, making him foreign, and then information, minister, effectively launching his political career. Thabane later helped negotiate a return to civilian rule and repatriation of exiles, culminating in elections in 1993.
In the next poll, in 1998, he won a seat in parliament and became foreign minister. Months later, accusations of electoral fraud triggered rioting, and Nelson Mandela, then president of South Africa, deployed troops to try to quell it, which they failed to do, pulling out after seven months. 
In 2006, after several ministerial posts in the LCD ruling party, Thabane left to form his own, the All Basotho Convention (ABC), enabling him to take power as prime minister in 2012. 
In the same year, he filed for divorce from his wife, Lipolelo, so that he could marry his then lover, Maesaiah. Lipolelo refused, and a very public spat erupted between the two rivals for his affections that sometimes ended up in court.
Less than a year after the alleged coup against him, Thabane failed to retain his majority in a 2015 election. He resigned as premier before fleeing again to South Africa, whose security forces he saw as his only protection against his own military. 
He spent much of his time there, at his house in the town of Ficksberg, where he often lived while in opposition, until a subsequent poll brought him to power again on June 3, 2017.
Asked in 2017 what was the worst problem his country faced, he replied, ""Abject poverty"". He said his party's motto was ""Man's biggest enemy is hunger"".
In the same month, on June 14, say police, a gang of eight gunmen shot Lipolelo in the head, killing her instantly. Two days later, Thabane was sworn in as prime minister for a second time. He married Measaiah a month later.
When police named him and Measaiah as suspects in Lipolelo's murder earlier this year, he came under pressure to resign. 
He promised to do so by the end of July, but several members of his now divided ABC party demanded he go immediately.

On Feb. 21, the day he was due to appear in court on charges of murdering Lipolelo, he again crossed into South Africa, his aides said for medical reasons, but returned days later.

Pompeo landed at Ben Gurion Airport for a one-day visit during which he will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his designated coalition partner, Benny Gantz.
The envoy, David Friedman, tested negative for the coronavirus, a State Department spokeswoman said.
Friedman experienced ""mild upper respiratory symptoms"" and was therefore asked by medical staff to avoid proximity to Pompeo, media added, quoting a statement from the U.S. embassy in Israel.
Topics to feature in talks will be the virus pandemic outbreak and regional tensions with Iran, Pompeo said on Twitter after his arrival.

579,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",U.S. commission says Taiwan's WHO exclusion caused lives to be lost,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Lives have been lost in the coronavirus pandemic because of the World Health Organization's (WHO) exclusion of Taiwan and refusal to allow it to share best practices and information, a top U.S. government commission on China said in a new report.
The United States has repeatedly clashed with China over its refusal to allow non-WHO member Taiwan, claimed by China as one of its provinces, full access to the body, becoming another source of rising tensions between Washington and Beijing.
Taiwan says China and the WHO have conspired for political purposes to lock it out of key meetings, that the WHO has not responded to its requests for coronavirus information and that the WHO has previously misreported Taiwan's virus case numbers.
The WHO and China strongly dispute this, saying Taiwan has been given all the help it needs, but that only China has the right to represent the democratic island in the WHO.
In a report released on Tuesday, the U.S. Congress' U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission said Taiwan's exclusion contributed to ""critical delays"" in timely receipt and accurate guidance for WHO members in the early stages of the outbreak. 
""Had the WHO allowed Taiwan's health experts to share information and best practices in early January, governments around the world could have had more complete information on which to base their public health policies,"" it said. 
One of Taiwan's main complaints is that the WHO ignored its request for information in late December on the potential for human-to-human transmission. The WHO has said Taiwan's email it received made no mention of human-to-human transmission.
China confirmed virus transmission between people on Jan. 20. On Jan. 12, the WHO had said there was no clear evidence of such transmission.
""In this respect, the WHO's suppression of information provided by Taiwan and the delayed issuance of its own guidance undermined the national security of the very member states trusting it for authoritative public health guidance,"" the U.S. commission said. 
""The lives lost as a result of these missteps offer a tragic reminder of how global health is compromised by the WHO's politically-motivated exclusion of Taiwan,"" it added.
Taiwan, with the strong backing of the United States and some of its major allies, is lobbying to be allowed access as an observer to next week's meeting of the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly.
But China says it won't support this and the WHO says it has no mandate on its own to invite Taiwan.
Taiwan has reported only 440 coronavirus cases and seven deaths, far lower than many of its neighbours, thanks to early and effective prevention work and its first rate health system.

580,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 07:31PM ET</span>","On tape, Bolsonaro cites protecting his family in push to swap top Rio cop: source","By Ricardo Brito
BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro said in an April cabinet meeting that he needed to change Rio de Janeiro's chief of the federal police to protect family members under investigation, a person with knowledge of a video of the meeting told Reuters.
The video was shown on Tuesday to investigators looking into accusations by former Justice Minister Sergio Moro, who resigned two days after the cabinet meeting, alleging Bolsonaro was trying to interfere in law enforcement for personal motives.
The fresh evidence in the federal investigation of the president fanned a political crisis distracting Bolsonaro from a widely criticized response to the coronavirus pandemic, eroding his popularity and rattling financial markets. 
In the video, the president said his family was being persecuted and he wanted to change the federal police chief in his hometown, or else he would replace the police force's national director and the justice minister, the source said.
Lawyers for Moro said Tuesday that the video ""entirely confirmed"" his allegations against the president.
Bolsonaro told reporters he is not worried about the investigation authorized by the Supreme Court into Moro's accusations, adding that the federal police had never investigated his family. He said the words ""federal police"" did not come up on the recording in question, which he said should have been destroyed.
After transcribing the video and interviewing ministers involved, Brazil's prosecutor general will decide whether to charge the president with obstruction of justice and abuse of power. If the Supreme Court and two-thirds of the lower house of Congress see merit to any charges, Bolsonaro would be suspended from office and would stand trial before the top court.
Bolsonaro has begun to court political power brokers he once decried as corrupt in a bid to survive his worst political crisis since taking office last year vowing to clean up Brazilian politics.
Support for the right-wing leader has dropped as he has played down the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic in Brazil, a poll released on Tuesday showed. Brazil now has the worst outbreak of any developing nation.
The mounting political and public health crises spooked nervous investors, driving Brazil's benchmark Bovespa stock index 1.5% lower on Tuesday and pushing the exchange rate to a record low as long-term interest rates jumped.
""My investment advice would be not to run into a burning building. Right now, Brazil is best left to the specialists, crazies, long-term opportunists and those without other options,"" said Armando Castelar, research coordinator at the Brazilian Institute of Economics (IBRE/FGV) in Rio de Janeiro.
Moro traveled to Brasilia to watch the video in person at a federal police facility, alongside his lawyer and others involved in the case.

""It is extremely relevant to the public interest that the whole of this video come out,"" one of his lawyers, Rodrigo Sanchez Rios, said in a statement.

581,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 06:45PM ET</span>",Russia slams U.S. assertion at U.N. that it remains party to Iran nuclear deal,"By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Russia's U.N. ambassador slammed the United States on Tuesday as ""ridiculous"" for arguing it was still a member of the Iran nuclear deal two years after it quit, so Washington could trigger a return of all United Nations sanctions on Tehran.
The United States, Russia, China, Germany, Britain and France in 2015 agreed to the deal with Iran that prevents Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in return for sanctions relief.
The U.N. Security Council enshrined the deal in a resolution that still names the United States as a participant, even though it left. U.S. President Donald Trump quit the agreement in 2018 and described the accord from Barack Obama's presidency as “the worst deal ever.”
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, however, said last month the language in the resolution was ""unambiguous"" and ""the rights that accrue to participants in the U.N. Security Council resolution are fully available to all those participants.""
He was referring to the ability of a participant to the nuclear deal - known as the JCPOA - to trigger a so-called snapback of all U.N. sanctions on Iran.
""This is ridiculous,"" Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told reporters. ""They are not members, they have no right to trigger,"" he said. 
Diplomats say the United States would face a messy battle if it tries to trigger a return of sanctions, which includes an arms embargo on Iran. It was not immediately clear how or if a Security Council member could stop such a move. 
Nebenzia said the United States should consider whether it would be worth it. 
""Snapback will definitely be the end of the JCPOA ... The most intrusive inspections of a country by the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) will cease,"" he warned. ""Is it in the U.S. interests that it happens?""
The United States has raised with the European parties to the deal the possibility of restoring sanctions if it is unable to get the 15-member Security Council to stop an arms embargo on Iran from expiring in October.
A resolution to do so needs nine yes votes and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, France or Britain.

Asked if Russia would veto such a resolution, Nebenzia said: ""I never answer questions before the right time comes, but you may make a wild guess ... I do not see any reason why an arms embargo should be imposed on Iran.""

KABUL/JALALABAD (Reuters) - Gunmen disguised as police attacked a hospital in the Afghan capital Kabul on Tuesday, killing 16 people including two newborn babies from a maternity clinic run by the international humanitarian organisation Doctors Without Borders.
In a separate attack the same day, a suicide bomber struck the funeral of a police commander, attended by government officials and a member of parliament, in the eastern province of Nangahar, killing at least 24 people and injuring 68. Authorities said that toll could rise.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for either attack. The Taliban, Afghanistan's main Islamist insurgency group which says it has halted attacks on cities under a U.S. troop withdrawal deal, denied involvement in both.
The Islamic State militant group operates in Nangahar and has carried out a number of high-profile attacks in Kabul in recent months. On Monday security forces arrested its regional leader in the capital.
The violence, as the country battles the coronavirus pandemic, risks derailing movement towards U.S.-brokered peace talks between the Taliban and an Afghan government long sceptical of the insurgents' renunciation of attacks.
Ministry of Interior photos showed two young children lying dead inside the hospital. An image showed a woman who had been killed lying on the ground still holding tightly to her baby, who a nurse in the unit confirmed to Reuters had survived and had been moved to an intensive care unit at another hospital.
President Ashraf Ghani condemned the attacks and said he had ordered the military to switch to offensive mode rather than the defensive stance it had adopted as the United States withdraws troops and tries to broker the talks.
""In order to provide security for public places and to thwart attacks and threats from the Taliban and other terrorist groups, I am ordering Afghan security forces to switch from an active defence mode to an offensive one and to start their operations against the enemies,"" he said in a televised speech. 
Meanwhile National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib said on Twitter: ""there seems little point in continuing to engage Taliban in peace talks"".
In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he condemned ""the two horrific terrorist attacks"" in the strongest terms and noted the Taliban had denied responsibility.
""To attack infants and women in labor in the sanctuary of a hospital is an act of sheer evil,"" he said, adding that lack of an Afghan peace deal left the country vulnerable to such attacks.
Pompeo also described the stalled U.S.-backed peace effort, which planned for intra-Afghan peace talks to begin on March 10 but have yet to occur, as ""a critical opportunity for Afghans to ... build a united front against the menace of terrorism.""
The Pentagon declined comment on Ghani's stated intent to restart offensive operations, saying only that the U.S. military continued to reserve the right to defend Afghan security forces if they are attacked by the Taliban.
MOTHERS, CHILDREN, NURSES
The Kabul attack began in the morning when at least three gunmen wearing police uniforms entered the Dasht-e-Barchi hospital, throwing grenades and shooting, government officials said. Security forces had killed the attackers by the afternoon.
""The attackers were shooting at anyone in this hospital without any reason. It's a government hospital, and a lot of people bring in their women and children for treatment,"" said Ramazan Ali, a nearby vendor who saw the start of the attack.
The 100-bed government-run hospital hosted a maternity clinic run by Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French name Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
MSF confirmed in a tweet that the hospital had been attacked. Just hours before it had tweeted a photo of a newborn at the clinic in his mother's arms after being delivered safely by emergency caesarean section.
Interior and health ministry officials said that mothers, nurses and children were among the dead and wounded. 
Soldiers ferried infants out of the compound, some wrapped in blood-stained blankets, and officials said 100 people were rescued, including three foreigners. 
The neighbourhood is home to many of Afghanistan's Hazara community, a mostly Shia Muslim minority that has been attacked by Sunni militants from Islamic State in the past, including at a March ceremony commemorating the death of one of its leaders.
Countries including the United Kingdom, Germany, Turkey and Pakistan released statements condemning the violence.
Last week, security forces killed and arrested several members of an Islamic State cell that authorities said was responsible for several attacks in Kabul including one on a Sikh temple in March. A roadside blast in the capital on Monday, which wounded four civilians, was claimed by the group.

Afghanistan also faces violence from the Taliban. The Taliban say they are refraining from attacking urban centres and their operations target government security forces.

583,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 05:30PM ET</span>",Polish opposition threatens to block plans for rescheduled election,"By Joanna Plucinska
WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's main opposition grouping threatened on Tuesday to block planning for a delayed presidential election, accusing the ruling coalition of rushing a voting plan through parliament for political gain.
The presidential election had been due to take place on May 10, but planning for it collapsed at the last minute over rifts within the coalition and with its opponents over how to hold the vote amid the coronavirus pandemic.
On Tuesday, Poland's lower house of parliament, the ruling party-controlled Sejm, voted in favour of the legislation moving to discussion in Poland's upper house of parliament, the opposition-controlled Senate. 
The ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) wants to hold the election as soon as possible, fearing that its ally, President Andrzej Duda, risks losing his leading position in opinion polls as the economic fallout from the pandemic worsens.
""Once again you have shown that you haven't learnt from your mistakes... you didn't use the opportunity for us to work together in the Sejm,"" Borys Budka, the leader of centrist opposition party Civic Platform (PO), said in parliament just before the vote took place.
The new legislation is unconstitutional as it gives too much power to the PiS-nominated speaker of parliament, Elzbieta Witek, to set the electoral calendar, Jan Grabiec, a spokesman for PO, told Reuters before the Sejm voted in favour of the bill.
PiS blames the Senate for scuppering the May 10 vote as it chose to take the full 30 days permitted to analyse legislation that would have allowed the election to go ahead by postal ballot only.
PO threatened to use the same delaying tactic again in the Senate, demanding amendments to hand more power to the electoral commission to organise the electoral calendar.
PiS needs opposition support to ensure the electoral commission has enough time to organise the vote safely. 
DELAYING TACTICS? 
""If these changes run counter to the constitution, then I doubt the Senate will accept it at lightning speed, just like with the last proposal... which eventually led to the ruling party's need to cancel the election,"" Grabiec said.
The new PiS legislation seeks to mirror opposition-backed proposals for a ""hybrid"" election that combines voting in-person and by mail.
But PO said the new rules would still allow PiS to rush through the elections and set a calendar that was favorable to its needs. 
Opposition parties have previously called for a months-long delay in the election to allow time for the coronavirus pandemic to be fully brought under control. 
On Tuesday, Poland saw its largest spike in new coronavirus cases in one day, totaling 595, as the government seeks to loosen lockdown restrictions to mitigate the pandemic's negative impact on the economy.
Poland now has 16,921 confirmed coronavirus cases and 839 deaths.
""The governing party's rush to hold the election as quickly as possible is very dangerous,"" Grabiec said.
On Wednesday, Duda, a PiS ally, is expected to meet with the Senate speaker to discuss how to best organize the elections. 
The electoral commission on Sunday gave parliamentary speaker Witek 14 days to set a new election date, which must be within 60 days of the announcement.

PiS has said it hopes the election can take place at the end of June or in July.

""We are in a good exchange with the Swiss government,"" Kurz told the broadcaster in an interview. ""Our goal is that we can reach an agreement in coming days over a significant easing and that the border controls can be completely ended in June.""
Switzerland and Austria are among European countries that enacted border controls weeks ago, to help contain the spread of the new coronavirus. They have been moving to open some closed crossings in recent weeks and also ease migration restrictions as new infections and deaths waned.
Switzerland has about 30,400 confirmed infections and 1,561 deaths, while Austria reported about 16,000 infections and 600 fatalities.
Kurz said that declining infection rates in Switzerland and Austria ""are developing similarly well,"" creating an opening to relax the border limits. He said that Austria and Switzerland were moving ahead, while acknowledging regions including Bavaria in Germany had shown more reluctance.
""Both Switzerland and Austria are small, export-oriented countries that are well-connected internationally,"" Kurz said. ""It's clear that the desire in our countries to open is perhaps stronger than elsewhere. Our goal is of course to solve the situation involving our larger border with Germany. Talks with Germany are going excellently. Expect a breakthrough there, too.""
European Union officials have warned that the bloc must go ""back to the future"" of open borders once the coronavirus pandemic is brought under control, after a spate of frontier closures by member states fraying its cohesion.

Switzerland is not in the EU, but has agreed to open borders to neighbors in normal times.

Kamerhe, the most senior politician to ever face trial for graft in Congo, has been held at Kinshasa's Makala prison since his arrest on April 8.
The appointment to replace Kamerhe with a deputy comes a day after his high-profile trial began. He has denied all wrongdoing in relation to charges of embezzling more than $50 million in public funds.
Kamerhe's supporters say the charges are politically motivated, aimed at stymieing his chances of challenging Tshisekedi at the next elections in 2023. 
Deputy director of cabinet Desiré-Cashmir Kolongele Eberande will assume the interim role of chief of staff, Tshisekedi's spokesman Kasongo Mwema announced on the state broadcaster.
Kamerhe backed Tshisekedi in his successful 2018 election campaign in return for Tshisekedi's support the next time around in 2023, but since gaining power their coalition has started to fray.

If convicted, Kamerhe could serve up to 20 years in prison and would be ineligible to contest the next election. The trial resumes on May 25.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal is to take in 500 children from Greek refugee camps as soon as restrictions on movement imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus outbreak are lifted, the country's Foreign Minister Augusto Santos Silva said on Tuesday. 
At least 5,200 unaccompanied minors live in Greece, many of them under harsh conditions in camps on islands in the Aegean, and concerns are mounting over how the disease has affected this vulnerable group. Most refugees in Greece come from Syria, with others from Afghanistan, Iraq and African countries.
""The commitment to take in 500 of the (over) 5,000 unaccompanied minors in camps in Greece remains and it will happen as soon as restrictions due to the pandemic allow us,"" Santos Silva told a parliamentary committee, according to local news agency Lusa. 
Santos Silva's announcement came after Socialist Party lawmaker Isabel Santos said on Saturday that 60 unaccompanied children from Greek refugee camps were expected to arrive in Portugal within the next few weeks. The member of the European Parliament did not specify a date. 
Portugal, which has reported 27,913 cases of the virus, with 1,163 deaths, said it was willing to take in some children as part of a voluntary European scheme to relocate around 1,600.
Other countries, including Germany, Ireland, France and Luxembourg, are also involved in the initiative. The first relocations took place last month when 12 minors were transferred to Luxembourg. Since then, Germany has received around 50 children.
Though Santos Silva said the reception and reintegration of the 500 children was currently being prepared by the government, Left Bloc lawmaker Beatriz Gomes Dias said the conditions of the accommodation given to refugees in Portugal is often not adequate. 
Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing conflicts and poverty in countries such as Syria have used Greece as a springboard to gain entry to other European countries.
In February, tens of thousands of migrants tried to enter Greece after Turkey said it would no longer prevent them from doing so. 

Turkey now hosts about 3.4 million refugees and migrants, while Greece has about 120,000 who are waiting for asylum applications to be processed.

Angolan authorities seized the accounts of dos Santos and her husband Sindika Dokolo late last year over allegations that they steered $1 billion in state funds to companies in which they held stakes during the presidency of her father Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who ruled for 38 years until 2017.
In February, Portuguese prosecutors followed suit, freezing Isabel dos Santos' assets in the country, which was Angola's colonial master until independence in 1975. She and Dokolo have denied any wrongdoing.
Dos Santos, 47, whose whereabouts are not known, said her lawyers had discovered a fabricated passport in her name last month when granted access to the Luandan court's files on the asset freeze for the first time.
The passport was in English, the passport number was cited differently in two locations on the document and the signature belonged to long-dead kung fu star Bruce Lee, who died in 1973. 
""The Angolan Public Prosecutor's Office presented material evidence that was fabricated and based on a forgery. This court decision should be struck out as abuse of process and the judgement set aside,"" dos Santos said in an English-language statement.
""The forgery of the passport is obvious at first glance,"" it said. 
Neither Angolan nor Portuguese prosecutors responded to requests for comment.
The Luandan Provincial Court in Angola could not be reached for confirmation or comment on what impact there would be on the asset freeze if the document dos Santos cited was proven to be fabricated and part of the file against her.
Angola has named dos Santos as a suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds while she was chairwoman of state oil firm Sonangol in 2016-2017.

Angola's chief prosecutor said in January that an international arrest warrant for dos Santos could be issued if she fails to appear to cooperate with the investigation.

The government will gradually reopen cinemas, museums and other recreational venues, but they will be subject to restrictions that support social distancing.
It is also allowing the re-opening of outdoor bars and outdoor restaurants, guest houses and small hotels. They would all have to comply with required sanitary measures.
Lawmakers, eager to support the hard-hit tourism sector, voted to allow state subsidies for tour operators who bring foreign holidaymakers to the country's resorts with charter flights. They also required operators of Black Sea (NYSE:SE) beaches to cut the cost of umbrellas and sunbeds. 
Bulgaria, which has a population of nearly 7 million, has confirmed 2,023 cases of COVID-19 and 94 deaths.

592,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 01:45PM ET</span>","Colombia says over 52,000 Venezuelans return home, cites lockdown","BOGOTA (Reuters) - More than 52,000 Venezuelans have voluntarily returned to their country from Colombia during the coronavirus lockdown, Colombia's migration agency said on Tuesday.
Colombia is the top destination for Venezuelans fleeing economic crisis and political upheaval. More than 1.82 million live in the Andean country, but a nationwide quarantine has cut many migrants off from work and motivated tens of thousands to return home.
""The vast majority of the migrant population remains in the country and there are some who have expressed their desire to return,"" migration agency director Juan Francisco Espinosa said in a live broadcast on social media. ""It's a phenomena that we have understood as rational and normal because the a pandemic situation makes them prefer being at home.""
The figures on returning Venezuelans include some 27,000 people in border areas who left Colombia in the first three days after the government closed land borders, he said. An additional 25,000 Venezuelans have since returned home via humanitarian transport.
Many Venezuelan migrants lack visas and get by working informally as street vendors, in construction, restaurants or making food deliveries. 
The two-month quarantine, currently set to end on May 25, has shuttered many businesses and burdened Colombia's poorest residents with additional worries about how to put food on the table, despite expanded government welfare payments to some.
An orderly return process for migrants will continue, Espinosa said, depending on Venezuelan capacity to receive returnees.
""If Venezuelan citizens want to return, they will be able to but in an organized way,"" he said. ""Venezuela has a limited capacity to receive its own citizens and that's an issue that is out of the hands of Colombian authorities.""
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro has said all returnees are welcome, but opposition leaders and activists have said quarantine facilities for returnees are overcrowded and lack food and water.

In calls to mark International Nurses' Day, the royals posted videos and chatted to healthcare workers from Australia and India to Africa and the Caribbean. 
""This is rather an important day,"" the 94-year-old queen told Professor Kathleen McCourt, President of the Commonwealth Nurses and Midwives Federation, saying nurses have ""obviously had a very important part to play recently"".
Royal commentators said it was the first time during her 68-year reign that audio of a telephone call involving the queen had ever been released.
Buckingham Palace said the royals had spoken to nurses and healthcare workers in Britain, Australia, India, Malawi, Sierra Leone, Bahamas, Cyprus, and Tanzania.
""You're a huge inspiration to everybody. A huge thank you from us all here,"" said Kate, the Duchess of Cambridge, during one of seven calls she made with Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, wife of the queen's youngest son Prince Edward.
Other royals who took part included heir to the throne Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, the queen's daughter Princess Anne and the queen's cousin, Princess Alexandra.
""From the bottom of my heart thank you for everything you're doing,"" said Kate's husband Prince William in a call to staff at a hospital in London. ""I hope you know how appreciative everyone is of what you're all doing.""

On Monday night, a giant image of Florence Nightingale was projected onto the buildings of Guys and St Thomas' hospitals in central London to mark 200 years since her birth and her legacy to modern nursing.

594,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 12:05PM ET</span>","Hungarian top court confirms Roma unlawfully segregated, awards damages","By Marton Dunai
BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A Hungarian school unlawfully segregated minority Roma students for years, the country's top court said in a final ruling on Tuesday, granting 100 million forints ($310,000) in compensation to the children's families.
Nationalist Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is at odds with the European Union for his perceived erosion of the rule of law, hinted in January that the state should disobey any court order to pay restitution to the Roma and provide training instead.
There was no immediate comment from Orban's government on Monday's ruling by the Kuria (Supreme Court) in the case involving an elementary school in Gyongyospata, a town that has been a flashpoint of ethnic tensions in the past.
""The supreme legal forum upheld... (an earlier) ruling which mandated a 100 million forint damages payment,"" the Kuria said in a statement. ""Students from the Roma ethnic minority were unlawfully segregated and given substandard education."" 
Analysts say Orban has been stepping up anti-Roma rhetoric and has had little to lose politically from ignoring the plight of a minority that has for centuries faced prejudice and discrimination in Hungary and elsewhere in eastern Europe.
Roma in Hungary live in disproportionate poverty, suffer from prejudice in schools and workplaces and have been subject to intimidation and occasionally deadly violence by the far right, rights activists say.
Orban used his first major press conference this year to decry the damages award to 60 Gyongyospata Roma and their families by a lower court.
He said the Roma had created an unruly and threatening environment in the school and majority Hungarian parents had begun taking their kids to a school in a neighbouring town.
""They feel like they are in a hostile environment in their own homeland...No way,"" Orban told reporters.
In response to his denunciation of the damages award, more than 2,000 Hungarians including Roma families marched in protest to parliament in February with banners saying ""no one is above the law"" and ""the future cannot be built on hatred"".
Last month, Roma leaders said the coronavirus pandemic posed a grave threat to the already precarious status of their community, with many Roma feeling abandoned by Orban's government.

Orban launched a major financial stimulus plan to soften the economic blow from the coronavirus, focusing on bolstering investment and employment but bypassing the very poor - often Roma who typically work in casual day jobs without security and have little access to standard medical care.

595,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 11:40AM ET</span>",Turkey says UAE spreading chaos in Middle East,"ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey accused the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday of bringing chaos to the Middle East through its interventions in Libya and Yemen, allegations which are likely to inflame tensions between the regional rivals.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu was responding to criticism of Turkey's role in the Libyan conflict, where it has deployed military personnel and helped send Syrian fighters to support the internationally recognised government in Tripoli.
The United Arab Emirates and Egypt, which back the forces of Khalifa Haftar trying to storm the Libyan capital, issued a joint statement with Greece, Cyprus and France on Monday condemning ""Turkey's military interference in Libya"".
Cavusoglu told Turkish broadcaster Akit TV that the United Arab Emirates, along with Egypt and other countries he did not name, were ""trying to destabilise the whole region"", but he singled out Abu Dhabi for particular criticism.
""If you are asking who is destabilising this region, who is bringing chaos, then we would say Abu Dhabi without any hesitation,"" he said. ""It is a reality that they are the force that unsettled Libya and destroyed Yemen.""
The UAE did not immediately respond to Cavusoglu's criticism.
Ties between Turkey and the United Arab Emirates have been strained by Ankara's support for Qatar after four Arab countries including the UAE imposed sanctions on Doha in 2017 over its alleged support for Islamist militants, which Qatar denies.
The UAE sees itself as a bulwark against political forms of Islam, and views Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan's Islamist-rooted AK Party as a supporter of groups like the Muslim Brotherhood which it opposes.
In Libya, where the U.N. says it has supplied aircraft and military vehicles to Haftar, the UAE called on all parties last month to commit to a U.N.-supervised political process to end the war.
The United Arab Emirates was also a leading power in an alliance which intervened in Yemen five years ago against the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. It reduced its presence in Yemen last year but remains a member of that alliance.
Cavusoglu also accused the UAE of supporting Islamist Al Shabab militants in Somalia, where Turkey has a military base and is training Somali troops. 
The UAE had trained hundreds of Somali troops since 2014 as part of an effort boosted by an African Union military mission to defeat an Islamist insurgency until Somalia disbanded the programme in 2018.

He made his comments after the foreign ministry in Ankara condemned Monday's statement by the five countries, and accused France of ""attempting to be the patron of this axis of malice"".

597,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 11:30AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. government officials worry about return of dual citizens if Mexico's pandemic worsens,"By Ted Hesson, Jonathan Landay and Mica Rosenberg
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government officials are concerned that dual U.S.-Mexico citizens may flee to the United States if the coronavirus outbreak in Mexico gets worse, putting more stress on U.S. hospitals, especially near the border, three officials familiar with the matter said.
The worries, which have not been previously reported, come as hospitals in the San Diego area in southern California have pressed the Trump administration to do more to limit the threat of the virus crossing into the United States.
While senior U.S. Department of Homeland Security officials have expressed their concerns about dual nationals in daily departmental calls, there are no plans at present to bar entry to them or make other changes to border operations, according to a senior DHS official, who like others requested anonymity to discuss the matter.
""I don't think there is any interest in telling American citizens that they can't come in,"" the official said.
The issue has come up in discussions about a potential surge of migrants if Mexico's economy worsens or the outbreak overwhelms health facilities there, according to the sources.
President Donald Trump has suspended non-essential travel across the U.S. land borders with Canada and Mexico, saying the restrictions are necessary to protect the United States. 
So far, fears of a deluge have not been realized. The United States has the highest number of coronavirus deaths worldwide and the U.S. economy has gone into a tailspin, with the unemployment rate at the highest level since the Great Depression.
Trump's opponents accuse him of exploiting the pandemic to expand his drive to restrict legal and illegal immigration to the United States in an election year.
Leon Rodriguez, a former director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under President Barack Obama, said that any move to prevent U.S. citizens from entering the country would raise ""serious constitutional issues,"" a sentiment echoed by several experts.
About 1.5 million U.S. citizens live in Mexico, according to a U.S. Department of State estimate, many of them retirees.
Mexico's foreign ministry did not immediately have comment on whether the issue of dual nationals had been raised by the United States. The DHS did not respond to a request for comment.
Carlos González Gutiérrez, the Mexican consul general in San Diego, said some public officials in the United States “mischaracterize the situation at the border with regards to the foreign-born population for short-term, electoral purposes.”
SCENARIOS
In the Trump administration discussions, U.S. officials have detailed several scenarios that could trigger a flood of people trying to cross the southern border.
One could be an improvement in the U.S. economy as Mexico confronts worsening economic fallout from the pandemic and the collapse of world oil prices, according to two U.S. officials.
Another could be the successful development in the United States of a vaccine or therapeutic to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, one of the officials said.
Private hospitals in five Mexican states and Mexico City are already at capacity due to the outbreak, Reuters reported over the weekend. 
The overwhelmed facilities include hospitals in Tijuana, just across the border from San Diego, the Mexican municipality with the most deaths attributed to COVID-19. Health experts say the outbreak there started earlier than elsewhere in Mexico because of its proximity to the U.S. city, which has a similar population but four times as many confirmed cases.
As of Tuesday, reported coronavirus cases in Mexico totaled about 35,000, with 3,465 deaths. The true numbers are almost certainly significantly higher due to the low level of testing nationwide, however. 
The number of known infections in the United States is 1.35 million, with more than 80,000 deaths.
Representatives of two hospital systems in the San Diego area - Scripps Health and Sharp (OTC:SHCAY) HealthCare - sent a letter to top Trump administration officials in late April that called for medical checks at the border and mandatory quarantine for individuals suspected to be infected with coronavirus.
""This is not an immigration issue for us, we do not want the border closed,"" Scripps CEO Chris Van Gorder told Reuters on Monday. ""I think that would be a disaster for both countries. But we are concerned about the large number of people coming across. There are no health checks at all going in either direction.”
At Scripps Mercy Hospital Chula Vista, less than an hour's drive from Tijuana, about a third of COVID-19 patients had traveled across the border in the previous week, a spokeswoman said. 
Gil Kerlikowske, who headed U.S. Customs and Border Protection for three years during the Obama administration, said that the United States should be proactively assisting Mexico's response to the health crisis as a border control measure.

""If people are being treated better in Mexico, it is to our benefit, as well,"" he said.

598,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",Bosnian official suspended amid probe into import of defective ventilators,"SARAJEVO (Reuters) - A senior Bosnian official in charge of procuring medical equipment to combat the coronavirus outbreak was suspended on Tuesday amid a criminal inquiry into the import of ventilators for COVID-19 patients that proved defective.
Fahrudin Solak, head of the civil protection authority (FUCZ) in the Bosniak-Croat autonomous region of Bosnia, has denied accusations of irregularities in the procurement of the Chinese ventilators.
The case arose after the COVID-19 pandemic prompted the Bosnia-Croat Federation government to relax public procurement statutes to allow purchases of medical equipment through direct bargaining with suppliers rather than via public tender.
A raspberry processing firm, Srebrena Malina, that had no license to import medical equipment was then recruited by FUCZ to procure 100 ventilators from China for 10.5 million Bosnian marka ($5.84 million) for care of COVID-19 patients.
Srebrena Malina received a permit for the transaction only days after 80 out of the 100 ventilators arrived, spurring allegations of irregularities and prompting the state prosecutor to open an investigation into possible corruption and fraud.
Prosecutors were investigating in part how and why Srebrena Malina was chosen to do a deal for the ventilators while several other companies with experience in procuring medical equipment said they could obtain effective machines at a lower cost.
The prosecutor's office said in an initial report on Monday the ventilators did ""not meet even a minimum of necessary characteristics for adequate treatment"" of COVID-19 patients and that was not advisable to use them in intensive-care units.
Medical experts said the ventilators were found to be of a type for use in medical transport rather than intensive care units, and the price paid for the machines had been inflated.
Both Solak and Fikret Hodzic, a prominent television presenter who owns Srebrena Malina and is close to the largest Bosniak party, denied any wrongdoing. Solak tendered his temporary resignation pending the outcome of the inquiry.
Several Bosnian import-export companies with connections to the political establishment have been under scrutiny since the coronavirus crisis began amid accusations of profiteering as authorities scrambled to plug shortages of medical equipment.
Bosnia, split into Serb and Bosniak-Croat autonomous regions since the 1990s war, has registered 2,158 cases of COVID-19 and 117 deaths from the lung disease. Both regions have begun a gradual easing of lockdowns imposed to contain the outbreak.

599,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Funeral director balances safety and emotional needs in virus-hit Britain,"LONDON (Reuters) - At a time when more people are dying but few can attend funerals, the job of an undertaker in virus-hit Britain is difficult, stressful - and often creative.
Government guidance on funerals says the number of mourners should be as small as possible during the pandemic, and limited to family or close friends, hitting those who have lost loved ones to COVID-19 or to other causes alike.
""For a lot of people, that is just a huge blow ... I think there are some difficult realities for even the people who are able to attend,"" said Poppy Mardall, founder of Poppy's Funerals.
""Something like this, it's like disrupting a pond. It creates ripples. And you didn't realise how much you needed what you had... until you're not allowed to do it.""
Mardall told Reuters she had been supporting families in coming up with alternative arrangements for funerals during Britain's lockdown. 
Those include streaming ceremonies online, driving hearses past the houses of those who cannot attend the service, and hand-drawn pictures of flowers on the coffin, to replace the real things in light of the closure of flower markets.
""We're having to come up with new rituals, or adapted rituals. Ritual is ... arguably more important with the reality of isolation that so many people who are grieving are still having to face,"" she said.
Government advice is that funerals should not be delayed, however difficult the circumstances of holding one in the current circumstances may be.
Places of worship may be closed but small funerals can still be held in a churchyard, or by a graveside or at a crematorium.
Mardall said many people were hoping to hold larger memorial services in the future as a way of commemorating their loved ones with more people.
But she said some people with low expectations had got a lot out of the modified service.
""There's something about having an intimate gathering of ten people - that it's not what you wanted but it gives you something else,"" she said.
""Some people are getting an experience they wouldn't have thought they wanted, but which they have really valued.""
Funeral services group Dignity said on Monday that families burying loved ones were opting for simpler services in light of the restrictions.
That reflects a difficult time for workers in the funeral sector too, as they have had to adapt their working practices to the realities of lockdown while coping with increased demand for their services and shortages of protective equipment.
Mardall estimated that at its peak in early May, Poppy's Funerals was 30% busier than normal, though the company retained excess capacity in mortuaries to cope with periods of high demand.
There are daily check-ins with the team, who are working from home where possible, and the firm has launched a blog, talking-death.com, to encourage discussion about dying.
Mardall said there had been one week where the firm did not have sufficient stocks of protective equipment, but the situation had improved now. 
""There are more people dying, so there's certainly pressure on all those people who care for the dead... and this is an infectious disease, so that makes people scared,"" she said.

""That strain on everybody is real.""

600,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>","Violence in northwest Nigeria drives 23,000 into Niger: UNHCR","GENEVA (Reuters) - Violence in northwest Nigeria has forced about 23,000 refugees to flee to Niger since April and raised concerns about the deteriorating security situation, the United Nations refugee agency said on Tuesday.
The numbers fleeing to neighbouring Niger have almost tripled from last year when the agency reported the first influx of 20,000 people following an insurgency and banditry in northern Nigeria which killed hundreds and displaced thousands.
The latest influx of mostly women and children came after attacks by gunmen in Nigeria's Katsina, Sokoto and Zamfara states during April. 
The deadliest attack claimed 47 lives in Katsina State, the agency said, prompting air strikes by Nigerian security forces already stretched tackling a decade-long insurgency by Islamist group Boko Haram in the northeast.
""We are working closely with authorities in Niger to relocate at least 7,000 refugees to safety ... where water, food, shelter, access to health and other essential assistance can be provided,"" UNHCR spokesman Babar Baloch told a media briefing.
""Discussions are also ongoing with the authorities to recognize on a prima facie basis the refugees fleeing Nigeria and arriving in the region,"" he said.
Nigeria closed all land borders in March to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected over 4,600 people in the country with 150 deaths. It first shut parts of its borders last year to fight smuggling but people could still cross both ways. 
The agency said refugees from Nigeria are being allowed to seek protection in Niger despite border closures with people in need of food, shelter and basic services including healthcare. 
Baloch said around 19,000 Niger nationals have been displaced in their own country as they fled, fearing insecurity in border areas. The refugees are found in Niger's southern Maradi region, the agency said.
Many have also been caught up in clashes blamed on farmers and herders over dwindling land in Nigeria which have killed more people than the Boko Haram conflict.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - As the coronavirus kills thousands and dominates government attention across Latin America, another deadly viral infection is quietly stalking the region.
Dengue - colloquially called breakbone fever for the severe joint pain it causes - is endemic in much of Latin America, but COVID-19's arrival has pulled crucial attention and resources away from the fight against it, doctors and officials say.
The Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO) expects 2020 to be marked by high rates of dengue, which can fill intensive care units and kill patients even absent the pressures of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Around the world, COVID-19 has affected other diseases in different ways. Though in Europe measures to stop the coronavirus have banished seasonal flu, in Africa border closures have stopped transportation of measles vaccines and other supplies.
In Latin America, a dengue epidemic which started in late 2018 is still being felt. Dengue infections in the Americas surged to an all-time high of 3.1 million in 2019, with over 1,500 deaths in Latin America and the Caribbean, according to the PAHO.
Cases of the disease should begin to decline in the second half of the year, the organization said.
Spread by mosquitoes, dengue outbreaks typically occur three to five years after the previous epidemic.
And with four strains of dengue in circulation, people may catch it more than once, with second cases more likely to be severe.
""COVID is the star right now, so all of the attention is being put on COVID, but there are still problems with dengue,"" said Doctor Jaime Gomez, who works at a hospital in Floridablanca, in Colombia's Santander (MC:SAN) province. 
Although dengue is not usually fatal and can be treated with painkillers, some sufferers deal with persistent symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, and depression that affect their ability to work. Severe dengue is treated with intravenous fluids and those who do not get tested are at risk of dangerous complications.
Such medical intervention cannot be given if patients stay home, worried about contracting the coronavirus, or if overcrowded hospitals have to turn them away.
With relatively few cases of COVID-19 in the province where he works, Gomez said his clinic had seen hospitalizations fall by half, as people were fearful of venturing outdoors.
'SYSTEM HAS COLLAPSED' 
Paraguayan lawyer Sonia Fernandez avoided seeking care when she and her two daughters, ages 11 and 8, got sick with dengue at the beginning of April.
""All three of us had dengue, we had all the symptoms, the pain, the rash, but we didn't go to a clinic or a health center so as not to expose ourselves (to COVID-19),"" Fernandez said.
All three have since recovered. 
Dengue cases in Paraguay have exploded this year. In the first 18 weeks of 2020, the country reported 42,710 confirmed cases and 64 deaths, compared to 384 confirmed cases and six deaths in the year-earlier period. 
In Ecuador, where the coronavirus outbreak has hit hard and hospitals in the largest city of Guayaquil been overwhelmed, an apparent fall in the number of dengue cases could mask other issues. 
According to Ecuador's health ministry, dengue cases peaked at 888 in the week ending March 14, two weeks after the country confirmed its first case of COVID-19. For the week of April 4, they fell to 257.
""Very clearly dengue is being under-reported,"" said Esteban Ortiz, global health researcher at Quito's University of the Americas. 
""Cases haven't decreased, the diagnosis of cases has decreased, which confirms the system has totally collapsed,"" he added.
Ecuador's health ministry said in a statement that the country was no more exposed to the double impact of COVID-19 and dengue than any other in the region, adding it has sufficient supplies to treat cases of the mosquito-borne disease.
Dengue has also spiked sharply in Central America. Cases in Costa Rica nearly tripled through May 1 compared with a year ago, to over 2,000.
""We are going through a difficult moment dealing with COVID-19 but unfortunately other diseases continue their cycle,"" Rodrigo Marin, director of Costa Rica's health surveillance agency, recently told journalists. 
In Panama, where dengue has caused at least two deaths this year, Panama City health official Yamileth Lopez also sounded the alarm in an interview with Reuters. 

""Dengue kills too,"" she said.

MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian aid worker, freed at the weekend after being held hostage for 18 months by Islamist militants in Africa, has been deluged with hate mail because she converted to Islam, judicial sources said on Tuesday.
Magistrates have opened an investigation into the abuse to see if charges of aggravated criminal threat can be laid against some of the senders, the sources said.
Silvia Romano was working as a volunteer in an orphanage in a village in southeast Kenya when she was seized by gunmen in November 2018. She was smuggled across the border into Somalia, where she was believed to have been detained by the Islamist group al Shabaab.
Romano, 24, was greeted by the prime minister and foreign minister when she arrived back by plane on Sunday, smiling broadly and wearing a hooded garment that covered her hair.
Although she has not spoken in public about her ordeal, her family have confirmed that she converted to Islam during her imprisonment and has changed her name to Aisha.
Newspapers quoted her as telling officials that she had chosen to become a Muslim of her own free will after reading the Koran and had not been abused by her captors. However, reports of her conversion sparked fury in some circles.
""Islamic and happy. Silvia the ungrateful,"" said the front-page headline of right-wing daily Il Giornale on Monday.
A politician from the province of Treviso posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that Romano should be hanged. The post was swiftly removed.
Italy is predominantly Roman Catholic and the Church warmly welcomed Romano's safe return. ""At this time, we all feel her to be our own daughter,"" said Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti.
Italian media reported that Rome paid a ransom of some 1.5 million euros ($1.6 million) to secure Romano's release. As always in such cases, the government declined to comment.
""Imagine the Islamic terrorists: They have brought home the money, committing a criminal act, and 'won' the cultural battle in the name of the Islamic veil and conversion,"" said Matteo Salvini, leader of the far-right opposition League party.
In an interview with La Repubblica newspaper, a spokesman for al Shabaab, named as Ali Dehere, confirmed a ransom had been paid, but declined to say how much.
""Some will be used to buy weapons, which we need more and more of to fight jihad (holy war). The rest will be used to run the country: to pay for schools, to buy the food and medicine we distribute to our people, to train the policemen who maintain order and enforce the laws of the Koran,"" he said.

The spokesman said Romano had converted voluntarily ""because she clearly saw with her own eyes a better world than she knew before"".

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia has detained 1,368 undocumented migrants in an area under lockdown in the latest such raid despite fears the crackdown could push vulnerable people into hiding and increase the risk of coronavirus infection in overcrowded detention centres.
The people from Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Myanmar and Bangladesh were rounded up in an area near a large market just outside the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, the Immigration Department said in a statement on Tuesday.
The raid on Monday, which included 261 women and 98 children, followed a similar roundup last week, which alarmed the United Nations and rights groups.
The migrants' offences included lacking proper identification, overstaying, and holding false papers, authorities said. They have defended the arrests as necessary to preserve law and prevent the migrants from travelling. 
With 6,742 cases and 109 deaths, Malaysia eased movement curbs earlier this month but has kept tight restrictions on several areas where there have been new outbreaks of the COVID-19 disease.
The Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network (APRRN) said many of those arrested on Monday were asylum-seekers not formally registered by the United Nations' refugee agency UNHCR.
""It really puts them in a precarious situation because they are simply categorised as undocumented migrants when they are fleeing from imminent danger,"" APRRN programme officer Rachel Tan told Reuters.
Around the world, migrants have been particularly vulnerable during the pandemic. In neighbouring Singapore, thousands of infections have been linked to migrant worker dormitories.
Last week, the United Nations urged Malaysia to avoid detaining migrants and release all children and their caregivers, warning that packed detention centres heightened infection risks. 
The Immigration Department's director general Khairul Dzaimee Daud said in the statement that all of those screened and detained after Monday's raid tested negative. 
The area round the Selayang Wholesalers' Market, where many migrants work, has been under lockdown since April 20, with businesses closed and residents confined to home, after a new cluster of cases was reported there.
Malaysia has about two million registered foreign workers, but authorities say many more are there without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as illegal migrants.

The lessons, though, did not cover maths or grammar, but hygiene amid a public health emergency: wash your hands, don't touch your face and keep away from each other.
That was the new reality as some 1.5 million elementary and primary pupils - roughly one in every four - returned to class as France tentatively emerges from lockdown.
But with less than two months of the academic year left, some parents, teachers and their unions have questioned the wisdom of reopening schools when the virus continues to circulate, especially in the greater Paris region.
The related COVID-19 disease has already killed more than 26,000 people in France.
""The school that the kids are going to discover will have little to do with the school that they left behind,"" said David, a teacher at a primary school in Paris' western 16th district who gave his first name only. 
""It's more like a nursery to let the parents go back to work."" 
The government wants to ease lockdown restrictions to resuscitate the economy and says the rate of infection has slowed sufficiently.
RESISTANCE
Unions and opposition parties have pointed to the risk that COVID-19 infections will pick up again, particularly in places where distancing is difficult, such as schools.
""Why have we started with the youngest children to end the lockdown when we know they'll be the hardest ones to make apply protective measures?"" said Francette Popineau, chief of the primary school union, on FranceInfo radio.
Secondary school children are not due back until May 25, but local authorities tasked with drawing up safety plans have concerns.
Recently, more than 300 mayors from the Paris region, including the capital's mayor Anne Hidalgo, warned against rushing children back, as well as the financial cost for smaller towns and the threat of legal action if pupils fell ill.
One of them, Pascal Thevenot, mayor of Vélizy-Villacoublay, told Reuters it would be difficult to impose some of the sanitary measures outlined in a 54-page government document.
""I'm not sure the people who wrote this have had children,"" he said. ""I see this as an economic decision rather than an education decision."" 
Many parents are still keeping their children at home. Others, though, need to return to work or consider whether the benefits to a child's mental well-being from returning to school outweigh the risk of infection.
""I'm not too stressed, I explained to her the protective measures and I had to go back to work anyway,"" Sandrine Delarue, a kindergarten assistant, said as she dropped her 10-year-old daughter Clara outside Vélizy's Mozart school.
As for Clara, there was no hesitation in going back. 
""It won't be the same school, but at least it will make the virus pass,"" Clara said. ""I'm happy to be back, to see my teacher, my friends and to learn in class.""

After Prime Minister Boris Johnson published a plan on Monday for how the United Kingdom could return to normal life, the constituent parts of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are diverging from the approach in England.
Like leaders in Scotland and Wales, Northern Ireland's regional government said now is not the time to lift stay-home restrictions, contrary to Johnson encouraging some people to return to work this week.
The Northern Irish plan bore closer resemblance to Ireland's five-stage approach than Johnson's three-step roadmap and, like in Dublin, the Belfast executive will decide on whether to move from one stage to the next every three weeks.
However, Ireland intends to enter phase one next week with its final phase set for Aug. 18, meaning construction sites will likely open on the south side of the open 500-kilometre border with Northern Ireland on Monday but not in the north.
Northern Ireland operates under a devolved power-sharing government, mainly made up of pro-British politicians who wish to remain part of the UK and Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland.
The power-sharing executive, established under a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of sectarian violence, was split over the initial pace of the lockdown in March when Ireland shut schools and banned big events before Britain did so.
The pro-Irish Sinn Fein and pro-British Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) displayed a united front on Tuesday.

""Now we know some will want us to set a date for lifting restrictions, but we will not be driven by a timetable and we know that some will be disappointed by that,"" First Minister Arlene Foster of the DUP told the regional assembly.

Veran was reacting after Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo asked on Twitter for the re-opening of the French capital's parks, closed since March 17, provided people wear face masks.
The minister was speaking after crowds of Parisians gathered on the banks of the trendy Saint-Martin canal and the Seine river on Monday to celebrate the easing of the lockdown.
Police had to disperse the crowds and Interior Minister Christophe Castaner later asked the Paris prefecture to ban drinking on the Canal Saint-Martin and the Seine river banks.
""It's not over. The virus continues to circulate....In view of yesterday's images you are referring to on the Seine river banks...one can understand but this can be dangerous,"" Veran told reporters during a visit in Limeil-Brevannes in the Ile-de-France region.
""No, we will not re-open the parks and gardens in Paris, in the Ile-de-France, and in regions that are classified as red because it can be extremely tempting with the sun that we have today for people to regroup too much and not respect the 10 people limit as well as social distancing.""
France is now split into ""green zones"" where the infection rate is low and ""red zones"", including the greater Paris region, where the rate is higher and more restrictions are in place.

608,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 07:15AM ET</span>","In one Florida school district, virtual school is not a virtual vacation","By Brendan O'Brien
(Reuters) - Many U.S. schools have stopped taking attendance since the COVID-19 pandemic forced classes online, but one South Florida district has remained committed to the scholastic task, saying it is a way to keep students safe and productive while learning at home. 
Broward County, outside Miami, has used daily attendance as a tool to quickly find students who were unable to participate in online classes because their households lacked laptops or internet access. Checking attendance has also helped officials identify those children in families particularly hard hit by the pandemic, whether through illness or financial setbacks. 
""A lot of kids are in home situations that are even more stressed than they have ever been,"" said Robert Runcie, superintendent of the district, the sixth-largest in the United States, with 330 schools and 270,000 students. The district closed its school buildings on March 16 and launched online classes on March 30. 
""If we're not tracking their attendance,"" he said, ""then in some ways we are neglecting our responsibility to make sure those kids are safe.""
That puts Broward County in the minority. Only a third of 100 school districts tracked by the Center on Reinventing Public Education in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic have said they are still taking attendance. 
A handful of states, including California and Texas, have waived average daily attendance requirements for state funding. In those states, districts are now receiving state money even if they have stopped monitoring attendance. 
Many large districts, including Los Angeles and Chicago, have stopped taking daily classroom attendance. Others track students only when they download materials, complete assignments or answer daily questions online.
""Teachers are not necessarily in contact with students every day,"" said Hedy Chang, director of Attendance Works, an organization that tracks attendance policy.
""If your remote learning strategy is just sending packets home, then what's attendance?"" she said.
NO STONE UNTURNED
By contrast, Broward students are counted as present after logging in to an online portal, a single entry point to the district's suite of educational applications. Teachers also count students who are participating online and measure their engagement. 
A student is marked absent if he or she fails to log in, triggering a response from school officials who will call parents, family members and even friends in hopes of tracking down and reconnecting with the pupil.
That effort has exposed the so-called digital divide among students. Attendance data, for example, showed 13 students who live in a disadvantaged neighborhood of Broward County were absent from school three weeks ago. 
When the district discovered the students lived in households without internet service, it dispatched a technician to bring them mobile hot spots, enabling them to log in to virtual classes. 
""We will not leave a stone unturned,"" said Laurel Thompson, the district's director of student services. ""Every child matters.""
Since the pandemic struck, the district has distributed more than 90,000 laptops and mobile hot spots, officials said. 
But some students have struggled to attend online classes as they are now working full-time to help support their struggling families, dealing with sick family members or living in unstable homes. When they appear absent, the district has dispatched social workers to connect the student with support services. 
Frequent absence from class is usually ""a symptom of something more,"" Thompson said. ""We have an ethical responsibility and a moral mandate to serve these students and their families."" 
The effort to track down and help absent students through attendance taking has been fruitful, Broward officials said. In recent weeks, the district has reduced its number of non-engaged students from 6,600 to 1,700. Overall, the district's daily attendance during the pandemic is at 91%, or 3 percentage points lower than normal. 
In one case, Broward second-grade teacher Vivian Lewis noticed during her daily attendance-taking that one of her students was absent from online classes. After phone calls to his Spanish-speaking family, she was able to help him get logged in to virtual classes. 

""I felt like he was thinking, 'Where's everybody? Where's my teacher? Why isn't she checking on me?'"" Lewis said. ""I could envision him ... being scared.""

Moore, 100, struck a chord with locked-down Britain by walking around his garden with the help of a walking frame to raise almost 33 million pounds for the National Health Service. His endeavor spread joy amid the grim news of the coronavirus outbreak.
In a bizarre online ceremony, Moore, wearing his war medals, was awarded the freedom of the City of London by the chamberlain, wearing a ermine-trimmed gown, and the Lord Mayor, who wore a tricorne hat trimmed with black ostrich feathers.
""Today we are paying tribute to a very special man,"" said Peter Kane, who occupies the ancient office of Chamberlain of the City of London. ""Just an incredible achievement - we could run out of adjectives trying to describe this.""
The freedom of the City of London dates back to 1237 and signified that the holder was not owned by a feudal lord and had to right to trade in the heart of London's ancient core. 
Moore, who was raised in Yorkshire, northern England, swore an oath to be ""good and true to our Sovereign Lady Queen Elizabeth the Second"" and to keep ""the Queen's Peace"". 
He signed the Freedom declaration with a wave of the pen and thanked the chamberlain for being given the ""Rules for the Conduct of Life"" which date from the mid-18th century. He was given a detailed history of his privileges as London's ""youngest freeman"". 
Moore, with what appeared to be a glass of champagne, was toasted. He smiled when told that the ancient privileges include being hanged with silk - rather than hemp - and the right to wander the city with his sword drawn.
""Captain Tom - you raised the spirits of people across the country, you showed us all the importance of community spirit and brought people together during this difficult time,"" Lord Mayor William Russell said.
The City of London traces its ancient rights to beyond the Norman Conquest of 1066, when the crucible of trade and commerce was formally granted freedoms and privileges which had developed during the dawn of English history.
The honour is the latest bestowed on Moore. For his 100th birthday last month, Queen Elizabeth agreed that he should be made an honorary colonel, and he was also made an honorary member of the England cricket team.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - As Thailand's tourist economy suffers a near-total shutdown from travel restrictions due to the new coronavirus, employees in the industry have been forced to improvise to make ends meet.
Air purser Kosit Rattanasopon, 37, has traded in his cabin crew uniform for a delivery driver's jacket, stylishly ferrying food around Bangkok on his Ducati motorbike since the Thai airline he works for grounded all flights.
Kosit makes about 1,000 baht ($31.13) per day, just enough to support his father and sister, who also cook boxed meals to sell online.
""I know things will not be the same again for at least another year, so I will have to keep doing this,"" he said.
Tourism accounted for 11% of Thailand's GDP last year, and border closures and travel restrictions to prevent its spread are expected to decimate the industry for months to come.
Those who have new jobs are among the fortunate. Some 4 million Thais work in the tourism sector, and most face a year or more of lost income until a vaccine or new coronavirus treatment allows travel to return to previous levels.
Another grounded airline worker, stewardess Thawanan Thawornphatworakul, has transformed her living room into a hair salon.
She averages two to three clients per day and charges 150 baht ($4.67) per cut. Thawanan, 36, said her income is nowhere near her airline salary, but it helps. 
""The income here helps with some expenses and pays the bills,"" she said.
Scuba diving instructor Sermsak Posayajinda, 47, has also found a new income source, making jars of chili paste from his mother's recipes and selling them online. 
""At first it was only a hobby during COVID-19 period, but the results have been very good, so this will become a business for us in the long term,"" Sermsak said. 
Closure of hotels and exhibition centres also disrupted the business of Asaree Jarugosol, 36, who rents out chairs and builds stages for hotels and caterers around Bangkok.
Asaree decided to retain all her staff by transforming her warehouse into a factory that makes 2,500 reusable face masks per day, first for local hospitals and now for exporting overseas as worldwide demand surges.
""At first we only have one sewing machine operated by one staff ... but now we have some 40 people working a proper production line,"" Asaree said.
""We will continue to produce face masks even when our old business returns.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Long queues formed outside hairdressers in Singapore on Tuesday as the government eased some restrictions of a nationwide lockdown, although any styles beyond a trim would have to wait. 
""We can only provide haircuts. Dying and perms are off limits,"" said Jervis Goh, supervisor at the New Hairstory salon in a residential area of central Singapore.
Laundry services and shops selling pet supplies were among a handful of establishments allowed to resume business on Tuesday, although most workplaces and schools remain closed and dining at restaurants is still banned under lockdown due to last until June 1.
""It feels so light now that I had it cut,"" said 85-year-old retiree Pang Kaytee, one of the first in line at the salon. Pang said he last cut his hair three months ago.
Mask-wearing staff inside the 26-seater establishment said they had to restrict the number of customers to six at a time, and each had to register and have their body temperature taken before entering. 
The city-state of 5.7 million had 24,671 COVID-19 cases as of Tuesday, one of the highest tallies in Asia, with the vast majority of infections in cramped migrant worker dormitories on the fringes of the island nation. It has recorded 21 virus-related deaths. 
Authorities say strict lockdown rules, where residents can only leave there home for essential needs like grocery shopping or to exercise alone, have curbed cases outside of the dormitories.
Staff at other salons across town could be seen disinfecting equipment and chairs just before opening, while tape marked seats that clients couldn't use to enforce social distancing. 
""I feel such relief they are reopening, I have been without a haircut for five weeks, said Muhammad Nor, a shaggy-haired 27-year-old truck driver, waiting outside a barber shop.

""It's very uncomfortable for me because of the hot weather. I thought about cutting it myself but felt that it wasn't such a good idea.""

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda's long-serving President Yoweri Museveni has said it would be wrong to hold a presidential election expected for early next year if the coronavirus persists, signalling for the first time a possible delay.
""To have elections when the virus is still there... It will be madness,"" the 75-year-old Museveni, whom opponents cast as an authoritarian clinging to power, said in an interview with the local NBS Television aired late on Monday. 
Uganda has recorded a relatively low case load of the COVID-19 disease - 121 infections and no deaths - and began easing a strict national lockdown a few days ago.
Though no date had been fixed for the 2021 election, it is typically held in February. 
In power since 1986, former rebel fighter Museveni has not confirmed whether he would run again, though the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party has already asked him to be their flagbearer and voters expect him to stand. 
The strongest opposition aspirant is pop star and lawmaker Bobi Wine whose music endears him to the young. 
Opposition leaders and rights groups accuse Museveni of cracking down on critics with intimidation, detentions, torture and tear-gassing of opposition rallies. The government denies that, saying arrests are to preserve the law. 
Under the 45-day lockdown that authorities started to ease last week, most businesses were shuttered, public gatherings banned, schools closed and movements largely curtailed. 
Museveni's doubt over holding the election contrasts with nearby Burundi where campaigns are in full throttle ahead of a presidential election next week.

There was no immediate reaction from Wine or his camp to the president's comment on the election.

The incident was a departure from a relative lull in lethal violence in the West Bank as Palestinians and Israelis have curbed movements and, to a degree, cooperated on measures in response to the coronavirus crisis.
But tensions are stirring as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu plans to swear in on Thursday a new coalition government whose agenda includes a possible declaration of sovereignty over Jewish settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley in the West Bank - a de facto annexation.
The Israeli military said the soldier, a 21-year-old conscript, was struck in the head by a rock thrown from a rooftop in Yabad village, near Jenin, as his special-forces unit withdrew after detaining four Palestinians.
""Israel's long arm will reach the terrorist and settle the score with him,"" Netanyahu said on Twitter.
The Palestinians detained in Yabad are suspected of having previously thrown rocks at Israeli cars on a nearby road, and other security offences, the military spokesman said.
There were no immediate reports of Palestinian casualties in Tuesday's incident.
The Palestinians want the West Bank for a future state and deem Israeli settlements there illegal, as do most world powers. Israel and the United States dispute that view.

Police arrested about 230 people after protests on Sunday in which hundreds gathered in shopping malls to sing and chant pro-democracy slogans, defying a ban on groups of more than eight, aimed at reining in the coronavirus.
""Regarding the media experience on that day, I also think it’s undesirable,"" Chris Tang told a district council meeting.
""I think we need to review, and even look into, what happened at that time. I also think we should have been more professional.""
Police in the Asian financial hub had fired pepper spray and run stop-and-search operations on the public and media, with the Hong Kong Journalists' Association saying filming by some media was blocked.
Video images posted online showed police pushing journalists, as well as dozens of people, some in yellow vests with press markings, being forced to kneel on a sidewalk behind a police cordon.
The former British colony, which does not require authorities to vet a press pass, has a long tradition of vibrant media, with volunteer reporters for scores of online student publications covering protests since they erupted last year.
On Monday, police said they took two student reporters, aged 13 and 16, who had attended the previous day's protest, to a station ""for their safety"", but without arresting them, and their parents later took them home.
In a letter to Hong Kong press associations, police said that while the force respected freedom of speech and media, officers had in the past seized fake press passes and faced obstruction from some people in yellow press vests.
After about three weeks with no virus transmissions in Hong Kong, protests are expected to pick up steam into the summer months, to press for democracy in the city that returned to Chinese rule in 1997.

619,By Reuters,"<span>May 12, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>",Philippines extends lockdown in capital beyond 11 weeks,"By Martin Petty and Neil Jerome Morales
MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines on Tuesday announced an extension of a lockdown of its capital, Manila, to 11 weeks, stretching one of the world's strictest and longest community quarantines to June to try to contain coronavirus outbreaks.
That would buck a global trend of easing lockdowns as countries try to strike a balance between containment and restoring some normalcy to limit economic damage. 
President Rodrigo Duterte mentioned an extension in ""some areas"" on Tuesday and his spokesman Harry Roque later confirmed the timeframe and retention of lockdown in the biggest cities, Manila and Cebu. 
That means Manila, which accounts for two-thirds of the country's infections and 72% of deaths, will be under lockdown for 11 weeks, or 80 days, longer than the 76-day quarantine in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the global epicentre of the virus.
""The lockdown had a big impact on COVID cases but it also impacted the economy,"" Roque said in a briefing. ""Government resources are limited, so we have to generate resources for the long-term fight against COVID. In the future, if without economic interventions, the result would be more harmful than the effects of COVID.""
Restrictions will be eased across most of the country in areas deemed lower-risk, and some essential economic activities will be permitted in the capital, Roque said, in a bid to restart an economy racing towards recession due to a sharp drop in domestic consumption, the main driver.
That has slammed the brakes on two decades of uninterrupted growth in the first quarter, which shrank to 0.2% compared with a year earlier, far short of economists' forecasts of a 3.1% expansion.
The Philippines has recorded more than 11,000 coronavirus infections and 726 deaths, but tested only 158,000 people so far - many fewer than other countries - making it tricky to gauge the full extent of the spread.
Duterte had warned the public against complacency and said the wearing of masks was ""a must-comply"".
""Remember that the easing up of the restrictions, this is not to say COVID is no more,"" he said. ""We cannot afford a second or third wave to happen.""
Manila's lockdown has since mid-March mandated home quarantine, social distancing, curbs on transport, immigration and outdoor exercise, and limits movement to workers in essential sectors and one adult per household for visits to supermarkets, pharmacies or clinics. 
The Philippines was one of the first countries to ban flights to and from China after three Chinese visitors tested positive, and it was the third country after China and Italy to order home quarantine, even though it had only a fraction of the cases reported elsewhere. 

That move aimed to keep its under-resourced health sector from being overwhelmed.

Taiwan, with the strong support of the United States, has stepped up its lobbying to be allowed to take part as an observer at next week's World Health Assembly (WHA), the WHO's decision-making body - a move which has angered China.
Taiwan is excluded from the WHO due to the objections of China, which views the island as one of its provinces.
Senior ministers in New Zealand last week said Taiwan should be allowed to join the WHO as an observer given its success in limiting the spread of the novel coronavirus, drawing China's ire which asked the Pacific country to ""stop making wrong statements"".
""We have got to stand up for ourselves,"" Winston Peters, New Zealand's foreign minister, said at a news conference when asked about China's response to New Zealand's position on Taiwan.
""And true friendship is based on equality. It's based on the ability in this friendship to nevertheless disagree.""
Peters said he did not think the issue would harm diplomatic ties with China, which is New Zealand's biggest trading partner.
Taiwan has reported only 440 coronavirus cases and seven related deaths, relatively low figures attributed to early and effective disease prevention and control work.
Peters praised Taiwan's response to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and said there was a lot for other countries to learn from.
""New Zealand's position on Taiwan is about its tremendous success against COVID-19,"" Peters said.
When asked about China's response later in the day, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said New Zealand's position on Taiwan was only related to its health response to COVID-19.
""We have always taken a 'One China' policy, and that continues to be the case,"" Ardern said.
Speaking in Taipei, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou expressed thanks for New Zealand's support, saying both countries were staunch supporters of freedom, democracy and human rights and that Taiwan would deepen ties with New Zealand.
Taiwan expresses regret at China's threats against New Zealand, Ou said, adding the response from China's foreign ministry was ""hysterical"".
Ties between neighbouring Australia and China have frayed in recent months after Canberra called for an international investigation into the origins and spread of the coronavirus that was first reported in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. 

China has dismissed such a probe as groundless, saying the country has been open and transparent about the outbreak.

In the video, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard cited former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder as saying Mexican authorities knew about the 2009-2011 scheme known as 'Fast and Furious.'
Representatives for Holder did not immediately reply to a request for comment. Nor did the U.S. embassy in Mexico City.
It was the first time Ebrard or President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador had made direct reference by name to a key U.S. figure connected to the program since the issue resurfaced in Mexico a week ago.
In a bid to curb cross-border gun smuggling, the U.S. scheme allowed people to illegally buy arms in the United States and take them to Mexico so that the weapons could be tracked and lead law enforcement officials to crime bosses. Some of those guns were subsequently blamed for the fatal shootings of both Mexican and U.S. citizens.
The current Mexican government has zeroed in on the program to highlight possible corruption under previous Mexican administrations amid a debate over how much they knew about the U.S. operation.
Holder, who served as U.S. Attorney General under Barack Obama between 2009 and 2015, had previously issued a statement via the U.S. embassy in Mexico contending that ""Mexican authorities"" knew about the program, Ebrard said.
""The (Mexican) government requests that it be provided with all the information available regarding the 'Fast and Furious' operation,"" Ebrard said in the video posted on Twitter.
Lopez Obrador first brought up the gun-running program last Monday when answering questions about Genaro Garcia Luna, a former Mexican security minister who was arrested in the United States in December on drug trafficking offenses.
Garcia Luna served under former President Felipe Calderon from 2006-12, spearheading a crackdown on drug cartels. Lopez Obrador has used his arrest to argue that corruption was rampant in past Mexican governments.
Some critics of Lopez Obrador contend that he has done U.S. President Donald Trump a favor by raising questions about Garcia Luna as the U.S president prepares to fight a November election against Joe Biden, who was vice president from 2009 to 2017 under Obama.
Lopez Obrador's supporters say he has focused on the issue to illustrate hypocrisy among his domestic adversaries.
Calderon, a longstanding political rival of Lopez Obrador, said last week there was no agreement between Mexico and the United States to permit illicit entry of arms.
'Fast and Furious' followed earlier sting operations that began under Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush.

The state including the city of Melbourne would take a staggered approach with teenagers in classrooms first, followed by younger pupils from June 9, Andrew said.
The Labor premier has been criticised by his political opponents for being too slow to reopen schools, a step seen as key to restoring the national economy which is heading for its first recession in 30 years.
The May 27 target date brings forward a previous government recommendation to keep Victorian students at home until mid-year, as new infections trend lower with seven new cases in the state in the 24 hours to Tuesday, according to official figures. 
Victorian classes would resume starting with years 11 and 12, and prep grades one and two, Andrews said.
""With three students in my own household, all learning from home ... I know and understand this has not been easy,"" Andrews told reporters in Melbourne. 
""But it has made a profound difference, a profound difference to the number of cases that we have.""
Drop-offs and lunch times would be staggered, cleaning would be ramped up and all adults would be required to keep their distance. 
Victoria is the last state to announce the return to school following national shutdown measures to contain the flu-like illness which began in China late last year. 
Schools in Australia's biggest state, New South Wales, reopened on Monday but only allowing students to attend one day a week on a staggered basis. 
The state reported its first 24-hour hour period without a single new positive case after conducting 6,000 tests in the same period. 
Australia has recorded about 7,000 cases of COVID-19 and 97 deaths from the virus, significantly below the levels reported in the United States, Britain and Europe. NSW and Victoria account for most of the confirmed cases and 97 deaths.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg is expected to say on Tuesday that the planned removal of most social distancing restrictions across Australia by July will boost its economy by more than A$9 billion ($5.80 billion) each month.
In a speech, extracts of which were provided in advance to media, Frydenberg is expected to say the government's gradual plan to get one million people back to work, would provide an immediate boost to its economy.

The government expects about 850,000 people will return to work once the planned relaxation of social distancing restrictions is implemented.

In a notice published in the Official Gazette, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador ordered that the Armed Forces (FA) participate ""in an extraordinary, regulated and complementary manner with the National Guard"" in public security tasks.
The armed forces will be under the command of the National Guard, the notice said, a military police created after Lopez Obrador came to the presidency on Dec. 2018. The order will last until March 2024.
The decree means the armed forces will be on Mexican streets until almost the end of the presidency of Lopez Obrador, a political veteran who often criticized former President Felipe Calderon for deploying sailors and soldiers for public security.
""His security strategy is not working and that is why he has had to order with this decree for the Armed Forces to support public security,"" security specialist Juan Ibarrola told the Milenio newspaper.
Lopez Obrador won office in 2018 vowing to adopt a more conciliatory security strategy focused on the root causes of crime, in particular by reducing poverty and corruption.
But the violence has ground on during his first year and half in charge, with a record 34,582 people murdered in 2019.
Some 3,000 homicides were recorded in March this year, the second-highest monthly murder tally ever, and the biggest since Lopez Obrador assumed power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States urged Tehran on Monday to send a charter plane to take home 11 Iranian nationals whom Washington wants to deport, and accused the Islamic Republic of stalling the repatriation process.
""We have 11 of your citizens who are illegal aliens who we have been trying to return to your country. You suddenly SAY you want them back, so how about you send a charter plane over and we’ll return all 11 at once?"" Ken Cuccinelli, acting deputy secretary of the U.S. Homeland Security Department, said in Twitter posts.
He said Washington had been trying for months to return Sirous Asgari, an Iranian science professor who was acquitted in November of stealing trade secrets but was still under U.S. custody, and that Tehran was delaying the process.
Cuccinelli did not make any mention of a prisoner swap between the two countries that cut diplomatic relations 40 years ago - something Iranian sources have said was in the works.
""Stop talking rubbish!"" Abbas Mousavi, spokesman for the Iranian Foreign Ministry, tweeted. ""Since Sep2018, @JZarif has put 'universal prisoners swap' on the table, urged U.S. act responsibly abt the Iranian HOSTAGES in & elsewhere. Your regime has reacted callously & risked their lives....Let our citizens go!""
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said earlier that Tehran had been ready for a prisoner exchange for some time and that it was the United States that had not responded yet, Iran’s Tasnim news agency quoted him as saying.
Both countries have called for the release of prisoners because of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Iran is the worst-hit country in the Middle East, while the United States has reported the highest number of deaths and infections worldwide from the virus.
Reuters reported last week that the United States was expected to deport Asgari, who tested positive for the coronavirus more than two weeks ago, once he received medical clearance to travel.
Iranian sources have said talks for a prisoner swap between the United States and Iran have been in the works for some time and that Washington was negotiating for the release of Michael White, a U.S. Navy veteran who has been detained in Iran since 2018. He was released from prison in mid-March to Swiss custody and is on medical furlough, but remains in Iran.
It was not immediately clear who would be exchanged for White, but a U.S. official denied that Washington was negotiating to swap Asgari for White as Iranian officials have suggested.
As the United States and Iran lack diplomatic relations, Switzerland looks after U.S. interests with Tehran.
On Monday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had a telephone conversation with his Swiss counterpart, Ignazio Cassis, and thanked him for Switzerland's ""continued and constructive role"" as Washington's protecting power in Iran and its assistance in repatriating U.S. citizens from that country.

MEXICO CITY ( Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI) Foundation) - The economic fallout from coronavirus could add nine million people to Mexico's poor, according to a government study released on Monday calling for aid like pensions and insurance in the country that provides no federal jobless benefits.
Increased hardship could translate to at least 70 million Mexicans, 56% of the country, not earning enough to cover basic needs, said CONEVAL, the autonomous public agency that measures poverty. 
That would be an increase from about 50% in 2018.
Mexico's overall poverty rate, a different measure that includes income and factors like education and access to food, dropped in the decade before 2018 to about 42% of the population, it said.
During that time, access to health care and the quality of housing improved most, the report said.
""The general conclusion is that this crisis threatens Mexico's advances in social development and will disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups,"" CONEVAL said.
""Facing this challenge, it is necessary to broaden and strengthen the response measures.""
Mexico has about 35,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, which has killed at least 3,400 people.
With businesses forced to close to help stop the spread of the disease, more than 346,000 formal jobs were lost between mid-March and early April, the government said, with further layoffs expected as the economy shrinks.
CONEVAL suggested policymakers consider introducing minimum universal pensions, unemployment insurance or universal basic incomes to help the most vulnerable.
Currently, there is little help for workers who lose their jobs because Mexico has no federal unemployment benefits.
Jobless workers are mostly forced to rely on savings, their families or upon private charity to survive.
The effects of losing a job are long lasting, and many workers in Mexico earn salaries near the poverty line, said David Kaplan, lead labor market specialist at the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), a lender to governments in the region.
""It doesn't take a big hit to knock these people into poverty,"" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.
In Mexico, women have been particularly vulnerable to the pandemic as they make up the majority of healthcare workers and face longer hours, risk of illness and housekeeping responsibilities, the report said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump accused Democrats of moving to reopen U.S. states from coronavirus lockdown measures too slowly for political advantage on Monday, as Pennsylvania's governor hit back against Republicans pushing a faster timetable.
The Republican president, who is running for re-election in November, is working to reopen the crippled economy quickly against recommendations from health experts to move more cautiously to avoid a resurgence of the virus that has so far killed more than 80,000 people in the United States.
Trump has encouraged states to ease restrictions designed to mitigate the spread of the new coronavirus. On Monday, he targeted the election battleground state of Pennsylvania, which has a Democratic governor, Tom Wolf. 
""The great people of Pennsylvania want their freedom now, and they are fully aware of what that entails. The Democrats are moving slowly, all over the USA, for political purposes. They would wait until November 3rd if it were up to them. Don’t play politics. Be safe, move quickly!"" Trump said in a Twitter post.
Hours later, Wolf pushed back against some leaders in Republican-dominated central Pennsylvania who had asked that their regions be included with those targeted for earlier reopenings. Wolf threatened consequences for counties that defied his order, including withholding federal stimulus funds, revoking liquor licenses and making them ineligible for business liability insurance.
""The politicians who are encouraging us to quit the fight are acting in a most cowardly way,"" Wolf said on Twitter. 
Later on Monday at a press briefing Trump acknowledged that it was up to governors to decide how fast to resume economic activity in their states. 
""If we see something wrong, we'll call them out and we'll stop it. But we are leaving it up to the governors,"" Trump said. ""Some are being not aggressive enough, in my opinion, and some are being a little bit aggressive but they're being very careful.""
Officials in Adams, York and Lancaster counties asked Wolf to include them with areas reopening soon. Lancaster officials told him on Saturday they intend to move forward with reopening on May 15, ahead of his schedule for the area. 
""I won't sit back and watch residents who live in counties under Stay at Home orders get sick because local leaders cannot see the risks of #COVID19 and push to reopen prematurely,"" Wolf said.
Some of the states hardest-hit by the novel coronavirus outbreak that has infected more than 1.3 million nationwide are led by Democratic governors, including New York and Michigan - both important prizes in the Nov. 3 election between Trump and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden.
Trump has encouraged reopenings with tweets calling on people to ""liberate"" their states, providing fuel to protests across the country including large gatherings in the Michigan capital of Lansing.
Trump's overall popularity has been mostly flat throughout the pandemic, with the number of adults who approve of him wavering between 40% and 45% from March to May, according to Reuters/Ipsos national opinion polls.

Despite mounting economic damage that saw 20.5 million Americans lose jobs in April, most Americans have consistently said in polls they want to maintain social distancing to protect themselves from the virus.

629,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 04:45PM ET</span>",Slovenia to allow passenger air traffic from Tuesday,"LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia will allow international passenger air traffic from Tuesday after it has been suspended for eight weeks due to the coronavirus epidemic, the government said late on Monday.
""The prohibition of international air flights from the EU area and from other countries to Slovenian international public airports is no longer needed,"" the government said in a statement.
It added a number of measures in the airline sector have been taken over the past weeks to protect public health. 
Slovenia has so far reported 1,460 coronavirus cases and 102 deaths.
Fraport Slovenia, a company which operates Slovenia's largest airport Ljubljana and is owned by Germany's Fraport AG Frankfurt, welcomed the decision but said most air carriers had cancelled flights to and from Ljubljana until the end of May.
""Regardless of that we have in the past days ... set everything needed to safely restart passenger traffic,"" Fraport said in a separate statement.
Before the coronavirus lockdown, the Ljubljana airport connected Slovenia to a number of mostly European destinations. Cargo traffic has not been prohibited.
The government said planes from abroad will not be able to land at Slovenia's smaller local airports until June 12.
From the middle of March Slovenia closed all schools, bars, restaurants, hotels, shops, apart from food and drug stores, and cancelled public transport. It also introduced a seven-day obligatory quarantine for most people entering the country.
It started lifting restrictions on April 20, when a number of shops reopened, while public transport resumed earlier on Monday. Some pupils are expected to return to schools on May 18. 
As a result of the lockdown Slovenia's tourism, which makes up some 12% of the country's GDP, slumped in March with arrivals of foreign tourists down by 78.1% year-on-year, the statistics office said last month.
The government expects GDP to fall by at least 8.1% this year after it increased by 2.4% in 2019.

630,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 04:15PM ET</span>",Mexican Supreme Court throws out law extending governor's mandate,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Supreme Court on Monday unanimously struck down a law extending the gubernatorial mandate of a member of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's ruling party which had fed concerns it could lead to broader changes to term limits.
The 2019 state law permitted Baja California Governor Jaime Bonilla to lengthen his term in office to five years from the original two years. But all 11 members of the Supreme Court ruled in a live online broadcast that the legislation was unconstitutional.
Governors are generally elected for a single six-year stint, but in the previous government, authorities agreed to reduce the terms of some upcoming mandates, including that of Baja California, in order to synchronize electoral calendars.
Under those changes, the current governor of the state that borders California was scheduled to serve only two years.
Still, after easily winning election in June 2019 and before he took office in November, Bonilla pushed through a law in the state congress allowing him to stay power until 2024, when the next presidential election is due to be held.
Supreme Court President Arturo Zaldivar, who has been publicly supportive of Lopez Obrador, said voters had elected Bonilla on the understanding he would serve a two-year term and that the state congress had no right to extend his period.
""Exercising the mandate awarded is subject to a pre-established period of time which cannot be modified after the fact,"" Zaldivar said. To change the terms as Bonilla had was tantamount to committing ""post-electoral fraud,"" he added.
Bonilla belongs to Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA). However, frictions have recently arisen between Bonilla and the federal government over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Mexico.
Opponents of Lopez Obrador had argued that lengthening Bonilla's mandate could set a precedent that could ultimately pave the way for presidential re-election.
Re-electing the president has been widely regarded as taboo in Mexico since the three-decade dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz, which ended with the Mexican Revolution in 1910.

Presidents are elected to serve one six-year term, and Lopez Obrador has repeatedly said he will not seek to extend his time in office. He does, however, aim to hold a so-called recall vote on his presidency by the spring of 2022 at the latest.

""We must act quickly to clean up the mess and renew these authorities,"" McConnell said in remarks opening the Senate session.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives backed the ""USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020"" extending the provisions in March, shortly before Congress left Washington as the coronavirus pandemic swept across the United States.
But the Republican-led Senate failed to pass the bill before heading home. Senators instead backed a 77-day extension, but that was not taken up in the House so the three FISA provisions, covering the government's ability to obtain and retain information, that expired on March 15 have not yet been renewed.
They face stiff opposition from privacy advocates, including liberal Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans. As the Senate considers the legislation this week, it is expected to also vote on amendments meant to rein in the law.
Trump, who is convinced that surveillance tools covered by the legislation were improperly used against his 2016 campaign, has demanded tighter controls.

Backers of the program consider it an essential tool for intelligence agencies' efforts to fight terrorism.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albania had its lowest daily infections from the new coronavirus in eight weeks on Monday as half its 2.8 million people began enjoying more freedom in green zones and life went on almost as normal in the other half.
With its economy heading for a recession of up to 5%, or 6.9% if most of the economy starts working by late summer, Albania has begun over the last two weeks to gradually re-start parts of its economy each week.
Just four new infections were traced in the last 24 hours, the lowest number of daily infections in the last eight weeks, said Eugena Tomini of the Health Institute in her daily update.
Data showed the new coronavirus's effective reproduction rate since April 24 had gone down below the critical limit, she added.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has killed 31 Albanians and infected 872, with 650 recoveries.
Monday marked the day when citizens could walk and drive without permits in the capital Tirana and some towns deemed as red zones until 5:30 p.m., when a curfew goes into effect until 5 a.m., making Tirana look like it was living a normal day.
Most of Albania's territory of 28,000 square kms and home to half its people are now green zones, having had either very few cases or none at all. People can walk and drive until 9 p.m. in those areas but carry only two family members in their cars.
Those wearing face masks and gloves stood out among most who did not and police seemed not too keen to enforce the curfew any longer given the low numbers of infections.
""We cannot stand this any longer,"" a pensioner called Llaqi, who was outside when he should not be, told Reuters of the lockdown that started on March 15. 
Barbers, hairdressers and dentists handled the wave of clients by having them either wait outside their shops or come by appointment, with some warning prices would rise due to extra hygiene measures.
With cafes and bars, very popular haunts, opening next week on condition they only serve customers outdoors, many queued outside bakeries offering takeout coffee.

But occasionally, the 34-year-old had considered instead giving birth in a Brazilian hospital and avoiding the trip. 
Coronavirus ended up making a decision for her. Lockdowns spread throughout Latin America in March, when Coll found herself near the coast of Rio de Janeiro with her husband and young son. There was no way to go back to Argentina once the nation shut down its borders. And Coll is due to give birth later this month.
""We decided in this context to do it in a private hospital that so far does not have any cases,"" Coll told Reuters from her boat, referring to the coronavirus. ""We've decided to make this investment, break open the piggy bank."" 
Her lifestyle is popular on Instagram, where her family account called the yellow boat (@el_barco_amarillo) has amassed over 60,000 followers. During normal times, they sailed nonstop living off the income they made from renting beds in their boat to their social media followers. 
Coll hopes travel restrictions will be lifted by October so they can start earning income again. But for now, they feel safer in their boat than trying to rent out an apartment in the city. 
""The virus is inland. It's not in the ocean,"" said Coll's husband Juan Manuel Dordal, 35. ""In a way, we feel we have to take care of ourselves when we leave the boat, not when we are on it.""
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's second largest city and its main tourist attraction, is also a coronavirus hot spot. Authorities have warned that hospitals may collapse and mulled imposing harsher lockdowns than the recommended quarantine guidelines currently in place. 
Their son just turned four and was going to start going to school, but the coronavirus restrictions got in the way. 
Still, Coll is upbeat about the future. 
""We had a very good season,"" Coll said, referring to the income they were able to generate from the boat. Summer in Brazil, located in the Southern Hemisphere, is opposite the Northern Hemisphere.

""There are coincidences that are just beautiful, and the money we made is exactly what we needed to pay for the birth.""

""An Interpol Red Notice has been issued for 42-year-old Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a U.S. intelligence official charged with causing the death of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn by dangerous driving,"" ITV reporter Adam Clark said on Twitter.
Interpol's website says a Red Notice is ""a request to law enforcement worldwide to locate and provisionally arrest a person pending extradition, surrender, or similar legal action."" Interpol issues such requests at the request of a member country, and they are not an international arrest warrant.
Interpol said it did not confirm red notices other than those listed on its website. Sacoolas was not listed publicly.
Britain's Crown Prosecution Service did not confirm the ITV report but said in a statement that it still wanted Sacoolas to stand trial in Britain over last August's crash.
""We will continue to do everything we can to seek to ensure that happens. We are unable, however, to give any explanation of what steps may or may not be taken, because to do so may compromise operational effectiveness,” the spokesman said. 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman reiterated criticism of the United States for refusing to extradite Sacoolas, saying it was a ""denial of justice"" and she should return to the UK. 
The U.S. State Department has said Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity and that to extradite her would set ""an extraordinarily troubling precedent"".
The case prompted an intervention from President Donald Trump in October last year, when he hosted Dunn's parents at the White House and tried unsuccessfully to persuade them to meet with Sacoolas, without having given them prior notice that she was in the building.
Asked about the ITV report, the police force local to the incident said it was in the hands of extradition specialists and declined to comment further.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Monday that several regions of the state outside New York City could start reopening their economies this weekend after meeting criteria related to hospitalizations and testing for the coronavirus, demonstrating that they are ""ready to go."" 
Cuomo said that the Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley and Southern Tier regions in central and western New York meet the seven criteria to reopen, including a two-week decline in hospital deaths and enough people to trace the contacts of new cases.
He also said certain business and recreational activities, including tennis, landscaping and drive-in theaters could open on May 15, when a stay-at-home order expires. The regions that qualify will also be allowed to reopen after that date.
""Some regions are ready to go today,"" Cuomo told a daily briefing. ""They just need to get some logistical pieces in order by the end of the week.""
Due to the rapid spread of the virus in New York City, the state has been by far the hardest hit by the pandemic, accounting for more than one-third of the nearly 80,000 American lives lost, according to a Reuters tally.
Underscoring the human costs of the health crisis, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday the number of deaths in New York City from causes other than COVID-19 rose by 5,293 above the seasonal norm during the first two months of the pandemic, citing data from the city's health department.
These deaths could be directly or indirectly attributed to the virus, including people who did not seek life-saving care for fear of exposure to COVID-19, and suggest the running death tally likely understates the actual toll, the CDC said.
Still, a nearly two-month shutdown of schools and non-essential businesses has worked to limit infections in New York, staving off a collapse of the city's hospital system, Cuomo said. Across the state, hospitalizations have been on a downward trend for nearly a month, and the 161 fatalities reported for Sunday marked the lowest number of daily coronavirus-related deaths since March 26.
'OVER THE MOUNTAIN'
While New York has taken a cautious approach to relaxing restrictions on business and daily life, other states - many of them in the South and Midwest - have moved to reopen even in the face of rising infections.
Cuomo, who has emerged as a leading national voice on the crisis, warned that reopening too quickly could backfire.
""We took the worst situation in the nation and changed the trajectory,"" Cuomo said. ""The rest of the nation the cases are still on the incline.""
Cuomo said regional reopenings would be coordinated across the state and that hospitalizations and other metrics would be watched closely. If ""circuit breakers"" are triggered, restrictions could be put back into place, he said.
""We just made it over the mountain. Nobody wants to go back to the other side of the mountain,"" the governor said.
At an earlier briefing on Monday, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said that while progress on key indicators for the virus had been made ""it's not quite where we need it to be"" to allow for a relaxing of social distancing measures.
""June is when we're potentially going to be able to make some real changes, if we can continue our progress"" de Blasio said.
Neighboring New Jersey has also seen coronavirus metrics improve in recent weeks.
At a separate briefing, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said hospitalizations continued to fall, while the 59 coronavirus-related deaths recorded over the past 24 hours was about a third of the daily count three weeks ago.

""The house is still on fire,"" Murphy said. ""Has it gotten better? Yes, it has clearly gotten better.""

KINSHASA (Reuters) - The chief of staff to Democratic Republic of Congo's president denied all wrongdoing on Monday as his trial on charges of embezzling more than $50 million in public funds opened live on national television. 
Vital Kamerhe, who appeared at a two-hour hearing wearing prison fatigues and a surgical mask as protection against the coronavirus, is the most senior politician to face trial for graft in Congo, where high-level corruption is endemic. 
Kamerhe backed President Felix Tshisekedi in his successful 2018 election campaign in return for Tshisekedi's support the next time around in 2023. The veteran power-broker's arrest on April 8 sent shock waves through the country's ruling coalition.
If convicted, Kamerhe could serve up to 20 years in prison and would be ineligible to contest the next election. 
Kamerhe, 61, told the court he never touched money earmarked for social housing under Tshisekedi's flagship 100-day building programme that prosecutors say was stolen. Kamerhe and several other senior government figures oversaw the public works drive.
""I intervened on behalf of the President of the Republic to ensure that this work is carried out and that we can meet the pressing needs of the Congolese people in the sectors of education, health and roads,"" he said.
Kamerhe is charged alongside two others, Lebanese businessman Jammal Samih and Jeannot Muhima, a senior aide to Tshisekedi. They also pleaded not guilty to the charges. 
The trial will resume on May 25. The court has 48 hours to rule on Kamerhe's request to be released on bail.
The arrest of Kamerhe, a former president of the national assembly, exposed deep fractures in his coalition with Tshisekedi. Some of Kamerhe's supporters say he is being targeted to remove a potential rival to Tshisekedi. The presidency has declined to comment on the affair. 
Transparency advocates see the trial as a litmus test case for Tshisekedi's commitment to addressing corruption, which they say was rampant under former president Joseph Kabila.

Congo is one of the world's poorest countries despite vast reserves of copper, cobalt and gold, and investigative reports by domestic and international organisations have repeatedly accused senior government officials of graft.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is weighing whether to file hate crime charges against the white men who killed Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black man who was gunned down while jogging in the small coastal town of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), Georgia, department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec said on Monday.
“The Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia have been supporting and will continue fully to support and participate in the state investigation. We are assessing all of the evidence to determine whether federal hate crimes charges are appropriate,"" Kupec said in a statement.
The Justice Department announcement comes just days after state investigators arrested a white former police officer, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, on charges of murder and aggravated assault.
The Feb. 23, shooting death of 25-year-old Arbery was captured on a video that has since gone viral on social media. The shooting and video sparked outrage across the country, with civil rights activists saying it marks yet another example of white perpetrators attacking an innocent black man.
Critics have questioned why it took local law enforcement more than two months to arrest the suspects, prompting Georgia's state attorney general to vow to investigate the delay.
Kupec said on Monday that the Justice Department is also looking into how the investigation was handled.
""We are considering the request of the Attorney General of Georgia and have asked that he forward to federal authorities any information that he has about the handling of the investigation,"" Kupec said.

""We will continue to assess all information, and we will take any appropriate action that is warranted by the facts and the law.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices on Monday wrestled with the potentially broad consequences of a rape case that could lead to huge swathes of Oklahoma being deemed tribal territory, with Justice Neil Gorsuch emerging as a potential decisive vote.
The nine justices heard about 90 minutes of arguments by teleconference in a member of a Native American tribe's challenge to his conviction of raping, molesting and sodomizing a 4-year-old girl in 1996. The man, Jimcy McGirt, argues that state prosecutors in Oklahoma lacked jurisdiction because the crime occurred on what historically should be considered tribal land.
At issue is whether the Muscogee (Creek) Nation territory where the crime was committed should be considered a Native American reservation or whether Congress eliminated that status around the time Oklahoma became a state in 1907.
If the justices side with McGirt, that effectively would recognize for the first time much of eastern Oklahoma, including the entire city of Tulsa, as reservation land. 
Under U.S. law, tribe members who commit crimes on tribal land cannot be prosecuted in state courts and instead are subject to federal prosecution, which sometimes can be beneficial to defendants. McGirt, 71, has served almost 23 years in prison. McGirt, who is not contesting his guilt in the case before the justices, is appealing a 2019 ruling by a state appeals court in favor of Oklahoma.
Gorsuch, a conservative justice with a history of siding with Native Americans in legal cases, asked questions that suggested he was leaning against Oklahoma. His questions signaled sympathy toward the conclusion that the land still should be recognized as a reservation and that Congress considered eliminating such status but never actually did so.
Gorsuch questioned Oklahoma's reliance on later historical evidence, including that the tribe had previously appeared to accept that its land was not a reservation.
""I guess I'm struggling to think why that should be relevant in an interpretation of statutes from the last century,"" Gorsuch said. 
The history of this issue also shows that sometimes ""states have violated Native American rights,"" Gorsuch added.
McGirt is a member of the Seminole Nation but the crime occurred on land historically claimed by the Creek Nation. 
Oklahoma argued that the Creek Nation never had a reservation. But even if one existed, the state and President Donald Trump's administration argued it long ago was eliminated by Congress.
'TRAIL OF TEARS'
The justices are considering a complex historical record that started with the forced relocation by the U.S. government of Native Americans, including the Creek Nation, to Oklahoma in a traumatic 19th century event known as the ""trail of tears."" 
A reservation is land managed by a tribe under the federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and generally exempt from state jurisdiction including taxation. More than 1.8 million people live in the land at issue, including roughly 400,000 in Tulsa, Oklahoma's second-largest city.
Some justices including conservative Justice Samuel Alito appeared concerned about the potentially broad ramifications of a ruling backing tribal authority.
But liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor said if problems do arise, Congress could address them.
""This is easily fixable by Congress,"" Sotomayor said.
If the land is deemed a reservation, tribe members there would become exempt from state taxes, while certain Native Americans found guilty in state courts may be able to challenge their convictions on jurisdictional grounds. The tribe also may obtain more power to regulate alcohol sales and expand casino gambling. 
The Supreme Court last year failed to resolve another case covering the same legal issue. That one involved a Creek Nation member named Patrick Murphy who was convicted of murder. Gorsuch did not participate and the court's failure to issue a ruling suggested the remaining justices were split 4-4.
The ruling could affect the other four of the ""Five Tribes"" in Oklahoma: the Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Seminole tribes.

McGirt's sentence of 1,000 years in prison could be tossed out and he could get a new trial in federal court if the justices side with him.

DUBAI (Reuters) - One Iranian warship accidentally struck another with a missile during an exercise, killing 19 sailors and wounding 15 others, Iran's navy said on Monday.
The incident took place during training in the Gulf of Oman, a sensitive waterway that connects to the Strait of Hormuz through which about a fifth of the world's oil passes. Iran regularly conducts exercises in the area.
The frigate Jamaran fired at a training target released by a support ship, the Konarak. However, the support ship stayed too close to the target and was hit, state broadcaster IRIB said.
""The incident took place in the perimeter of Iran’s southern Bandar-e Jask port on the Gulf of Oman during Iranian Navy drills on Sunday afternoon, in which 19 sailors were killed and 15 others were injured,"" state TV said, quoting the navy. 
Fars news agency quoted an unidentified military official as denying some Iranian media reports that the Konarak had sunk. The navy statement said investigations were undergoing regarding the cause of the incident, student news agency ISNA said.
Video posted on Twitter purportedly of the Konarak showed a heavily damaged ship with black smoke rising from one side.
Reuters could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video.
IRIB said the Dutch-made Konarak vessel, which was purchased before Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, had been overhauled in 2018, and is equipped with four cruise missiles. 
The incident took place at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the United States since 2018, when the United States withdrew from a nuclear deal between major powers and Iran, and Washington re-imposed sanctions on Tehran.
Animosity deepened in early January when a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani. Iran retaliated on Jan. 8 by firing missiles at U.S. military bases in Iraq. Later that day, Iran's armed forces shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing all 176 people aboard, in what the military later acknowledged was a mistake.
Many of those killed aboard the airliner were Iranian and postings on social media on Monday drew comparisons between the two incidents.

""Until when does the Islamic Republic want to play with the lives of Iranians,"" a Twitter user name Sedighe Taheri wrote.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal will use long-range drones and other surveillance means to reinforce the monitoring of summer wildfires, officials said on Monday, responding to concerns over the country's readiness to tackle forest blazes during the coronavirus pandemic.
European Union data shows Portugal is one of the bloc's worst-hit countries by fires every year. One of the root causes of its frequent wildfires is that parts of the country's interior are deserted as people have left to live in cities or abroad, and the job of clearing trees and bushes is ignored, creating a fire risk. 
Municipalities and firefighters say that risk could have intensified during the country's lockdown due to the coronavirus over the past two months.
Environment Minister Joao Matos Fernandes said 12 drones, each with a range of 100 km and capable of flying for up to eight hours to spot wildfires, would be deployed from the end of June, when higher temperatures make fires more likely.
Officials said last month that around 100 firefighters had been infected by the novel coronavirus. 
Matos Fernandes, however, said that for now at least, the coronavirus outbreak is unlikely to have any notable impact on the number of firefighters ready to tackle forest fires.
""Firefighters have prepared themselves to reduce the risk of contagion but we cannot say a decrease in human resources won't happen,"" Matos Fernandes told a news conference. ""That's why we decided to reinforce vigilance.""
In June last year major wildfires in central Portugal burned about 8,500 hectares, destroying houses and forcing authorities to evacuate villagers, who said there were not enough firefighters and resources to combat the flames. 
In June 2017, a huge wildfire near the town of Pedrogao Grande caused the deadliest disaster in modern Portuguese history, killing 64 people and injuring more than 250.
Defence Minister Joao Cravinho said on Friday that the army would send soldiers to support residents and firefighters during the wildfire season if needed. 
There are also concerns about delays in land clearing, which is essential to prevent or slow down wildfires.

A survey by services platform Fixando of 600 land clearing providers showed 77% experienced a drop in demand due to the coronavirus and the government's lockdown measures.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - France is urging its European Union partners to consider threatening Israel with a tough response if it goes ahead with a de facto annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank, three EU diplomats said.
Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg also want to discuss the possibility of punitive economic measures during a foreign ministers' meeting on Friday, the diplomats told Reuters, though all member states would have to agree to any collective action.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said cabinet discussions will start in July over extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank, as was mooted under U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan.
Palestinians have expressed outrage at Israel's plans to cement its hold further on land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, territory they are seeking for a state.
The EU diplomats did not give details on what punitive measures EU member states might consider to try to dissuade Israel from making the move.
In terms of procedure, EU governments would need to ask the Commission and the EU foreign policy division, the EEAS, to draw up a list of options.
All 27 EU nations would need to agree to any EU response and Israel's closest allies such as Hungary and the Czech Republic could still block even preparatory work.
An EU spokesman on Monday declined to comment on internal discussions but said: ""annexation is contrary to international law and if annexation goes ahead, the EU will act accordingly"". 
TRADE, RESEARCH AT RISK
Israel has long been a part of the EU's research and innovation programme Horizon 2020, which was worth nearly 80 billion euros between 2014 and 2020, according to the European Commission. 
The EU is also Israel's top trading partner and Israel benefits from trade preferences with the world's largest trading bloc.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in February Trump's plan departed from ""internationally agreed parameters"". Borrell said that steps to annex Palestinian territory, ""if implemented, could not pass unchallenged.""
That is a view taken by France, Belgium, Luxembourg and Ireland, according to EU diplomats. 
""There is clearly a need to look at what annexation means in the context of international law and we do need to know our options,"" said one senior EU diplomat involved in discussions.
""We also need to say what exactly the consequences of annexation would be, ideally as a way to stop any such move,"" the diplomat said.
The Palestinians and many countries regard the West Bank settlements as illegal under the Geneva Conventions that bar settling on land captured in war. Israel disputes this, citing security needs and biblical, historical and political connections to the land.

Guaido thanked Rendon and another exiled lawmaker, Sergio Vergara, who also resigned from the opposition's ""crisis strategy commission,"" for their ""dedication and commitment to Venezuela,"" without giving a reason for the decision.
Rendon has said that while he negotiated an exploratory agreement with Florida's Silvercorp USA late last year, he cut ties with the firm's chief executive, Jordan Goudreau, in November.
Goudreau, Rendon said, then went ahead with an operation led by two ex-U.S. soldiers to capture Maduro. The plot failed and Venezuelan authorities said security forces killed eight members during one May 3 incursion attempt and arrested a dozen more, including the two U.S. citizens, the following day.
Guaido has denied any involvement in the bungled invasion. But it has raised doubts about his leadership some 16 months since he first declared a rival presidency and denounced Maduro as a usurper who had overseen a six-year economic collapse.
In the statement, Guaido's press team said Rendon and Vergara ""ratified their support for the democratic cause... and called for all national and international sectors to reinforce their support for the interim president.""
Rendon and Vergara confirmed their resignations in public letters. Rendon said the commission had never been interested in ""participating in violent activities,"" while Vergada said he had not been aware of the so-called Operation Gideon.
Goudreau, in media interviews, has confirmed his role organizing the incursion.
On Friday, Venezuela Chief Prosecutor Tarek Saab said his office had requested the extradition of Goudreau, Rendon and Vergara for their involvement in the ""design, financing, and execution"" of the plan.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's ruling coalition plans to propose legislation on Monday to allow both postal and in-person voting in a presidential election postponed from last Sunday, sources said, as it seeks political backing to schedule a new ballot.
Planning for the election collapsed at the last minute amid rifts within the coalition and with its opponents over how and when to hold the vote during the coronavirus pandemic.
The coalition's main member, the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, had sought to hold the ballot on schedule through a mail-only vote, but critics said it was putting political gain ahead of public health.
PiS does not want to delay the presidential election too much as the incumbent, Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, risks losing his leading position in the polls as the economic fallout from the coronavirus worsens. 
Late on Sunday, the electoral commission said the PiS-nominated parliamentary speaker had 14 days to set a new date, which must be within 60 days of the announcement.
PiS, however, needs the support of its coalition partners and the opposition to amend election rules to allow for some form of postal voting, which it had advocated to mitigate health risks from the pandemic.
Poland has to date only allowed postal voting in exceptional circumstances, such as voter disability. Last week legislation was approved to allow for a mail-only vote, which would be subject to amendment by PiS coalition partners to ensure the vote is legal and fair.
Without opposition and coalition support, PiS risks lengthy parliamentary debate that could undermine its preparations for the election yet again. 
The amended draft legislation, expected to be made public on Monday, according to two sources with knowledge of the process, is being put together by members of PiS' junior coalition partner Accord.
The new rules would allow for ""hybrid voting"", essentially allowing voters to choose if they want to vote in-person or by mail, a move that is expected to be supported by the opposition. 
""This seems like a realistic, good and advantageous solution,"" one of the sources said. 
The draft will also seek to reinforce the role of the National Electoral Commission in organizing elections and allow more candidates to join the presidential ballot. 
The coalition is hoping for the approval of Poland's largest opposition group, the centrist Civic Platform (PO), in order to ensure the legislation is passed quickly, so the presidential election can take place in June or July. 

The upper house of parliament, the Senate, is controlled by the opposition and is entitled to hold a piece of legislation for up to 30 days but can vote it through more quickly.

The decision to reopen the mosques was made in consultation with the ministry of health, IRIB quoted Mohammad Qomi, the director of the Islamic Development Organization, as saying.
The move comes even though some parts of the country have seen a rise in infections. 
Tasnim news agency reported on Sunday that a county in southwestern Iran had been placed under lockdown to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus. It also quoted the governor of Khuzestan province, where the county is located, as saying there had been a sharp rise in new cases across the province.
Last Friday, prayer gatherings resumed in up to 180 Iranian cities and towns seen as being at low risk of coronavirus contagion after a two-month suspension, state media reported.
The resumption of Friday prayers — still banned in the capital Tehran and some other major cities — followed the reopening last Monday of 132 mosques in areas consistently free of the virus.
Schools will reopen next week, President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday, according to the official presidency website.
Iran has already lifted a ban on inter-city trips and malls, with large shopping centres resuming activities.
The total number of Iran's coronavirus deaths rose by 45 in the past 24 hours to 6,685, Health Ministry spokesman Kianush Jahanpur said in a statement on state TV. The total number of diagnosed cases in the country has reached 109,286.
Iran, one of the countries in the Middle East hit hardest by the novel coronavirus, has begun easing restrictions on normal life in order to keep afloat its economy, already battered by U.S. sanctions. Health officials have repeatedly warned, however, that easing restrictions could lead to a renewed spike in the number of infections. 
Rouhani announced the replacement of the minister of industry, mines and trade on Monday, according to the official presidency website, a decision that appeared to be an attempt to boost the economy.
Hossein Modares Khiabani will replace Reza Rahmani as the caretaker head of the ministry, the announcement said without noting why Rahmani was dismissed.
Rouhani called on Khiabani to stabilise car prices, eliminate obstacles for domestic production and expand non-oil exports.

KARACHI (Reuters) - Markets across Pakistan were teeming on Monday after opening up for the first time in over a month as the country began to lift its lockdown despite a rise in the rate of coronavirus infections.
Pakistan announced last week that it would begin a phased lifting of its lockdown because of the effect it was having on the economy and an impoverished workforce.
Public transport remains shut, but factories and offices have been allowed to resume operations. Restrictions on mosque attendance had already been lifted before last week's announcement. 
""We opened today after almost two months; I am almost bankrupt and owe workers their salaries,"" said Muhammad Sattar, a garment shop owner in one of the busiest commercial areas of Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and financial capital.
Areas around wholesale markets in Karachi saw heavy traffic jams, and there were also big crowds in the commercial centres of the provincial capitals of Lahore and Quetta.
However, there are signs that Pakistan's outbreak is accelerating. Of its 667 deaths from the coronavirus, around 200 have been registered over the past week, and there are almost 31,000 confirmed infections.
Prime Minister Imran Khan justified easing the lockdown by saying: ""We know we’re doing it at a time when our (infection) curve is going up ... but it is not increasing (as fast) as we were expecting.""
But he said the virus could run out of control if people did not take precautions.
Faisal Subzwari, a leader of a political party allied with Khan, tweeted his frustration with many citizens:
""If 99%, 95% of shopkeepers and buyers are not wearing masks, what's the point of talking about other precautionary measures?""
Many doctors have said they fear the outbreak will gather pace among a population of more than 200 million and overwhelm the struggling health system. 
Markets were also packed in Peshawar, the capital of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province, which has registered 245 dead and has the highest mortality rate in the country.
""I opened my shop for the first time today after locking it on March 24,"" said Ghousul Azam, adding that he had a family to support. ""Better to die of coronavirus, because I can’t survive sitting at home.""
Schools and large shopping malls remain shut for now, and markets will initially be allowed to operate only until 5 p.m.

But with the Muslim holiday of Eid coming in two weeks, crowds are likely to increase.

Belgians must now shop alone and should wear face masks and in some stores even gloves. But many still thronged shopping streets for the first time since mid-March, albeit with a cordon system in place to create one-way routes and avoid pedestrians from bumping into one another.
""At first, we weren't following the indications, but now we get it, we see the markings on the ground,"" said shopper Ambroisine Igouanga, who works in Brussels, wearing a brightly-coloured homemade cotton face mask.

The government has begun allowing a gradual easing of restrictions from May 4, with a series of phases of further re-opening during the course of the month. 
However, beauty salons, hairdressers and tattoo parlours remained closed because physical distancing is not possible.
With almost 55,000 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 8,707 deaths, Belgium has been among the most affected in Europe per capita, although it was also quick to report deaths in care homes and also counts deaths of those suspected to have the COVID-19 disease, based on symptoms.
In an encouraging sign, the number of hospital admissions in Belgium was 60 over the past 24 hours, compared to 10 times that level each day in late March.
LINES, STRESS ... SALES?
Complete with mini-roundabouts on pedestrian streets to allow people to change direction, shoppers were greeted by ""welcome back"" signs in shop windows, hand sanitizers, gloves, police patrols, and also long queues. 
""Unfortunately, I had to wait ages for some hearing aid batteries. It was urgent,"" said Salvatore, a jobless man who works in the still-shuttered restaurant sector.
Others were just grateful to be able to go out, and some were expecting stores to be offering reductions.
""It's great, I'm expecting sales, I think everyone is,"" said Firene Azeri from Azerbaijan, who lives in Brussels with her husband and child.

""NDS will continue its comprehensive and targeted operations to hunt down senior leaders of regional terrorist groups and destroy the joint hubs of these terrorist networks,"" the statement said.
South Asia Islamic State is mainly focused on a small presence in Afghanistan, largely in the north, though it has waged high profile attacks further south in the capital.
Afghan security forces arrested eight members of a network grouping Islamic State and Haqqani militants responsible for bloody attacks in the capital including on Sikh worshippers, the country's security agency said last Wednesday.
The ongoing violence underscored the challenges to securing lasting peace in Afghanistan even after the United States signed a troop withdrawal agreement with the militant Taliban in February. 
The Taliban, which says it opposes the Islamic State and has fought the group, has since held off on large-scale attacks on foreign forces or in major centres, though it has continued attacking Afghan security forces throughout the provinces.
On Monday, there were four roadside blasts in the capital which wounded four civilians, including a child, according to Kabul's police. No group immediately claimed responsibility.
Clashes in eastern Laghman province between security forces and the Taliban killed six security force members and wounded five, according to Haroon Yousufzai, a local military spokesman. The ministry of defence said the Taliban also suffered heavy casualties. 
The Afghan government and foreign powers including the United States have been calling on the group to reduce violence, saying it is hindering progress on moving towards formal peace talks.

Children at Geneva's La Tour School had to adapt to new rituals, with parents dropping them off at a distance. Classrooms were half full to reduce crowding and desks spaced 2 metres apart.
Under a courtyard shelter in heavy rain, children laughed while others played hopscotch and one girl helped a smaller child put on disposable gloves.

""Of course we wish to send our children to school as it is terrible to stay at home all day long. I am so confused at this moment,"" she said.
Linda Bapst in Prilly said her 3-year-old son resuming kindergarten on Monday was anxious at having to enter the building alone for the first time.
At a private school near Lausanne, teachers wore masks and one a full-face visor while children had their temperature taken outside. Two were turned away.
The country's public health agency has released an educational video aimed at easing concerns.
In it, two children kick a cross-eyed, spiky football shaped like the new coronavirus, as a teacher explains that ""everything is a bit different at school at the moment but together we are strong and we'll get through it.""
Magalie Chaffard, a mother, said she felt reopening schools was an important step towards resuming a normal routine.

""At a certain point, life needs to go on,"" she said.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Thirsty Czechs were allowed to return to beer gardens on Monday in one of the the government's most eagerly anticipated measures to relax coronavirus restrictions.
Authorities also permitted some schools, hairdressers, malls, cinemas and other businesses to reopen. Museums and galleries opened their doors and the government gave the green light for weddings, cultural and religious events of fewer than 100 people. Professional sports teams resumed full training.
But for many Czechs - who rank as the world's biggest beer drinkers per capita - the reopening of restaurant terraces and beer gardens was a highlight of the government's plan to re-start the economy in stages.
""Considering the beer is finally in a glass rather than a plastic cup from a take-away window, it is absolutely great,"" said Ivan Verner, a retiree sipping a Pilsner Urquell at the historic U Pinkasu pub in central Prague.
Late-morning drinkers filled half the tables. The other half were closed due to social distancing restrictions.
""I've been looking forward to this moment since they announced the news beer gardens would reopen,"" Verner said.
Strict lockdown measures have taken a harsh economic toll, with Czech manufacturing activity at its weakest since the 2009 global financial crisis. But the country is now slowly moving towards some semblance of normality.
""The clothes we should have been selling for the spring, we will now be selling in the summer and in the fall,"" said Michal Micka, owner of the Pietro Filipi and Kara fashion brand chains, who predicted a 25% sales drop in 2019.
""That is the only way to deal with this. We have stock and we have to sell it.""
The government has sought to help companies with salary subsidies and rent deferrals but many firms say a complicated application process makes assistance hard to come by.
Authorities also eased travel restrictions from Monday, allowing residents from outside the European Union to enter the country if they can show a negative COVID-19 test and are taking up certain kinds of work, such as in the healthcare sector.
Trains and buses also restarted foreign routes while Czech Airlines has said it will resume some operations on May 18 with flights to Amsterdam, Frankfurt, Paris and Stockholm. 
The Czech Republic reported 8,123 cases of the virus by Monday morning with 280 deaths, far less than many of its western European neighbours.

655,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 08:21AM ET</span>","In France's race for virus masks, old people lost out","By Caroline Pailliez, Matthias Blamont and Tangi Salaün
PARIS (Reuters) - In late February, as the COVID-19 pandemic was about to hit, French President Emmanuel Macron faced a critical decision. Like most countries, France did not have enough protective face masks.
His response was to intervene. By decree, his government put the state in control of all stocks of masks on French territory. Officials were to distribute them to frontline healthcare workers.
Macron's far-reaching step was unique among major European states. The decree eventually helped channel protective equipment to those most at risk, such as the elderly and people with underlying chronic health conditions, people in the sector told Reuters.
But for some, including hundreds of France's retirement homes, it meant that mask deliveries from private suppliers failed to arrive as expected. As a result, homes with low stocks operated for around 10 days without supplies, a Reuters examination found.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, has triggered a global shortage of protective equipment; some world leaders now face criticism for not doing enough in the face of the epidemic. 
The experience in France underscores how, confronted with the deadly new virus and sparse resources with which to tackle it, even governments that have acted forcefully can face limits and unintended consequences to their interventions. 
Thirty minutes' drive from the centre of Paris, the state-owned Emile Gerard retirement home had placed orders with its usual suppliers for 1,700 protective masks in late February and early March for the 240-bed facility, said interim manager Elsa Nicoise. 
Those orders went unfulfilled. Her two suppliers told Nicoise that the equipment she ordered had been requisitioned by the government, she said. 
With only meagre stocks in reserve, she had to ration masks. ""We handed them out parsimoniously,"" said Nicoise. Seven residents have died with the virus. At least seven staff have tested positive for COVID-19.
Emile Gerard was one of many homes affected. The requisition decree disrupted supplies of tens of thousands of masks to retirement homes - which in total accommodate around 1 million residents - just as the virus was starting to spread among the vulnerable and elderly. That conclusion is based on interviews with four medical supplies distribution firms whose customers include more than 4,000 medical establishments, two nursing home industry representatives, two nursing home bosses, and a trade union official.
The government never physically requisitioned stocks of masks, but producers and suppliers who wanted to avoid violating the decree stopped shipping them to customers. Most didn't resume regular deliveries until late March.
Reuters found no evidence of a direct link between the requisition policy and the deaths of any particular nursing home residents. People in the French nursing home sector say their protective equipment supplies are now adequate. 
But Jean-Pierre Riso, head of FNADEPA, an industry group that represents retirement home bosses, believes the supply interruption exposed some residents in nursing homes across France to the virus.
""The absence of protective equipment in the first weeks of March contributed to the spread of the virus in retirement homes,"" Riso said. 
The French presidential administration declined to respond to questions about the mask requisition, referring to the health ministry. The ministry, in a statement to Reuters, said its order was aimed at preventing market speculation and directing supplies where they were most needed. It said it never seized supplies or insisted that all masks be supplied exclusively to the state, and whenever it became aware of a shortage, it acted to fix that. 
The ministry said, however, stocks of masks had initially been frozen - it did not say who by - and that nursing homes at the start of the crisis were worried about supplies.
As of May 9, 9,737 people had died in French nursing homes with coronavirus-related illnesses, according to health ministry data. That's just under 40% of total deaths in the outbreak as measured by the health ministry.
ROOSEVELT
Macron, a 42-year-old former investment banker, became president in 2017 promising to unleash the power of the free market, changed the law to enable companies to ask staff to work longer hours, and tried to remove some pension privileges, prompting strikes and protests.  
But faced by the new disease in late February, he cranked up the levers of the state, which owns and operates about half of France's 7,400 nursing homes. All receive protective equipment through commercial companies, which also supply hospitals in France's state-run health service. 
When the outbreak erupted, France's decade-old strategic stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) had gradually diminished and not been replenished. 
The country was supposed to hold one billion surgical masks and 600 million filtering facepiece or FFP2 masks – also known as N95 masks, a tight-fitting design to protect the wearer from infection. But it had zero FFP2 masks and the stock of surgical masks was down to 117 million, Health Minister Olivier Veran told reporters on March 21.
In a global supply squeeze, it was suddenly clear it would not be possible to import enough masks: Macron had reached a ""Rooseveltian moment,"" an Elysee Palace official told Reuters, in a reference to the U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ramped up state intervention during the Great Depression of the 1930s.
SUPPLIES HALT 
In a late February meeting, health ministry officials told representatives of big mask producers - four French manufacturers and several foreign firms - that the state would be requisitioning masks, said Franck Sarfati, director of sales with CAHPP, a firm that procures supplies and services on behalf of 4,000 medical establishments. 
From then, producers became hesitant to provide supplies, Sarfati said. Under a March 3 government decree, all regular shipments stopped, and big producers were to send masks to major hospitals in each region. From there they were to be allocated to the health care workers who needed them.
But according to Sarfati, a second commercial supplier and four executives in the nursing home industry, there was a bottleneck: The centralised state supplies were going as planned to the major hospitals, but not being transferred on to the nursing homes. 
With the fresh supplies blocked, the Emile Gerard home was left with a stock of 800 surgical masks and 765 FFP2 masks, said Nicoise. A local school donated another 700 masks. It was not enough. At the rate that the home was using masks now, she said, the FFP2 masks would last for several weeks, but the surgical masks would only last a few days. 
Anissa Amini, an employee of the home and a trade union representative, said there were times staff caring for a resident did so without an FFP2 mask - because managers had not provided it - then discovered later the person had COVID-19. 
""That's how it spreads,"" she said. Nicoise declined to comment on this point, saying she needed to know the details of any given case. She said the home had promptly implemented all safety measures and recommendations set out by the government. Emile Gerard's suppliers did not immediately respond to comment. 
""PANIC ON DECK""
Retirement homes across France found themselves unable to source new supplies during this period, suppliers and nursing homes said. 
Robert Kohler, director of the La Roseliere nursing home in Kunheim, eastern France, realised on the evening of March 19 he had only three days' supply left.  After two days of telephone calls seeking help, some businesses donated masks to the home. 
Mask supplier Le Réseau Cocci said there were delivery disruptions to all the 160 nursing and retirement homes and three hospitals that it supplies. ""We had a huge number of calls from hospitals and we weren't able to give them answers,"" said its boss, Ronald Monfrini.
Another supplier, Voussert, had orders for around 200,000 masks on its books for clients including dozens of nursing homes, doctors' surgeries and clinics, said Laurent Camin, its chairman. With the requisition decree, deliveries came to a halt, affecting 1,000 customers, he said. He did not have a breakdown of how many of those were nursing homes. 
""It was panic on deck,"" said Florence Arnaiz-Maumé, head representative of Synerpa, a lobby group for private retirement homes, describing the mood in the first 10 days of March among the 1,800 nursing homes that are members of her organisation. She said that since then the supplies were restored and the requisition had helped.
""NOT A PRIORITY""
In the Emile Gerard home, the first state-provided supplies of masks arrived on March 22, but by then the virus had already spread. Some residents would not survive the pandemic. They included Denise Pham Van, the 99-year-old widow of a World War Two veteran.
At the start of the outbreak, Denise, who suffered from dementia, was physically well, said her daughter, Monique Pham Van. As it progressed, she deteriorated. Visits were barred because of the virus, but on a Skype call, Monique Pham Van said, her mother had looked worryingly thin, and did not speak. 
Within a week, Denise was on a drip and being administered oxygen. She had no fever and was not coughing - two of the symptoms of COVID-19 - and the home made an exception to the ban on visits, allowing her daughter to be at her bedside.
On April 13, Monique, wearing a mask, held her mother's hand and talked to her as her breathing became more and more shallow. Her mother died a little before 2 a.m. the next day. 
Two days after that, Denise's family were told she had been one of those infected with COVID-19.
""I think that partly the contamination is due to this absence, this lack of equipment,"" said Monique Pham Van. In the race to supply healthcare workers in France with protective gear, nursing homes, she said ""were not a priority."" 
Manager Nicoise said it was difficult to make that link, given there is much scientists still don't understand about the virus. ""It's too early to draw conclusions,"" she said. ""We're still really in the thick of it. The time for analysis will come after.""
At least 11 families of nursing home residents have filed legal complaints  that identify a lack of masks and other protective gear among the alleged shortcomings in treatment during the outbreak, according to documents seen by Reuters and Fabien Arakelian, the lawyer representing  the families. He said he was preparing another 10 complaints. 

The families have not specified who is the target of their complaints; their lawyer said this approach may trigger an inquiry to establish who was to blame.

657,By Reuters,"<span>May 11, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",Turkey turns to medical diplomacy to heal damaged relations,"By Tuvan Gumrukcu
ANKARA (Reuters) - Emblazoned with Turkish flags and presidential seals, crates packed with medical equipment are loaded onto planes, part of a major aid campaign by Ankara which has dispatched supplies to dozens of countries since the new coronavirus pandemic erupted.
""There is hope after despair and many suns after darkness,"" says a message on every shipment - a line from 13th century Sufi poet Jalaluddin Rumi, which looks to better days not just in the battle against COVID-19 but also for Turkey's fraught diplomacy.
With its relations with NATO allies in Europe and the United States darkened by disputes over Russian missile defences, human rights and Western sanctions on Iran, Turkey hopes the virus crisis is an opportunity to soothe recent tensions. 
Despite battling one of the world's biggest coronavirus outbreaks at home - where the death toll now exceeds 3,700 -, Turkey has sent medical aid to 61 countries, including the United States, Spain, Italy, France and Britain. 
By its own calculations, Ankara has been the world's third biggest aid distributor during the outbreak, sending face masks, protective suits, testing kits, disinfectant and respirators. 
In a letter to President Donald Trump sent with one shipment, President Tayyip Erdogan said he hoped the ""spirit of solidarity"" Turkey had shown would help U.S. politicians ""better understand the strategic importance of our relations"". 
Ankara faces potential U.S. sanctions over its purchase of Russian S-400 missile defences, which it bought last year but has not yet fully deployed. Despite the threat of sanctions, it says the systems will ultimately be activated.
On Saturday, Erdogan also called on the European Union to increase its cooperation with Turkey in light of the support Ankara provided member states during the outbreak. ""I hope the EU now understands that we are all in the same boat,"" he said.
Turkey remains a candidate for EU membership but the process has long stalled amid disputes over Turkey's human rights record, the handling of Syrian refugees and gas exploration around Cyprus and the eastern Mediterranean.
PROBLEMS PERSIST
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the aid initiative had lifted the mood with Washington.
""Has there been a positive atmosphere after the latest aid Turkey sent? Yes, and there is a positive atmosphere in the eyes of the (U.S.) public too,"" Cavusoglu said, adding however that ""the core problems with the United States still persist"".
Turkish aid shipments were also sent to Libya, Iraq, Iran, the Palestinian Authority, Russia, the Balkans and to China, where the new coronavirus first emerged.
Turkey says it has also sent aid to Israel, despite tensions over Israeli settlement building in the West Bank and the status of Jerusalem. Both sides expelled their top diplomats in 2018.
Turkey has sent aid to 15 countries in Africa, where it is seeking to expand influence and commercial ties. 
Not all aid shipments have gone smoothly. A commercial shipment of ventilators to Spain was delayed over export licences. Another commercial shipment of 400,000 protective suits to Britain was criticised after some failed quality checks, but both Ankara and London said that was not a government-to-government shipment, and that there had been no problem with aid sent directly by Turkey.
While the diplomatic outreach may have brought a change of tone to some of Ankara's troubled international relations, analysts say lasting results are unlikely without concrete steps to address fundamental differences.
""No amount of goodwill, no amount of medical diplomacy will alter the negative repercussions that Turkey's deployment of the S-400s has produced in Washington,"" said Fadi Hakura, consulting fellow at the Royal Institute of International Affairs in London. 
""If Turkey wants to curry favour with Washington, it has to terminate the S-400s.""
Gonul Tol, founding director of The Middle East Institute's Center for Turkish Studies in Washington, said Turkey's differences with the EU would also not be resolved overnight.

""While some countries have welcomed Turkish aid, Ankara's problems with its neighbours and Western allies are too serious to be resolved by a few symbolic steps,"" she said.

MANILA (Reuters) - In the past few weeks, Manila Bay in the Philippines has been transformed into the world's biggest parking lot for cruise ships, none of which have any guests.
More than 20 vessels collectively weighing about 2 million tonnes are clustered off the coast of the capital, awaiting coronavirus clearance for more than 5,300 Philippine staff to return home from abandoned cruises, with no guarantee of a job at sea again. 
More ships are set to join the flotilla, says the coast guard, which has been shuttling between ships to administer 4,991 virus tests for crew quarantined for the 14 days mandatory for repatriates. No suspected cases have been reported.
(To see related graphic, click on https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/xklpykbxepg/Manila-Bay.jpg)
Crew told Reuters they were bored, lonely or frustrated being so close to home, but felt fortunate to be confined to their cabins in comfort, knowing that thousands of Philippine returnees are in tougher quarantine conditions elsewhere.
""Each person is staying in a suite room - We feel like the guests now,"" joked Michael Torralba Martinez, speaking from one of the cabins that he normally cleans.
""We feel safer here ... Standards are strict in ships when it comes to cleanliness and sanitation,"" he said in an online chat.
Martinez, 33, and the father of two, gave Reuters a virtual tour of his room, one of 1,011 on the 15-deck Sun Princess, where 225 quarantined Philippine staff were being served by colleagues from countries such as China, India and Indonesia.
He displayed photographs of room-service meals, his double bed, balcony and flatscreen television, plus daily puzzles and activities like origami and bingo, to keep entertained in rooms guarded by security staff.
""If someone is caught leaving the room, quarantine is back to day zero for everyone. So no one dares,"" he added.
At least 15 ships in the Manila flotilla are owned by subsidiaries of cruise giant Carnival (NYSE:CUK) Corp, including Costa Cruises, Cunard, P&O Cruises Australia and Princess Cruises, of which three ships were hotbeds for infections. Those firms did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters. 
The return is bittersweet for some, a chance to be home again with less risk of prolonged exposure to an outbreak, but soon jobless and facing dim employment prospects in an industry brought to a virtual standstill by outbreaks, travel bans and flight cuts.
'HAPPY AND SAD'
""When I learned we'll be sent back home, I was happy and sad at the same time. Sad because I'll lose my job, but happy because I can be with my family,"" said Jenison Herrera of the housekeeping staff of the Queen Elizabeth.
The ship has been quarantined since April 20 and without passengers since March 14, a month into Herrera's nine-month contract, when owners in Australia decided to halt services and sail home the 530 Philippine crew. 
""Those who are not in quarantine are the ones who give our needs. We call them 'frontliners',"" Herrera 33, said of colleagues. ""Even the highest positions in the ship.""
It is too soon to gauge the impact of the virus on the estimated 500,000 Philippine seafarers, who sent home $6.5 billion in 2019, a fifth of the country's remittance income, the central bank says.
Ace Rodrin Catibayan, 34, a waiter on the Costa Venezia, is awaiting the outcome of on-board tests. Although he is certain those are negative, he is worried about his income and possible stigma at home from the attention focused on cruise outbreaks.
""For sure it would take time before we can go onboard again. It would be a long wait for us to make a living,"" he said.
""I'll try to apply again or start a small business. But I really want to go back on the ship because I earn higher here.""
Jose Albar Kato, who heads the Philippines' International Maritime Association and its federation for seafarers' employers, was not surprised to see the giant huddle off Manila of cruise ships, each the length of two to three soccer fields.
Philippine staffers formed the largest contingent on most cruise ships, he said, so it made sense to park in Manila Bay.
""On average 30% to 40% of crew are Filipinos,"" Kato told Reuters. ""It's a big saving for the owner to just wait it out here.""
Buffet steward Arnold Salarda, 31, has been with the Golden Princess for six years and started his quarantine on May 3.
Though deadly outbreaks on other Princess ships have been a constant worry for his family, he hopes to be the first in line to be rehired when virus infections slow and cruises resume. 
""We were told by the company, by the time they resume operations, they will prioritise us, the old crew,"" he said.

""But we don't know when that will happen, because the number of cases is still ballooning.""

The data was published after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Sunday that manufacturing and construction workers should be encouraged to go back to their jobs, drawing concern from trade union groups.
Men in the lowest-skilled jobs suffered 21.4 COVID-related deaths per 100,000 males in the period up to April 20, more than double the average for working age males of just under 10 deaths per 100,000, the Office for National Statistics said.
The average death rate for working age women was 5.2 per 100,000.
Male security guards had a death rate of more than four times the overall average for working-age people. Male chefs, taxi drivers, chauffeurs and bus and coach drivers and also had higher death rates.
Male and female care workers and home carers - some of whom have raised concerns publicly about a lack of protective equipment - had significantly raised rates of 23.4 and 9.6 COVID-related deaths per 100,000 respectively, the data showed.
But healthcare workers, including doctors and nurses, were not found to have higher rates of COVID-related deaths than people of the same age and sex in the general population.
The ONS said its data did not prove that higher death involving COVID-19 were necessarily caused by differences in exposure to the virus through work.
It adjusted its data for age, but not for other factors such as ethnic group and place of residence.

Last week, the ONS said black people and men of Bangladeshi and Pakistani origin were nearly twice as likely to die from the COVID-19 disease than whites, even when adjusting data for deprivation.

As France battled to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, Mauny's salon, in Mayenne, about 270 km (167 miles) west of Paris, had to close under a government order that allowed only food stores, tobacconists and pharmacies to keep trading.
A scheme to gradually relax the restrictions means that starting from May 11, other business can now re-open, providing they put in place safety precautions. 
""I'm going to cut hair, I'm going to welcome people,"" he said, just after opening. ""Wow, I really want to.""
Hair salons are anticipating a rush of customers who have been waiting weeks to get a trim, or need a professional to repair the damage done by a do-it-yourself haircut performed at home.
Most stores re-opening on Monday kept to regular business hours. Not Mauny. ""I like to be first,"" he said.
His first post-lockdown customer, Caroline Corbeau, was ready for a new haircut. ""I really needed it. It was great to have this opportunity,"" she said.

The law, which authorises Orban to bypass Parliament indefinitely in measures to contain the virus and mitigate its after-effects, has provoked an international wave of criticism, including from rights groups and the EU Commission.
The Council of Europe, the EU's main human rights body, was among the first to warn Hungary about its democratic backslide and its issues over freedom of expression in a March 24 letter by Secretary General Marija Pejcinovic Buric.
""An indefinite and uncontrolled state of emergency cannot guarantee that the basic principles of democracy will be observed and that the emergency measures restricting fundamental human rights are strictly proportionate to the threat which they are supposed to counter,"" Buric wrote then.
The foreign ministers of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden wrote to Buric on May 6 that they ""share the concerns expressed in that letter. Even in an emergency situation the rule of law must prevail.""
Orban has been at odds with European Union institutions since taking power in 2010, going head to head over economic policies, alleged corruption, immigration and his ever-expanding influence over all walks of life.
The combative premier has used that pretext to paint the EU as an adversary in massive campaigns, an electoral strategy that has paid handsome dividends at the polls, helping to cement his rule, but has left him ostracised among his European peers.
The European People's Party suspended the membership of Orban's Fidesz from the mainstream conservative group over such conflicts, but the premier continues to use the issue for political gain.
Orban on March 26 told Buric that the law did not give him unlimited powers and could be withdrawn by Parliament - where his Fidesz holds a two-thirds majority - at any time. 

""If you cannot help us in the current crisis, please at the very least refrain from blocking our defence effort,"" Orban wrote to the secretary general. The vast government-controlled or loyal press repeated that phrase for weeks.

Hundreds of riot police were deployed to disperse the protesters on Sunday, with some members of the media caught up in the chaos that evoked memories of the sometimes violent unrest that rocked the global financial hub last year.
Several media outlets, citing sources, said more than 200 people were arrested. Police said they could not confirm the number. The Hospital Authority said 18 people were taken to hospital. 
Images beamed live from the working class district of Mong Kok showed riot police pushing back some reporters and firing pepper spray amid chaotic scenes. 
Footage showed protesters being subdued on the ground, scuffles and people bleeding.
Police fired pepper spray at journalists and activists, and conducted stop and search operations on members of the public and media.
The Hong Kong Journalists' Association (HKJA) said some members of the press were prevented from filming. 
""Some journalists who were sprayed by pepper spray were not allowed to receive immediate treatment, and they were requested to stop filming,"" said Chris Yeung, chairman of the HKJA. 
Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
The outbreak of coronavirus and strict rules to curb its spread had brought a relative lull in anti-government protests this year, but the recent arrest of democracy activists and renewed concern about Beijing's tightening grip on the city have revived the movement.
Police in riot gear told protesters they were staging an illegal assembly and violating anti-virus measures that bar gatherings of more than eight people.
Democratic Party lawmaker Roy Kwong was arrested for ""disorderly conduct in a public place"", police said. 
Video footage showed Kwong apparently being pushed to the ground and then surrounded by officers. He was later taken to hospital after he said he was feeling unwell. 

The financial hub is gearing up for protests over the next few months, with activists calling for two million people to gather for an annual march on July 1 that marks the anniversary of its handover from British to Chinese rule in 1997.

Businesses such as large retailers, office buildings, outdoor markets, beauty salons and gyms will reopen in individual provinces once they report no more than 7% growth in COVID-19 cases per day for seven consecutive days, according to a decree by the Central Asian nation's chief sanitary doctor.
At the same time, the government has dropped the requirements that passengers present medical certificates before flights and be seated with empty seats between them. Domestic flights resumed from May 4.
The oil-rich former Soviet republic bordering China has confirmed 5,126 COVID-19 cases with 31 deaths.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Kristen Choong had accepted her family's decades-old noodle stall in Singapore would likely fold when she retires. 
Now, battling a 90% drop in business due to the coronavirus pandemic, she is constantly having to reassure customers that the stall will survive the next few months.
""I really have (to) tell people, we're still here. If we weren't then it would be tragic...We'll do our best to keep going,"" said 45-year old Choong, who runs the Ji Ji Noodle House with her ageing mother.
Government orders last month for people to stay home to curb the disease abruptly halted a Singapore tradition of eating out at its more than 100 hawker centres - sprawling food courts serving up cheap regional cuisine.
This hawker culture - which has given rise to the world's cheapest Michelin-starred meals and been featured in movies like 'Crazy Rich Asians' - is being considered for UNESCO status. 
Ji Ji was started by Choong's grandfather from a pushcart before it moved into Hong Lim Market in the 1970s when the government first built hawker centres to clean up the island. The stall features in  Michelin  (PA:MICP)'s Singapore food guide. 
Choong said she has been given a three-month rent waiver from the government during the lockdown, and, like many others, has started food delivery to keep business going.
Even before the pandemic, Singapore's hawkers faced a problem. Many are getting older and their better-educated sons and daughters are shunning cramped, sweaty kitchens for office jobs.
Choong took over from her mother, Lai Yau Kiew, but she said ""no one wants to inherit"" such a labour intensive job that involves boiling and frying wontons, vegetables, meat and noodles from 5am to 10pm every day. 

""My heart tells me to just take it one day at a time,"" said Lai, 69, who comes by the stall every day to help her daughter.

PARIS (Reuters) - Millions of French people are set to cautiously emerge from one of Europe's strictest lockdowns on Monday, once more able to engage in everyday activities that have become unexpectedly precious, such as visiting shops and getting their hair cut.
France, whose official death toll is the world's fifth highest, had enforced an eight-week lockdown, since March 17, to slow the spread of the new coronavirus, with residents only allowed out for essential shopping, work and a bit of exercise.
Shops and hair salons can now reopen, while people can venture out without a government-mandated form, except for trips of more than 100 km (62 miles), which are only allowed for professional reasons, funerals or caring for the sick.
President Emmanuel Macron's government decided to lift the lockdown after the number of patients in intensive care - a key measure of hospitals' ability to cope with the epidemic - fell to less than half the peak of over 7,000 seen in early April.
Another encouraging indicator has been a prolonged decline in the number of daily deaths from coronavirus infections, which fell to 70 on Sunday, bringing the total to 26,380.
Ahead of Monday's end to lockdown, many people were keen to enjoy life's simple pleasures again, including getting a new hairstyle. 
""No hairdressers? I'd rather go without food,"" Danielle Gerard, a regular at a hair salon in the central Marais district in Paris told Reuters TV over the weekend.
But it's certainly not business as usual.
The government has urged caution, with some regions including the Paris area remaining ""red zones"", and subject to additional restrictions. People across the nations are also still advised to work from home if they are able to do so. [nL8N2CP8RH]
A few sporadic clusters of infections have emerged in recent days, including one in Dordogne where at least nine people were diagnosed with COVID-19 following a funeral in late April, and another one in a central France secondary school where four people were infected.
Kindergarten and primary schools are allowed to open on a voluntary basis on Monday, a day before 1.5 million out of a total 6.7 million primary school pupils will be able to return to classrooms on Tuesday. [nL5N2CG5LW]
Although France has managed to circumscribe the epidemic to a broad northeastern quarter of the country - including Paris - and its hospitals have been able to cope, the ongoing crisis will nonetheless leave long-lasting marks, as it will across the world.
The French, long accustomed to being told their high taxes paid for the best healthcare in the world, have been dismayed by the rationing of critical drugs, face masks and equipment. They have watched with envy as neighbouring Germany appears to have coped better with the coronavirus pandemic.
After initially enjoying a rebound in popularity, Macron's handling of the crisis has been criticised, with the government's flip-flopping messages on when or even whether to wear face masks - which has been an issue in other countries too - fuelling mistrust.

Macron's popularity rating fell to 34% in May, down 5 points from a month ago, according to a recent Elabe poll for Les Echos newspaper.

SALATIGA, Indonesia (Reuters) - A traditional market on the island of Java has moved outdoors and set stalls at least a metre (3.3 ft) apart as Indonesia looks to safely maintain the bazaars where most people go to get affordable food and are part of the fabric of society.
The 857 vendors at the Salatiga market in Central Java province, as well as visitors, are required to wear masks and avoid physical contact with each other to mitigate the spread of the novel coronavirus, the head of the vendor association said.
A vegetable seller said the social distancing measures made him feel safe and comfortable at work. At least eight confirmed cases of the virus have been found in the city of Salatiga, local media has reported.
Indonesia, which had over 14,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of Sunday, has been reluctant to enforce a complete nationwide lockdown. Instead, many cities have adopted ""large-scale social restrictions"" that have closed businesses and encouraged people to stay home.
Attempts to keep traditional market stalls running are happening elsewhere in the country, in one form for or another, with precautions in place.
In Depok, a city near the capital Jakarta, for example, one vegetable seller has set up his stall in a residential area to make sure residents can buy necessities without having to venture too far from home.
Customers must wear masks, sit apart while waiting for their turn to shop and wash their hands after shopping.
""This rule must be obeyed by everyone because it is a shared responsibility to prevent the spread of COVID-19,"" said local resident Sumarna, who uses only one name, after shopping at the stall.
Indonesian authorities expect cases of the new coronavirus to peak in late May and taper off in the following month, if the country is successful in avoiding a second wave of infections.

Tokyo, Osaka and 11 other prefectures are not among the regions that could see an earlier easing of restrictions.
""As for the 34 prefectures ... if we can confirm the number of new infections remains stable, lifting (of the state of emergency) will be in sight for many of those prefectures,"" Nishimura told a parliament session on Monday.
He added that the emergency could be re-implemented if there were signs of an overshoot after the lifting.

Japan last week extended the nationwide state of emergency to the end of May, saying it would reassess the situation on May 14 and possibly lift the measures earlier for some prefectures.

Gunmen seized Romano, who was working for an Italian charity called Africa Milele, in southeastern Kenya in November 2018. No group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.
She was found in Somalia, some 30 km (19 miles) outside the capital, Mogadishu, and was released thanks to efforts by the external intelligence agency, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said.
Romano, 24, touched down at Rome's Ciampino airport aboard a special flight at about 2 p.m. (1200 GMT).
Escorted by masked men from the intelligence service, she temporarily removed her protective mask to wave as she descended the steps from the jet before hugging relatives waiting for her at the airport. 
She was greeted by Di Maio and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
In her home neighbourhood in Milan, church bells saluted her arrival, with many people on their balconies, SKY TG24 showed.
Romano is expected to meet prosecutors in Rome later on Sunday. 
""I was strong and resisted,"" Romano was quoted by Italian newspapers as saying after her release.
Conte said the task force working to free Romano had been in the final stages ""for the last months"", after having proof that she was still alive. He added that details were not disclosed so as to not compromise the operation. 
""We are so glad to welcome Silvia back in such a delicate moment for the country. The state is always there, and will always be there,"" Conte said.
He thanked the intelligence services, the judiciary and the defence and foreign ministries, all involved in the release of the woman.
Later on Sunday, Turkish security sources said Romano was rescued after a joint effort by Turkey's MIT intelligence agency and Italian and Somalian government authorities.
""The MIT began work in the region on determining Silvia Romano's condition in December 2019 upon a request from Italian authorities,"" the sources said.
They added that Romano was delivered to Italian authorities in Somalia on Saturday after the joint efforts.

""I am literally bursting with joy at this moment. But it is hard even only to think, please let me breathe. I need to withstand the shock, happiness is so big that it is exploding,"" Silvia's father, Enzo, was quoted as saying by several Italian newspapers on Sunday.

678,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2020 03:51PM ET</span>",Massive bombardment hits Tripoli as water supplies threatened,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - A withering bombardment shook Tripoli on Sunday as the eastern-based forces of Khalifa Haftar fought overnight for new territory in the southern suburbs after losing ground recently around the city. 
Adding to the misery of Tripoli residents, the main water supplier to northwest Libya said armed men in the south had stormed one of its facilities, reducing supply. 
""My father said we should be ready to leave at any moment... the fighting last night was heavier than at any time before,"" said a resident of Abu Salim district, near a frontline. 
""We would leave to survive, but where can we go?... we will be on the street. It's hopeless,"" the resident added by phone. 
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has been trying to capture Tripoli for 13 months, but Turkish military aid this year for the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) has helped it regain some ground. 
The LNA, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, last week announced a new air campaign, but most bombardment since then has been through artillery. 
Last month the pro-GNA forces recaptured a string of towns in the northwest from the LNA, re-establishing their control between Tripoli and the Tunisian border. 
They have also made two attempts to seize the LNA's strategic al-Watiya airbase, but have been repelled, and have moved towards the LNA's main northwestern stronghold of Tarhouna. 
An LNA military source said late on Saturday that the fighting was the fiercest so far. Eastern forces briefly took some ground in Abu Salim. 
Tripoli residents described the bombardment as the worst so far after weeks of fighting as the GNA attempts to end Haftar's campaign to seize the capital and push his forces out of artillery range. 
Mitiga, the only functioning airport in the Libyan capital, was targeted by rockets for a second day after shelling on Saturday destroyed fuel tanks and sprayed shrapnel across a passenger jet being readied for take off. 
The U.N. Libya mission condemned what it called ""indiscriminate attacks"", which it said were mostly attributable to pro-LNA forces. It said last month that the LNA was responsible for four fifths of civilian deaths in the first quarter of 2020. 
Turkey said on Sunday it would regard Haftar's forces as ""legitimate targets"" if attacks on its interests continued.
Water pressure in Tripoli was already starting to decline on Sunday afternoon after the Great Man-Made River Project, the main water utility, said one of its power stations in the south had been stormed by armed men. 
Ahmed al-Deeb, head of its western region committee, said the men had switched off the electricity because of a shortage of cooking gas and a lack of cash in local banks, and that tribal elders were negotiating with them to restore power. 

The state-run National Oil Corporation said last week it was carrying out work to supply cooking gas from the country's main Sharara oil field.

Turkey backs Libya's internationally-recognised Government of National Accord (GNA). It has signed a military cooperation deal with the GNA, which has been trying to fend off an offensive by Haftar's forces.
Ankara views Haftar's forces, which are backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, as ""putschists"". 
""If our missions and our interests in Libya are targeted, we will deem Haftar's forces legitimate targets,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement in which it also slammed the United Nations for not taking action over Haftar's attacks.
""It is unacceptable for the United Nations to remain silent against this carnage any longer,"" it said. ""Countries providing military, financial and political aid to Haftar are responsible for the suffering that the people of Libya are enduring and the chaos and instability the country is being dragged into.""
It also said attacks on Tripoli's Mitiga airport early on Saturday, part of an intensified barrage of artillery fire on the capital, were war crimes.
On Thursday, Turkey and Italy said the area around their embassies in Tripoli had been shelled.
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) has been fighting for more than a year to capture Tripoli from the GNA with frequent shelling of the capital. The United Nations said four fifths of the 130 civilian casualties recorded in the Libyan conflict in the first quarter of 2020 were caused by LNA ground fighting.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the LNA was in a ""period of regression"" after NATO member Turkey threw its support behind the GNA.
""Even the efforts of countries that provide him (Haftar) with unlimited financial support and weapons will not be able to save him,"" Erdogan said.
Pro-GNA forces have retaken some territory from the LNA around Tripoli during an escalation of fighting in recent weeks with the help of Turkish-supplied drones.
The LNA says Turkey has established a military drone base at Mitiga, but the GNA denies this.

War-ravaged Yemen is divided between the internationally recognised government temporarily based in the south and the Houthi movement that ousted it from power in the capital, Sanaa, in the north in late 2014.
The Saudi-backed government has so far reported 34 cases of the novel coronavirus with seven deaths in the territory it controls, while the Houthis, who control most large urban centres, have recorded just two cases with one death.
The WHO directive issued late on Saturday notified staff in Sanaa, in the Red Sea (NYSE:SE) port of Hodeidah, in the northern province of Saada and the central province of Ibb that ""all movements, meetings or any other activity"" for all staff in those areas were paused until further notice.
The WHO did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Three sources told Reuters that the WHO had taken the measure to press the Houthi authorities to report results of tests for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by coronavirus.
The Saudi-backed government has accused Houthi authorities of covering up an outbreak in Sanaa, a charge the group denies.
The WHO has said it fears COVID-19 could rip through Yemen as the population has some of the lowest levels of immunity to disease compared with other countries. Minimal testing capacity has added to concerns. 
The five-year war between a Saudi-led coalition and the Iran-aligned Houthi movement has shattered Yemen's health system and left its population weakened by widespread hunger and disease.
Around 80% of the population, or 24 million people, rely on humanitarian aid and 10 million are at risk of starvation.

This raises the possibility that the official death toll from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, seriously understates the spread of the virus in the Russian capital.
Many countries are looking at ""all-cause mortality"" statistics as a guide to understanding the full impact of the virus, as some deaths caused by COVID-19 may go unrecorded, while the death toll from other illnesses may also rise during a time when healthcare systems are under strain. 
The data published on Sunday shows Moscow recorded 11,846 deaths in total in April, the first month when the city recorded a large number of deaths caused by COVID-19. That is 18% more deaths than recorded in April 2019.
The new data was first reported by The Moscow Times on Sunday.
The number of deaths compares with just 658 fatalities registered in April as having been caused by COVID-19.
The figure is also up 20% compared with an average of the same month during the previous 10 years, according to the open data published by the Moscow government, which is based on the number of death certificates issued each month.
Other countries are also paying increased attention to the number of ""excess deaths"" as a guide to measuring the full impact of the pandemic, since many deaths from coronavirus are never identified as such due to insufficient testing.
A report published by Italy's statistics bureau on Monday showed nationwide deaths were up 39% since the first official COVID-19 death occurred, compared with an average of the same period during the previous five years. 
Just over half of these ""excess deaths"" were registered as caused by COVID-19. The remaining 46% were most likely to be deaths caused by the virus among patients who were not tested for it, or else deaths that could be attributed to the strain on the health system, the bureau said.
As of Sunday, Russia had registered a total of 1,915 deaths from the new coronavirus.
Cases of infection rose by 11,012 in the last 24 hours, bringing the nationwide tally to 209,688. Russian coronavirus cases overtook French and German infections this week to become the fifth highest in the world.

Russia recorded its first death from the novel coronavirus on March 26.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - On Friday, musician Rodrigo Cunha and his piano zipped down an elevated highway in a gritty section of downtown Sao Paulo, playing tunes written by Brazil's most famous composers, from Tom Jobim to Vinicius de Moraes.
Dressed in a dark blue suit, wearing a plastic face shield and riding atop a modified flatbed truck, Cunha is a conspicuous presence on the Minhocao, a highway weaving through graffiti-covered buildings that has become a symbol the city's urban grit. 
But with South America's largest metropolis under quarantine, the surreal has become increasingly normal in recent weeks. This is one of the few ways, Cunha says, he can serenade the region's mothers, many of whom are forced to pass this Mother's Day without their children or grandchildren.
""I'm really moved to be able to share my art so that people feel alright,"" said Cunha, a musician at the city's Baccarelli Elizete Costa Orchestra, who is volunteering his time. ""And I feel good being able to collaborate and be part of this story that we're living through.""
Cunha is part of a crew of dozens of Paulistanos, as the city's residents are known, who have volunteered their time and, in some cases, resources to pay homage to the city's mothers.
While the coronavirus crisis is growing in Brazil, leading to a palpable sense of frustration and fear, the crisis has also been an opportunity for Brazil's famously convivial to show their solidarity in unexpected ways.
The truck upon which Cunha rides was provided by a local Mercedes-Benz dealer for free. His suit was provided by a city tailor.
Olga Amato, the owner of a large events business in Sao Paulo and the organizer of the initiative, said she was inspired by a similar homage to medical professionals in the Italian town of Varallo, in which musicians played the famed Brazilian tango ""Odeon,"" by Ernesto Nazareth. Amato said she managed to gather all the volunteers she needed for the project within a 24-hour time frame.
""I think that if this virus came to teach us something, it was to teach us that we need to lessen our differences,"" she said, after a tune from the piano that left hundreds of Paulistanos glued to their windows.
""That empathy and solidarity will stay with us forever.""

LAUSANNE/ZURICH (Reuters) - Getting children back into classrooms may seem like a reassuring step toward normalcy after weeks of coronavirus lockdown but for some parents in Switzerland like Audrey Razama, it's a source of anxiety. 
Swiss schools start reopening on Monday and Razama's 5-year-old daughter is due to join classmates. Razama, from the western town of Vevey, is instead opting for home schooling, worried that her daughter could bring home the virus and infect her younger sister, who has a heart murmur.
Last month, parents in Denmark experienced similar angst: schools re-opened to many empty desks. France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United States are also planning education reboots.
Switzerland, which has recorded more than 30,000 cases of the coronavirus, with 1,500 deaths, is loosening its lockdown as the outbreak eases, like other countries in Europe. Swiss health officials say young children rarely experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and seldom infect others.
But Razama's fears highlight parents' concerns as governments inch toward normalcy: What is really the best way to protect their children?
""Precaution needs to take priority amid all this uncertainty,"" Razama, 32, told Reuters.
While it is not known how many parents share her worries, an online petition to officials in Bern including Swiss Health Minister Alain Berset and Swiss President Simonetta Sommaruga to halt school openings has some 21,200 signatures so far. 
The government cites scientific papers supporting its view that youngsters are unlikely to pass coronavirus infections between one another or bring them home from school. 
Daniel Koch, Switzerland's coronavirus czar, has given grandparents the green light to hug children up to 10 years old, sparking controversy. 
""Most children with the disease got it through infected parents,"" Koch said last month. ""There is no danger from children, not even for high-risk patients or grandparents.""
Didier Pittet, an expert on reducing infection at the Geneva University Hospital, also believes the timing is right. 
""Children are carriers of the virus, sometimes even in a big quantity, but there is very little, even no evidence, that shows that they are really efficient transmitters,"" Pittet told Reuters. ""The epidemic curve has really decreased. We can't stay in confinement for eternity."" 
Still, this is fertile territory for doubt. 
Even studies cited by the health ministry -- and a review released by Switzerland's own national COVID-19 task force -- acknowledge children's role in transmission remains ""highly uncertain"".
Marco Ajelli, a mathematical epidemiologist from Italy's Bruno Kessler Foundation, said children's ability to infect others merits more scrutiny, calling it ""one of the biggest unknowns of COVID-19 epidemiology"".
Adding to worries about risks, three children in New York have died from a rare, mysterious inflammatory syndrome while also testing positive for the virus.
SPLIT CLASSES
Even as Swiss classes re-start, they will hardly be normal. 
Awarding of grades has been scrapped. Many schools are splitting classes in half, with attendance trimmed to just two days a week per group, to accommodate that change. 
There will be ubiquitous hand-sanitizing stations.
Desks are being moved further apart, with markings being taped to floors, to help children observe new space limits. And older children from their 10th year, as well as university students, must wait until at least June 8 for classes to begin. 
It is not clear yet how many parents will be like Razama and keep their children at home. 
The central government in Bern delegates education largely to the 26 cantons, which have crafted their own approaches to re-opening guided by principles set out by the federal health ministry. 
Zurich, like many cantons, decided that children not under quarantine have virtually no reason to skip classes, while teachers in risk groups can be excused. 
Still, administrators around the country have also told parents whose children may have a risky health condition that individualized solutions may be possible, in consultation with doctors.
""We only have fewer than 10 families who said they will not send their children back to school,"" said Veronique Restrepo, a primary school director in Geneva. 
""But we will see on Monday, because maybe some were not comfortable to say this to us and will not send their children.""
'TRYING TO REASSURE' PARENTS
Some parents said they still feel cornered. 
""Our children are being sent out like scouts to see what happens to them,"" said Laeticia Dupraz, 27, with a 6-year-old daughter in school and a 4-year-old son at home.
Switzerland requires school attendance for 11 years, and under normal circumstances parents face fines up to 5,000 Swiss francs ($5,150) for keeping their children away.
Most officials, however, favour a softer approach amidst this crisis. 
""It is not our role to threaten parents,"" said Julien Schekter, of Vaud canton's learning office. ""We are trying to reassure them.""

""Aggressive behavior by the two sides resulted in minor injuries to troops. The two sides disengaged after dialogue and interaction at the local level,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The Indian daily Hindustan Times, citing a military source, said four Indian soldiers and seven Chinese troops were injured when some of the soldiers exchanged blows during the confrontation, which it said took place on Saturday and involved some 150 soldiers.
The Defence Ministry said the incident took place in the Nakula area but did not give details of how it started, or what caused the injuries. 
China's Ministry of Defense could be immediately reached for comment on Sunday.
India and China have often accused each other of intrusions into each other's territories, but clashes are rare. 
There is still deep mistrust between the two countries over their festering border dispute, which triggered a brief war in 1962.
Hundreds of troops from both sides were deployed in 2017 on the Doklam plateau, near the borders of India, Bhutan, and China after India objected to Chinese construction of a road in the Himalayan area, in the most serious standoff in years.

688,By Reuters,"<span>May 10, 2020 04:56AM ET</span>",Iran says United States yet to respond about prisoner swap,"By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Washington has yet to respond to Iran about a prisoner swap, Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei was quoted as saying by the government's website on Sunday, reiterating that Tehran was ready for a full prisoner exchange with the United States without preconditions. 
If a swap goes ahead, it would be one of very few instances of cooperation in an otherwise deeply frayed U.S.-Iran relationship, which has grown more hostile since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.
""We have stated our readiness to discuss the release of all prisoners without preconditions ... but Americans have not responded yet. It seems to us that Americans are more prepared than before to end this situation,"" Rabiei said, according to the government's website Dolat.ir.
Both countries have called for the release of prisoners because of the new coronavirus outbreak. Iran is the worst hit country in the Middle East, while the United States has reported the highest number of deaths worldwide from the virus.
Three Iranian officials told Reuters last week that a prisoner swap between the two countries was in the works. Michael White, a U.S. navy veteran who has been detained in Iran since 2018, is a likely candidate to be swapped. He was released from prison in mid-March on medical furlough but remains in Iran.
""Washington is aware of our readiness and we think there is no need for a third country to mediate between Tehran and Washington for the prisoner exchange,"" Rabiei said. 
""However, if the American side agrees, the interest section of Iran in Washington will inform the U.S. of our views on the details, including how and when the exchange will take place.""
Tehran and Washington cut diplomatic relations shortly after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution after hardline Iranians seized the U.S. embassy and took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Switzerland looks after U.S. interests with Tehran.
""We are worried about the safety and health of jailed Iranians in America ... We hold America responsible for their safety amid the coronavirus outbreak,"" Rabiei was quoted as saying.
It is not clear exactly how many Americans Iran may hold, but they include father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi. Several dozen Iranians are being held in U.S. prisons, many of them for breaking sanctions.
Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said in December that Tehran was ready for a full prisoner exchange with the United States, tweeting: “The ball is in the U.S.' court”. 
In mid-March U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urged Tehran to free American prisoners as a humanitarian gesture because of the coronavirus. 
Last December, Iran freed U.S. citizen Xiyue Wang, who had been held for three years on spying charges, and the United States released Iranian Massoud Soleimani, who faced charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
The United States is set to deport Iranian professor Sirous Asgari, who was acquitted of stealing trade secrets, once he receives medical clearance to leave, U.S. and Iranian officials said on Tuesday.
Relations have grown more hostile again since 2018 when Trump exited Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers and re-imposed sanctions on Tehran that has crippled its economy. Iran has responded by gradually scaling back its commitments under the agreement.

Animosity reached historic heights in early January when top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. Iran retaliated on Jan. 9 by firing missiles at bases in Iraq where U.S. troops were stationed.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Ahmad al-Mostafa can't afford milk for his baby daughter. A Syrian refugee, he has barely been able to feed his family since Lebanon sank into economic crisis last year. But now, a coronavirus lockdown has made things even worse. 
""Nobody will hire us anymore,"" said the 28-year-old, who lost his restaurant job a few months ago. He racked up hundreds of dollars in debt at the local minimarket getting food before the owner said he could borrow no more.
""We're afraid of tomorrow,"" he said. ""We don't know what will happen to us.""
His plight echoes that facing many of the 5.6 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey, who had scraped by on meagre daily wages but now find even that is denied them as the coronavirus pandemic forces their host countries into shutdown. 
Many Lebanese have themselves been hit by a financial crisis that has evaporated jobs and sent prices soaring, and have become less tolerant of the Syrians who have boosted the population by around 1.5 million to some 6 million. 
'THEY DON'T HIRE SYRIANS'
""Every time I go looking for work, they tell me they don't hire Syrians,"" said Mostafa, who fled into north Lebanon in 2014. ""I'm sitting indoors - and everything is expensive."" 
He can no longer afford diapers, which have doubled in price, and he relies on a charitable neighbour who gets milk for his one-year-old daughter. 
More refugees say they are worried about starving than about the virus, said Mireille Girard, representative of the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR in Lebanon.
In a survey last month, UNHCR found 70% were going hungry, while many could not buy soap. Since Syria's war erupted nine years ago, many have languished in crowded camps where aid workers fear any COVID-19 outbreak would be rapid and lethal.
'NOT A SINGLE PENNY'
In Jordan, the Zaatari camp, home to 80,000 Syrian refugees, has been closed off by the authorities during a two-month lockdown, meaning those who used to go out to work on farms every day can no longer do so.
Jordan hosts some 900,000 refugees in all, most of whom live outside the camps.
Abdullah Aba Zaid, who used to get work picking tomatoes, has had no income for two months. 
""For the last 10 days, I haven't had a single penny in the house even to pay for bread. I am borrowing from here and there,"" he said. ""Everyone is waiting for God's mercy ... hoping things will improve.""
But even as businesses return to work after the government eased curbs this week, job losses are on the rise, making more Syrians dependent on already strained aid efforts.
UNHCR is getting more calls for help from refugee families who had been largely self-reliant, said Dominik Bartsch, its Jordan representative. 
Some Syrians said their accumulating debts had forced them to sell U.N. food coupons to pay for rent and basic goods.
'EVERYONE IS HUNGRY' 
Since Turkey's economy tipped into a brief recession two years ago, the public mood towards Syrians has soured, with some saying they have driven down wages and taken jobs from locals. 
Many of the three and a half million Syrian refugees work as day labourers in construction and manufacturing, especially textile factories - sectors that have been hard hit by the pandemic curbs. 
Unlike millions of Turkish workers who lost their wages, Syrians do not benefit from government aid packages but can apply for food aid from local municipalities. Still, many have no basic protection against the virus.
One in five does not have access to clean water, said Omar Kadkoy of the Economic Policy Research Foundation of Turkey (TEPAV). ""This brings the issue to an alarming level and the government should be acting to contain (it).""
In a camp in Lebanon's Bekaa valley, which authorities have sealed off during the lockdown, Younes Hamdou cannot find bread. Clean water is also scarce, illness rife and social distancing nearly impossible.

""We are prisoners ... We have no immunity because of the lack of food,"" he said. ""Lebanese people have gone hungry, Syrians have gone hungry. Everyone is hungry.""

In a statement, the Defense Ministry said the boats were equipped with machine guns and ammunition, but had no crew, adding they were discovered as part of a nationwide operation to guarantee Venezuela's ""freedom and sovereignty.""
According to a preliminary investigation the boats were dragged away by strong river currents, Colombia's Navy said in a statement.
Colombia's Navy said it is talking with its counterparts in Venezuela to recover the boats.
In televised comments Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said the military would return the boats if the Colombian government made an official request for them.
Venezuela will make an official complaint to the United Nations accusing Colombia and the United States of violating international law for the failed invasion attempt, Maduro added.
On Wednesday, Venezuelan state television broadcast an interrogation video of a former U.S. soldier, in which he said a Florida security firm had hired him to train dissident Venezuelan troops in Colombia for an operation to seize control of Caracas' airport and capture Maduro.
Authorities said they arrested the man, Luke Denman, along with a second U.S. citizen and 11 others, as they attempted to enter Venezuela by boat on Monday from Colombia. The government said a separate raid attempt the day before left eight people dead.

Maduro on Wednesday accused Colombian President Ivan Duque of enabling the operation, which Duque denied.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Every year for the past 20, Rosa Maria Fuenzalida has visited her mother's grave on Mother's Day without fail in the central Chilean city of Curico. 
She is one of millions of people in Latin America, where family is its own religion, who flock to take floral offerings to the cemeteries where their mothers and grandmothers are buried to show they are not forgotten. 
This year though, with Chileans self-isolating as the new coronavirus spreads around the country, Rosa Maria relied on a stranger to take flowers to her mother's grave. 
Burial places throughout Chile announced to widespread dismay that they would not open on Mother's Day. But Curico's general cemetery, which ordinarily would have 15,000 visitors on Mother's Day, offered a compromise. 
For three days in the run-up to Sunday, it invited visitors to bring their flowers to the front gate on different days, according to the letters of their surnames, for the bouquets to be delivered for them to their loved ones' final resting place.
Those leaving bouquets said they received a Whatsapp message shortly afterward with a photograph of the flowers in place, with a note assuring them they had fresh water. 
Roberto Garcia, the cemetery's director, said more than 1,000 people had brought flowers by Friday afternoon. 
""Today in Chile the truth is that it has been hard; we have people who have died, in Curico we have more than 45 cases of coronavirus,"" he said. 
""This acts as a ray of light. We are doing this with care and love for each of these families and especially the children who have lost their mothers.""
Rosa Maria, an only child who was 21 when her mother died, said she had been struck by the local authorities' recognising the practice as ""essential"" amid social distancing rules across Chile. 
""Despite the time that has passed, I still have a relationship with my mum and to be able to go to the cemetery regularly to see her is important to me,"" she said. 
""Everything is strange at the moment, but to have someone else take care of something so personal was really strange, but also really lovely."" 
In the capital, Santiago, where the largest cemeteries ordinarily attract tens of thousands of visitors with associated road closures and chaotic scenes, the national federation of cemetery workers this week urged people to stay away. 
Luis Yevenes, its president, told a local radio station: ""It's for everyone's safety. We need to stop this virus. It is sad to see the funeral corteges coming in without people, just the coffin, because the relatives cannot go amid the quarantine. We want to avoid more people going through that pain.""
Around the region, where many nations are only just nearing the peak of infections from the deadly virus, Mother's Day will be a muted affair on Sunday. 
In Mexico, where it is considered among the most important days of the year, officials have increased promotion of social distancing, closing the capital’s main flower market and cemeteries where people gather, and have even suggested moving the holiday to July.
“Don’t expose her, take care of her and don’t go to visit,” Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum tweeted with a hashtag linking to a popular movement for the day to be moved to July 10. 
In Colombia, officials in Medellin and Cali, the country's second- and third-largest cities, banned liquor sales over the Mother's Day weekend as a preventive measure, since the holiday has historically been marked by increased levels of violence and fights. They offered virtual concerts instead. 

Medellin is also under a curfew for the Mothers Day weekend.

The children are expected to arrive in Portugal within the next few weeks, Santos was cited by local news agency Lusa as saying during an online conference to celebrate Europe Day. The member of the European Parliament did not specify a date.
At least 5,200 unaccompanied minors live in Greece, many of them under harsh conditions in camps on islands in the Aegean.
Human Rights Watch said the Greek authorities had not done enough to address the ""overcrowding and lack of health care, access to adequate water, sanitation, and hygiene products"" in the camps to limit the spread of coronavirus. 
Portugal, which has reported 27,406 cases of the virus, with 1,126 deaths, said it was willing to take in some children as part of a voluntary European scheme to relocate around 1,600. Other countries, including Germany, Ireland, France and Luxembourg, are also involved in the initiative. 
The first relocations took place last month when 12 minors were transferred to Luxembourg, since when Germany has received around 50 children.
Santos, who said Portugal was the first country to offer assistance to Greece, was critical of the European response to the issue, saying the relocation scheme ""had failed"" since its introduction.
""These children live under bad conditions,"" she said. ""They live in refugee camps with the triple, quadruple and in many cases up to five times the population they are able to accommodate."" 
Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing conflicts and poverty in countries such as Syria have used Greece as a springboard to gain entry to other European countries.
In February, tens of thousands of migrants tried to enter Greece after Turkey said it would no longer prevent them from doing so. 

Turkey now hosts about 3.4 million refugees and migrants, while Greece has about 120,000 who are waiting for asylum applications to be processed.

MILAN (Reuters) - Silvia Romano, an Italian aid worker who was kidnapped in Kenya 18 months ago, has been freed and is expected back in Italy on Sunday, the Italian government announced on Saturday.
""Silvia Romano has been freed. I thank the men and women of the external intelligence service. Silvia, we await for you in Italy!,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte wrote on his Twitter account. 
Speaking to state broadcaster RAI, Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said Romano was found in Somalia and was released thanks to the external intelligence agency.
""She is now at the Italian embassy in Mogadishu (the Somali capital) and she will arrive in Rome tomorrow on a special flight,"" Di Maio said. 
Asked about the release, Di Maio said he could not reveal any details. Italian daily Corriere della Sera reported on its website that Italy paid a ransom to free the woman.
Kenyan government officials were not immediately available to comment on Romano's release.
Gunmen seized Romano, who was working for an Italian charity called Africa Milele, in northern Kenya in November 2018. 
No group claimed responsibility for the kidnapping, which brought fears of an upsurge in attacks by militant Islamists. 
Police and residents said at the time that the gunmen seized the young woman from a guesthouse in Chakama, a small town south of the border with Somalia and near the coast.

The Somali militant group al Shabaab has periodically staged attacks in Kenya, including an attack on a university in April 2015 in which 148 people were killed.

(Reuters) - Little Richard, the self-proclaimed ""architect of rock 'n' roll"" who built his ground-breaking sound with a boiling blend of boogie-woogie, rhythm and blues and gospel, died on Saturday at the age of 87.
Richard, a Grammy Award winner and inductee to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame whose electrifying 1950s hits such as ""Tutti Frutti"" and ""Long Tall Sally"" and flamboyant stage presence influenced legions of performers, succumbed to cancer. 
""Little Richard died in Tullahoma, Tennessee of bone cancer. He was loved by his family and adored by millions,"" his family said in a statement through their lawyer, Bill Sobel.
Richard's bass guitarist, Charles Glenn, told celebrity website TMZ the musician had been sick for two months and that he died surrounded by his brother, sister and son.
At his peak in the late 1950s and early '60s, Richard shouted, moaned, screamed and trilled hits like ""Good Golly, Miss Molly"" and ""Lucille,"" all the while pounding the piano like a mad man and punctuating lyrics with an occasional shrill ""whoooo!""
Time magazine said he played ""songs that sounded like nonsense ... but whose beat seemed to hint of unearthly pleasures centered somewhere between the gut and the gutter.""
The music drew in both young black and white fans at a time when parts of the United States still were strictly segregated. Many white artists, such as Pat Boone, had their own hit versions of Richard's songs, albeit considerably toned down and ""safer"" for the pop audience.
""I've always thought that rock 'n' roll brought the races together,"" Richard once told an interviewer. ""Although I was black, the fans didn't care. I used to feel good about that.""
Mick Jagger, Paul McCartney, James Brown, Otis Redding, David Bowie and Rod Stewart all cited Little Richard as an influence. Jimi Hendrix, who played in Richard's band in the mid-1960s, said he wanted to use his guitar the way Richard used his voice.
FASHION STATEMENT
""I am the innovator,"" Richard would tell interviewers and audiences. ""I am the originator. I am the emancipator. I am the architect of rock 'n' roll!""
Little Richard's sonic extravagance was matched by his campy flamboyance. He wore brightly colored suits, a pencil-thin mustache, a carefully curled 6-inch pompadour, mascara, pancake makeup and lipstick.
""Elvis may have been the king of rock 'n 'roll but I am the queen,"" he proclaimed.
He was born Dec. 5, 1932 as Richard Penniman to a poor family of 12 children in Macon, Georgia. Religion was a guiding force in his family, which attended Pentecostal, Baptist and African Methodist Episcopal churches. His faith was so deeply ingrained that at times it would overwhelm his rock career.
His first performances were as a child in his church choir and his earliest inspirations were gospel singers, including Sister Rosetta Tharpe, who let a young Richard open her show when she stopped in Macon. A singer named Esquerita also influenced Richard's fashion and manic musical style.
He first went on the road in the late 1940s, performing in medicine shows and drag shows and with bands.
Richard first recorded in the early 1950s and became a dominating force on the music charts starting in 1956 with hits such as ""Tutti Frutti,"" ""Rip It Up,"" ""Slippin' and Slidin', and ""Good Golly Miss Molly."" All were infused with the frantic rhythm of a runaway train.
""Shining like a quasar, the most intensely radiant object in the cosmos, he seems to tap a mystical source of mental power that is only accessible to great preachers and shamans,"" McCartney wrote in the preface to the 1994 biography ""The Life and Times of Little Richard.""
But Richard's career took a turn in 1957 when he decided to abandon rock in the middle of a two-week tour of Australia.
Richard told a biographer that he saw a fireball shoot across the sky during an outdoor performance in Sydney and took it as a sign from God to change his life. He said he later determined the fireball was the launch of Russia's Sputnik satellite.
A few months later, however, Richard was a student at a Bible college in Alabama. For a while he played only gospel music but slipped back into rock 'n' roll, sharing a bill with the young Beatles in Hamburg, Germany, in 1962.
It was a pattern that persisted for years as Little Richard moved between rock 'n' roll, alcohol, cocaine and heroin abuse and Christianity and gospel music. He would go on to become an ordained Seventh Day Adventist minister and eventually worked gospel and rock both into his shows, along with a little preaching.
""I talk about my life as a homosexual and a drug addict because I think it is right to tell people what God has done for me,"" he wrote in his autobiography, ""The Life and Times of Little Richard.""
Richard was among the first inductees into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1986 but missed the ceremony because he was recovering from an auto accident. Rolling Stone magazine ranked him No. 8 on its list of 100 greatest entertainers of all time and he received a lifetime achievement Grammy in 1993.
""Little Richard bent gender, upset segregationist fault lines and founded a tradition of rock dadaists devoted to the art of self-creation,"" a Rolling Stone critic said. ""He went with the inspiration of the moment, be it divine or hormonal, and caromed like a shiny, cracked pinball between God, sex and rock 'n' roll.""
As a minister, Richard officiated at weddings for Bruce Springsteen, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, Cyndi Lauper and other celebrities.
Richard suffered a heart attack in 2013 and hip problems required him to use a wheelchair at times.
In a post on Instagram on Saturday, Richard's longtime guitarist Kelvin Holly said, ""Rest in peace, Richard. This one really stings.""

""My thoughts and prayers go out to all my bandmates and fans all over the world. Richard truly was the king!""

At least 18 people have died in three riots in separate parts of the country in recent weeks, including a disturbance at Freetown's central prison on April 29 which started after an inmate tested positive for the virus.
In a televised address, Bio claimed members of the All People's Congress (APC) party were behind the violence. 
""These attacks are therefore premeditated, orchestrated, and executed with a clear objective – to make the state ungovernable,"" he said in the unscheduled broadcast on Friday.
The APC has denied the accusations. ""It is shocking, the claims the president is making,"" party spokesman Sidi Yayah Tunis said.
Last week, the United Nations called on the authorities and all political parties to work together to avoid distracting from the fight against the virus, which has so far infected 291 people and killed 17.
Since then, two prominent opposition members have been detained without charge. Amnesty International and local rights groups have called for their immediate release.
Without referring to specific incidents, Bio said any recent arrests were not politically motivated, but linked to investigations into the violence. The authorities will take further steps to protect security and rule of law, he said, without giving further details.
As part of the country's response to the health crisis, courts have been closed and those considered to be serious offenders can be held without bail, the chief justice ruled last month.

The APC and Bio's Sierra Leone People’s Party are long-time foes. After beating an APC candidate to the presidency in 2018, Bio launched a crackdown on alleged graft that has resulted in several former APC ministers being imprisoned.

KIEV (Reuters) - Mykhailo Pinchuk takes a short walk around his empty zoo, greeting some animals with a stroke and a morsel of food.
No visitors have been allowed since March, when the Ukrainian authorities imposed a national lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Pinchuk says the animals, born in captivity and used to the constant presence of people, are lonely. Some orang-utans even cry in their enclosures, he told Reuters.     
    ""Even hoofed animals ... rush to me when I am walking past their enclosures. They stretch their necks through the holes in the fence to see who is coming, and to ask you to come closer and give them some food,"" he said.
    ""They don't understand what is going on, as the situation has changed. They were fine with the previous situation, they enjoyed people's company."" 
    The zoo in the village of Demydiv, some 40 km (25 miles) from Kiev, has almost run out of money and can barely cover the utility bills needed to maintain the proper conditions for its animals, he said.  
    Zookeepers have had to adjust the animals' diet. Dozens of big cats are being fed with chicken, rather than more expensive pork or beef, and apples have replaced mangoes and pineapples for the monkeys. 
Pinchuk urged people to donate to support the zoo, which is home to 400 animals including a seal, a hippopotamus and giraffes. Out of 70 staff members, the zoo has kept only 20, on a minimum salary.    
""People do not necessarily understand what it means to maintain the zoo. Sometimes people think it is just like keeping cats and dogs, with the only difference being that there are many animals in the zoo, otherwise it is all the same,"" he said.
""But it is not like this. There are animals who eat more than 100 kilos of food daily. We spend 500,000 hryvnia ($18,650) just on food per month.""

GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 1,000 people queued up on Saturday to get free food parcels in Geneva, underscoring the impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the working poor and undocumented immigrants even in wealthy Switzerland.
The line of people stretched for more than 1 km (half a mile) outside an ice rink where volunteers were handing out around 1,500 parcels to people who started queuing as early as 5 a.m.
""At the end of the month, my pockets are empty. We have to pay the bills, the insurance, everything,"" said Ingrid Berala, a Geneva resident from Nicaragua who works part-time. ""This is great, because there is food for a week, a week of relief...I don't know for next week.""
In a nation of nearly 8.6 million, 660,000 people in Switzerland were poor in 2018, charity Caritas says, particularly single parents and those with a low level of education unable to find work after losing a job.
More than 1.1 million people were at risk of poverty, which means they have less than 60% of the median income, which was 6,538 Swiss francs ($6,736) for a full-time job in 2018. 
Swiss bank UBS has calculated https://www.ubs.com/microsites/prices-earnings/en/explore/?category=Prices&indicator=General_Price%20Level_excl.%20rent%20(New%20York%20%3D%20100)&split=false that Geneva is the second-most expensive global city for a family of three to live in, behind only Zurich. While average incomes are also high, that helps little for people struggling to make ends meet.
""I think a lot people are aware of this, but it is different to see this with your own eyes,"" said Silvana Matromatteo, head of the aid group Geneva Solidarity Caravan.
""We had people in tears who said 'It is not possible that it is happening in my country'. But it is here and maybe the COVID-19 brought everything out and this is good, because we will be able to take measures to support all these workers, because they are workers above all.""
Patrick Wieland, chief of mission for the Doctors Without Borders group, said a survey last week showed just over half the food recipients interviewed were undocumented, while others had attained legal status, were Swiss or were seeking asylum.
Just over 3% had been tested positive for COVID-19, three times the overall rate in Geneva, which he attributed to poor and overcrowded housing.
""In Geneva, one of the richest cities in the world, there have always been people living precariously, especially all the people who work as housekeepers, in agriculture, on construction sites or in hotels, and they found themselves overnight without a job because of COVID-19,"" he said.
One illegal immigrant who called himself Fernando said he lost his restaurant job during the crisis and had no pay.

""I'm very grateful to receive this help and if the situation changes for me, I am committing to do the same thing that they are doing for me,"" he said. ($1 = 0.9706 Swiss francs)

AHMEDABAD (Reuters) - Hundreds of migrant workers in India's western state of Gujarat have clashed for a second day with authorities, hurling stones at police trying to enforce a lockdown to stem the spread of coronavirus.
Protesters took to the streets in the city of Surat on Saturday, a day after residents in Ahmedabad clashed with paramilitary forces.
More than 500 workers employed in industries in the Hazira belt, on the outskirts of Surat, gathered to demand that the authorities make arrangements for them to return to their home states.
The protesters, most of them migrant workers from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, told police they are struggling to survive without work and money.
""We told them that a large number of workers have [already] been sent to their home states by the government, and similar arrangements would be made for them too,"" Inspector H.R. Brahmbhatt, based at Ichhapore police station, told Reuters.
""We asked them to have some patience and to return to their homes because of the lockdown, but they refused, and started throwing stones at us.""
Police used teargas to disperse the crowd, Brahmbhatt said.
D.N. Patel, joint commissioner of police for Surat, said around 50 workers were arrested and have been charged with unlawful assembly and rioting.
""We are in the process of identifying more people who were involved in the violence,"" he said.
The violence comes as the number of reported coronavirus cases in India climbed to 59,662, with 1,981 deaths. 
Gujarat has seen several incidents of violent protests by residents and migrant workers since the nationwide lockdown began on March 25. It has been extended twice and will now run until May 17, the government said last week. 
Surat, which is home to nearly a million migrant workers, is a hub for the textile and diamond industry. 
Earlier in the week, 1,000 migrant workers took part in a protest in the village of Vareli, on the outskirts on Surat. 
Patel said a large number of police reinforcements have been sent to the area and the situation was under control.

In a closed-door trial, Zhang Zhiru and Wu Guijun were sentenced to three years imprisonment, suspended for four years, while Jian Hui, Song Jiahui and He Yuancheng were sentenced to 18 months, suspended for two years, according to the China Labour Bulletin.
While the five were released on April 24, they had to undergo a 14-day quarantine period before finally returning home on Thursday, it said. 
Their families and friends only learned of their release and sentencing once they arrived home, two people close to Zhang and Wu told Reuters. 
The five were originally arrested in January last year and charged with ""gathering a crowd to disturb public order,"" according to the China Labour Bulletin.
All five had been important advocates for factory workers' rights during the 2010s, it said, with the state-run Global Times writing a feature praising Zhang's efforts in September 2014. 
Labour activists in China have long been under pressure from the ruling Communist Party, which is deeply suspicious of social organising that occurs outside of its control. Authorities have sharply intensified their efforts in recent years.
Despite the release of the five, worker groups and their former staff continue to be monitored closely, according to sources who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject.
A representative for the Shenzhen courts was unable to provide immediate confirmation or comment over telephone on Saturday. 
Zhang's ex-wife Xiao Hongxia said he seemed healthy and ""in good spirits"" when she visited him on Friday. 
""I brought his two sons who haven't seen him for more than a year,"" she said. ""They were very happy - what son wouldn't be happy to see their father?""

BEIJING - Grunts, groans and the sound of pulsing music and crashing weights have returned to some of Beijing's gyms after being closed for nearly three months due to the coronavirus outbreak.
With the respiratory illness under control in China, the economy has begun to open up again as authorities loosen lockdown restrictions including stay-at-home orders.
""After coming back to the gym I've been able to get my blood, my circulation going again and get my muscles flexed again,"" said one gym enthusiast, surnamed Lu, 38, at ""Mi Fitness"", one of the facilities which was allowed to reopen at the end of April.
""This kind of feeling is fantastic!"" he said, after a few sets of lateral raises.    Only gyms above ground level are currently allowed to operate provided they follow rules. Temperatures are checked at the door and names and contacts are noted. Everyone must wear a mask unless they have difficulty breathing and maintain a distance of around two metres.
Mi Fitness is subject to three spot checks a day from the city's sports authorities, the local government and the building's management. A breach of the rules may shut down the business. A thorough cleaning of equipment is carried out regularly.
The fitness studio is on the eighth floor of an office building in west Beijing. During a visit by Reuters on Friday, all those working out observed the mask rule. Some admitted it was a little uncomfortable to wear one while exercising, but 21-year-old student Peng Weichen was determined to see the positive side of things.
    ""I treat it as a form of resistance training,"" Peng said. ""That is, resistance training with a reduced oxygen intake. It's not a big deal. It's fine. I can take it.""
Several members including Peng's training partner, Xu Haozhi, said they were glad to be back in the gym because the outbreak has taken a toll on their waistlines.
""If I don't get some proper exercise soon,"" Xu said. ""I will be really, really fat.""
Li Chenglong, 26, a barista, said he was excited to be training again, but initially his muscles were not quite ready.
""After doing various different exercises my body would really feel it for at least a couple of days,"" Li said. ""It was quite painful.""
Gym co-founder Liu Mei said the re-opening came in the nick of time.
In early April after two months of no income and no certainty when Mi could re-open, Liu and her business partner considered giving up the business which only opened in 2019.
""I was really panicking before...the whole sector was in a state of panic,"" she said.    Mi Fitness is for members only and gym users sign up for classes with a personal trainer. But Liu says they are now allowing people who want to work out on their own use the facilities for a month as many other gyms nearby are still closed. That has helped bring up the number of customers which average about a half-dozen per hour.
Although the lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus has eased, many people are still working from home or looking after their children and business is not what it used to be.
Despite these hurdles and concerns about a possible second wave of coronavirus, Liu says the fitness sector has a lot of promise.
""I really hope that all of those fellow gym owners who feel that they can't stay afloat any longer, can keep going somehow because this sector does have a lot of potential,"" Liu said. ""When it comes to getting the nation fit and fighting and resisting this epidemic, I think that our sector should keep going.""
China has 82,887 cases of coronavirus and the death toll stands at 4,633, according to the national health authority.

""Economic consequences of illness and confinement, such as unemployment or less income sources, can disproportionately affect the most vulnerable groups,"" said the study, which surveyed around 4,000 people between April 25 and May 1. 
About 22% of Portugal's 4.9 million workers take home the minimum monthly wage of 635 euros, the lowest in western Europe. 
Since the pandemic hit Portugal, 25% of people with a household income of up to 650 euros lost all their earnings, and only 6% of those with a monthly household income of 2,500 euros or more lost it all, the study showed. 
""Preliminary data seems to indicate COVID-19 is noticeably unequal,"" it said, adding that inequalities can increase people's risk of being infected by the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus because they might have no option but to leave their homes to work.
""Work that cannot be done remotely or the need to continue to do small jobs to ensure short-term subsistence puts people at risk of greater exposure to infection,"" it said. 
Portugal, which has reported 27,268 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 1,114 deaths, started cautiously easing its lockdown restrictions on Monday. 
Portugal's economy is expected to contract by 8% this year, and unemployment to more than double to 13.9%, according to the International Monetary Fund. 
A total of 91,500 people registered as unemployed between the beginning of Portugal's lockdown on March 18 and the end of April, official figures showed, bringing total unemployment to just under 370,000 people.

VISAKHAPATNAM (Reuters) - Villagers placed the bodies of three victims of a deadly gas leak from an LG Polymers plant in southern India at the gates of the site on Saturday, and demanded the factory be shut down immediately and its top management arrested.
Toxic styrene gas spewed out of the plant near the southern city of Visakhapatnam on Thursday, killing at least 11 people and forcing 800 more to be hospitalized for treatment. Hundreds of victims remain in hospital.
On Saturday, villagers staged a sit-in at the plant's gate with three bodies of victims as the Director General of Police visited the plant, Reuters' partner ANI reported.
Some protesters barged into the compound and police had to block their way to allow officials investigating the leak to come in and out. 
Protestors shouted ""We want justice!"" and demanded a permanent closure of the factory that is close to residential areas, ANI reported.
They also called for the arrest of factory management of LG Polymers, which is a subsidiary of LG Chem Ltd, South Korea's biggest petrochemical company.
Police have filed a negligence and culpable homicide complaint against the management of the LG Polymers plant.
In a statement on Saturday, LG Polymers apologised to all those affected by the incident and said it would extend all possible support to ensure those affected and their families were taken care of. 
""The company is committed to work closely with the concerned authorities in India to investigate the cause of this incident,"" the company said.

It said its initial investigations suggested the tragedy was caused by leaking vapour from a styrene monomer storage tank.

Fourteen more were wounded during the protest - sparked by growing unhappiness at the distribution allegedly favouring people with political connections, said Gulzaman Nayeb, a lawmaker representing Ghor.
Police opened fire after some among the around 300 protesters threw stones and started firing guns and trying to enter the governor's house, said Mohammad Arif Aber, a spokesman for the provincial governor of Ghor. 
He put the toll at two dead and five wounded, adding police were among the wounded. He denied that aid was being unfairly distributed.
Among the dead was Ahmad Naveed Khan, a local volunteer radio presenter who was sitting at his nearby shop and hit in the head by a bullet, according to Ahmad Quraishi, Executive Director at the Afghanistan Journalists Centre. 
The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission (AIHRC) is looking into the ""worrying reports of police firing on protestors"", its chairperson Shaharzad Akbar said on Twitter. 
The government has been distributing food aid around the country as the restrictions imposed by the coronavirus pandemic have led to many job losses and rising food prices.
Akbar told Reuters this week that the commission was being inundated with complaints from the public that food aid is being distributed unfairly.
""We hear repeated complaints from people that the ones who are receiving the limited aid that is there are not the ones that are most deserving, they are the ones who have connections to local authorities or local officials,"" she said while adding it was not possible to verify the extent to which this was happening.

Mitiga is the last functioning airport in the Libyan capital, though civilian flights stopped in March because of repeated shelling even before the country imposed a lockdown over the coronavirus pandemic. 
The NOC statement, posted on the state-run company's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, gave no details of the attack but said firemen were working to bring the blaze under control. 
Video shared with Reuters by an airport worker showed plumes of black smoke billowing over the apron. 
The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar has been fighting for more than a year to capture Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), with frequent shelling of the capital. 
Pro-GNA forces have retaken some territory from the LNA during an escalation of fighting in recent weeks with the help of Turkish-supplied drones.

MINSK (Reuters) - Thousands of soldiers marched in Belarus on Saturday to celebrate the Soviet victory in World War Two, as President Alexander Lukashenko rejected calls for lockdown measures to fight the coronavirus pandemic. 
Lukashenko, who has ruled the eastern European country since 1994, has called fears over the coronavirus a ""psychosis"" and variously suggested drinking vodka, visiting saunas or playing ice hockey to beat the disease.
Spectators in stands in the capital Minsk, a few of whom wore masks, looked on as soldiers marched, tanks rolled past and Su-30 fighter jets flew in formation overhead. 
Lukashenko's insistence on going ahead with the display contrasted with neighbour Russia, which scaled back celebrations amid a jump in coronavirus cases and postponed its usual massive military parade on Red Square (NYSE:SQ).
Dressed in military uniform and surrounded by generals, Lukashenko said it was unacceptable for Belarus to even think about cancelling the parade.
""There will be people who will condemn us,"" Lukashenko said. He told such critics: ""do not rush to draw conclusions, let alone condemn us, the heirs of the Victory, the Belarusians ... We simply could not асt differently, we had no other choice.""
Belarus has not imposed lockdown measures or social distancing rules, and kept its borders open while countries around the world have closed them.
""This is a demonstration of determination, will, strength, not so much for society as for the inner circle of the elite,"" said Andrey Egorov, senior analyst at the Center for European Transformation. ""It's a demonstration that everything remains under control.""
Another reason for staging the parade could be an act of one-upmanship against Russian President Vladimir Putin. Ties between the two traditional allies have been strained, especially over Moscow's decision to scale back subsidies and loans that prop up Lukashenko's rule.
""Against the background of Putin's cancelled parade, Lukashenko has the opportunity to draw attention to himself,"" said political analyst Alexander Klaskovsky. 
""This is such a kind of revenge for the numerous humiliations. Putin hid in the bunker, and Lukashenko at that time will be standing on the podium in a beautiful uniform.”
The World Organisation has called on Belarus to introduce tougher measures to fight the coronavirus and the head of its Minsk office has expressed concern about holding the parade.
There are 21,107 confirmed coronavirus cases in Belarus, with 121 deaths. But some in the country believe the official statistics underestimate the true toll.

The EU executive is due on Wednesday to present guidance and recommendations for member states on gradually lifting internal border restrictions, restarting travel and reviving the ailing tourism sector. 
Germany and other member states have called for a suspension of EU rules that force cash-drained airlines and the hospitality industry to offer full refunds for cancelled flights and visits instead of vouchers for future travel. 
The Commission will tell member states to make vouchers more attractive to encourage customers to accept them. 
""To provide incentives for passengers and travellers to accept vouchers instead of reimbursement, vouchers should be protected against insolvency of the issuer and remain refundable by the end of their validity if not redeemed,"" the draft document said.
""Insolvency protection needs to be assured at the national level and secured vouchers need to be accessible to all passengers and travellers,"" it said. 

The document also said vouchers should be more flexible and widely transferable to other services available.

The U.S.-based rights group, citing a source with ties to the royal family, said Prince Faisal bin Abdullah, a son of late monarch King Abdullah, was detained by security forces on March 27 while self-isolating due to the coronavirus pandemic at a family compound northeast of the capital Riyadh.
Reuters could not immediately independently verify the detention. The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a detailed Reuters request for comment. 
Earlier in March, authorities had detained King Salman's brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, and former crown prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was replaced in a 2017 palace coup and placed under house arrest, sources had told Reuters. 
Sources with royal connections said at the time that the move was a preemptive effort to ensure compliance within the ruling Al Saud family ahead of an eventual succession to the throne by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman upon the king's death or abdication. 
It was not clear if the reported detention of Prince Faisal was related to those in early March, which also saw Ahmed's son Nayef and Mohammed bin Nayef's brother Nawaf detained.
Saudi authorities have not commented on those detentions, which follow crackdowns on dissent in which clerics, intellectuals and rights activists have been arrested, and an anti-corruption drive launched in 2017 that netted scores of royals, ministers and businessmen.
Critics have said the campaigns were part of moves by Crown Prince Mohammed, the king's son and the kingdom's de facto ruler, to consolidate his grip on power.
""Now we have to add Prince Faisal to the hundreds detained in Saudi Arabia without a clear legal basis,"" said Michael Page, deputy Middle East director at HRW.
The kingdom has regularly denied allegations of unfair detention. Authorities said last year the government was winding down the anti-corruption campaign after 15 months, but would continue to go after graft.
HRW said Prince Faisal's whereabouts or status are not known.
""The source said that Prince Faisal has not publicly criticized authorities since his December 2017 arrest and that family members are concerned about his health as he has a heart condition,"" it added. 
In late December 2017, a senior Saudi official said Prince Faisal and another royal, Prince Meshaal bin Abdullah, were released from Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, where people nabbed in the anti-corruption drive were being held, after reaching an undisclosed financial settlement with the government.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will reform its disease prevention and control system to address weaknesses exposed by the coronavirus outbreak, a senior health official said on Saturday.
China has been criticised domestically and abroad as being initially slow to react to the epidemic, which first broke out on a large scale in Wuhan. The virus has since spread across the world, infecting almost 4 million people and killing almost a quarter-million from the COVID-19 disease it causes.

The commission intends to build a ""centralised and efficient"" chain of command and reform, and modernise the disease prevention and control system, he said.
The commission also aims to make better use of big data, artificial intelligence and cloud computing to better analyse the disease, trace the virus and distribute resources.
He said the commission plans to step up research on core technology, improve medical insurance and better ensure the availability of emergency materials.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The leaders of U.S. congressional foreign affairs committees wrote to nearly 60 countries on Friday asking them to support Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization, citing the need for the broadest effort possible to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan, which is not a member of the United Nations, has been excluded from the WHO, which is a U.N. agency, due to objections from China. 
""As the world works to combat the spread of the COVID-19, a novel coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, it has never been more important to ensure all countries prioritize global health and safety over politics,"" the lawmakers said in their letter, sent on Friday and first reported by Reuters.
It was signed by Representatives Eliot Engel, Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, and Michael McCaul, the panel's ranking Republican member, as well as Senators Jim Risch, the Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman, and Bob Menendez, the panel's ranking Democratic member.
The letter was sent to ""like-minded"" countries, large and small, seen as friends and allies of Taiwan, including Canada, Thailand, Japan, Germany, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Australia.
It was sent as President Donald Trump and other U.S. officials have ramped up criticism of China over the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19. The Trump administration has accused China of making the pandemic worse by hiding information.
Last month, Trump announced that he was suspending aid to the WHO, accusing it of being ""China-centric"" and promoting China's ""disinformation"" about the outbreak, assertions the WHO denies.
Some of Trump's fellow Republicans in Congress have echoed the president's criticisms. Democrats have criticized Trump for attacking the WHO during a global health crisis, while saying it needs reforms.
Taiwan has been seeking to join a ministerial meeting this month of the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), with backing from Washington and several U.S. allies.
But China, which considers Taiwan a breakaway province under its ""one China"" policy, said Taiwan's effort to join the meeting will fail, insisting its efforts are based on politics, not health concerns.
Taiwan has argued that its exclusion from the WHO has created a dangerous gap in the global fight against the coronavirus.
In their letter, the U.S. lawmakers said Taiwan's resources and expertise are assets that could benefit the world as it struggles with the pandemic. They noted that Taiwan was invited to participate in WHA meetings from 2009 to 2016.

""Diseases know no borders. We urge your government to join us in addressing the pressing issue of Taiwan's inclusion in global health and safety organizations. Given what the world has endured as a result of COVID-19, UN Member States joining together to insist Taiwan be invited to the upcoming virtual WHA session in May 2020 is the right place to start,"" the letter said.

Fernandez said he was ""extremely proud"" of Argentines for observing the strict social isolation measures, which he said had helped the government achieve its aim of flattening the curve of cases and deaths. 
Argentines have been sealed in their homes since the quarantine was first announced on March 20 but since last month have been allowed to take short walks outside their homes during the day.
Buenos Aires Mayor Horacio Rodríguez Larreta told the same news conference that children would now be allowed to go out for exercise accompanied by their parents at weekends.
Argentina has been under national quarantine for seven weeks and the government has extended it three times previously.

Britain left the EU in January, and talks with the bloc are now focused on setting new trading terms from 2021, when London's status-quo transition period ends. However the talks quickly hit an impasse when negotiations resumed last month, according to diplomats and officials.
""It's worrying that Britain is moving further away from our jointly agreed political declaration on key issues in the negotiations,"" Maas told Augsburger Allgemeine newspaper.
""It's simply not on, because the negotiations are a complete package as it's laid out in the political declaration,"" he added.
Maas said there was currently neither common ground on how to shape a comprehensive trade deal nor on whether to extend the negotiation period beyond the end of the year.
""The British government is still refusing to extend the deadline,"" Maas said. ""If it stays that way, we will have to deal with Brexit in addition to the coronavirus at the turn of the year.""

(Reuters) - A 5-year old boy has died in New York from a rare inflammatory syndrome believed to be linked to the novel coronavirus, highlighting a potential new risk for children in the pandemic, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday.
Cuomo told a daily briefing that the boy died in New York City on Thursday and that health officials were looking at other deaths involving children under similar circumstances to see if there is a link to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
""There has been at least one fatality because of this and there may be others that are now under investigation,"" Cuomo said. ""This is every parents' nightmare, right, that your child may actually be affected by this virus.""
Cases of rare, life-threatening inflammatory illnesses in children associated with exposure to COVID-19 were first reported in Britain, Italy and Spain, but doctors in the United States are starting to report clusters of kids with the disorder, which can attack multiple organs, impair heart function and weaken heart arteries.
Dr. Sean O'Leary, a pediatric infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Colorado who serves on the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on infectious disease, said he believes the New York case is the first reported death from this syndrome in the United States.
The syndrome shares symptoms with toxic shock and Kawasaki disease, which is associated with fever, skin rashes, swelling of glands, and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart. Scientists are still trying to determine whether the syndrome is linked with the new coronavirus because not all children with it have tested positive for the virus.
Cuomo said New York's health department, which on Wednesday issued an advisory to healthcare providers about the so-called pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, were reviewing 73 cases with children showing similar symptoms across the state.
""While rare, we are seeing some cases where children affected with the COVID virus can become ill with symptoms similar to the Kawasaki disease or toxic shock-like syndrome that literally causes inflammation in their blood vessels,"" the governor said.
This emerging syndrome, which may occur days to weeks after a COVID-19 illness, reflects the surprising ways that this entirely new coronavirus infects and sickens its human hosts.
In Westchester County, a suburb of Manhattan, officials said on Friday that they were reviewing the recent death of another child that was possibly related to the syndrome and COVID-19 at the Maria Fareri Children's Hospital in Valhalla, New York.
""In these early stages, we cannot say with certainty whether this was specifically related to COVID-19, and not to underlying medical issues,"" the Westchester Medical Center Health Network, which counts the hospital in its network, said in a statement. 
If the syndrome grows in prevelance it would shake a prior assumption that children by and large did not have to worry about COVID-19, Cuomo said. 
""This would be really painful news and would open up an entirely different chapter,"" he said. ""I can't tell you how many people I spoke to who took peace and solace in the fact that children were not getting infected.""

In neighboring New Jersey, a child was among the 162 COVID-19 fatalities reported on Friday by state Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli. Speaking at a briefing, Persichilli declined to provide any details about the child to protect the privacy of the family other than to say that the child had ""an underlying medical condition.""

The NSC issued a statement via Twitter after Maduro said that Venezuelan authorities had detained a pair of U.S. citizens working with a U.S. military veteran who has claimed responsibility for the foiled operation.
President Donald Trump had already denied U.S. involvement in the incident but the NSC took it a step further.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Queen Elizabeth honoured those who died in World War Two on Friday, the 75th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, and used the occasion to say she was proud of how people had responded to the coronavirus pandemic.
In a televised message, the 94-year-old monarch said those who had served during the conflict with Nazi Germany in the 1940s would admire how their descendants were coping with COVID-19 and the lockdown imposed to curb its spread.
""Today it may seem hard that we cannot mark this special anniversary as we would wish,"" Elizabeth said, reflecting on the scaling down of events to mark the VE Day anniversary because of a ban on social gatherings, with a veterans' parade cancelled and street parties scrapped. 
""Instead we remember from our homes and our doorsteps. But our streets are not empty. They are filled with the love and the care that we have for each other.
""When I look at our country today and see what we are willing to do to protect and support one another, I say with pride, that we are still a nation those brave soldiers, sailors and airmen would recognise and admire.""
Britain has the highest death toll in Europe from COVID-19 at more than 30,000, a number second only to the United States.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has likened the fight against the coronavirus to a war, and the queen's words about the conflict of 75 years ago appeared applicable today.
""It had affected everyone and no one was immune from its impact. Whether it be the men and women called up to serve, families separated from each other or people asked to take up new roles and skills to support the war effort, all had a part to play,"" the queen said.
""At the start, the outlook seemed bleak, the end distant, the outcome uncertain,"" she added. ""Never give up, never despair, that was the message of VE Day.""
Elizabeth, who delivered her address exactly 75 years to the hour after her father George VI gave his victory speech to the nation, was a teenager during the war and as a member of the women's Auxiliary Territorial Service, she learned to drive military trucks. 
As Britain celebrated victory on May 8, 1945, she and her late younger sister Margaret famously slipped out to join the throng outside Buckingham Palace, believed to be the only time during her 68-year reign she has been among the public unrecognised.
""I vividly remember the jubilant scenes my sister and I witnessed with our parents and Winston Churchill from the balcony of Buckingham Palace,"" the queen said.
""A sense of joy in the crowds who gathered outside and across the country was profound.""

She said the greatest tribute to those who gave their lives was that countries that were enemies during the war were now friends.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president on Friday urged the United States to shed light on a gun-running sting that caused bilateral friction under the Obama presidency, questioning the behavior of past U.S. administrations for the third time this week.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his government would send a diplomatic note to Washington for information on the 2009-2011 operation known as 'Fast and Furious,' a topic that has resurfaced in recent days amid a debate over historic U.S.-Mexico cooperation on security and possible corruption under previous administrations.
Setting out to stop cross-border gun smuggling, the U.S. scheme allowed people to illegally buy arms in the United States and take them to Mexico so that the weapons could be tracked and lead law enforcement officials to drug cartel bosses. Some weapons were later blamed for gangland slayings in Mexico.
""How could this be? A government that invades in this way, that flagrantly violates sovereignty, international laws,"" Lopez Obrador said at his daily news conference.
To avoid a repeat, the matter needed to be cleared up, said Lopez Obrador, who noted that President Donald Trump had last year been ""respectful"" to Mexico in discussions over joint co-operation following two major security incidents.
Mexican politicians are still arguing over how much its government knew about 'Fast and Furious' at the time.
Lopez Obrador brought up the gun-running scheme on Monday when discussing the case of Genaro Garcia Luna, Mexico's security minister from 2006-12, who was arrested in the United States in December and charged with drug-trafficking offenses. As security minister, Garcia Luna had spearheaded a crackdown on drug gangs, launched under former President Felipe Calderon.
Roberta Jacobson, a former American ambassador to Mexico appointed under U.S. President Barack Obama, had suggested both governments knew about possible corruption by Garcia Luna in an interview with Mexican magazine Proceso published at the weekend.
Lopez Obrador has used the arrest of Garcia Luna to argue that corruption was rampant in past Mexican governments.
But this week he has also asked whether previous U.S. administrations were complicit by working with Garcia Luna, whose period as minister coincided with Obama's first term in office and the final years of George W. Bush.
ELECTION
Critics of Lopez Obrador contend that he has done Trump a favor by raising questions about Garcia Luna as the U.S president prepares to fight a November election against Joe Biden, who was vice president from 2009 to 2017 under Obama.
Fernando Belaunzaran, co-leader of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution, on Twitter called it a ""badly-disguised"" stunt by Lopez Obrador to curry favor with Trump ahead of a joint meeting the Mexican president has proposed.
Allies of Lopez Obrador reject this, saying instead that he is seeking to put pressure on Calderon, a critic of the president who is building a new political party.
""This (diplomatic) note is about domestic political matters,"" said Lorenzo Meyer, a historian at the Colegio de Mexico and longtime supporter of the president. ""I don't think he's given thought about what this means for the United States.""
On Monday, Lopez Obrador said U.S. officials at the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) who cooperated with Garcia Luna should be investigated.
The DEA and the CIA declined to comment. The FBI did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

On Thursday, Lopez Obrador again asked for U.S. officials to be investigated for their ties to Garcia Luna, saying ""cover-ups"" during the era were not the work of just ""one government.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union should strengthen a voluntary pledge, to which  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google and  Twitter Inc  (NYSE:TWTR) signed up to combat fake news, with sanctions to make it a more effective tool, a study done for the European Commission said on Friday.
The three U.S. tech giants, together with Mozilla and trade bodies representing the advertising industry, agreed in October 2018 on a self-regulatory code of practice to tackle disinformation in a bid to stave off heavy-handed legislation.
The EU executive has acknowledged the companies' efforts via regular reports but also urged them to do more. Last year, it commissioned a study to look in to the matter.
The study said the code should continue as a basis for further action but noted some shortcomings.
Key among these are the code's self-regulatory nature, the lack of uniformity of implementation and the lack of clarity around its scope and some of the key concepts, the study conducted by consultancy Valdani, Vicari and Associates (VVA) said.
It recommended giving some teeth to the code to ensure compliance.
""The European Commission should consider proposals for co-regulation within which appropriate enforcement mechanisms, sanctions and redress mechanisms should be established,"" the study said. 
Tech lobbying group EDiMA said the code should not be abandoned.

""The outcomes of the code of practice have shown that it is an effective way to address the spread of online disinformation and fake news,"" Director General Siada El Ramly said.

BOSTON (Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday declined to dismiss the charges against ""Full House"" actress Lori Loughlin and other wealthy parents awaiting trial in the U.S. college admissions scandal after they accused investigators of fabricating evidence.
U.S. District Judge Nathaniel Gorton in Boston accepted the explanations prosecutors provided to counter allegations by defense lawyers that investigators pushed a cooperating witness to lie and trick parents into making incriminating statements.
That witness was William ""Rick"" Singer, a college admissions consultant who has admitted to orchestrating a vast scheme to use bribery and other forms of fraud to help wealthy parents get their children in to top schools.
""The court is satisfied that government's counsel has not lied to or attempted to mislead the court or fabricated evidence,"" Gorton wrote.
Gorton said he also would not bar prosecutors from introducing at trial secretly recorded calls Singer placed to the parents.
Defense lawyers did not respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.
Loughlin and her fashion designer husband, Mossimo Giannulli, are set to face trial in October with six other parents.
Since March 2019, 53 people have been charged over a scheme prosecutors say Singer ran to facilitate cheating on college entrance exams and use bribery to secure the admission of various parents' children to schools as fake athletic recruits.
Prosecutors allege Loughlin and Giannulli agreed with Singer to pay $500,000 in bribes to have their two daughters named as fake recruits to the University of Southern California crew team.
They and 12 other parents in March moved to dismiss the case, saying prosecutors until recently withheld personal notes by Singer regarding recorded telephone calls he made to them at the government's direction.
In notes written in October 2018, Singer said Federal Bureau of Investigation agents told him to ""tell a fib"" on the calls to get the parents to make incriminating statements by telling them their payments were for bribes, not university donations.
The parents' lawyers maintain they believed their payments were legitimate donations. They said the notes showed investigators coerced Singer into lying to fabricate evidence supporting their criminal intent.
Gorton previously called those claims ""disturbing."" 
But on Friday, he said he was satisfied with the prosecution's explanation for the notes, though they should have been provided to defense lawyers sooner.

He said Singer was not being fully cooperative when he wrote the notes and that agents were trying to get him to ""corroborate, not fabricate, evidence.""

720,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 03:45PM ET</span>","To mention or not to mention WHO, that is U.N. Security Council question","By Michelle Nichols
NEW YORK (Reuters) - For more than six weeks the U.N. Security Council has been trying to agree on a resolution to confront the coronavirus pandemic, only to be stymied by a stand-off between China and the United States over whether to mention the World Health Organization.
The United States does not want a reference to the WHO in the text, diplomats said, which ultimately aims to back a March 23 call by U.N. chief Antonio Guterres for a ceasefire in global conflicts so the world can focus on the pandemic.
Washington halted funding for the WHO, a U.N. agency, after President Donald Trump accused it of being ""China-centric"" and promoting China's ""disinformation"" about the outbreak, assertions the WHO denies. 
The U.S. criticism prompted a staunch defense of the WHO during council negotiations by China, where the new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19, emerged late last year, so far killing nearly 275,000 people globally.
While the Security Council - charged with maintaining international peace and security - cannot do much to deal with the coronavirus itself, diplomats and analysts say it could have projected unity by backing Guterres' call for a global ceasefire.
""This would have been a much more effective appeal for a ceasefire if it had come a month ago. Now it feels a bit lame and late,"" said Richard Gowan, the U.N. director for the Crisis Group, conflict prevention advocates. ""The council has lost some credibility as the weeks have gone by, mainly thanks to U.S. obstructionism.""
Diplomats said both China and the United States have raised the prospect of a veto on the issue of whether WHO is mentioned or not. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by France, Russia, Britain, the United States or China to pass.
'PETTY'
It appeared the 15-member body had reached a compromise late on Thursday, diplomats said and according to the latest version of a French- and Tunisian drafted-resolution.
Instead of naming the WHO, the draft text, which was seen by Reuters, ""emphasizes the urgent need to support all countries, as well as all relevant entities of the United Nations system, including specialized health agencies."" The WHO is the only such agency.
The United States rejected that language on Friday, diplomats said, because it was an obvious reference to the Geneva-based WHO. 
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said the council should move forward with either a resolution limited to supporting Guterres' ceasefire call or a broad resolution urging countries to commit to transparency and accountability in the context of COVID-19.
Trump ramped up criticism of WHO after he and Chinese President Xi Jinping essentially agreed, in a March 27 phone call, to an informal truce in a war of words, during which Trump referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus.""
Last week, Trump again sharpened his rhetoric against China over the pandemic, signaling an end to the truce. On Wednesday U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of ""refusing to share the information we need to keep people safe."" Beijing accused Pompeo of telling lies. 
Some diplomats and analysts also questioned China's motives in advocating for the WHO at the Security Council, which they said was unusual because Beijing would traditionally argue that the work of the agency was outside the council's peace and security mandate.
""The battle over naming WHO is the veritable dictionary definition of small-minded petty obstruction and dysfunctionality,"" Simon Adams, executive director of the Global Centre for the Responsibility to Protect, posted on Twitter.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has made an already difficult timeline for a British-European Union trade deal ""virtually impossible"", Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said, cautioning that he did not wish to raise expectations of London seeking more time.
Tortuous Brexit talks, now focused on setting new trading terms from 2021 when London's status-quo transition period after Brexit ends, quickly hit an impasse when they resumed last month, according to EU diplomats and officials.
Coveney, who played a key role in Britain's EU withdrawal talks due to the border Ireland shares with British-run Northern Ireland, said progress so far this year has been much slower than the EU had hoped before the resumption of talks next week.
""Given the complexity of what we're trying to deal with here and the added complications, and there are many, as a result COVID-19, it surely makes sense for us to seek a bit more time,"" Coveney told an online conference on Friday.
""I think anybody looking at this from the outside could only conclude it makes sense to look for more time, but the British government has decided that's not what they want. I wouldn't be raising expectations around the British government agreeing to seeking more time.""
Coveney said if the EU are to have any of chance of changing British minds, they have to be careful as to how they do that. Any request would recognise that ""COVID-19 has made what is already a very, very difficult timeline to get agreement virtually impossible,"" he added.
While the EU says only a relatively modest free trade agreement is possible before the end of the year, it attaches conditions to it - including rigid guarantees of fair competition - that have been rejected by Britain.
Coveney said the two rounds of talks to date have ""really gotten nowhere"" because of those differences. At a bare minimum, he said, the EU needs an agreement and understanding around the so-called level playing field issues or ""whatever we decide to call them politically"".
Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who presided over Britain's exit from the EU on Jan. 31, has ruled out seeking an extension of the transition period beyond Dec. 31. Until then, Britain remains part of the EU's single market and customs union. 
""Talking about the UK being fully autonomous, protecting sovereignty, I get that language, that is what has driven Brexit in many ways. Breaking free from the European Union, not being a rule taker, that's fine from a political narrative perspective,"" he said.
""But you can't have quota-free, tariff-free trade unless there is a level playing field. The EU can just never facilitate that and why would they...This is essentially the crux of the issue and if we can't resolve it, there isn't going to be a deal.""

A liberal opposition party, the Neos, announced on Thursday that the searchable but little-known ""Complementary Register"" was publicly visible, calling for it to be taken down.
People whose details were featured include the interior, economy, environment and tourism ministers, as well as some of the country's best-known journalists, musicians and actors.
""This is the biggest data protection scandal of the republic there has ever been in Austria,"" Neos lawmaker and digitisation spokesman Douglas Hoyos told a news conference on Friday, welcoming the database's removal overnight.
The database's exact purpose and why people are on it remain unclear, though it appears to include individuals who are or were self-employed and who had secondary sources of income. 
Much of the public was shocked or surprised, including a presenter of national broadcaster ORF's main TV news programme.
""I found myself listed on this website. I can definitely say for my part that I never gave permission to be visible on this register. I did not even know about this site and assume that many, many of these million people in Austria knew nothing about it,"" Lou Lorenz-Dittlbacher said on Thursday while interviewing a data protection activist who worked with the Neos.
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's conservatives reacted angrily to Hoyos but also complied with his request. 
The party's leader in parliament, August Woeginger, said the database has existed for years and the Neos should have known.
""The Neos' cluelessness is shocking,"" he said in a statement, adding that the register had existed in its current form since 2009 by order of a government decree.
The conservative-controlled Economy Ministry echoed his comments in a statement but added that it took down the database on Thursday night ""to prevent possible misuse of the data as a result of the discussion in the media"".
""The ministry is always open to a legal adjustment and improvement. At the same time it should be noted that this is neither a data leak or a theft of data,"" it added.
The conservatives' junior coalition partner, the Greens, said: ""The availability of such a large number of people's private addresses is ... problematic from a data-protection perspective.""

JERUSALEM/RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian leaders on Friday vowed to defy a new Israeli military order which they fear could lead to the confiscation of money destined for prisoners, their relatives and the families of those killed in unrest.
Israel has long sought to end the payments, made by the Palestinian Authority to around 11,000 individuals and families. The Palestinians consider them stipends for victims of Israeli occupation, but Israel calls the payments a reward for violence.
With a new Israeli military order set to take effect on Saturday threatening fines and jail for anyone who facilitates such payments, Palestinian banks had begun shutting down the accounts of some prisoners and their families in recent days.
The prisoners and families are seen as heroes by many Palestinians, and the decision by banks to shut their accounts drew a backlash. Two branches of one bank, Cairo Amman Bank, were attacked overnight; one torched and another fired on by gunmen.
Stepping into the fray on Friday night, Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh said banks had agreed to reopen the accounts.
""Families of prisoners can activate their bank accounts starting from Sunday,"" he said in a statement. ""We reject the Israeli threats to banks over the allocations of prisoners and martyrs, and we will not submit to them.""
Israel's military said in a statement that the order expands its authority to seize assets received from committing a security offence. It did not comment on whether banks specifically would face penalties.
The Association of Banks in Palestine defended the account closures as intended to protect prisoners' assets from seizure and to defend the banks and their employees from Israeli punishment. The group called on the PA to find another method to make the payments.
LONG-RUNNING DISPUTE
Samer Bani Odeh, a 51-year-old released in 2011 after 16 years in Israeli jail for membership in an armed group, said Cairo Amman Bank had told him his account was being closed. The bank did not respond to a Reuters email seeking comment.
""A bank manager in Nablus sat with us (a group of prisoners) and said: we apologise, but we have to close your accounts. This is outside our control,"" Odeh said.
Fourteen banks operate in the West Bank, at least four of which had moved to close accounts, according to the Palestinian Prisoners Club, which represents prisoners.
The Palestinian Authority has limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank, land occupied by Israel since a 1967 war and home to nearly 3 million Palestinians.

As part of the dispute over the stipends last year, Israel said it would deduct the value of some of the payments from taxes it collects on the Palestinians' behalf. The PA responded by rejecting any funds collected by Israel, giving up half of its budget.

724,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>",Macron's lawmakers told to pull together amid reports of new group,"PARIS (Reuters) - The parliamentary leader of French President Emmanuel Macron's centrist party demanded the ""utmost prudence"" from his lawmakers on Friday after reports that some were poised to defect to a new political group, according to an internal memo.
Gilles Le Gendre, a close Macron ally, sent the memo seen by Reuters to La Republique En Marche (LaRem) lawmakers after the business daily Les Echos reported that the creation of a new 58-strong centre-left grouping was imminent.
Macron's party, formed after the former investment banker won the presidency in May 2017, has suffered a string of defections in recent months by parliamentarians frustrated with his tight grip on decision-making and his pro-business policies.
Macron's once-comfortable majority has been eroded. His party has 296 seats, down from 314 after the 2017 parliamentary vote, and just seven more than it needs for an absolute majority. LaRem also still has the support of a small partner.
There has been no official confirmation of what would be a ninth group in France's National Assembly. 
But Le Gendre wrote to his party that, if it came, ""more than ever, we will need pull together and rally round. Any attempt to divide will make it harder to deliver what the French people expect from their leaders"".
A parliamentary group does not have the formal structures of a party. It is, however, highly likely that any parliamentarian who joined the new group would be ejected from Macron's party.
A LaRem party source did not dismiss the reports of a new grouping in the making, but doubted whether it would manage to assemble as many as 58 members and suggested not all would come from LaRem's benches.
Among the names linked with the new group are Cedric Villani, a prize-winning mathematician who fell out with Macron after launching a renegade bid for Paris City Hall, and Matthieu Orphelin, who quit LaRem over what he called Macron's failings on climate change policy.
Both now sit in parliament as independents. Neither immediately responded to requests for comment, and nor did Macron's office.

Other names associated with the would-be new group suggest it could poach from other parties, including the Socialist Party, which is still trying to rebuild after Macron routed France's traditional mainstream blocs three years ago.

The measure, similar to others put in place around Latin America, has been criticized by LGBT groups and transgender people who say the restrictions have exposed them to discrimination and violence from people questioning their right to be out.
The rule, in place for nearly a month, will end on Monday, Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez said during a virtual press conference. Lopez said the restriction will be lifted because a gradual return to work for construction and manufacturing sectors will make it difficult for police to enforce gender rules.
Everyone will be required to use face masks when outside, Lopez said, and residents in certain neighborhoods in the working-class south of the city with high case numbers will have to stay inside between Saturday and May 23.

BRUNSWICK, Georgia (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters gathered in front of a Georgia courthouse on Friday to decry the killing of an unarmed black man in February and the delay in charging two white men in a shooting captured on video that was released earlier this week.
The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) arrested a former police officer, Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, on Thursday and charged with them with aggravated assault and murder in the Feb. 23 killing of Ahmaud Arbery, 25, in the coastal Georgia town of Brunswick (NYSE:BC).
The video's wide broadcast in recent days ignited outrage among activists, politicians and celebrities who saw the incident as the latest case of white perpetrators killing a black man and going unpunished.
""If we became involved when it was still an active crime scene, that's the perfect situation,"" GBI Director Vic Reynolds said in a briefing on Friday. ""Sometimes it's not a perfect world.""
He said the GBI could only initiate an investigation when asked to do so by the Glynn County district attorney.
“I just want justice for Ahmaud,"" Quintina Johnson, a 47-year-old waiter who was one of about 350 protesters in front of the Glynn County Courthouse in Brunswick on Friday. ""This is just one step we all have to take to make sure that justice is served correctly.”
The video footage, which surfaced on social media, shows Arbery jogging down a narrow two-lane road and around the McMichaels’ white pickup truck, which had stopped in the right lane with its driver’s door open.
As Arbery crosses back in front of the truck, a gunshot is fired. Arbery is then seen struggling with a man holding a long gun as a second man stands in the bed of the truck brandishing a revolver. Two more shots are heard before Arbery stumbles and falls face down onto the asphalt.
The GBI said it was Travis McMichael who fired the fatal round.

A district attorney, who was appointed to handle the case after two other prosecutors recused themselves because of their connections with the elder McMichael, said on Wednesday he would ask a county grand jury to decide whether the two men should face charges.
Gregory McMichael is a former Glynn County police officer and district attorney's investigator. 
The men's arrest by the GBI, one day after the agency opened an investigation into the case, appears to have sidelined any grand jury probe.

The new coronavirus case, on Pence's team, confirmed by White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, came a day after news that Trump's personal valet had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.
The two cases in quick succession heightened fears of contagion to the country's top two leaders, with both Trump and Pence recently resuming robust travel schedules despite a national death toll from the virus that has topped 75,000. 
But McEnany on Friday pointed to new steps taken to further protect top officials, noting that the White House is now conducting contact tracing and putting in place all guidelines recommended for essential workers. 
""We've taken every single precaution to protect the president,"" McEnany insisted to reporters in a White House press briefing. She also pointed to regular cleanings and adherence to distancing guidelines of six feet between individuals that are not always followed at crowded White House events. 
""We've done every single thing that Dr. (Deborah) Birx and Dr. (Anthony) Fauci have asked us to do,"" she added, referring to highly respected physicians on the coronavirus task force. 
Earlier on Friday, Trump was asked in a Fox News interview whether those who serve him food would now cover their faces. ""They've already started,"" he said on the network's ""Fox and Friends"" morning program.
The White House has also instituted daily, as opposed to weekly, coronavirus tests of the president and vice president. Both Trump and Pence tested negative for the virus and were feeling well after the Trump staffer - a U.S. military service member who works at the White House as a valet - came down with the virus. 
Trump also told Fox News that he has not yet been tested for antibodies to the novel coronavirus but probably would be soon. Such a test could confirm previous exposure to the virus. 
Still, Trump and Pence maintain busy public schedules. The vice president, who has led the White House coronavirus task force, on Friday flew to Iowa to meet with faith leaders about holding ""responsible"" gatherings and to discuss the food supply at the headquarters for Midwestern grocery chain Hy-Vee Inc.
According to a White House official speaking on condition of anonymity, a Pence staffer tested positive for the virus prompting officials to deplane Air Force 2 on Friday morning and briefly delay the planned takeoff. It was not immediately clear whether the staffer with the virus had been aboard the plane.
Trump attended a public event at the World War Two memorial with elderly veterans on Friday and was scheduled to meet face-to-face with Republican members of Congress at the White House, according to the White House. Neither Trump, first lady Melania Trump, the veterans nor military officials seen at the ceremony wore masks.
When asked about the safety of the ceremony's elderly participants, McEnany said it was their choice: ""They made the choice to come here because they've chosen to put their nation first. They wanted to be with their commander in chief on this momentous day.""
DICTATORS, KINGS, AND QUEENS 
Even as White House staffers don masks, protective facial coverings have been a harder sell for Trump and Pence. 
Trump himself has said he would not wear a mask and has not publicly worn a mask to any of his events so far amid the pandemic, but told reporters this week he tried some on behind the scenes during his visit to a Honeywell (NYSE:HON) face mask factory in Arizona. 
""As I greet presidents, prime ministers, dictators, kings, queens ... I don’t see it for myself, I just don’t,” Trump said in early April when the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began recommending widespread mask use to slow the coronavirus's spread.
""This president will make the decision as to whether to wear a mask or not,"" McEnany said on Friday. 
The virus, which first surfaced in Wuhan, China late last year, has infected more than a million Americans and driven millions into unemployment as a result of lockdown measures to curb a rise in infections. Those measures are being eased in some states, but many are still requiring masks. 
Both Trump and Pence have drawn fire for not donning masks, with critics arguing they are setting a bad example for Americans. 

Pence did not wear a mask while visiting coronavirus patients during a recent visit to Minnesota's Mayo Clinic, noting he was tested frequently for the disease. But he later said he should have worn one, saying it carries a symbolic weight as well.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Polish opposition lawmakers on Friday called for the dismissal of a government minister tasked with organising Sunday's presidential election, after the ruling coalition unexpectedly said the vote could not take place due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Opposition parties had accused the government of risking public health for political gain in insisting that the vote should take place as scheduled.
The Law and Justice (PiS) government tried to hold a last-minute postal ballot, which opposition groups said contravened Polish law.
The government acknowledged on Wednesday that a postal vote could not be organised on time and said a new election would be called soon.
""Today we are starting the process of holding accountable those who are responsible for the embarrassment that is the presidential elections,"" Borys Budka, head of the centrist Civic Platform, told reporters. 
The party said it would ask parliament for a vote of no confidence in Jacek Sasin, the deputy prime minister in charge of preparing for the vote
The Left, another opposition group, submitted a notification to the prosecutors' office demanding information on whether there was a legal basis for a postal ballot. 
PiS denies misconduct.
""There is no basis for minister Sasin's dismissal, there will be no changes in this post,"" government spokesman Piotr Muller said, according to state news agency PAP.
PiS had wanted the election to go ahead because of concerns that the recession likely to follow the coronavirus pandemic would dent support for the government and its allies.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Three weeks before he was shot dead, Miguel Calderon, an inmate in the lawless Los Llanos jail on Venezuela's central plains, sent a voice message to his father.
""We live among the shit and the trash,"" the 26-year-old former soldier, convicted of car theft, said in the message reviewed by Reuters.
Like many of the prisoners in Venezuela's overcrowded and violent penitentiaries, Los Llanos's 4,000 inmates normally subsist on food relatives bring them. But authorities banned visits due to a coronavirus quarantine imposed in March.
The guards, desperate themselves amid national shortages, began stealing the little food getting behind bars, inmates said, forcing some prisoners to turn to eating stray animals.
By May 1, Calderon and other convicts could bear it no longer. Around midday, they crowded around the jail's entrance, demanding change and some attempted to escape, according to two witnesses and three other people familiar with the incident.
A contingent of National Guard soldiers guarding the perimeter opened fire, hitting scores of inmates, they said. Calderon was among them.
By the day's end, 47 prisoners had died and 75 more were injured, the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons rights group said, the latest in a history of massacres in Venezuelan jails. The two people in the jail at the time, questioned by Reuters, say soldiers executed several of the wounded on the ground.
The day after, the United Nations Human Rights Council expressed grave concern and called for an investigation.
The information and prison ministries did not respond to requests to comment, and Reuters was unable to speak to any of the guards or soldiers present during the incident.
Venezuela's chief prosecutor Tarek Saab said on Friday that authorities were investigating the incident and were conducting autopsies on 47 victims.
The local National Guard detachment, in a statement on the day, said the penitentiary's director had been stabbed while attempting to speak at the entrance with inmates and when they attempted to flee, ""they were shot down.""
ECLIPSED BY INVASION
The story of the massacre has been buried by news of a bungled invasion against President Nicolas Maduro's government, linked to the opposition, in which two former U.S. soldiers were captured and eight people killed.
State television has been lauding Venezuelan soldiers for repelling just the sort of U.S. incursion the Socialist party has long warned of, allowing Maduro to deflect attention away from the killings in Los Llanos and other reported rights violations.
In recent weeks, security forces have shot dead several Venezuelans protesting gas shortages and intelligence agents have detained opponents criticizing the state's readiness to combat coronavirus.
A U.S. State Department statement said on Thursday that Maduro was using the failed invasion ""to justify an increased level of repression"" and was ""attempting to avoid responsibility"" for the prison deaths.
Deadly riots are common in Venezuela's teeming prisons, where crime groups hold control, often with penitentiary authorities' consent. But this delicate balance of power is being destabilized by the coronavirus crisis.
A severe shortage of gasoline - exacerbated by U.S. sanctions seeking to topple Maduro - has compounded the quarantine's restrictions, curtailing Venezuela's already limited food supply. 
Nowhere have the shortages been felt more severely than in prisons, home to an estimated 50,000 inmates. With the government barely able to pay its own workers or secure imports for subsidized food, the welfare of prisoners has slipped even further down the agenda.
Calderon was imprisoned four years ago in Los Llanos, a complex of dirty white jail blocks ringed by rusted fencing overgrown with vegetation, on the outskirts of the city of Guanare, capital of Portuguesa state.
In the message to his father, Victor, he said he lived in a ramshackle sector of the prison called Jumanji, where prisoners slept in shacks ""like dogs"" as there was no space in the cells. The people in Jumanji were known as ""the stained ones,"" he said.
Calderon described to his father how at one point he saw a cat's head rolling on the ground and a group of ""happy prisoners"" who had found and eaten the animal. Prisoners, he said, defecated in the open.
""This is madness, dad,"" he said.
HOPING FOR FOOD 
The jail's gang leader, known as Olivo, in a WhatsApp message sent to various people locally after the deaths and shared with Reuters by an assistant in prison, said officers were ""provoking inmates"" with the new restrictions.
""They have stolen the food that our families sacrifice to send us,"" Olivo said.
Olivo, in the message, said inmates on May 1 went ""peacefully"" to the entrance to express their worries to the prison's director and seek ""a solution, not a conflict.""
Reuters could not reach Olivo directly. 
The National Guard referred to him as ""the leader"" in their statement, using the same alias.
Calderon was hoping to receive food, the two people with him at the time later told Victor in voice messages also reviewed by Reuters. In messages sent to Reuters via Victor, they declined to be identified due to security concerns. 
Tensions rose outside, though it is not clear what sparked the shooting.
""I told him, 'don't stay here, move',"" one person with him said in a message. 
But Calderon stayed put, the person said. As gunfire rang out, he was shot in his leg and chest, both people said. His friends dragged him back inside while soldiers went around ""finishing off"" prisoners lying injured on the ground, they said.
General Gherson Chacon, commander of the National Guard in Portuguesa, did not respond to messages seeking comment.
The two people there at the time said they took off Calderon's clothes to look for more bullet holes, but blood bubbled through his mouth and he ""asphyxiated."" According to one person, before dying, he said: ""Why do these things happen to us?""
Guards left Calderon's rake-thin body, dressed only in underpants, on the ground outside the prison alongside the other corpses as blood pooled around them, photos sent to Reuters by local opposition lawmaker Maria Martinez showed. Victor identified Calderon in the photos.
Police returned Calderon's body to Victor the following evening and his family buried him the morning after in a cemetery by Guanare.
In a phone interview, Victor said they had not received an official autopsy report confirming his son's cause of death. Calderon was named in a list of 30 of the deceased published in pro-government newspaper Ultimas Noticias on May 4.

""The government is not interested in letting the truth behind the massacre come out,"" Martinez said.

Border conflicts are frequent in the area which is part of the fertile Ferghana valley, a patchwork of Kyrgyz, Tajik and Uzbek villages with numerous enclaves and disputed border lines.
The clash first broke out between the residents of Kyrgyzstan's southwestern Batken province and the dwellers of Tajikistan's northernmost Sughd province, with dozens of people on each side hurling rocks at each other, the Kyrgyz side said.
One of the people involved in the fight then used a rifle; Tajik border guards then shelled their Kyrgyz counterparts with mortars, wounding three servicemen, Kyrgyzstan's border guard service said in a statement.
Tajik border guards, in turn, accused Kyrgyz ones of opening fire at two Tajik civilians. Both sides said the hostilities have ceased and negotiations were under way.

CHENNAI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - When gas began leaking from a nearby chemical factory and drifting towards his house in southern India, there were no warnings and no alarms, welder Elamanchili Venkatesh said.
He realised something was wrong when he woke up choking and spluttering in the pre-dawn darkness on Thursday in RR Venkatapuram village, just 250 metres (275 yards) from the plant owned by South Korea's LG Chem Ltd.
""My eyes were burning and the room was filled with a strong smell,"" the 22-year-old said.
Somehow, he was able to dial a friend and urged him to come over immediately. He then stumbled around trying to wake his family of six, but failed.
Venkatesh, who staggered outside blindly, said he coughed up blood before losing consciousness. When he woke up hours later in a hospital, his mother was fighting for her life and his one-year-old niece was in intensive care. 
His mother died soon afterwards. She was one of 11 people killed after gas from styrene, a raw material used at the factory, leaked into the air around 2:30 a.m. and enveloped homes on the outskirts of Visakhapatnam city in Andhra Pradesh state, officials said.
Hundreds more fell ill and were taken to hospital. 
""Why couldn't they have raised an alarm? Don't they have a siren in the company to alert citizens when something like this happens?"" he said. ""I didn't hear anything."" 
A dozen other victims interviewed by Reuters described similar scenes of confusion after the leak. 
LG Chem did not immediately respond to specific queries from Reuters for this article, including why residents did not hear an alarm.
It said that when the accident occurred, it was reopening the unit after a weeks-long nationwide lockdown imposed to stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. 
The leak was discovered by a night shift maintenance worker, the company said.
""Currently, we are focusing on all necessary measures together with relevant authorities to protect residents and employees and surveying the extent of the casualties and damage,"" LG Chem said in a statement on Friday.
It said the leak followed a chemical reaction in an industrial material that had been in storage for weeks.
""The exact cause of the incident is currently being investigated and will be notified as the findings and information becomes more concrete,"" it said.
A senior Andhra Pradesh government official briefed about the matter said that the temperature of stored raw material was higher than it should have been, adding that authorities were investigating whether a cooling system had malfunctioned.
P. Chandra Mohan Rao, a director at the plant, which makes polystyrene plastic used in cutlery, cups and packaging, did not immediately respond to questions from Reuters.
IMPOSSIBLE TO BREATHE
Authorities said the first call to emergency services came from a local resident at 3.25 a.m., not the company. 
Over the next few hours, police, firemen and ambulance crews evacuated about 4,500 families living in the villages surrounding the factory.
Naresh Patrudu, one of three friends who came to rescue Venkatesh, reached the area a little before 4:00 a.m. 
On the way to their friend's home, Patrudu said he saw more than a dozen people lying completely motionless in lanes, and along storm drains and ditches. Others were semi-conscious, rolling around on the ground, but disoriented and unable to run.
Avinash Kumar Gusida, 28, who also came to rescue a stranded friend, saw several children, adults and several dogs and cows lying unconscious. ""It was very, very horrible,"" he said.
Pasala Kanakaraju, 56, who fled his house on his motorcycle, found people lying unconscious in the streets, some frothing from the mouth. He lost control of his bike and collapsed. 
LG Chem said that inhaling the gas causes nausea and dizziness, but multiple witnesses told Reuters the symptoms exhibited by the victims were more severe.
Patrudu said Venkatesh's mother was found lying unconscious about 400 metres from the house. His father and older niece lay motionless nearby. 
Venkatesh himself was discovered outside a neighbouring cement plant, throwing up. His sister-in-law was the last to be found. She lay unconscious inside the house.
""We still didn't know what was happening,"" Patrudu said.
By then, the ambulances had started arriving. ""Those were the first noises we heard,"" he said.

Ventakesh's brother and younger niece were evacuated by other rescuers, and the family was briefly reunited at a local hospital before his mother died.

AHMEDABAD (Reuters) - Some residents frustrated over a strict coronavirus lockdown in Ahmedabad, the largest city in the western Indian state of Gujarat, hurled stones and were met with teargas in clashes with paramilitary forces on Friday.
Authorities in the city ordered all shops, except those selling milk and medicines, to close on midnight Wednesday until May 15, implementing a stricter lockdown than the national one in place since March 25, in an effort to curb a rise in infections.
Clashes erupted in the Shahpur locality of Ahmedabad when police and paramilitary forces tried to enforce the lockdown, asking people to stay indoors.
""Some people got agitated, and started pelting stones on the forces,"" city police commissioner Ashish Bhatia told Reuters. ""The police fired teargas shells to disperse the crowd. The situation is under control now,"" he said.
Local TV showed crowds chasing away the police and paramilitary teams. Bhatia said one policeman was injured and eight people had been detained.
Ahmedabad is one of the worst-hit cities in India. The city has reported more than 5,000 cases of coronavirus, accounting for about 70% of the total cases in Prime Minister Narendra Modi's home state. The city has also accounted for more than three quarters of the deaths in Gujarat.

KIEV (Reuters) - Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president of Georgia, vowed on Friday to help his new boss, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, clean out a political ""swamp"" of oligarchs' interests that he said were preventing Ukraine prospering. 
He spoke to Reuters in an interview a day after being appointed to advise Zelenskiy on reforms, a surprise political comeback in his adoptive country for one of the post-Soviet world's most recognisable figures.
Twice president of Georgia, Saakashvili had a brief but stormy spell in Ukrainian politics five years ago under Zelenskiy's predecessor Petro Poroshenko in which he once clambered onto a roof to avoid law enforcement. 
His reappearance ruffled feathers in Kiev and in Tbilisi -- Georgia's government recalled its ambassador for consultations in protest.
He joins Zelenskiy as Ukraine faces the prospect of a recession caused by the coronavirus pandemic -- which Saakashvili argued makes sweeping reforms all the more urgent. 
""President Zelenskiy has a clear mandate from the population of Ukraine to drain the swamp, to clean up the corruption mess that Ukraine has inherited, and to go against the vested oligarchic special interests,"" he said. 
Time has been lost since Zelenskiy's election last year, he said. ""But now, with the challenge of imminent, huge crisis ... there might be no other option but fast reforms and changes. Because we are dealing with a situation when Ukraine either changes or disappears as we know it.""
ECHOES OF TRUMP
His language echoes that of U.S. President Donald Trump, who vowed to ""drain the swamp"" in Washington of lobbyists and elites, and has expressed admiration for Saakashvili.
The 52-year-old had initially been sounded out for the post of deputy prime minister, but the move met with resistance in parliament. 
""The point is that President Zelenskiy, by appointing me, demonstrated he is prone to unconventional, brave steps,"" Saakashvili said. 
""I myself was surprised and President Zelenskiy was taken by surprise by the amount of fear that my candidacy generated. And this is a fear of not a healthy personal nature. This is a fear of old lobbies that don't want any change,"" he said.
He promised to help drive an overhaul of the judicial system -- long seen as riddled with corruption -- as well as deregulation and tax reform. 
""We've been unable to create state institutions and democratic framework for real change. Rather we created some ugly post-Soviet structure that is more or less, in many ways, more corrupt than the Soviet Union ever was,"" he said. 
""And that's the system that is killing Ukraine.""
RUNNING FEUD
Under Poroshenko, Saakashvili was invited to run the southerly Odessa region in 2015, based on his track record of fighting corruption as Georgia's leader after its 2003 Rose Revolution.
He was among several foreign politicians and technocrats to be given key posts by the pro-Western leadership in Kiev after the Russian-backed president, Viktor Yanukovich, fled in the face of street protests.
But the appointment descended into a running feud. Saakashvili resigned, accusing Poroshenko of corruption, which Poroshenko denied.
Ukraine stripped Saakashvili of his new citizenship when he was abroad, but he barged his way through a checkpoint at the Polish border to get back into Ukraine in September 2017. 
Five months later, he was deported after playing a cat-and-mouse game with law enforcement that saw him variously live in a tented protest camp, go on hunger strike, and break out of a police van with the help of his supporters. 
Zelenskiy restored his citizenship in one of his first official acts as president.
A benchmark for the progress of Ukraine's reforms has been its negotiations with the International Monetary Fund for a new loan agreement. The government hoped to secure an $8 billion package but the IMF this week switched to what is likely to be a more modest loan deal with fewer riders.

Saakashvili saw it as evidence of the international community's scepticism about Kiev's ability to pass reforms, but also called for the IMF to increase its lending to Ukraine.

Putin's overture was the latest in a series of contacts with Washington with which Moscow is keen to rebuild relations frayed over everything from election hacking allegations to Syria.
Putin and Trump say they worked closely together to clinch a global oil production cuts deal and spoke by phone on Thursday, when Trump offered to supply Russia with medical equipment to help fight the new coronavirus. 
On Friday, the Kremlin said Johnson and Putin had spoken by phone, congratulating each other on the 75th anniversary of the allied victory in World War Two and expressing a readiness for dialogue and cooperation on bilateral issues.
Ties with London remain badly strained over the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in England. 
""Both sides expressed readiness to establish dialogue and cooperation on issues on the agenda of Russian-British relations, as well as in solving pressing international problems,"" the Kremlin said in a readout of the call. 
The telegrams were among many Putin dispatched to the Soviet Union's World War Two allies on the 75th anniversary of the end of the conflict in Europe. 
Russia, which marks the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany on May 9, the day after ""Victory in Europe"" Day, has been forced to scale back commemorations due to the coronavirus.
In his message to Trump, Putin said Russia and the United States now stood at the forefront of confronting global challenges. ""Our countries could do a lot to ensure international security and stability,"" he said.

Putin told Johnson the allies' togetherness during World War Two was needed today and that the memory of those years could help British-Russian ties improve.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts on Friday put a temporary hold on the disclosure to a Democratic-led House of Representatives committee of grand jury material redacted from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian interference in the 2016 election.
The block will remain in place while the court considers what action to take. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in March that the materials had to be disclosed to the House Judiciary Committee and refused to put that decision on hold. The appeals court said the materials had to be handed over by May 11 if the Supreme Court did not intervene.
The committee's lawyers have until May 18 to file their response to the Justice Department's request to block the materials being immediately handed over, Roberts' brief order said.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday is scheduled to hear another showdown between Trump and the House, this time over committee subpoenas seeking his financial documents from his accounting firm and two banks. On the same day, the court is also weighing an attempt by a New York grand jury to obtain Trump's tax returns and related materials. 
The court has a 5-4 conservative majority that includes two Trump appointees. 
In the Mueller-related case, the appeals court in March upheld an Oct. 25 ruling by Chief U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell against the administration's bid to keep the redacted material secret.
The circuit court backed Howell's decision to direct the administration to comply with a subpoena by the House Judiciary Committee for the material blacked out of Mueller's report. The court agreed with Howell's decision that the House, in its impeachment investigation of Trump last year, was engaged in a judicial proceeding exempt from secrecy rules that typically shield grand jury materials from disclosure. 

Trump's administration has refused to comply with various House subpoenas for documents and testimony in a power struggle between the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government.

By the end of April, police had dismantled a number of such smuggling networks, stopped scams and attempted scams to the value of more than 30 million euros ($32 million), and seized 438,000 masks, he said.
In addition, 5.7 million masks ostensibly ordered on the internet have been the subject of a scam or attempted scam, he said.
The government has been criticised by doctors and opposition politicians for being indecisive on whether to require masks to be worn in public, and buying too few of them.
""Masks have become a wanted item, and so something you steal or use to swindle people,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told reporters.

739,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 11:50AM ET</span>",Stop! French philosopher Latour urges no return to pre-lockdown normal,"By Benoit Van Overstraeten
PARIS (Reuters) - What if rather than hurrying back to a pre-lockdown ""business as usual"" to revive economies hammered by the coronavirus pandemic, countries built a new normal where the fight against climate change was paramount? 
French philosopher Bruno Latour, a life-long environmental activist, is advocating just this, inviting people to resist a return to the old ways as governments ease restrictions.
Latour, 72, says the pandemic has unexpectedly showed it is possible to shut down global economic activity, despite leaders saying for decades that the train of progress could not be stopped.
The lockdowns have showed ""we could actually take immensely drastic measures in a matter of days to counter a threat. So in that sense, when people say we cannot do anything, it's clearly wrong,"" Latour told Reuters in an interview.
However, he noted that the scale of changes and decisions to be made to stem climate change are ""many times more complicated and more drastic than the ones we have (with the coronavirus)"".
France has been one of countries worst hit by COVID-19, with nearly 26,000 deaths to date. With new infections slowing, the government announced this week that a gradual easing of its nearly two-month lockdown would start from Monday - signalling a slow return to business as usual.
""We should not miss the chance of doing something else"", said Latour, who has built himself an international reputation with his case studies of scientists, notably French biologist Louis Pasteur, and his philosophical work to show nature and society are not opposites but closely intertwined.
Latour's call echoes a study published on Tuesday in which a group of top U.S. and British economists said massive programmes of public investment targeting green issues would be the most cost-effective way to both revive economies and strike a decisive blow against climate change.
NEW 'PROTECTIVE MEASURES'
Just as people around the world have been asked to adopt new behaviours to stop the spread of the virus - social distancing, wearing masks, coughing in your sleeve - Latour says all individuals should think of ""protective measures"" against a return to the pre-crisis production model.
""Let's try to see if we can imagine in advance what we want to keep (...) and what we want to stop"", Latour said.
He has issued a questionnaire on his website, translated into at least a dozen languages, asking people to describe how they would like the world to evolve, what they want to be definitely dropped or what should be developed. 
He said he had received hundreds of responses and was organising workshops. 
""Maybe, if it works, we'll link them to groups of people who can actually (...) stop something"", he said, adding, ""Can we do it politically? One way is to stop buying the things we don't want. The power of the consumer is immense"".
That said, Latour does not overstate the importance of his initiative. 

He said he is concerned that the scale of the crisis, which has put millions of people out of work around the world, will in fact send environmental concerns onto the back-burner.

JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan's fragile government and the peace agreement that formed it are in jeopardy after the country's president and vice president disagreed on how to share out regional states between them.
South Sudan ended five years of civil war in 2018, but conflict between President Salva Kiir and Vice President Riek Machar -- who led the opposing sides in the war -- have been major obstacles to completing the peace process.
The two disagree over who will run South Sudan's states and how to integrate different fighting forces. On Thursday, Kiir's office announced that leadership of six of the 10 states would go to Kiir's side, three would go to Machar's side and one would go to an alliance aligned with neither Kiir nor Machar.
""The allocation of the states ... is that of the president and not a decision taken by consensus,"" Machar said in a statement on Friday. ""It does not take into consideration the relative prominence each party has in each of the respective states or counties.""
Calls to Kiir's spokesman, Ateny Wek Ateny, for comment went unanswered.
Alan Boswell, a senior analyst with Brussels-based think tank International Crisis Group, said the disagreement between Kiir and Machar endangered the gains made so far toward a lasting peace.
""South Sudan’s new unity government is facing its biggest crisis yet, as negotiations broke down on how to share power in state and local governments across the country,” he said in a statement. 
""Despite the attention of South Sudan’s international partners on the COVID-19 pandemic, quick action from regional leaders will be key so that this latest power squabbling doesn’t escalate.""
South Sudan's civil war, often fought along ethnic lines, claimed an estimated 400,000 lives, triggered a famine and created Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda.
Previous South Sudan peace deals have held for only a matter of months before fighting resumed.

Trump said the incursion ""was not a good attack,"" carried out by a ""rogue group"" that included Venezuelans and ""people from other countries.""
""I saw the pictures on a beach. It wasn't led by General George Washington, obviously,"" he said, referring to the first U.S. president, often considered a military genius.

A former U.S. soldier captured in Venezuela has said he was contracted by a Florida security firm to seize control of Caracas' airport and bring in a plane to fly Maduro to the United States. According to a document published by the Washington Post on Thursday, members of the country's opposition party negotiated a $213 million deal with the company, Silvercorp USA, to invade the country and overthrow Maduro.

VALETTA/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Malta told its European Union partners on Friday it would no longer take part in a new Mediterranean mission to stop more arms reach warring factions in Libya, just four days after the naval and air operation began patrols.
A Maltese government spokesman and two EU diplomats told Reuters the decision was in protest at what Valetta said was an EU failure to help deal with migrants arriving from Libya, where the conflict has escalated sharply since April.
Malta is not a European military power, but the decision is a blow to a mission which began on May 4 after months of difficult diplomacy over which EU countries, if any, should take in any migrants rescued at sea.
EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell has warned that the bloc risked becoming irrelevant if it could not act, potentially leaving Libya's fate to Turkey and Russia, rather than influencing events in its own neighbourhood.
Although the EU cannot patrol the Egypt-Libya land border, through which artillery is still being delivered to Libya, the EU is concerned the Libyan conflict could worsen instability almost a decade after Muammar Gaddafi's fall in 2011.
An EU spokesman declined to comment directly on Malta's decision, saying the mission ""is a concrete example of how the EU wants to contribute to the peaceful settlement of the conflict on Libya,"" noting that its mandate is to enforce the United Nations arms embargo. 
Complicating matters, Malta has told Brussels it will veto decisions on the operation, known as Irini, that involving spending for disembarkation of migrants, port diversions, and the use of drones, the government official and diplomats said. That is likely to drain the mission of funds.
Operation Irini counts vessels from France, Greece and Italy, one Maltese naval boarding team and three patrol aircrafts from Germany, Luxembourg and Poland. The European Satellite Centre is providing satellite imagery support. 
The breakdown in cooperation, just after France began patrolling a naval vessel and Luxembourg flew aircraft over the eastern Mediterranean smuggling routes, deepens an increasingly bitter dispute with Malta.
Maltese Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo complained on Thursday that Italy and Malta were being left alone to deal with thousands of migrants crossing the central Mediterranean.
The island has closed its harbours and chartered two tourism boats to hold migrants just outside territorial waters. It has also criticised EU governments for not taking in those migrants after they have arrived in Maltese and Italian ports.
With hundreds of thousands making the perilous crossing from North Africa each year and thousands dying at sea, EU ships are required under international law to rescue those in trouble.
However, with EU borders closed by the coronavirus pandemic, governments are reluctant to take in migrants, although Luxembourg has taken minors relocated from Greece.

The rescue took place in the night from Thursday to Friday, a spokesman for the Maritime Prefecture for the Channel and North Sea (NYSE:SE) said.
Border and coastguards in Britain and France have intercepted numerous attempted crossings in recent months as migrants have repeatedly tried to travel from destinations in Asia and Africa to Britain.
""It's little wonder people living in France's refugee camps are desperate to make this dangerous crossing, given the awful conditions they face there,"" Clare Moseley, founder of the Care4Calais charity, said in a statement.
She was referring to difficulties in implementing social distancing measures to fight COVID-19 in the camps.
""These people are fleeing terrifying situations in some of the most dangerous parts of the world. They aim for the UK because they want to be safe.""

Italy loosened some of the toughest lockdown restrictions in Europe on Monday, allowing many businesses to re-open and giving people more freedom to move about but authorities have insisted that strict social distancing measures must still be respected.
The rules have been widely respected but several incidents have been reported of large groups of people, many not wearing protective masks, gathering in parks and other outdoor spaces, including the Navigli, Milan's popular canal area.
""Yesterday's images from along the Navigli were disgraceful,"" Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan, said in one of his regular online messages from his office in the city centre.
""Either things change today, or tomorrow I'll be here in Palazzo Marino and I'll pass measure to close the Navigli, I'll stop takeaway services and then you can explain to the people who work in bars why the mayor isn't allowing them to do business,"" he said.
""This isn't a game, we can't allow this in a city of 1.4 million inhabitants,"" he said.
Sala's comments reflect the deep concern among Italian authorities that the staged end to a lockdown imposed in early March could lead to a renewed flare-up in the epidemic if careful social distancing measures are not respected.
In a news conference in Rome the head of the National Health Institute, Silvio Brusaferro also warned that the epidemic was not over and called for responsible behaviour.
""The virus hasn't changed its identity, it's transmitted in the same way ... if we form gatherings and break the rules that have given our health system some breathing space then this will allow it to circulate again,"" Brusaferro said.
Italy, now facing its worst recession since World War Two, has been among the worst affected countries in the world, with some 30,000 dead and Lombardy, the region around the financial capital Milan, has accounted for around half of these.
The government, desperate to get as many companies back to work as possible, plans a staged re-opening of the economy with factories and construction sites opened this week and shops allowed to open from May 18.

Restaurants and bars are allowed to sell food and drinks to take away but will not be allowed to re-open fully until June.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - One of the Arab world's oldest universities faces its worst crisis since its foundation, with huge losses, staff cuts and an uphill battle to stay afloat as Lebanon's economic meltdown and the coronavirus pandemic hit revenues.
The American University of Beirut has graduated leading figures in medicine, law, science and art as well as political leaders and scholars over the decades including prime ministers.
It has weathered many crises, including Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, when a number of staff including two presidents were killed or abducted and a bomb destroyed one of its main halls.
But Lebanon's problems now may be the biggest threat yet to the institution founded in 1866 by Protestant missionaries. It ranks among the world's top 200 universities and its collapse would deprive future generations in Lebanon and the wider region of internationally recognized higher education. 
""This is one of the biggest challenges in AUB's history. The country is crashing catastrophically,"" AUB President Fadlo Khuri told Reuters in an interview.
With inflation, unemployment and poverty high, many families have little means to cover food and rent, let alone tens of thousands of dollars in tuition fees. 
The heavily indebted state, which defaulted on its foreign currency debt in March, owes AUB's medical centre - which attracts patients from across the Middle East and Central Asia - more than $150 million in arrears, Khuri said.
Government officials have ruled out a haircut on the bank deposits of non-profit universities such as AUB, but Khuri still fears his institution may take a hit if a state rescue plan puts part of the burden on large depositors and includes colleges.
Along with other universities, his school has lobbied the state and, he said, received assurances from the president and finance minister that any such measures would not impact them.
But he remains worried, with government plans for plugging vast holes in the national finances not yet finalised.
Government officials could not be reached for comment. 
""We have all this money they (the state) still owe us for the hospital so it's very hard to rely on well-intentioned people who may or may not have the ability (to deliver),"" he said.
The university and hospital expect real losses of $30 million this year after bleeding revenues. For 2020-2021 alone, it projects a 60% revenue reduction from this year, down to $249 million. 
FIGHTING TO SURVIVE
The stark revenue forecasts rely on an ""optimistic assumption"" that the Lebanese pound will stabilize at 3,000 to the dollar, but Khuri has said they do not take into account a possible haircut imposed on AUB's bank deposits in Lebanon.
Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni has said there will be a shift to a flexible exchange rate in the ""coming period"".
Khuri said AUB will have to set its own rate in the meantime, taking into account people who have said they can pay in dollars to help cushion the impact of the pound's collapse on poorer students.
AUB has already lost donations and scholarships it was expecting before the pandemic. On top of benefit and wage cuts, it is studying options such as closing whole departments and halting spending. 
In an email to students and families, Khuri promised to work to protect their livelihoods and to raise money via an emergency fund.

""But there is no question that sacrifices must and will take place at every level,"" Khuri wrote. ""We must fundamentally change in order to survive ... Saving AUB must be our only priority. And save it we will.""

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - An Ethiopian court on Friday convicted a former cabinet minister on corruption charges and sentenced him to six years in prison.
The conviction comes amid a push by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed to crack down on corruption in the public sector. Several former senior government officials and executives of state-owned enterprises have already been arrested and jailed. 
Bereket Simon was minister of communication from 1995 to 2012 under then president Meles Zenawi and was widely considered to be his right-hand man.
Bereket co-founded the Amhara region's public investment fund, TIRET Corporation, which he led until 2017. TIRET owns companies in the brewing, construction, transport and logistics sectors.
He was arrested last year on suspicion of mismanagement of public funds while he was heading the fund. 
Bereket was found guilty on two counts, of corruption and mismanagement of the institution, court spokesman Tazebachew Tassie said.
The court in Bahir Dar, the capital of Amhara, also convicted Tadesse Kassa, a former TIRET board member, on the same charges. 

Lawyers for Bereket and Tadesse could not immediately be reached for comment.

The ambassador, Nicholas Chapuis, on Thursday said it was ""regrettable"" that part of the article on EU-China relations had been removed before publication, the latest example of how troubled ties are between the bloc and Beijing.
As EU diplomats in Brussels expressed dismay that Chapuis allowed for the censorship without even informing the 27 EU countries in advance, a spokeswoman for the bloc's executive European Commission said on Friday, ""The decision was not the right one to take.""
But she also said Chapuis was an expert on China and ""a true asset"" for the Brussels-based EU joint foreign policy arm. 
The incident comes after China sought to block an EU report alleging that Beijing was spreading disnformation about the coronavirus outbreak, according to diplomatic correspondence seen by Reuters in April.
An EU-China summit in Beijing had been postponed from March amidst the coronavirus pandemic.
With more than a billion euros a day in bilateral trade, the EU is China's top trading partner, while China is second only to the United States as a market for EU goods and services.
But political, trade, human rights and security tensions weigh heavily on the relationship, not least as both vie for influence in the western Balkans.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Doctors in hazmat suits ran temperature checks on passengers at Delhi airport and bags were disinfected as the first group of Indians returned home on special flights from Singapore and the Gulf on Friday since a sweeping lockdown was imposed in March.
Some 400,000 Indians were expected to be brought back from the United States and the United Kingdom, besides southeast Asia and the Gulf, in a mammoth airlift mounted by state carrier Air India.
Separately, the Indian navy sent warships to the island nation of Maldives for citizens stranded there since the government cut off all travel and ordered its 1.3 billion people to stay indoors to prevent a surge in coronavirus infections.
""The process for return of Indian nationals stranded abroad via non-scheduled commercial flights and Indian navy ships has begun,"" home ministry joint secretary Punya Salila Srivastava told a news conference.
Local TV networks showed Air India crew dressed in light blue overalls, masks and protective plastic face shields inside the plane waiting to receive passengers in Abu Dhabi. ""Long live India,"" they said, raising their hands.
India has 56,342 cases of the novel coronavirus, rising by 3,390 over the previous day and showing no sign of abating, despite the lockdown which has battered the economy and left millions without work. At least 1,886 people have died.
Distress had also been mounting among the vast Indian diaspora unable to return home.
There have been numerous tales of hardship, both financial and emotional, from people desperate to see sick relatives, attend funerals or births, while others have simply lost their jobs and are running out of money stranded abroad.
The first round of evacuations would bring back around 200,000 people by the middle of May and then by mid-June a total of 350,000-400,00 would be flown back, the government said.
In Delhi, some 250 people got off the plane from Singapore and were screened for symptoms of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. 
They stood far apart from each other in a spotlessly clean terminal building, wearing masks and waiting to be cleared for entry. 
Srivastava said if any traveller is found symptomatic upon arrival, they will be taken to hospital while others will be placed under a 14-day quarantine in a government facility. 
There were some concerns that the influx of people from overseas could lead to a further spike in infections. 

Lav Agarwal, joint secretary in the health ministry, said the federal government had asked state authorities to make sure hotels, college hostels and empty houses that had been converted into quarantine centres for those returning be closely supervised by health workers.

(Reuters) - A white former police officer and his son were arrested on Thursday in Georgia and charged with murder in the shooting death of an unarmed black man, an incident that touched off a furor in the community and among civil rights activists nationwide.
Gregory McMichael, 64, and his son Travis, 34, were taken into custody by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and charged with aggravated assault as well as murder in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery in the town of Brunswick (NYSE:BC), the agency said in a statement. 
The Feb. 23 shooting death of Arbery, 25, as he ran unarmed through the small town was captured on video by an unnamed witness in a vehicle near the scene. The video's wide broadcast in recent days ignited outrage among activists, politicians and celebrities who saw the incident as the latest case of white perpetrators killing a black man and going unpunished.
It was not immediately clear on Thursday if the two men had retained attorneys.
A district attorney appointed to handle the high-profile case after two other prosecutors recused themselves said on Wednesday he would ask a county grand jury to decide if the two men should face charges.
The men's arrest by the GBI, one day after the agency opened an investigation into the case, appears to have sidelined any grand jury probe.
THREE SHOTS
The video footage shows Arbery jogging down a narrow two-lane road and around the McMichaels' white pickup truck, which had stopped in the right lane with its driver's door open.
As Arbery crosses back in front of the truck, a gunshot is fired. Arbery is then seen struggling with a man holding a long gun as a second man stands in the bed of the truck brandishing a revolver. Two more shots are heard before Arbery stumbles and falls face down onto the asphalt.
The GBI said it was Travis McMichael who fired the fatal round. 
According to a police report obtained by the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT), Gregory McMichael, a former Glynn County police officer and district attorney's investigator, told detectives the incident began when he spotted Arbery from his front yard ""hauling ass"" down the street.
McMichael told police that, because he suspected Arbery in a string of recent neighborhood break-ins, he and his son gave chase in the truck, with Gregory McMichael carrying a .357 Magnum revolver and Travis armed with a shotgun.
Gregory McMichael said Arbery began to ""violently attack"" his son, fighting him for the shotgun, prompting Travis to open fire. 

According to a letter obtained by the Times, the prosecutor in Brunswick argued there was not probable cause to arrest the McMichaels because they were legally carrying firearms, had a right to pursue a burglary suspect and use deadly force to protect themselves.

Dozens of men and children sat out on a long line of blankets on the ground in the town of Atareb for the iftar, when Muslims break their daily fast at sundown during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan.
Many have returned to the town from camps for the displaced since a March ceasefire halted the most recent government offensive against the rebel-held territory.
""This is the first time that we've got together since the enormous destruction that happened in the district,"" said Mohamad Jabar, 30, who attended the iftar on Thursday with his children.
""We returned recently to our homes. Even if they are destroyed or half destroyed, they are better than the camps and the crowding.""
Fears that the new coronavirus would spread quickly through camps for the displaced at the Turkish border have encouraged some to return to their homes near the frontline.
So far, no cases of the virus have been confirmed in the rebel-held northwest, where just a few hundred tests have been carried out on a population of some 4 million people. 
The site of the iftar was cleaned and sanitised by Civil Defence workers beforehand, said Abdel Malak al-Sheikh, 37, a member of the charity that organised the meal. 
Organisers encouraged the attendees to stay apart to respect social distancing rules. But most ended up sitting close together as the ate. 
""From amid the destruction, we are trying to deliver a message to the whole world that we are steadfast. From the destruction that Bashar al-Assad caused, life and hope will spring,"" Sheikh said. 
Northwestern (NYSE:NWE) Syria is the last major piece of territory held by rebels fighting President Assad. Backed by his allies Russia and Iran, Assad waged his latest offensive to recover the area earlier this year.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China should expand its stock of nuclear warheads to 1,000 soon, Global Times editor-in-chief Hu Xijin said on Friday, even as U.S. President Donald Trump repeats his call for China to join an arms control treaty.
The Global Times is published by the People’s Daily, the official newspaper of China’s ruling Communist Party. The party has been known to float ideas and guide public sentiments via the Global Times, which tends to take a nationalistic stance on issues involving other countries. 
Tensions between United States and China, already high from an ongoing trade war, have increased in recent months amid a war of words over the origins of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We love peace and promise not to use nuclear weapons first, but we need a bigger nuclear arsenal to suppress U.S. strategic ambition and impulse against China,"" Hu wrote in a Weibo (NASDAQ:WB) post.
Hu added that this stockpile should include ""at least 100 DF-41 strategic missiles"", a latest class of intercontinental missiles capable of striking continental United States, according to defense experts.
He wrote, ""Don't think that nuclear warheads are useless during peacetime. We are using them everyone, silently, to shape the attitudes of American elites towards us.""
Hu's post on Weibo - a Twitter-like social media in China - came after White House said Trump called for ""effective arms control"" that includes China and Russia during a telephone call on Thursday with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.
Trump has long sought for China to be included in a renewal of the New START nuclear arms treaty that expires in February 2021, but Beijing has steadfastly rejected such calls.
""Major powers have the foremost responsibility and obligation in the area of nuclear arms control. China has always adhered to the policy of not being the first country to use nuclear,"" said China foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying on Friday.
An internal Chinese report warns that Beijing faces a rising wave of hostility in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak that could tip relations with the United States into armed confrontation in the worst-case scenario, according to a Reuters report this week.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A wholesale market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan played a role in the outbreak of the novel coronavirus last year, as the source or possibly as an ""amplifying setting"", the World Health Organization said on Friday, calling for more research.
Chinese authorities shut down the market in January as part of efforts to halt the spread of the virus and ordered a temporary ban on trade and consumption of wildlife. 
""The market played a role in the event, that's clear. But what role we don't know, whether it was the source or amplifying setting or just a coincidence that some cases were detected in and around that market,"" said Dr Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert on food safety and zoonotic viruses that cross the species barrier from animals to humans.
It was not clear whether live animals or infected vendors or shoppers may have brought the virus into the market, he told a Geneva news briefing. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said there is ""a significant amount of evidence"" the virus came from the Wuhan laboratory, although he has also said there wasn't certainty. 
No public evidence has linked the outbreak to the lab in Wuhan and scientists have said the coronavirus appears to have developed in nature. A German intelligence report cast doubts on Pompeo's allegations, Der Spiegel reported. 
Ben Embarek did not address the accusations. 
He noted that it took researchers a year to identify camels as the source of the MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome) virus, a coronavirus that emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and spread in the Middle East, adding: ""It's not too late."" 
""What is important, what would be of great help, is to get hold of the virus before it adapted to humans, before the version we have now. Because then we would better understand how it adapted to humans, how it evolved,"" he said.
""In terms of investigations, China has most probably, most likely, all the expertise needed to do these investigations. They have lot of very qualified researchers to that,"" he said.
A common sight across Asia, wet markets traditionally sell fresh produce and live animals, such as fish, in the open air. 
Many markets worldwide that sell live animals must be better regulated and hygiene conditions improved, and some should be closed down, Ben Embarek said. ""But the vast majority can be fixed, can be better organised.""

It is often a question of controlling waste management, the movement of people and goods, and of separating live animals from animal products and from fresh goods, he said.

The pandemic has hit the country's elderly care homes hard, not least in the capital Stockholm, where staff at hospitals and nursing homes have publicly warned of a lack of protective equipment such as masks.
Visits to care homes for the elderly have been banned since April 1 under Sweden's lockdown, which has not been as stringent as in many other countries.
The preliminary investigation into the Berga care home in Solna concerns several cases of violation of the Work Environment Act, the Prosecution Authority said in a statement. 
""There is information about a high death rate among the residents, that several of the staff have been infected by COVID-19 and that basic care routines have not been followed,"" it said.
On April 29, Swedish radio Ekot reported that around a quarter of the care home's residents had died between mid-March and mid-April.
Sakarias Mardh, CEO of A&O which runs the Berga care home, told Ekot that there had been deaths from COVID-19 at Berga and that every case was tragic, but declined to comment on or confirm the death toll.
While Sweden has not had a complete lockdown, gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned, high schools and universities are teaching online and people have been told not to take unnecessary trips.

MADILL, Oklahoma (Reuters) - Sick with pneumonia, agitated and confused, Johnny Leija refused to return to his hospital room.
Moments later, with three police officers pinning him on the floor, Leija was dead at age 34.
Staff at the local hospital in tiny Madill, Oklahoma, had called the police in the early evening of March 24, 2011, for help giving Leija an injection to calm him. Security cameras captured much of the ensuing encounter.
The officers, after shooting Leija with a stun gun, follow him down a corridor, shock him again, and wrestle him to the floor. One officer then straddles Leija’s back, trying to handcuff him as the others struggle to pull back his arms. They get one handcuff on. Leija goes limp. The officers step back. Hospital staff drop to Leija’s side and begin a futile effort to resuscitate him.
The Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner’s Office determined that Leija, his lungs already compromised by pneumonia, was starved for oxygen in his struggle with the police and died from “respiratory insufficiency.”
The county sheriff and the Madill police chief defended the officers’ actions as appropriate to the situation. The cops were not charged with any wrongdoing.
Erma Aldaba, however, blamed the officers for her son’s death. “My son wasn’t a criminal, my son was sick,” she said in an interview.
So Aldaba took the only other route open to people in her situation: She sued. Her lawsuit in federal district court in Muskogee, Oklahoma, alleged that the three officers used excessive force, violating her son’s civil rights under the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects against unreasonable search and seizure.
But almost immediately, her case hit a formidable obstacle: a little-known legal doctrine called qualified immunity. This 50-year-old creation of the U.S. Supreme Court is meant to protect government employees from frivolous litigation. In recent years, however, it has become a highly effective shield in thousands of lawsuits seeking to hold cops accountable when they are accused of using excessive force.
At first, it looked like Aldaba would clear the hurdle. The judge hearing her case, and then a federal appeals court, rejected the officers’ claim of qualified immunity.
The appeals panel based its decision on a two-question test courts use to weigh police requests for immunity. The first is whether the evidence shows or could convince a jury that the officers used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The second question is whether the officers should have known they were breaking “clearly established” law – a Supreme Court coinage for a court precedent that had already found similar police actions to have been illegal.
To both questions, the court determined, the answer was yes.
Then, at the officers’ request, the Supreme Court intervened. The justices ordered the appeals court to reconsider its ruling, indicating that they disagreed with the lower court.
Back at the appeals court, Aldaba’s lawyer argued, as he had the first time around, that the cops’ treatment of Leija was “clearly established” as illegal. To support his argument, he cited earlier cases in which police were held liable for using excessive force on unarmed, mentally compromised people. Not similar enough, the court now said, so the cops had no reason to think they were breaking the law. The police got immunity. Aldaba’s case was dead.
“It makes me feel that there was a mistake, but we can’t win,” Aldaba, 60, said. “We can’t win fighting the cops.”
EFFECTIVE BARRIER
Aldaba’s lament has become an increasingly common one. Even as the proliferation of police body cameras and bystander cellphone video has turned a national spotlight on extreme police tactics, qualified immunity, under the careful stewardship of the Supreme Court, is making it easier for officers to kill or injure civilians with impunity.
The Supreme Court’s role is evident in how the federal appeals courts, which take their cue from the high court, treat qualified immunity. In an unprecedented analysis of appellate court records, Reuters found that since 2005, the courts have shown an increasing tendency to grant immunity in excessive force cases – rulings that the district courts below them must follow. The trend has accelerated in recent years. It is even more pronounced in cases like Leija’s – when civilians were unarmed in their encounters with police, and when courts concluded that the facts could convince a jury that police actually did use excessive force.
Reuters found among the cases it analyzed more than three dozen in which qualified immunity protected officers whose actions had been deemed unlawful. Outside of Dallas, Texas, five officers fired 17 shots at a bicyclist who was 100 yards away, killing him, in a case of mistaken identity. In Heber City, Utah, an officer threw to the ground an unarmed man he had pulled over for a cracked windshield, leaving the man with brain damage. In Prince George's County, Maryland, an officer shot a man in a mental health crisis who was stabbing himself and trying to slit his own throat.
The increasing frequency of such cases has prompted a growing chorus of criticism from lawyers, legal scholars, civil rights groups, politicians and even judges that qualified immunity, as applied, is unjust. Spanning the political spectrum, this broad coalition says the doctrine has become a nearly failsafe tool to let police brutality go unpunished and deny victims their constitutional rights.
The high court has indicated it is aware of the mounting criticism of its treatment of qualified immunity. After letting multiple appeals backed by the doctrine’s critics pile up, the justices are scheduled to discuss privately as soon as May 15 which, if any, of 11 such cases they could hear later this year.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, one of the court’s most liberal members, and Clarence Thomas, its most conservative, have in recent opinions sharply criticized qualified immunity and the court’s role in expanding it.
In a dissent to a 2018 ruling, Sotomayor, joined by fellow liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, wrote that the majority’s decision favoring the cops tells police that “they can shoot first and think later, and it tells the public that palpably unreasonable conduct will go unpunished.”
In that case, Kisela v. Hughes, the justices threw out a lower court’s ruling that denied immunity to a Tucson, Arizona, cop who shot a mentally ill woman four times as she walked down her driveway while holding a large kitchen knife.
A year earlier, Sotomayor in another dissent called out her fellow justices for a “disturbing trend” of favoring police. “We have not hesitated to summarily reverse courts for wrongly denying officers the protection of qualified immunity,” Sotomayor wrote, citing several recent rulings. “But we rarely intervene where courts wrongly afford officers the benefit of qualified immunity.”
Sotomayor was responding to the majority’s decision not to hear an appeal brought by Ricardo Salazar-Limon, who was unarmed when a Houston police officer shot him in the back, leaving him paralyzed. A lower court had granted the officer immunity.
The Reuters analysis supports Sotomayor's assertion that the Supreme Court has built qualified immunity into an often insurmountable police defense by intervening in cases mostly to favor the police. Over the past 15 years, the high court took up 12 appeals of qualified immunity decisions from police, but only three from plaintiffs, even though plaintiffs asked the court to review nearly as many cases as police did. The court’s acceptance rate for police appeals seeking immunity was three times its average acceptance rate for all appeals. For plaintiffs’ appeals, the acceptance rate was slightly below the court’s average.
In the cases it accepts, the court nearly always decides in favor of police. The high court has also put its thumb on the scale by repeatedly tweaking the process. It has allowed police to request immunity before all evidence has been presented. And if police are denied immunity, they can appeal immediately – an option unavailable to most other litigants, who typically must wait until after a final judgment to appeal.
“You get the impression that the officers are always supposed to win and the plaintiffs are supposed to lose,” University of Chicago law professor William Baude said. In his research, Baude has found that qualified immunity, as a doctrine, enjoys what he calls “privileged status” on the Supreme Court, which extends to cases the court decides without even hearing arguments – a relatively rare occurrence. In such cases, the court disproportionately reversed lower courts’ denials of immunity.
All nine current justices declined to be interviewed for this article. They have offered few explanations of the court’s stance on qualified immunity beyond writing in opinions that the doctrine balances individuals’ rights with the need to free officials from the time-consuming and costly burden of unnecessary litigation.
DEFINING 'CLEARLY ESTABLISHED'
The main challenge for plaintiffs in excessive force cases is to show that police behavior violated a “clearly established” precedent. The Supreme Court has continually reinforced a narrow definition of “clearly established,” requiring lower courts to accept as precedent only cases that have detailed circumstances very similar to the case they are weighing.
“We have repeatedly told courts not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality,” the court wrote in a November 2015 opinion, repeating its language from an earlier ruling. In that 2015 opinion, the justices reversed a lower court decision and granted immunity to Texas State Trooper Chadrin Mullenix, who had stopped a high-speed chase by shooting at a vehicle from an overpass, killing the driver.
Critics of qualified immunity say the high court’s guidance has created a ludicrously narrow standard. Even some judges feel constrained. In a 2018 decision, James Browning, a judge in federal district court in New Mexico, said he was ruling “with reluctance” in favor of an officer who had slammed an unarmed man to the floor in his own home while he was yelling at the police.
The force the cop used, Browning ruled, was excessive. But the officer had to be granted immunity, he said, because of subtle differences with the earlier case Browning had considered as a possible “clearly established” precedent. Those differences included the distance between the men and the officers and what the men were yelling. Even the locations of the respective incidents could be a factor, the judge noted, the earlier case having occurred in a  Target  (NYSE:TGT) parking lot.
In his ruling, Browning criticized the high court’s approach because “a court can almost always manufacture a factual distinction” between the case it is reviewing and an earlier case.
In February, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati, Ohio, granted immunity to an officer who shot and wounded a 14-year-old boy in the shoulder after the boy dropped a BB gun and raised his hands. The court rejected as a precedent a 2011 case in which an officer shot and killed a man as he began lowering a shotgun. The difference between the incidents was too great, the court determined, because the boy had first drawn the BB gun from his waistband before dropping it.
In other recent cases, courts have sided with police because of the difference between subduing a woman for walking away from an officer, and subduing a woman for refusing to end a phone call; between shooting at a dog and instead hitting a child, and shooting at a truck and hitting a passenger; and between unleashing a police dog to bite a motionless suspect in a bushy ravine, and unleashing a police dog to bite a compliant suspect in a canal in the woods.
The Supreme Court in 2009 raised the bar even higher for plaintiffs to overcome qualified immunity. In Pearson (NYSE:PSO) v. Callahan, it gave judges the option to simply ignore the question of whether a cop used excessive force and instead focus solely on whether the conduct was clearly established as unlawful.
In the decade since then, the Reuters analysis found, appeals courts have increasingly ignored the question of excessive force. In such cases, when the court declines to establish whether police used excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment, it avoids setting a clearly established precedent for future cases, even for the most egregious acts of police violence. In effect, the same conduct can repeatedly go unpunished.
The case of Khari Illidge shows this perverse dynamic at work.
One cool spring evening in 2013, sheriff’s deputies in Phenix City, Alabama, a suburb of Columbus, Georgia, responded to a trespassing call. They found Illidge wandering along a quiet, tree-lined road. The 25-year-old was naked, covered in scratches and behaving erratically.
In the encounter, the deputies shocked Illidge six times with a stun gun before he fell to the ground. As he lay face-down, one deputy shocked him 13 more times as two others struggled to handcuff his wrists, according to their testimony. They then shackled his ankles with leg irons and fastened them to his handcuffs – an extreme form of restraint, known as a hogtie, that many police departments across the country have banned.
A 385-pound officer then kneeled on Illidge’s upper back until he went limp. Illidge was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital. The autopsy report lists cardiac arrest as the cause of death.
“They treated him like an animal,” Gladis Callwood, Illidge’s mother, said. “Or maybe even worse.”
Callwood sued the police, alleging excessive force. The cops claimed qualified immunity. They said they did what was necessary to subdue an aggressive man who resisted arrest and who, according to a friend who had seen him earlier, had probably taken LSD. A toxicology report found no traces of the drug in his blood.
“You have to make split-second decisions,” Ray Smith, one of the deputies who had shocked and hogtied Illidge, told Reuters. Hesitation can be deadly, he said.
Judge W. Harold Albritton in federal district court in Montgomery, Alabama, sided with the cops. In his ruling, the judge said there was no precedent establishing that the officers’ treatment of Illidge was unlawful.
The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed – even though it had heard a case involving hogtying in Florida in 2009. In that earlier case, Donald George Lewis died after West Palm Beach cops hogtied him on the side of the road where they had found him disoriented and stumbling through traffic. But the appeals court in that earlier case granted immunity without addressing whether the force police used was excessive. As a result, the court didn’t establish a precedent that could apply in subsequent cases – including Callwood’s.
By allowing judges to consider only the question of clearly established law in excessive force cases, the Supreme Court created a closed loop in which “the case law gets frozen,” said lawyer Matt Farmer, who represented Lewis’s family.
In October 2018, the Supreme Court declined to review Callwood’s case. Her lawsuit, like Aldaba’s, was dead.
HIGH-PROFILE OUTLIERS
Police have difficult, high-risk jobs. Few would dispute that. Qualified immunity is essential, proponents say, because police need latitude to make split-second decisions in situations that could put lives, including their own, at risk.
“It is very easy to second-guess the decision making of a police officer when you are sitting at a desk,” said Chris Balch, an Atlanta-based lawyer who represents police departments in civil rights cases.
Larry James, general counsel of the National Fraternal Order of Police, said the trend in appeals courts to favor immunity reflects the high volume of meritless lawsuits civil rights lawyers file. “Plaintiffs’ lawyers sue everyone under the sun, irrespective of the facts,” he said.
Even so, as the Reuters analysis found, appellate courts have ruled in favor of plaintiffs, denying cops immunity, in 43 percent of cases in recent years. As opponents of qualified immunity point out, denial of immunity doesn’t automatically mean cops will be held liable for alleged excessive force. When such cases go to trial, juries may side with police after weighing the facts of a case. Also, local governments or their insurers, not the cops themselves, typically bear the financial burden of litigation, settlements or jury awards.
The U.S. government does not maintain comprehensive data on civilians killed or seriously injured by police. According to media organizations and police-accountability groups that compile numbers from police reports, news accounts and other sources, the number of deaths alone is about 1,000 a year.
A handful of those incidents draw national attention to police tactics – for example, the 2014 death of Eric Garner after New York City police put him in a lethal chokehold. In such high-profile cases, qualified immunity rarely comes into play. Instead, police departments, often under heavy political pressure and facing public protests, typically offer big dollar settlements to victims or their survivors. The cops may also face disciplinary action or criminal charges.
In the far more numerous incidents of alleged excessive force that don’t make national headlines, police departments are under less pressure to settle, and officers are even less likely to be prosecuted or otherwise disciplined. In those cases, federal civil rights lawsuits provide the obvious avenue for holding cops accountable.
The United States first allowed citizens to sue government officials for civil rights violations in a law passed in 1871. These so-called Section 1983 lawsuits were intended to give citizens a path to justice when state and local authorities in the post-Civil War era turned a blind eye to – or even participated in – acts of racist violence by groups like the Ku Klux Klan.
Nearly a century later, the Supreme Court introduced qualified immunity, articulating the doctrine in a 1967 ruling to limit Section 1983 lawsuits. The court reasoned that police should not face liability for enforcing the law in good faith. The court refined the doctrine in 1982 to include the “clearly established” test.
Today, after decades of Supreme Court tweaks to how excessive force cases are judged, plaintiffs’ lawyers say the deck is unfairly stacked against their clients. “Why are there so many police shootings?” said Dale Galipo, a prominent California civil rights attorney. “I would say one of the reasons is there’s no accountability, there’s no deterrent.”
Several lawyers told Reuters they decline to take cases they think may have merit in large part due to the high barrier of qualified immunity. “I have turned down dozens of police misconduct cases and have routinely referred the potential plaintiffs to qualified immunity as a major problem,” said Victor Glasberg, a civil rights lawyer in Virginia.
The American Association for Justice, the plaintiff bar’s main lobbying group and a backer of efforts to curb qualified immunity, knows that its “members would like to pursue cases where people are treated unjustly,” said Jeffrey White, the group’s senior associate general counsel. But, he added, lawyers must think carefully when “the chances of obtaining justice are tilted heavily towards defendants.”
GENTLE AND LOYAL
Johnny Leija spent his life in small towns in the dry, flat farming and oil country on both sides of the Oklahoma-Texas border, quitting school after junior high to take a series of temporary construction jobs.
He was gentle and fiercely loyal to his family, friends and relatives told Reuters. They recounted the time Leija ended up with a broken leg after sticking up for his sister in a fight with her abusive boyfriend. In his early 20s, he spent a year in Marshall County jail for marijuana possession. After that, his family said, he never indulged in anything harder than the occasional Bud Light.
Leija moved to Madill in early 2011 with his girlfriend, Olivia Flores, and the four children they were raising – one of their own and three by Flores from an earlier relationship. He soon got a job welding and painting horse trailers, but money was tight. Leija, Flores and the children were sleeping on the floor of their still-unfurnished house. In late March, when Leija started complaining about pain in his chest and torso, Flores had to pawn a radio to buy medicine.
On the morning of March 24, 2011, after Leija spent most of the night vomiting, he and Flores headed to the emergency room at Integris Marshall County Medical Center, now called AllianceHealth Madill. Details of what happened over the next 12 hours come from a review of hundreds of pages of medical, police and court records and interviews with people involved.
When first examined, Leija was agreeable and alert, but his blood oxygen levels were dangerously low. He was put on oxygen and given antibiotics through an intravenous line. He soon seemed on the mend and was admitted to a room down the hall.
Flores left midafternoon to pick up the children from school. Soon after, Leija’s breathing became labored. His blood-oxygen level plunged again. He became distressed and aggressive. The doctor on call, John Conley, prescribed over the phone an anti-anxiety pill. Leija refused it, claiming that the hospital staff was trying to poison him. “I am Superman,” he yelled. “I am God!”
He somehow cut the IV line and told a nurse that he needed to leave. Conley, again by phone, told nurses to give Leija an injection to calm him. The hospital had no security staff, so a nurse called the police to help restrain Leija for the shot. Conley arrived minutes later, finding Leija in the bathroom still insisting he had to leave the hospital.
Madill Police Officer Brandon Pickens and Marshall County Deputy Sheriffs Steve Atnip and Steve Beebe were eating dinner at La Grande, a Tex-Mex joint on a highway north of Madill, when they got the call about an unruly patient at the hospital.
They had little information when they arrived. Beebe thought Leija, dressed in a white T-shirt and pajama bottoms, was a visitor, not a patient.
According to the officers’ accounts, Leija pulled the gauze from his IV site and yelled, “This is my blood!” as it dripped on the floor.
The officers ordered Leija to his knees. He did not comply. Beebe aimed his Stinger stun gun at Leija and fired, hitting Leija in the chest.
It had little effect. Leija “hollered out, shook a bit,” a nurse later testified. Beebe, Pickens and Atnip then grabbed Leija, 5 foot 8 and 230 pounds, and pushed him against a wall, where Beebe pressed the Stinger against Leija’s back and shocked him again. The four toppled onto the lobby floor with a thud.
Pickens and Atnip were holding Leija face down and Beebe was trying to handcuff him when he grunted and stopped moving. Clear fluid poured from his mouth and pooled on the floor around his head.
Conley and staff spent 40 minutes trying to revive Leija. At 7:29 p.m., he was pronounced dead, a Stinger dart still stuck in his chest.
Marc Harrison, a forensic pathologist with the Oklahoma Chief Medical Examiner’s Office, testified in a sworn deposition that Leija’s manner of death was “natural,” but that “it would be reasonable to assume” that two shocks with a stun gun and Leija’s physical struggle with police would have “required an elevated need for oxygen.” Through the medical examiner’s office, Harrison said he stands by his opinion.
STERN DENIALS
When Aldaba’s lawsuit against the officers landed in federal court in Muskogee, Oklahoma, the officers’ lawyers quickly asked that the case be thrown out on the grounds of qualified immunity.
It was “abundantly clear” that the force used on Leija was not excessive, the police lawyers argued. Further, they said, no established precedent put the officers on notice that they would violate Leija’s rights “by attempting to subdue an individual so that medical staff could properly treat him.”
Judge Frank Seay disagreed. He noted that officers’ accounts differed from each other about the extent of the threat Leija posed and what the officers knew about his medical condition. For instance, the two sheriff deputies said Leija was “slinging blood” and had challenged them to fight, but officer Pickens did not make those claims. And while all three officers said Leija was bleeding heavily, two nurses present testified that he wasn’t.
“Leija was a hospital patient. He was not armed in any fashion. While it is alleged that he was using his blood as a weapon, there is no evidence that any blood spattered on any of the officers,” Seay said in his April 5, 2013, ruling. The case against the three officers could now move forward.
Beebe, the deputy who twice shocked Leija, said in an interview that his biggest regret about the fatal encounter was not having more details on Leija and his medical condition. “Maybe we could have done things different if we had that information,” Beebe said. “The last thing you want to do is end up with somebody dying.” He added: “I’m sad for the family. We all live in the same community.”
Beebe also serves as pastor at a Southern Baptist church in a nearby town – a role that he said has helped him understand the need to de-escalate stressful situations.
In the encounter with Leija, however, he and the other officers “did the right thing” to protect themselves and the people in the hospital, he said. “I think we need to be held accountable,” Beebe said. “But when we go out, sometimes we have to use force…. We shouldn’t have to worry about being sued every time.”
Pickens, now a firefighter in Madill, directed questions to his police superiors. City Manager James Fullingim, who was police chief at the time of Leija’s death, said immunity is important for officers to perform their jobs. “The officers absolutely did not do anything wrong,” he said.
Atnip died in a motorcycle accident in 2015. Conley, the doctor who treated Leija, declined to comment.
The police took their case to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado. That court was no less stern in denying the officers’ appeal, faulting their decision to “Tase and wrestle to the ground a hospital patient whose mental disturbance was the result of his serious and deteriorating medical condition.” Leija did not commit any crime, the court said, and he posed a threat only to himself, passively resisting the officers. “The situation the police officers faced in this case called for conflict resolution and de-escalation, not confrontation and Tasers,” the court said.
The officers then petitioned the Supreme Court to review the case. Their appeal arrived just as the justices were weighing the case of Texas State Trooper Mullenix, the cop who shot and killed a fleeing driver from an overpass.
The lower courts had denied Mullenix immunity, saying it was unclear how much of a risk the driver had posed. But on Nov. 9, 2015, the Supreme Court reversed the lower courts. Ignoring whether the force used was illegal, the justices focused on whether Mullenix’s actions had been clearly established as illegal. It concluded that none of the three car-chase cases it had previously decided were similar enough.
The same day, the justices ordered the 10th Circuit to use the Mullenix ruling as a guide in reconsidering whether qualified immunity should apply in Aldaba’s case.
Aldaba’s lawyer, Jeremy Beaver, pointed out to the appellate panel a handful of “strikingly similar” rulings from the 10th Circuit going back nearly 20 years that provided “ample warning” to the police that their actions were unlawful.
Case law since 2001, Beaver noted, required police to consider a person’s diminished mental health or capacity when determining what force to use. A 2007 case denounced the beating and Tasing of an unarmed, nonviolent person who was not fleeing. So did a similar case from 2010.
“Mr. Leija had a clearly established right to be free from Tasering and tackling while he was a hospital patient who had committed no crimes, was unarmed, was not a threat to the officers or the public, and was mentally and physically compromised,” Beaver argued in court papers.
That wasn’t enough. The revised appeals court decision, written by Judge Gregory Phillips, dismissed Beaver’s arguments because the “offered cases differ too much from this one.”
Phillips said the cases Beaver cited involved force to detain people for “non-medical” reasons and did not involve hospital personnel “standing by observing” the incident. “We have found no case presenting a similar situation,” the judge wrote. Phillips did not respond to a request for comment.
The outcome, Beaver said, highlights the painful paradox of qualified immunity. Aldaba “had to live with the fact that at every stage, every judge that reviewed the case determined that there were constitutional violations that had occurred,” he said. “Despite that, she still couldn’t have a trial.”

756,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 05:51AM ET</span>",Social distancing signs around the world show the new normal,"(Reuters) - They range from simple spray-painted circles on the ground in a Mogadishu market to bright and breezy floor stickers in a Dubai mall, which blow a kiss and urge: ""Hey there beautiful, don't forget to keep a safe distance.""
The markings that will oblige us to keep apart in busy social settings, in order to prevent transmission of the new coronavirus, are appearing on shop floors, city pavements and train or tram platforms the world over.
As people emerge from weeks of lockdown, they face an array of new measures to try and keep the virus in check and protect society's most vulnerable.
The signs mounted so far went up at speed - but look likely to become commonplace and could be in use for years. 
Dots on the ground, lines, squares within squares, love hearts and smiley faces are being used around the world. The markings need to be impactful enough to be adhered to, but also, ideally, to reassure people without making them feel cattle-driven.
""Anywhere where there are graphics at the moment, it is because people have had to react super quick and put something in place - speed has been of the essence. We are now at the point where there is a bit of breathing space,"" said Chris Girling, Head of Wayfinding at CCD Design & Ergonomics in London.
We have a hotchpotch of styles, colours, terminology, scale and placement strategies, he notes. ""This means every single time a member of the public enters a different space they are having to relearn the rules.""
There is a balance to be found, he said. ""People want to feel safe, reassured and at ease. If you can do that, they are in turn going to be more likely to shop, feel relaxed and return. The message needs to be clear and consistent ... and absorbed.""
PLEASE
Levels of politeness vary in the places where retailers, city and transport authorities have been able to afford to print special signs. 
""For your safety please stand 2 metres from other people,"" reads a floor sign in a Shell (LON:RDSa) petrol garage in Britain.
""Please practice social distancing,"" reads another alongside footprints in Santa Monica, California. 
""Stand here"" is written in English on a red circle floor sign in a grocery shop in Beirut.
""If we are using words like 'stop' and 'go' and more abrupt language, then that is more associated with hazard and prohibitive signage. This (COVID-19) is a very different type of situation and one that people have never experienced before, so it warrants a different tone of voice,"" said Girling.
""It is definitely worth trying a more friendly and inventive touch with how you talk to your customers or the general public as they are likely to be more receptive... there is even a bit of space for humour."" 
Footprints have proved popular so far, in signs from Bury in Britain to Abidjan in Ivory Coast, but as Girling points out, the best sign systems would also encourage linear movement and give a visual understanding of direction.
Asked how he would design a social distancing system, he suggested a line of tape to show a pathway, which changes colour every two metres.
""The instinct to follow a line from childhood naturally stays the same as we become adults, and you subconsciously pick up on these visual cues as you walk around environments.""

Signs related to COVID-19 should also ideally have their own distinctive colour, which will become instantly recognisable.

757,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 05:50AM ET</span>","Israel, U.S. to discuss reported Sinai peacekeeper drawdown plan: Israeli minister","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel said on Friday it would discuss with its closest ally the United States a newspaper report that the U.S.-led peacekeeping force in the Egyptian Sinai may be drawn down, calling its nearly four-decade-old presence ""important"".
U.S. Secretary of Defense Mark Esper is pushing to pull out some American troops from the international peacekeeping force it heads in the Sinai Peninsula, the Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, citing current and former U.S. officials. 
The drawdown would come as Egypt battles an Islamist insurgency in the desert peninsula, where the U.S.-led Multinational Force and Observers (MFO) has been since the early 1980s, following Egypt's peace deal with Israel in 1979. 
Asked to comment on the report in an interview with Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM, Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz said ""the international force in Sinai is important, and (the) American participation in it is important. 
""Certainly, the issue will be raised between us and the Americans,"" said Steinitz, a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet. 
The U.S. and Egyptian embassies in Israel did not immediately respond to requests for comment, nor did the MFO's office in Israel. 
According to its website, the MFO has 1,156 military personnel from the United States and 12 other countries covering an area of more than 10,000 square kilometers (3,860 square miles) in the Sinai. Some 454 of the personnel are American.
But the size of the force has decreased by over 30 percent since 2015, according to data from its website. 
Cairo sees the MFO as part of a relationship with Israel that, while unpopular with many Egyptians, has brought it billions of dollars in U.S. defence aid, sweetening the foreign-enforced demilitarisation of their sovereign Sinai territory.
For the Israelis, the MFO offers strategic reassurance, recalling that in 2013 Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi toppled an elected Islamist government hostile to its neighbour.

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - The Spanish government will decide on Friday in which regions bars, restaurants and places of worship will open under the next phase of a gradual exit from the coronavirus lockdown, although it looked likely that Madrid and Catalonia would not move forward. 
In a sign of life returning to normal, Barcelona beaches opened for a short window from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. on Friday to allow people to swim and jog. People paddled on boards and swam in the water under the supervision of police.
""This is freedom,"" said smiling swimmer Marta Torrents, speaking on the beach dressed in a wet-suit. ""To be able to go out to sea and swim - for me, this is perfect.""
Spain has been one of the worst-hit countries globally from the coronavirus pandemic, with more than 26,000 fatalities. The regions of Madrid and Catalonia, home to Barcelona, account for around half of all recorded infections.
The government will decide which regions will move to the second phase of its four-stage exit on Friday and the results will be officially published on Saturday. The country is aiming for a return to normality by end-June.
""There are two areas more severely hit by the epidemic - Madrid and Barcelona - and it is perhaps reasonable that in these two areas the exit goes at a slower pace,"" Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias said in a radio interview on Friday.
Spain is emerging from a strict lockdown now in its eighth week which has battered the economy and led to hundreds of thousands of job losses. 
The government has loosened the terms this week, with people allowed to take exercise and small businesses like hairdressers receiving clients with restrictions to allow social distancing.
Under the next stage, bars, restaurants and places of worship will be able to open with limited capacity. 

In the fourth and final phase, expected around the end of June, beaches will open for sun-bathing and restrictions on shops and restaurants will be further loosened.

759,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",China says Taiwan will fail in bid to attend key WHO meeting,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Taiwan will fail in its bid to take part in a key meeting of the World Health Organization (WHO) as its efforts are not based on concern for the health of Taiwan's people but are ""political manipulation"", China said on Friday.
Taiwan has been lobbying to attend, as an observer, this month's gathering of the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), and has won high-level support from the United States and several of its allies including Japan.
Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO, due to the objections of China, which considers the island one of its provinces, had angered Taipei's government, which says this has created a dangerous gap in the global fight against the coronavirus.
Speaking at a daily news briefing in Beijing, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party was trying to use the pandemic for its own political purposes.
""Its so-called attempts to get into the WHO and participate in the WHA are absolutely not for the health and well-being of Taiwan's people but are through-and-through political manipulation, and will not succeed,"" she said.
Both Taiwan and the United States say that WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has the power, should he so wish, to invite Taiwan to the WHA. 
But diplomatic sources in Taiwan say that in practice he is unlikely to do so if China does not approve.
Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council said late on Thursday that health was a basic human right and China was ""using politics to infringe upon health and human rights"".
The WHO should ""not be manipulated by a single country's political position"" and at this time of pandemic should protect the health and safety of all people around the world, it said.
Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help and information it needs during the pandemic, something Taiwan strongly disputes. Taiwan says it wants full and proper access to the WHO.
China says it has the right to represent Taiwan on the international stage. Taiwan says that only its democratically elected government can speak for the island's 23 million people.
Taiwan attended the World Health Assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations were warmer.
But China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, an accusation she rejects.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - As Thailand's capital cautiously reopens many restaurants shuttered over coronavirus fears, the feline ""employees"" of the Caturday Cafe are back at work.
The few dozen friendly cats typically lounge around the cafe, breaking up naptime to saunter over to human customers for snuggles and belly rubs.
The friendly furballs give some much-needed outside contact for Thais who have mostly been confined to home during weeks of semi-lockdown with most non-essential businesses closed.
    ""Earlier, we could not go out anywhere which makes us a bit stressed out. But since we can come to meet the cats, we feel more at ease and relaxed,"" said regular customer Pantip Keeseeree, who said she came as soon as she heard the cafe had reopened.
    Like other businesses across Thailand, the cafe has new rules aimed at curbing the spread of the virus. Before entering, customers must have their temperature checked and wash their hands, and once inside must wear a mask at all times.
    ""Actually, the number of customers is nothing like it used to be. Over 50% have decreased for both Thai and foreign customers,"" said cafe owner Arisa Limpanawongsanon.

761,By Reuters,"<span>May 08, 2020 05:00AM ET</span>",European lawmakers to consider tougher climate law: draft,"By Kate Abnett
(Reuters) - European Union lawmakers are considering toughening the bloc's planned climate law, with stricter near-term emission goals and a binding commitment for every member state to decarbonize by 2050, according to a draft document seen by Reuters.
Such goals are required if the world is to stick within limits scientists say are needed to avoid devastating fallout from global warming, the lead author of the document, Swedish lawmaker Jytte Guteland, said.
The European Commission, the EU's executive, proposed the law in March - weeks before the coronavirus pandemic prompted an economic crisis that the bloc has pledged to tackle with ""green"" investment.
Centred around a legally binding goal to cut EU net greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050, the law must be agreed with lawmakers and member states to take effect.
Under a draft proposal for the parliament's position on the law, each individual EU country would need to reduce its national emissions to net zero by 2050 and achieve net ""removals"" of greenhouse gases after that date. 
This is tougher than the Commission's bloc-wide 2050 target, which had raised the possibility that some of its 27 members could decarbonise later, if others did so early.
The draft also calls for the EU's 2030 climate target to be tightened to a 65% cut in emissions from 1990 levels, rather than the 50% or 55% cut being considered by the Commission.
Guteland, who guides the parliament's talks on the climate law, said the proposal fits the emissions pathway scientists say would avoid catastrophic climate change. 
""Scientists are talking about planetary limits. If we do not limit our emissions faster during the first 10 years, then we might actually go over the planetary limits,"" she told Reuters of the risk of breaching the crucial 1.5 degrees boundary.
""It is political choice whether we do it or not.""
The proposal sets the stage for difficult talks. 
The United Nations says global greenhouse gas emissions must fall by an average of 7.6% each year from now until 2030 to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) - the level that scientists say would avoid the most dire impacts of climate change.
Lawmakers will finalise their position in the coming months, before wrangling over the final law with the Commission and member states.
Of the three groups, parliament is typically the more determined advocate of tougher climate policies.
Still, the proposed 2030 target may struggle to get majority support from lawmakers and could face resistance from the Commission, which did not include a 65% target in its assessment of possible 2030 climate goals.
Making EU climate goals binding at national level could also deter countries concerned about the costs of reaching net zero, which the Commission says would require up to 290 billion euros of additional investments each year.
Poland was the only EU country to refuse to commit to the bloc-wide 2050 net zero emissions target, but the Czech Republic has called for climate aims to be dropped amid the pandemic.
On the other side, green groups had said the Commission's climate law proposal to clamp down on emissions after 2030 was too late.
Parliament's draft plan would lay out a pathway for EU emissions from 2025, measured against a ""carbon budget"" setting out how many emissions the bloc could produce without scuppering its climate commitments. 

It would also create an independent panel of climate scientists to monitor the bloc's progress. Countries not on track would receive recommendations from the Commission, and could face fines if they flout the advice.

The Guardia Civil force said it had arrested the man, described as deeply radicalized, after a joint investigation with security forces in Morocco and the United States. 
""The suspect intended to carry out a terrorist act, the details of which are unknown,"" police said in a statement on Friday.
His links to Islamic State date back at least four years, police said, though he had not displayed any outward signs of radicalization until recently. 
After Spain imposed a coronavirus lockdown on March 14, his interest in the jihadist movement increased, police said. 
Since then, the suspect made public pledges of allegiance to Islamic State and declared his hatred of the West on social media, police said.
He also made several furtive trips around the city, during which police believe he was scouting out potential targets for an attack. 
Police said he was likely to have been responding to calls from Islamic State for followers in the West to carry out attacks in the countries where they live. 
In April, security forces in the southern city of Almeria captured arrested a British rapper who was on the run after fighting for the jihadist movement in Iraq and Syria.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea lashed out at South Korea over recent military drills, while leader Kim Jong Un sent a personal message to China's Xi Jinping to congratulate him on that country's success in controlling the coronavirus, state media reported on Friday.
A North Korean military representative said on Friday that recent South Korean military drills were a grave provocation that demanded a reaction, according to a statement carried by Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
""The recent drill served as an opportunity which awakened us once again to the obvious fact that the enemies remain enemies all the time,"" the statement said. 
North Korea cited a military exercise by the Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF) Air Combat Command on Wednesday, and said the drills violated inter-Korean agreements aimed at reducing military tensions.
""Everything is now going back to the starting point before the north-south summit meeting in 2018,"" the statement said.
On Sunday, South Korea said North Korean troops fired multiple shots toward a South Korean guard post at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), which separates the two countries.
South Korean troops responded by firing warning shots, but no casualties were reported.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had said the shots fired by North Korea were likely ""accidental"".
In a separate dispatch, KCNA said Kim sent a verbal message to the Chinese president about the coronavirus, KCNA said.
""Kim Jong Un in his message extended his warm greetings to Xi Jinping and congratulated him, highly appreciating that he is seizing a chance of victory in the war against the unprecedented epidemic,"" said KCNA.
Kim wished Xi good health and the KCNA report said the relations between Pyongyang and Beijing were ""firmly consolidated.
Asked about Kim's message to Xi during a daily briefing in Beijing on Friday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said China and North Korea are friendly neighbours and in close communication on COVID-19 epidemic control. She said she had nothing to update with in response to a question on whether Xi will send a reply to Kim.
COVID-19 is the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. 

North Korea has said it has no cases of the coronavirus, but previously reinforced border checks and anti-epidemic measures.

The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) of Khalifa Haftar has been bombarding Tripoli for months as part of a year-long war to capture the city, causing four fifths of civilian deaths in the conflict this year, according to the United Nations. 
At least 131 civilians were killed or injured in the fighting in the first quarter of 2020, the U.N. has said.
However, Turkish military support for the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) has helped its forces push the LNA back from several areas in recent weeks, threatening to end Haftar's campaign in western Libya. 
The Turkish ambassador told Reuters in a message that a Grad missile had struck the High Court building next to the embassy and another landed by the Foreign Ministry. 
Italy's Foreign Ministry said on Twitter the area near around the Italian ambassador's residence was hit, causing at least two deaths. ""Italy strongly condemns yet another attack by Haftar forces,"" it said. 
Shells also landed around the city's port, where the United Nations migration agency had to abort an operation to disembark migrants who had been rescued at sea. 
The LNA's military spokesman had this week announced the start of a new air campaign, and said strikes had targeted an airbase at Misrata. 
Local authorities there said the loud blasts that occurred late on Wednesday were caused by a storage problem with old munitions. 
Pro-GNA forces have been able to reverse some of the losses they suffered last year with the help of Turkish drones and air defence systems, which stopped most air strikes by the LNA and its allies. The LNA is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia.
Wednesday's Misrata blasts came after an attack by the pro-GNA forces on al-Watiya airbase west of the capital, one of the LNA's most important strongholds in western Libya. The pro-GNA forces have also moved towards Tarhouna, another key LNA bastion. 
The U.N. Libya mission said last month that during the first quarter of 2020, at least 131 civilians were killed or injured, a rise of 45% over the last quarter of 2019 as the fighting escalated. 

It said ground fighting was the main cause of the deaths and that four fifths of them were caused by forces affiliated to the LNA.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan prepares to ease coronavirus restrictions in some parts of the country, a growing number of the country's businesses are planning to resume operations despite concerns that isolation guidelines were being lifted too early. 
After a monthlong shutdown brought economic activity to a grinding halt, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said on Friday that the government was looking at ways to bring some parts of the country out of lockdown measures as the rate of infections has slowed in several outlying regions.
""The number of new infections of the coronavirus is significantly falling,"" he told reporters. ""There are more prefectures with no new coronavirus cases, so lifting the state of emergency is within sight.""
After lockdown measures led to a record contraction of Japan's services sector last month, businesses including cafes, bars and sports clubs have been resuming operations even as the coronavirus epidemic has sapped demand.
Casual clothing chain Uniqlo reopened 48 stores in Japan on Thursday, including several large stores in Tokyo and Osaka, said its owner, Fast Retailing, while Aeon Co, the region's biggest supermarket operator, said it was reopening its Aeon Mall shopping centres.
A queue of more than 100 people snaked in front of Tokyo's famed Kinokuniya book store in the Shinjuku district when it reopened on Thursday for the first time in three weeks, local media reported, with most customers waiting to purchase the latest manual for the video game ""Animal Crossing.""
But Tokyo Disneyland operator Oriental Land on Friday said that the park, one of the country's biggest tourist attractions, would remain closed through May amid the state of emergency in the city and neighbouring Chiba Prefecture.
Japan this week extended its nationwide state of emergency but said it would reassess the situation on May 14 and possibly lift the measures earlier for some prefectures.
TOO EARLY?
So far, 27 of Japan's 47 prefectures have lifted some or all requests for residents to remain indoors as much as possible, or are planning to do so in the coming days.
About 15,500 coronavirus infections and 590 deaths have been confirmed in the country as of Friday.
Businesses were permitted to reopen in Iwate Prefecture in the country's northeast, which has yet to report any infections, but some local shop owners were wary of resuming normal operations.
""It feels like it's too early to reopen. People have done a good job of keeping infections in the prefecture at zero,"" said Mana Takahashi, owner of Clammbon cafe in Morioka City in the prefecture, who has been relying on coffee bean sales for revenue since closing the cafe's dining area in April.
""It would be unfortunate for an infection to occur just as rules are being loosened,"" she added, adding that the streets outside her shop have remained largely empty even after the shutdown request was lifted.
Across town, sports clubs and karaoke bars were opening for the first time in weeks. 
""We've had a few groups of students, and also single customers have come in so far,"" said an employee at a karaoke bar shortly after it reopened at noon on Friday, speaking on condition of anonymity as he was not permitted to speak with media. ""We're expecting our regulars back tonight.""

SATARA, India (Reuters) - An Indian train killed 14 migrant workers who had fallen asleep on the track on Friday while they were heading back to their home village after losing their jobs in a coronavirus lockdown, police said.
Tens of thousands of people have been walking home from India's big cities after being laid off because of the lockdown to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus since late March.
The driver tried to stop the freight train when he saw the workers on the tracks in the western state of Maharashtra, the railway ministry said, adding it had ordered an inquiry. 
Fourteen people were killed and five were injured, said a railway spokesman, C.H. Rakesh.
""I have just heard the sad news about labourers coming under the train, rescue work is underway,"" Railway Minister Piyush Goyal said on Twitter. 
Under the lockdown, all public transport has been suspended so migrant workers heading home often have to walk long distances to get there.
The government has extended the lockdown until May 17.
Police said the labourers worked for a steel company and were walking to their village in the neighbouring state of Madhya Pradesh. 
""They had been walking all night, they were exhausted and fell asleep on the tracks,"" a police officer said. 
Because of the lockdown, they were probably not expecting any trains to be moving, an official said. 
India's eight-week long lockdown, one of the world's most stringent, has helped contain the coronavirus officials say, but it has hit the poor hard. 
Criticism has mounted about how Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has arranged planes to bring back Indians from overseas, while leaving labourers stranded in big cities with little food or cash.
Modi said on Twitter he was anguished by the loss of lives in the train accident and all possible assistance was being provided.
""Shocked by the deaths of migrant workers hit by train. We should be ashamed of how we treat our nation-builders,"" said Rahul Gandhi, leader of the main opposition Congress party.
Over the past week, some state governments facing public pressure organised trains and buses to bring back migrant labourers. 
Many are trudging great distances in the blistering heat through fields and forests to get home.

DETROIT/SACRAMENTO, Calif. (Reuters) - Michigan and California, two U.S. manufacturing powerhouses, acted on Thursday to allow factories to reopen from coronavirus lockdowns over the next few days, as millions more Americans joined the ranks of workers left jobless by the pandemic.
Governor Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan gave the go-ahead to manufacturers in her state to restart on May 11, removing a major obstacle to North American automakers seeking to bring thousands of idled employees back to work this month.
The U.S. auto sector accounts for 6% of U.S. economic output, with more than 835,000 Americans employed in vehicle manufacturing. 
Whitmer, however, extended her stay-at-home order for two more weeks to avoid a new wave of coronavirus infections in an industrial Midwestern state hard hit by the virus and by business closures.
Whitmer had held off easing the state's lockdown, drawing protests and hampering efforts to restart vehicle assembly anywhere in the United States because key parts suppliers are based in and around Michigan's automaking hub of Detroit.
""We're not out of the woods yet, but this is an important step forward,"" the governor, a first-term Democrat, said in a statement.
Mexico is another link in the chain. If it does not allow suppliers to restart, automakers will not be able to resume most U.S. production for more than a few days, auto executives said.
The Mexican government aims to inform the public on Monday of its plans to reopen the auto industry, a senior official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In California, fellow Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom unveiled rules permitting manufacturers in his state - ranging from makers of computers, electronics and textiles to aerospace and chemical plants - to reopen as early as Friday. 
His order also gave the OK for warehouse and logistics facilities to return to work, and for retail businesses to offer curbside service.
Newsom, the first U.S. governor to halt most commercial activity in his state - on March 19 - said sufficient progress had been made in reducing California's infection rate to allow for a safe, gradual economic reopening.
Companies, however, are required to meet criteria such as physical distancing of staff, coronavirus testing for employees and workplace training on hygiene and infection control.
Newsom's move drew an enthusiastic ""Yeah!!"" on Twitter from Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) chief executive Elon Musk, though the only assembly plant for his electric car-making business is in Alameda County, one of several San Francisco Bay-area jurisdictions whose more stringent lockdown runs through May.
Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, may benefit more immediately, as its manufacturing facility is based just outside Los Angeles.
Michigan's announcement came three days after neighboring Ohio, also a key player in the auto industry, allowed manufacturers to reopen on Monday, adding to the clamor for Whitmer to follow suit. 
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, announced further steps on Thursday to permit bars, restaurants, hair salons and other personal care businesses to open this month with social-distancing limits.

DEPRESSION-ERA JOBLESSNESS
Several weeks of widespread business shutdowns meant to curb the contagion have dealt a staggering blow to the U.S. economy, casting Americans out of work in numbers unseen since the Great Depression of the 1930s and stoking pressure on politicians to lift restrictions.
The U.S. Labor Department reported on Thursday 33.5 million workers have filed first-time claims for unemployment benefits the past six weeks. Its closely-watched monthly jobs report was due out on Friday, with April's unemployment rate expected to shatter the post-World War Two record of 10.8% set in November 1982.
""I feel like the government is failing us,"" said Claudia Alejandra, who lost her job at a department store makeup counter in Orlando, Florida, on March 28 and now spends her days trying to secure unemployment benefits that should have arrived weeks ago. 
The bleak jobs figures add to a litany of gloomy reports on consumer spending, business investments, trade, housing and productivity. 
The toll on human lives has likewise been staggering. Nearly 76,000 Americans have died from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus, out of more than 1.26 million known to be infected, according to a Reuters tally.
Michigan, Ohio and California were among dozens of U.S. states moving to ease constraints on social and business life, despite a lack of vastly expanded diagnostic testing and other safeguards called for under White House guidelines issued in April.
GUIDELINES SHELVED
News surfaced on Thursday the White House has shelved a more recent set of guidelines prepared by U.S. health officials to help states determine the safest ways to reopen mass transit, restaurants, daycare centers and other public places.
The 17-page document prepared by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was rejected because it gave ""overly prescriptive"" guidance, a member of the White House coronavirus task force said, confirming a report by the Associated Press.
The CDC did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
But Dr. Deborah Brix, a task force coordinator, later told CNN: ""No one has stopped those guidelines. We're still in editing.""
Public health experts warn that reopening prematurely risks unleashing new outbreaks. They have also raised concerns a state-by-state hodgepodge of differing policies confuses the public and undermines social distancing generally. 
In New York and New Jersey, the country's two hardest-hit states, bars and retail businesses deemed non-essential remain closed, and restaurants are limited to takeout and delivery business. In Georgia and Texas, most retail and dine-in restaurants are open, albeit with restrictions on how many people can be served and how close tables may be to one another.
Trump, who had staked his November re-election bid to the strength of the U.S. economy before the pandemic, has continued to press for an escalation of commerce, acknowledging - as predicted by researchers - it may cost lives.
Yet, it remains to be seen how many consumers will venture back into restaurants and shops in the midst of a pandemic.
In one indication of public wariness, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank in Atlanta, Raphael Bostic, told reporters on Thursday preliminary cellphone tracking data showed that ""movement has not gone up appreciably"" among consumers.
""Whether having an open economic policy is going to translate into economic activity - we are going to learn this in the next couple of weeks,"" he said.

DHAKA (Reuters) - The Bangladesh navy has rescued around 280 Rohingya Muslims from the Bay of Bengal, towing their stranded boat to an island where they will be quarantined as a precaution against the coronavirus, coast guard and naval officials said on Friday. 
The rickety wooden boat was spotted early on Thursday in Bangladeshi waters, and taken to Bhasan Char, a low-lying island off the southern coast, where the government has built housing and cyclone shelters.
""They were starving and we have given them food and water,"" one naval officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""The plan is to keep them in home quarantine for 14 days. Later the government will decide.""
The navy and coast guard are on alert for other boats in Bangladeshi waters, unable to find their course as the seas turn rougher due to a change in season. 
Reuters telephone calls to government officials for comment were unanswered.
Back in February, Bangladesh appeared to be backing off plans to settle Rohingya refugees on Bhasan Char, having come under fierce criticism from the United Nations and aid agencies.
But the subsequent coronavirus scare appears to have persuaded Bangladesh authorities to at least use the facilities on the island for quarantining rescued Rohingya boat people.
Last weekend, 29 Rohingya found on another vessel adrift at sea were also taken to the island, which now has electric lighting and cell phone towers. 
Another boat that landed on the coast of Bangladesh in mid-April was packed with hundreds of starving and emaciated Rohingya. Survivors said several dozen died on board during weeks at sea.
More than one million Rohingya live in sprawling refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, most having arrived from Myanmar in late 2017 after fleeing a military crackdown that the U.N said was conducted with genocidal intent. The army denies genocide and says it was carrying out a legitimate campaign against insurgents who attacked police posts.
Any outbreak of coronavirus in the camps, where people live in cramped, squalid conditions, would be a nightmare for aid agencies and the Bangladesh authorities. 
For years, Rohingya, either wanting to escape persecution in Myanmar or the poverty of camps in Bangladesh, have made the perilous sea journey south in the hope of reaching Thailand or Malaysia.
In 2015, hundreds of Rohingya died after a crackdown in Thailand led smugglers to abandon their human cargo at sea. 
The United Nations has urged authorities to let the boats land, but Southeast Asian governments have tightened their borders to keep out the new coronavirus. And even in mostly-Muslim Malaysia, sympathy for the Rohingya refugees appears to have eroded.
Among the targets of anti-Rohingya vitriol was Zafar Ahmad Abdul Ghani, a Rohingya activist who had to deactivate his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account after it was flooded with angry comments and death threats sparked by allegations that he had demanded Malaysian citizenship for Rohingya.
Malaysia last month turned away a boat carrying 200 suspected Rohingya and has also arrested some people believed to be Rohingya for suspected trafficking of illegal migrants. It has not said whether it would allow more Rohingya to enter the country.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday abruptly asked a judge to drop criminal charges against Donald Trump's former national security adviser Michael Flynn following mounting pressure from the Republican president and his political allies on the right.
The move drew furious criticism from congressional Democrats and others who accused the department and Attorney General William Barr of politicizing the U.S. criminal justice system by bending to Trump's wishes and improperly protecting his friends and associates in criminal cases.
Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general who served as an adviser to Trump during the 2016 campaign, had been seeking to withdraw his 2017 guilty plea in which he admitted to lying to the FBI about his interactions with Russia's U.S. ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the weeks before Trump took office.
The Justice Department filed a motion to dismiss the charges with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who has presided over the case and has a reputation for fierce independence. Judges generally grant such motions, but Sullivan could demand answers from the department about its reversal or even deny the motion and sentence Flynn, a less likely scenario.
Sullivan at a 2018 hearing expressed ""disgust"" and ""disdain"" toward Flynn's criminal offense, saying: ""Arguably, you sold your country out.""
Trump, who had publicly attacked the case against Flynn and has frequently castigated the FBI, said he was ""very happy"" for his former aide, adding: ""Yes, he was a great warrior, and he still is a great warrior. Now in my book he's an even greater warrior."" Trump said in March he was considering a full pardon and accused the FBI and Justice Department of having ""destroyed"" Flynn's life and that of his family.
Flynn was one of several former Trump aides charged under former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that detailed Moscow's interference in the 2016 U.S. election to boost Trump's candidacy and contacts between Trump's campaign and Russia. Trump's longtime friend and adviser Roger Stone and his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort both were convicted and sentenced to multi-year prison terms.
The Justice Department said in its filing it was no longer persuaded that the FBI's Jan. 24, 2017 Flynn interview that underpinned the charges was conducted with a ""legitimate investigative basis"" and did not think his statements were ""material even if untrue.""
""A crime has not been established here. They did not have the basis for a counterintelligence investigation against Flynn at that stage,"" Barr said in a CBS interview. Asked about the fact that Flynn lied to investigators, Barr said: ""Well, people sometimes plead to things that turn out not to be crimes.""
In a filing, Flynn's lawyers agreed with the department's motion to dismiss the charges.
It marked the latest instance of the department under Barr, a Trump political loyalist, changing course under public pressure from the president to go light on one of his allies. In February, Barr and other senior department officials abandoned a tough sentencing recommendation by their own career prosecutors in Stone's case after Trump publicly lashed out at the prosecution team. The prosecutors quit the case in protest.
Shortly before the Flynn motion was filed on Thursday, career prosecutor Brandon Van Grack withdrew from the case and other related legal matters. He remains a Justice Department employee, a department spokeswoman said.
'WITHOUT PRECEDENT'
Trump critics have accused him of becoming emboldened after his February acquittal in his Senate impeachment trial and interfering in cases involving people close to him.
""Flynn PLEADED GUILTY to lying to investigators. The evidence against him is overwhelming,"" Jerrold Nadler, the Democratic chairman of the House of Representatives Judiciary Committee, wrote on Twitter. ""The decision to overrule the special counsel is without precedent and warrants an immediate explanation.""
""We have to be deeply skeptical that this is anything other than a further capturing of our criminal justice system for the benefit of the president,"" added Noah Bookbinder, a former prosecutor who now heads the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics advocacy group.
Seth Waxman, another former prosecutor now in private practice, added, ""To have the case dismissed like this raises a lot of uncertainty for the institution of the Department of Justice.""
Barr was appointed by Trump long after Flynn was charged. Barr three months ago named Jeffrey Jensen, a U.S. attorney in Missouri, to review the case. Jensen said he ""concluded the proper and just course was to dismiss the case.""
Trump fired Flynn after only 24 days on the job when it emerged that Flynn had misled Vice President Mike Pence and the FBI about his Kislyak dealings. 
According to the indictment, Flynn in December 2016 - after Trump won the election but before he took office - discussed U.S. sanctions against Russia with Kislyak and asked him to help delay a U.N. vote seen as damaging to Israel, a move contrary to then-President Barack Obama's policies.
Flynn was supposed to cooperate with prosecutors under his plea deal. But he switched lawyers and said prosecutors had tricked him into lying about his Kislyak conversations.
Pressure from Trump allies to drop the charges intensified last week after partially redacted documents turned over to Flynn's defense showed more about the FBI's thinking before interviewing Flynn.
An unidentified FBI agent wrote: ""What is our goal? Truth/admission or to get him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired?""
Flynn's allies have argued those documents show the FBI was out to get him. 
""The government has concluded that the interview of Mr. Flynn was untethered to, and unjustified by, the FBI's counterintelligence investigation into Mr. Flynn - a no longer justifiably predicated investigation,"" the Justice Department wrote in Thursday's filing.
Prosecutors asked the judge in January to sentence Flynn to up to six months in prison, saying he ""has not learned his lesson"" and acts like ""the law does not apply"" to him.
His sentencing has been deferred several times. 

Flynn previously headed the Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency but he was forced out in 2014 in part due to his management style and opinions on how to combat Islamist militancy. He joined Trump's 2016 campaign and at the Republican National Convention led chants of ""Lock her up,"" referring to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

The Empowerment Removal Committee said it confiscated property from Bashir's brother-in-law, nieces, nephews, and even a former defence minister, who was a close ally of the former president. It transferred the ownership of the several plots, which totalled around 92,000 square meters (990,000 square feet) in size, to the finance ministry.
Separately, it also dissolved the boards of the Khartoum International Airport Company and the Sudan Airports Holding Company over corruption accusations. 
The committee was charged by the attorney general with dismantling the system built by Bashir after his ouster in April last year. It oversees investigations into crimes involving public funds and corruption by the former president and members of his extended family and old regime.
Bashir, who has been jailed in Khartoum since he was toppled following mass protests against his 30-year rule, is wanted by the International Criminal Court for alleged war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity in the Darfur region.
A Sudanese court handed Bashir a first, two-year sentence in December on corruption charges. He also faces trials and investigations over the killing of protesters and his role in the 1989 coup that brought him to power.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Thursday authorized deployment of armed forces to fight destruction of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, giving them authority over environmental agencies in the region as military influence in the government grows.
Environmental advocates fiercely criticized the order, saying that environmental agencies are the one with the necessary expertise.
Last year, Bolsonaro waited until August to send troops into the Amazon, following international outcry over a wave of fires in the rainforest, which traps vast amounts of greenhouse gases that cause climate change.
Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon hit an 11-year high in 2019, and rose another 51% through March this year. 
The order, unlike last year, gives the military authority to ""coordinate"" activities of agencies such as environmental enforcer Ibama and parks department ICMBio. 
Suely Araujo, who headed Ibama until early 2019 and now is an adviser to advocacy group Climate Observatory, said it was ""unacceptable"" to transfer power over environmental operations in the Amazon to the military.
""The military can help in certain situations, but in relation to environmental agencies, they should be consulted and not subordinated,"" Araujo said. ""It's the environmental agencies that have expertise in this area, who know how to carry out operational planning and strategy.""
Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper, has appointed a slew of current and former military officers as government ministers since taking office in 2019. This year, he increased to seven the number of military men in his 20-member cabinet, not including retired general and Vice President Hamilton Mourao.
Araujo said putting the armed forces in charge of Amazon enforcement operations raised the question of whether Ibama would have to ask the military's permission to destroy equipment used to commit crimes such as illegal logging inside indigenous reserves or other protected areas.
Bolsonaro has repeatedly said the government should not destroy this type of machinery, but Ibama agents have not halted the practice, long considered the only way to avoid a repeat of environmental crimes.
Ibama and the Environment Ministry did not respond to requests for comment.
The military authorization is effective from May 11 to June 10, but can be extended in 30- day increments, as Bolsonaro did once last year, for 60 days in total.

Vice President Mourao said last week that the government planned to send in the military as part of a plan to establish bases in the Amazon to fight deforestation.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada and the country's 10 provinces will boost pay for essential workers such as employees in seniors' residences, which are linked to 80% of coronavirus deaths, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday.
""If you're risking your health to keep this country moving and you're making minimum wage, you deserve a raise,"" he told a daily briefing.
The total number of coronavirus-related deaths rose by just over 4% to 4,280 from 4,111 on Wednesday, official data showed, further evidence the outbreak has peaked. The number of positive diagnoses edged up to 63,895 from 62,458.
Quebec, the province hardest hit by the coronavirus, has unveiled plans to gradually restart its economy but on Thursday pushed back for the second time the date when businesses can reopen in Montreal, Canada's second biggest city.
Premier Francois Legault cited shortages of personnel in hospitals and said Quebec would offer higher pay to part-time medical workers. Montreal firms can now only open on May 25, not May 11 as originally planned.
""Montreal is fragile - the rest of Quebec is a paradise. That's how it is, they are two completely different worlds,"" said Quebec's chief public health office Horacio Arruda.
Canada's military is increasing its support in Quebec and aims to have more than 1,350 members in 25 different homes in coming days, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told reporters.
Trudeau made his announcement a day before Statistics Canada releases unemployment data for April. Analysts say they expect around 4 million people to have lost their jobs after a record 1 million were thrown out of work in March.
 Manulife Financial  (NYSE:MFC) Corp's (TO:MFC) chief executive Roy Gori cautioned against reopening economies too soon.
""Subsequent pandemic waves could create greater ... devastation than we've already seen,"" he said.
Under the deal with the provinces, Ottawa will contribute C$3 billion ($2.1 billion), representing 75% percent of the total cost of the increased wages, the government said in a statement.
The provinces will be responsible for determining who is essential and how much they receive.
Ontario, Canada's most populous province, will slowly begin resuming elective and non-essential surgeries, Premier Doug Ford announced, starting with the most urgent procedures such as cancer and cardiac surgeries.

The Pacific province of British Columbia said it would unveil a plan to handle 30,000 non-urgent surgeries that have been postponed. This involves adding new capacity and hiring and training staff.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Queen Elizabeth will give a televised message to her nation on Friday to mark the 75th anniversary of VE Day, as the coronavirus outbreak overshadows nationwide celebrations to commemorate the end of World War Two in Europe.
Plans for extensive events to herald the anniversary of Victory in Europe Day, when allied forces accepted the unconditional surrender of Nazi Germany, were scaled back in March after the government banned social gatherings to curb the coronavirus.
That meant a procession by veterans through the capital and other events involving crowds were scrapped. 
However, Royal Air Force jets will still fly over the four capitals of the United Kingdom and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will deliver a message to mark the occasion, a holiday in Britain, and speak to a veteran via a video call.
""Today we must celebrate their achievement, and we remember their sacrifice,"" said Johnson, who will also recite a recently discovered poem called ""V Day"" by World War One poet Edmund Blunden.
""We are a free people because of everything our veterans did -  we offer our gratitude, our heartfelt thanks and our solemn pledge: you will always be remembered.""
The 94-year-old queen's address will be particularly symbolic, coming exactly 75 years after her father George VI gave a victory speech over the radio to the nation.
Elizabeth, a teenager when the war broke out, learned to drive military trucks and to be a mechanic while serving in the women's Auxiliary Territorial Service, and she was in Buckingham Palace when it was bombed in September 1940.
Since becoming queen 68 years ago, Elizabeth has rarely made broadcasts to the nation except her annual Christmas Day message, but her VE Day speech will be the third such address since the coronavirus shut down much of Britain in March.
Last month, she invoked the spirit shown during World War Two, calling for the public to show the same resolve and echoing the words of the famous song “We’ll Meet Again” by Vera Lynn which became a symbol of hope for Britons during the conflict.
As part of Friday's celebrations, after the queen's address is aired at 2000 GMT, Britons are being encouraged to open their front doors and join in a nationwide singalong of Lynn's song.
The commemorative events will start hours earlier with a two-minute silence at 1000 GMT led by the queen's son and heir, Prince Charles, and at 1400 GMT, extracts from the victory speech of wartime leader Winston Churchill will be broadcast.
Before the lockdown, street parties were due to be held across the country, and people are now being encouraged to decorate their houses and throw a 1940s-themed afternoon tea in their own homes.
Welsh opera singer Katherine Jenkins will give a solo performance at London's Royal Albert Hall, in what will be the first concert behind closed doors in its 150 year history.

""As we stay home to protect the NHS (National Health Service) and save lives, I know the British people will mark this historic occasion in new ways to show our deepest gratitude and respect for those that gave so much to bring peace, freedom and prosperity to Europe,"" Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said.

(Reuters) - With the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season fast approaching, U.S. officials on Thursday said they were readying more buses, hotel rooms and shelter space for social distancing to reduce the spread of the novel coronavirus during potential evacuations.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a telephone briefing that it anticipated a higher-than-average number of storms during the U.S. storm season beginning on June 1. It urged states and cities to step up their preparations.
""COVID will make it a little more difficult,"" FEMA Administrator Pete Gaynor said, referring to the disease caused by the virus. ""We're asking local leaders to think about how they will manage evacuating and shelter. You're going to need extra space.""
Last year, there were about 15 hurricane-related deaths in the United States, and at least 70 in the Bahamas, where Hurricane Dorian caused billions of dollars in damage.
COVID-19 has killed more than 73,000 people in the United States in the past two months.
In partnership with the American Red Cross, FEMA said it was preparing to house more evacuees in hotel rooms where families can stay, instead of packing them into shelters. They are also working to provide more buses to transport evacuees to avoid tight conditions.
An official estimate on the number of storms during the 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, which runs through Nov. 30, is expected to be released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration on May 21.
But several forecasters see a more active season than average, with 18 named tropical storms and eight hurricanes. 
Last year there were 12 named storms of which, seven strengthened into hurricanes, including two major ones, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The most deadly storm was Dorian, which ravaged the Bahamas, killed scores and left whole communities obliterated.
Gaynor said FEMA had more money than ever going into the hurricane season, with $6 billion devoted to federal response to the pandemic that officials could on draw on, as well as $80 billion remaining in disaster relief funds.
Brad Kieserman, vice president for disaster operations and logistics at the American Red Cross, said his organization had reserved more than 20,000 overnight stays at thousands of hotels.
""I can't reinforce enough: our goal collectively is to keep people safe,"" he said.
FEMA is also working to provide more face masks and other protective gear to help states fight COVID-19, as many hospitals and other U.S. facilities struggle to maintain enough masks and protective gear.

FEMA is also working with states to maximize each state's ability to test for the virus, Gaynor said, but each state must decide how many people get tested.

McConnell said the bipartisan bill introduced by Republican Senator Marco Rubio would urge President Donald Trump ""to use targeted sanctions against those responsible for the repression.” A person familiar with the matter, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a vote could come as soon as next week but might still be delayed.
The latest U.S. move comes amid steadily worsening relations between the Trump administration and Beijing over the global COVID-19 pandemic, which Washington has blamed on China's lack of transparency about the initial outbreak there.
""I expect the Senate will soon look to pass Senator Rubio’s Uyghur Human Rights Policy Act,"" McConnell, the senior Republican in Congress, said in a speech to the Senate. 
Rubio's office said it hoped the bill could be passed by unanimous consent soon, but could not say when this might happen. McConnell's office would not elaborate on what he meant by ""soon.""
The Senate ended this week's session on Thursday and does not reconvene until Monday. Under unanimous consent, which is designed to expedite Senate proceedings, an action is approved provided no senator objects. 
The United Nations estimates that more than a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps in China's Xinjiang region over recent years as part of a wide-reaching campaign by Chinese officials to stamp out what they characterize as terrorism.
In addition to the Uighurs, the bill covers other Muslim minority groups in China. 
China has condemned moves to pass legislation in support of the Uighurs as malicious attacks and a serious interference in its internal affairs that would affect bilateral cooperation.
In November, the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill calling for sanctions against senior Chinese officials responsible for the Xinjiang crackdown and specifically named the region's Communist Party Secretary Chen Quanguo, who, as a politburo member, is in the upper echelons of China's leadership.
Senate approval of the Uighur measure - which would bring it a step closer to Trump's desk - would be expected to send it back to the House for a final vote there to reconcile any differences, according to the person familiar with the matter.

China has consistently denied any mistreatment of Uighurs and says the camps are providing vocational training. It has warned of retaliation ""in proportion"" if Chen were targeted.

KIEV (Reuters) - Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president of Georgia, was appointed on Thursday to a senior role at an advisory body on reforms chaired by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy.
The move marks another political comeback for one of the post-Soviet world's most recognisable politicians, although it was not immediately clear how much influence Saakashvili would be able to exert over Zelenskiy's administration.
He joins as Ukraine faces a recession caused by a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic, and the government is trying to secure aid from the International Monetary Fund that is contingent on Kiev's reform performance.
According to a decree published by Zelenskiy's office, Saakashvili will head an executive committee at the National Reform Council.
""Several bottles of excellent Georgian wine from my village broke through the lockdown and reached me today. In principle, today there is something to celebrate,"" Saakashvili wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
The former Georgian president had been sounded out for the post of deputy prime minister in April, but that move petered out after he held talks with lawmakers in Zelenskiy's party who would have needed to confirm his appointment. 
Saakashvili also served for a brief but turbulent spell under Zelenskiy's predecessor, Petro Poroshenko, and became an outspoken critic of Poroshenko's government. 
The council was set up by Poroshenko in August 2014 to drive reforms but it has not met since Zelenskiy's election last year.
Former Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk, who served under Zelenskiy, said the council had become a decorative institution and the significance of Saakashvili's appointment would depend on whether the body would be given more heft.
The role in the council could bring Saakashvili closer to Zelenskiy and also allow him to speak his mind, Honcharuk said. 
""In the national council, he is closer to the president. Moreover, as the deputy prime minister, Saakashvili would not have been able to criticise the prime minister. Now it will be much easier for him to do this,"" Honcharuk told Reuters.
RAN SOUTHERN ODESSA REGION
    Under Poroshenko, Saakashvili was brought in to run the southern Odessa region of Ukraine in 2015, based on his track record of fighting corruption as president of Georgia after the 2003 Rose Revolution.
    But he resigned a year later, accusing Poroshenko of corruption, which Poroshenko denied.
The Ukrainian authorities stripped Saakashvili of his citizenship when he was abroad, but he barged his way through a checkpoint at the Polish border to get back into Ukraine in September 2017. He was deported five months later.
Saakashvili returned last year after Zelenskiy restored his citizenship in one of his first official acts as president.
News of Saakashvili's prospective appointment as deputy prime minister drew an angry reaction from Georgia's current government, which said it would withdraw its ambassador to Kiev for consultations if it went ahead.
A Georgian court sentenced Saakashvili in absentia to six years in prison in June 2018 for abuse of power and seeking to cover up evidence about the 2005 beating of an opposition member of parliament when he was president. 
Saakashvili, who has denied all charges against him, was sentenced to a separate three years in prison in January 2018 after he was convicted of seeking to cover up evidence about the murder of a Georgian banker.

His supporters said the verdict was politically motivated,

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate failed on Thursday to override President Donald Trump's veto of a resolution that would have reined in his ability to wage war against Iran by requiring him to obtain congressional authorization for military action.
The vote was 49-44 in favor of the resolution, but that fell short of the two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, needed to override a veto in the 100-member Senate. 
The resolution, led by Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, had passed the Republican-led Senate and Democratic-led House of Representatives earlier this year with support from Democrats and Republicans despite Trump's opposition.
Trump vetoed it on Wednesday, calling it ""very insulting"" and accusing Democrats of pursuing the matter for political reasons, although the measure was introduced by some of Trump's fellow Republicans, as well as Democrats.
Kaine responded by saying that Congress is doing its job by trying to assert its authority to weigh in on the use of military force.
""It is not a partisan effort. It was bipartisan from the very beginning,"" Kaine told reporters on a conference call before the vote.
""It was introduced to stop a rush to an unnecessary war,"" he said.
Trump also contended that, as commander in chief he needed to retain broad authority for military action against Iran. Trump withdrew the United States in 2018 from the international nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic reached under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, and has been waging a ""maximum pressure"" campaign against the Tehran government.
The war powers resolution was introduced weeks after Trump ordered a strike in January that killed top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad's airport. The strike in Iraq raised fears of renewed conflict in the Middle East and frustrated members of Congress from both parties who said they were not sufficiently briefed on the decision.
It was the seventh veto of Trump's three-year-long presidency. None has been overridden. Trump's fellow Republicans, who hold a 53 to 47-seat majority in the Senate, rarely break with the president.
The measure would require Trump to remove U.S. troops engaged in hostilities against Iran unless Congress declares war or passes a specific authorization for the use of military force.

It was the latest in a series of recent efforts by lawmakers from both parties - during Obama's presidency as well as under Trump - to wrest back Congress' constitutional right to declare war.

Venezuelan authorities this week arrested more than a dozen people, including Americans who work for the company Silvercorp USA, as part of a bungled incursion that has served as a public relations victory for Maduro's struggling government.
The two captured Americans appeared on state television in Venezuela on Wednesday and Thursday, saying that they had been tasked by Silvercorp with taking control of the airport in Caracas in order to fly out Maduro. Both will be tried in Venezuela's civilian courts, Maduro said.
The document deals a blow to the credibility of opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has vehemently denied any links to Silvercorp or involvement in the attempt to remove Maduro by force. 
Guaido, the president of the opposition-held National Assembly, argues that Maduro is usurping power after rigging a 2018 election and is recognized by dozens of countries as Venezuela's rightful leader.
The plan described in the 42-page document offers minute tactical details ranging from which land mines to deploy and what riot gear to use, but offers no explanation of how a small group of commandos could overpower hundreds of thousands of security forces who remain loyal to the ruling Socialist Party.
On Thursday, state television aired a video with captured American Airan Berry, who said the objectives of the mission were to control specific targets such as intelligence service Sebin and military intelligence group DGCIM and to ""get"" Maduro. 
The document published by the Washington Post said, ""Service Provider Group will advise and assist Partner Group in Planning and executing and operation to capture/detain/remove Nicolas Maduro (heretoafter ""Primary Objective""), remove the current Regime, and install the recognized Venezuelan President Juan Guaido.""
Reuters was unable to immediately confirm the authenticity of the document https://context-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/6241a047-6222-4269-8c50-2c9e3c7c9cf5/note/d836cf76-031f-4978-a4da-18a081752b94.
The Washington Post said the general services agreement, signed by Juan Guaido, had been provided by Silvercorp CEO Jordan Goudreau, who has publicly described leading the operation. It said the detailed attachment had been provided by Venezuelan opposition officials.
Guaido's press team did not respond to a request for comment.
Guaido advisor Juan Rendon, whose signature also appears on the document, told CNN that he signed an ""exploratory agreement"" with Silvercorp but that it was never completed. He said Silvercorp had led a ""botched suicide"" mission without Guaido's support.
Reuters could not immediately reach Rendon for comment.
The document was also signed by opposition legislator Sergio Vergara and Goudreau.
Reuters was unable to obtain comment from Goudreau, whose voice mail box was not accepting messages on Thursday.
Vergara did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Two main opposition parties, First Justice and Popular Will - which Guaido is affiliated with - on Thursday said in a statement that ""the democratic forces do not promote or finance guerrillas, outbreaks of violence or paramilitary groups,"" reiterating calls for a transition government. 
The logos of six other parties, including Democratic Action and A New Era, which have significant representation in the National Assembly, appear on the document.

Moore-Gilbert is forced to wear a blindfold anytime she is taken out of the cell, Khandan told CHRI.
Iran has stepped up detentions of foreign and dual nationals amid a protracted standoff with Western powers, after the United States withdrew from an international agreement to curb Iranian nuclear activities and reimposed sanctions on Tehran in 2018.
Separately, journalist and film maker Mohammad Nourizad attempted suicide in a prison in Mashhad, his wife Fatemeh Maleki said in an interview with BBC Persian on May 2.

MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spain weighed up further steps on Thursday to bring life back to normal as the coronavirus epidemic ebbed, but the capital Madrid and the city of Barcelona could remain under tight restrictions for the time being.
Both cities and their surroundings have registered the highest number of coronavirus deaths and infections in Spain, one of the countries worst hit by the global pandemic.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's government is anxious to get the country up and running again without igniting a second wave of infections as the economy reels and Spaniards gradually emerge from nearly eight weeks under lockdown.
Parliament voted on Wednesday night to extend a state of emergency for two more weeks from Sunday. This gives the government power to control people's movements as it relaxes the lockdown, which succeeded in curbing the outbreak.
""If the security measures are complied with and the safety distances respected, I think it's fantastic. I think it was about time,"" said Charo Nunez, a pharmacy worker in Madrid.
The Health Ministry gave Spain's coronavirus death toll for the past 24 hours as 213 on Thursday, down from 244 the previous day and far below peaks of nearly 1,000 in early April. 
MADRID AWAITS DECISION
The government's phase-out plan has several stages in which restrictions are progressively eased, such as the opening of bars or stores. 
Each region must apply to enter a new phase if it considers it meets hospital capacity requirements, among other conditions.
Catalonia's regional government proposed on Wednesday that the Barcelona metropolitan area would not be included in Phase 1, which starts on Monday after a preparatory Phase 0, saying there is a moderate to high risk of a new wave.
Attention is now focused on Madrid, the centre of the outbreak in Spain, which is still registering high numbers of new cases.
Madrid's top public-health official, Yolanda Fuentes, resigned on Thursday evening after the region submitted a request to the Health Ministry for it to move on to Phase 1.
Fuentes opposed progressing to the next phase and wanted Madrid to remain in the initial phase, newswire Europa Press reported, citing sources close to the regional health authority.
The authority declined to comment on the reasons behind her resignation, while Fuentes could not be reached. 
At Madrid's storied 19th century cafe El Espejo on the Recoletos boulevard, staff were spacing out tables and disinfecting equipment on Thursday in the hope that restrictions would be lifted sooner rather than later.
Cafe owner Sergio Munguira said the plan was still to reopen at noon on Monday, ""unless they tell us differently"", with staff wearing gloves and masks and clients using QR codes to call up the menu on smartphones without having to touch the list.
The rest of Spain's regions have also asked to move to Phase 1 and are expected to make the transition smoothly.
The government's plan has four phases and aims to have the country back to normal by the end of June, with sufficient hospital capacity to combat potential outbreaks.
Small businesses such as hairdressers started to open this week with restrictions while Spaniards are now allowed out of their houses for exercise.

On Thursday, Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) started to reopen some of its smaller stores to be visited by appointment as part of a gradual reopening of its store network.

KABUL/HERAT, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers trying to cross into Iran this month by forcing them into a raging mountain torrent at gunpoint, according to two Afghan lawmakers investigating the deaths.
The incident has triggered a diplomatic crisis between the neighbours, who share trade, economic and cultural ties. Iran has denied that such an event took place on its soil.
Afghan authorities said on Thursday they had recovered 12 bodies in the past two days from the Harirud River, which forms much of the northern, mountainous section of Afghanistan's border with Iran, taking the confirmed death toll to 17.
Afghan officials and survivors say the incident took place on May 1.
Habiburrahman Pidram, a lawmaker from the westerly Herat province who spoke with survivors, said a group of 57 men trying to enter Iran from Herat had been detained by Iranian border guards.
""These workers were kept in custody by Iranian forces and, after 24 hours, the Afghan workers were brought to the bank of the river, beaten and ordered to jump in the river to go back to Afghanistan,"" he said.
Those who could swim then jumped into the deep, fast-flowing mountain torrent, while the others were beaten up and threatened with being shot before jumping or being pushed in, said Pidram, part of a 16-strong team appointed to investigate by President Ashraf Ghani's government.
""Of 57 workers who were forced into the river by Iranian security forces, only 12 managed to survive,"" Pidram said, meaning 45 must have died. Five bodies were pulled out by a shepherd, downriver in Turkmenistan, to the north, he added. 
Lawmaker Abdul Satar Hussaini, who is also investigating the incident, said some of the dead workers had come from his province, Farah, which adjoins Herat. 
2.5 MILLION MIGRANTS
Abdul Ghani Noori, the governor of Herat's Gulran district, opposite the Iranian bank where the incident is alleged to have taken place, said 17 bodies had been found so far.
He said preliminary investigations had shown that the migrants had been forced into the river at gunpoint in an area called Zulfiqar on the Iranian side.
On May 2, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil.
""Border guards of the Islamic Republic of Iran denied the occurrence of any events related to this on the soil of our country,"" he said.
The Iranian embassy and consular office in Afghanistan said on Thursday that they could not add to the ministry's statement, and the ministry could not be reached for further comment.
Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, mostly from Herat, are in Iran after failing to find work in war-ravaged Afghanistan.
U.N. officials say Iran's coronavirus epidemic has caused more than 150,000 Afghans to return home, some of them deported.
Dozens of Herat residents have staged protests against Iran in defiance of a pandemic lockdown, some smashing the windows of Iranian trucks.
The United States has condemned the river incident and encouraged the Afghan authorities to undertake a full investigation.
Afghanistan's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday said that Iran had agreed to a joint investigation to determine the facts and the identity of the perpetrators.

Seventy-two of the Knesset's 120 lawmakers signed on to Netanyahu's candidacy after parliament passed legislation approving details of a power-sharing deal between the premier's right-wing Likud party and centrist rival Benny Gantz's Blue and White.
President Reuven Rivlin, who oversees the coalition negotiations, then officially tasked him with job and gave him 14 days to get it done.
Netanyahu and Gantz, who were deadlocked in three inconclusive elections since April 2019, plan to swear in their new coalition on Wednesday. Their deal would see Netanyahu serving as prime minister for 18 months after which Gantz would take over.
Gantz had previously balked at partnering up with Netanyahu, who has been indicted on graft charges. He reversed course last month, saying that a unity government was needed to head off economic damage from the coronavirus crisis.
Their coalition deal cleared a legal hurdle on Wednesday when Israel's Supreme Court dismissed challenges by opposition figures and watchdogs and ruled Netanyahu could form a government even as he faces an indictment for bribery, fraud and breach of trust.

Netanyahu, 70, has denied any wrong-doing ahead of his trial, which is due to open on May 24.

On March 31, the country's Supreme Court declared that Nelson Chamisa's leadership of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) was illegitimate and ordered the party to hold an election to replace him within three months.
A majority of MDC leaders have rallied behind Chamisa, arguing that the leadership issue was settled when the party held a congress in 2019 to choose a new executive.
But a faction opposed to Chamisa has been emboldened by the court ruling and this week asked parliament to eject four senior MDC members, all allies of Chamisa.
Their dismissal should trigger a by-election but the new coronavirus outbreak makes this uncertain. The pandemic also makes it difficult for the MDC to organise protests.
The MDC said parliament, which is controlled by the ruling ZANU-PF party, had taken sides in the fight to control the opposition. The MDC suspended participation in parliament while it consults members on its next move.
""For the avoidance of doubt this means that no MDC member shall attend any parliamentary committee or the sitting of parliament or any official business of parliament until such time as a decision is made,"" the MDC said.
President Emmerson Mnangagwa's ZANU-PF already has a majority in parliament and can pass legislation without any hindrance.
Chamisa, 42, narrowly lost the 2018 presidential election to Mnangagwa. He maintains Mnangagwa rigged the vote and does not recognise his presidency.
The MDC, which has split three times since its formation in 1999, frequently accuses ZANU-PF of fanning divisions in its ranks. ZANU-PF denies the charge.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albania will let shopping centres and services start work and drivers travel without permission from Monday due to the low number of infections with the new coronavirus after Thursday marked the ninth day without any deaths, officials said.
To make sure its deficient health system would not be snowed under, Albania has closed its borders and imposed long lockdowns since its first case on March 8. In May, still enforcing dusk-to-dawn curfews, more businesses have resumed working or will.
Albania has registered 31 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and 842 infections, including 10 in the last 24 hours. After 605 recovered, 206 people are still ill with COVID-19 but just 38 of them are in hospital, and of those only seven are in intensive care units. 
""Fortunately, we are not facing those indicators that stop the opening,"" said Mira Rakacolli, the head of the committee of health experts managing the crisis, said in a statement.
Albania wants to re-start its economy as soon as possible after the World Bank said it is headed for recession, shrinking by 5% or 6.9% depending on the time that most activities resume. 
If there had been an average of 15 infections daily, or 90 people needed to go to hospital and 20 in intensive care, the re-opening should have been rolled back, Rakacolli said.
Medical staff in the public health sector have been hailed as heroes after some remained in hospitals, for up to two months, to care for patients.
With 9,806 tests done so far, the government has come under opposition criticism for hiding the extent of the outbreak. Experts said they are now tripling daily tests and strengthening teams on the ground tracing the contacts of infected people.
The statement said the experts denied the new coronavirus might have been in Albania in January and February, as claimed by some, including Bardh Spahia, an opposition official in charge of health issues.

""Above all, this feeling that the war was over was wonderful,"" Boehm, now 90 years old, told Reuters Television. 
On May 8, Germany commemorates the 75th anniversary of what is now officially called ""Day of Liberation"", Nazi Germany's defeat and the end of World War Two in Europe. 
    ""The soldiers, our German soldiers disappeared and no more shots were fired,"" said Boehm, remembering the frightening noise of battle which had included the deafening sound of Red Army multiple rocket launchers and the sight of artillery.
""We knew it would soon be over. Another indication was that the so-called gold pheasants, the (Nazi party) elite dressed in brown disappeared,"" he said. ""Either they changed their clothes or their homes. They did not want to be seen."" 
The end came fast, he said. 
""Between the disappearance of the German soldiers and the appearance of the Soviet soldiers there was maybe half an hour,"" said Boehm.
He grew up in eastern Berlin but moved to the western side before the Berlin Wall, the front line of the Cold War in Europe for nearly three decades, was built in 1961.
Like his parents, Boehm said he never wanted to live through something as terrible as World War Two again. 
The bloody Battle of Berlin, in which Red Army tanks, artillery and infantry fought forward street by street in April and May 1945, reduced the Nazi capital to rubble. 
Despite relief that the fighting and destruction was over, many Germans realised their country was destroyed and feared the arrival of the Soviet Red Army.
""The looting and the rioting was terrible,"" said Boehm, adding his aunt was raped, an uncle had an eye knocked out and their remaining belongings were stolen. 
""All that was not nice but we were so busy surviving we had no time to feel hate,"" he said.

""No one expected that we would see 75 years without war and in fact that's a gift,"" said Boehm.

SANTORINI, Greece (Reuters) - There is a new addition at a bar on Santorini. The beach lounge chairs are surrounded by plexiglass screens, a precaution against coronavirus once the island starts getting visitors again.
Beach bar owner Charlie Chahine says he does not like it, but if that is the way it has to be for tourists to return, then that is what he is doing. 
""We hope these constructions you see are not going to be the future for beaches. We don't want this, but if this is necessary, and if this is what people's safety depends on, such a construction or any such construction - we (just) want to work, we want to get going,"" said Chahine.
    Businesses on Greece's most popular holiday island are adopting all kinds of hygiene measures, anxious for the season to start. 
They are aware they will have already missed months of business if the country opens to tourists in July, as the government has forecast as the country eases lockdown measures that began on March 23.
Santorini is a popular destination for tourists globally. Each summer its cobblestone streets are crammed. In 2018 2 million people came to this volcanic island. It is also a popular destination for weddings and honeymoons. Now the streets and rooftop terraces are empty.
    Vice President of the Santorini Hotel Association Andreas Patiniotis said bookings in June last year were at 70%, while at the moment it hovers at 30% at most. He acknowledges things will not be easy.
""I believe we have to start somewhere, so that there is work for our suppliers, for our employees. There are so many people that depend on hotels.""
    Hotel owner Panagiotis Loutos has been carrying out repairs on his property. Looking at his empty pool, he says it is not just the fears of financial loss. His heart breaks to see his hotel sitting empty.

""We are going to be ready in 10 days, that is the only thing that is sure. We see the (preparations) and we are happy, but it hurts, (because) the absence of people - it's something you can't even talk about,"" he said.

LA BAULE-ESCOUBLAC, France, (Reuters) - The sweeping Atlantic bay in La Baule-Escoublac should be filling up with holidaymakers taking advantage of a series of long weekends in May. Instead the only activity is a bulldozer and excavator reshaping the shoreline.
With France under lockdown, tables and chairs lie stacked on the outdoor terraces of beachfront restaurants in the western resort town as their owners plan how to reconfigure seating to respect coronavirus social distancing rules once the government says they can re-open.
La Baule-Escoublac is a ghost town. It offers a snapshot of the financial uncertainty facing the tourism industry in France even as it and other European nations start winding down their restrictions on public life. 
Nearly 90 million foreign tourists visited France in 2018, making it the most visited country in the world, according to government data. Tourism accounts for about 7% of France's 2.3 trillion euro ($2.48 trillion) economy. 
""We're not used to seeing the beach like this. The quicker things pick up the better,"" said Pierre Guillou, who manages the waterfront restaurant Les Fils a Maman.
Guillot's problems extend beyond when the beach will open. He wants to know who will be able to visit the resort's cafes, restaurants and shops.
Across Europe, countries are grappling with just how much freedom of movement to restore, both across borders and internally.
France begins easing its lockdown from Monday but will initially impose a 100-km (60-mile) travel restriction on people inside ""red zone"" COVID-19 hotspots, including the greater Paris region, unless it is for an urgent family or work-related reason.
There will also be a compulsory two-week quarantine for travellers - whether French or foreigners - arriving in the country from outside the European Union's Schengen open-border area and the United Kingdom.
President Emmanuel Macron has told the French they should holiday in France. 
""We're going to limit big international trips, even during the summer holidays. We will stay amongst Europeans, but perhaps we will have to restrict that further still,"" the president said this week.
NEW ADVERTISING CAMPAIGNS
EU policy on reopening borders remains disjointed. For example in neighbouring Italy, the outbreak's early epicentre in Europe, anyone arriving from abroad currently faces a fortnight in quarantine unless on a short business trip.
It all leaves Parisians in the dark over whether they will be able to decamp to the Riviera, the Dutch uncertain if they can drive their motorhomes to Spain and British unsure if they can hop the Channel and spread around France this summer.
France's Dordogne area, a favourite with Britons, is not banking on anybody coming from very far away. So far this year, the region has already lost an estimated 93 million euros in tourism revenues, according to the Dordogne tourist board. 
""We're going to lose our foreign clientele this year,"" said Christophe Gravier, director of the Dordogne tourism board. He may also lose French clients if curbs persist, with those from Paris and its surrounds accounting for the single largest group. 
Gravier has torn up his old 400,000 euro advertising plan, scrapping a nationwide campaign and focusing on the southwestern region of Nouvelle-Aquitaine in which the Dordogne is located. 
""We have no means of knowing what the government will decide later, he said, referring to the travel restrictions. ""Our challenge is to raise the attractiveness of the Dordogne locally.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's President Sebastian Pinera said on Thursday he had spoken to U.S. President Donald Trump to seek to place his country in ""pole position"" to receive early access to a vaccine for the new coronavirus when one is developed. 
Pinera said he and Trump discussed the ""war"" over medical equipment such as ventilators, and the role of American laboratories in developing therapeutic treatments for COVID-19.
""We have long been trying to put Chile in a privileged position so that when we have a vaccine that vaccine reaches Chile in a timely manner,"" Pinera told a press conference in La Moneda presidential palace in the capital, Santiago.
He said his government had also reached out to other countries - naming the United Kingdom and Israel - to lobby for access to an eventual vaccine.
""We have contacted the main projects... so that when that vaccine is in place, Chile will be in pole position,"" he said. 
The conversation reflects the intense jockeying by nations around the world for medical resources that have become scarce during the pandemic. 
Other countries, including Brazil, have reported similar conversations with Trump in recent weeks as the United States seeks to rival China as a principal provider of means to fight the outbreak, which has so far claimed 256,000 lives worldwide. 
Global leaders pledged in April as part of a World Health Organization initiative to accelerate work on tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 and to share them around the globe, but the Trump administration did not join.
Most experts have suggested clinical trials for a safe and effective vaccine could take a minimum of 12 to 18 months.
Trump wants to speed up development of a vaccine with the goal of having 100 million doses ready by the end of 2020, a senior administration official said last week.[L1N2CH2WI]
Chile on Thursday reported 24,581 confirmed cases of the virus, and 285 deaths. It said a spike in case numbers was due to a ramping up of tests to 12,000 daily, though medical experts pointed to an elevated contagion rate. 

Pinera said Chile had the lowest mortality rate from COVID-19 in all of Latin America and that Trump had praised ""the way Chile is facing this double health and social pandemic.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Gulf Arab states should consider their relationship with the United States when dealing with China, a U.S. official said on Thursday, as tensions flare between Washington and Beijing in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Gulf Arab states have developed close ties with Beijing despite their longstanding relationship with key ally the United States as they seek capital and technology to diversify their economies away from hydrocarbon revenues.
""These (Gulf) states have to weigh the value of their partnership with the United States,"" said U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs David Schenker. 
""We want our partner nations to do due diligence,"" he told Reuters by phone.
President Donald Trump has blamed Beijing for the coronavirus pandemic and his administration is weighing punitive actions against China over its early handling of the outbreak as economic damage mounts.
Several Gulf officials have praised China's efforts to combat the virus, which originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Beijing has recently stepped up its Middle East diplomacy efforts. It has sent medical experts and supplies to countries around the world, including several Gulf states, Egypt and Israel, to help combat the disease.
The State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East said countries in the region should be wary of Chinese aid, which he said was often ""predatory"".
Schenker also said there was concern about the participation of Chinese firm Huawei in building part of the 5G infrastructure in the Gulf, which hosts the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet and the largest American military base in the region. 
That would make it ""difficult"" for American and Gulf forces to communicate, he said.
Huawei has long been a target of the U.S. administration, which says the firm could be exploited by Beijing. China and Huawei has repeatedly denied the accusation.
The U.S. was looking at providing countries with alternatives to dealing with China and their companies, though admitted it was ""behind on 5G"". No U.S. firm makes 5G technology.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday threw out a lower court ruling that had invalidated a decades-old federal law defended by President Donald Trump's administration that makes it a felony to encourage illegal immigration.
The high court, ruling 9-0, did not resolve the legal merits of the dispute but faulted the 2018 decision by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as an overreach. The justices found that the 9th Circuit had based its decision on an issue never presented in the California case - the question of whether the law at issue was overly broad. 
The Supreme Court, in its tersely worded ruling written by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, sent the case back to the 9th Circuit to start its work again. Ginsburg wrote that the lower court's ""radical transformation of this case goes well beyond the pale.""
The 9th Circuit struck down the law as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of free speech because it is overly broad, criminalizing a wide array of ordinary conversations and advice. The 9th Circuit found that the law could criminalize even simple speech, such as a grandmother suggesting to her relative whose visa had expired to stay in the country. 
The Trump administration, in its appeal of the 9th Circuit ruling, argued that the law was not meant to criminalize protected speech, but rather to stop people who would facilitate or solicit illegal immigration and enrich themselves by doing so. 
The case centered on the prosecution of a U.S. citizen named Evelyn Sineneng-Smith, who ran an immigration consultancy in San Jose, California that primarily served Filipinos who worked as home healthcare providers. 
But neither side in the case had presented arguments over whether the law was overly broad, Ginsburg said. Instead, the appeals court itself introduced that issue. 
""No extraordinary circumstances justified the panel's takeover of the appeal,"" Ginsburg said.
Federal prosecutors in 2010 accused Sineneng-Smith of duping illegal migrants into paying her to file frivolous visa applications while remaining in the country indefinitely.
Sineneng-Smith was convicted in 2013 of violating the encouragement law, as well as mail fraud. She was sentenced to 18 months in prison and three years of supervised release.

Trump has made restricting both legal and illegal immigration a centerpiece of his presidency and his campaign for re-election on Nov. 3.

The whites, separated by a stripe of black kitchen tops, were displayed in neat rows to resemble a cemetery in the ornate central Grand Place square.
Coralie Michiels, one of the organizers of the protest, said the action was partly to show the scale of the hotel, restaurant and cafe sector - providing a livelihood for 10% of Belgium's 11.5 million people and contributing 18 billion euros ($19.4 billion) a year to the economy.
""There is an impression that we're not really being heard,"" said Michiels, whose family owns Restauration Nouvelle, a company with restaurants and catering services.
""We need to know what measures there are and be able to plan for the future.""
Belgium has begun easing its lockdown, with all shops allowed to open from Monday. However, bars and restaurants will stay closed at least until June, having shut their doors in mid-March.
Restaurants can still offer takeaway or delivery service dishes, but some, such as Michelin-starred Comme Chez Soi, have chosen to feed the homeless during the lockdown. Others have decided to provide meals for health sector workers. 

Switzerland is set to allow bars and restaurants to reopen on Monday, while German states will start doing so from next week.

As Germany's leaders prepare to lay wreaths to mark the ""Day of Liberation"" on May 8 - the day in 1945 when German generals signed an unconditional surrender - many Jews are worried about the popularity of the far right.
""Germany's government knows its enduring responsibility for the Nazi era,"" Josef Schuster, president of the Central Council of Jews in Germany, told the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung paper.
""But if you interpret Germany as a country, with all its residents, and ask us if they have also understood and learned from history, then I must say that I have never been convinced, and at the current time I am certainly not,"" he said.
Schuster also said he was worried that a certain amount of anti-Semitism appeared to have become an accepted fact of life in Germany, the paper said.
Last year an anti-Semitic gunman attacked a synagogue and a kebab shop in the eastern city of Halle, killing two people. 
Some 1,800 criminal incidents were committed against Jews in 2018, mostly by individuals espousing far-right views, the government has said.
Schuster said there was a dangerous amnesia about history among younger people.
""In their minds, World War Two is as far away as the empire, there is no longer a reference point. If about half of young people don't know the term 'Auschwitz', something's wrong,"" he said. 
The German government expressed alarm at a survey by ComRes market research institute in 2018 which showed that 40% of Germans between 18 and 34 thought they know nothing or little about the Holocaust, more than the European average of 33% -- one of several surveys with similar results in recent years. 
In the past decade or so, Germans have tended to focus more on their own suffering during World War Two, which Nazi Germany started. 

In particular, some prominent members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the third-biggest parliamentary party, have suggested history teaching should focus more on German victims.

""Thanks to our common efforts since March, we have brought the contamination under control,"" Solberg told a news conference. ""We can therefore, over time, lighten the toughest measures.""
Norway, like many other European countries, is trying to negotiate a path between the need for reopening society while at the same time avoid a flare-up in new contaminations. 
Kindergartens reopened on April 20, primary schools from first to fourth grade on April 27, but middle schools and high schools have remained closed. They will now resume work from Monday.
Foreigners without the right to live or work in the country - tourists, for instance - are still not allowed to enter the country.
But foreigners working in sectors considered crucial, such as agriculture, fisheries or the oil industry, can come in the country though they still have to submit to a 14-day quarantine.

Still, if Norwegians and foreign residents want to go abroad, they will need to undergo quarantine upon their return.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Aides to former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who were at the center of the ""Bridgegate"" scandal engaged in corruption and abuse of power but not criminal acts, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Thursday as it unanimously threw out their convictions and placed new limits on political corruption prosecutions.
The justices sided with Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, both of whom were convicted for their roles in a scheme to engineer traffic chaos in September 2013 on the world's busiest bridge to punish a local mayor who refused to endorse Christie's gubernatorial re-election bid.
""The evidence the jury heard no doubt shows wrongdoing - deception, corruption, abuse of power. But the federal fraud statutes at issue do not criminalize all such conduct,"" liberal Justice Elena Kagan wrote on behalf of the court in the 9-0 ruling. 
Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, and Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, were convicted in 2016 of wire fraud and misusing Port Authority resources. The Supreme Court ruled that their actions did not fit within the definition of fraud under federal law.
""Having been maligned, I now stand with my family and friends knowing that due process worked. While this may finally have made this case right for me, it does not absolve those who should have truly been held accountable,"" Kelly said in a statement.
Kelly will serve none of her 13-month prison sentence, which had been hold while she appealed. Baroni started serving his 18-month sentence but was released when the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case last year.
""Although the process of getting to this day has been an ordeal, Bill is heartened that the system ultimately worked, even as he recognizes how often it fails others who are less fortunate,"" Baroni's lawyer, Michael Levy, said in a statement. 
Kagan wrote that the federal fraud laws would be violated only if the aim of the two defendants was ""to obtain the Port Authority's money or property."" The scheme was an exercise of ""regulatory power"" that does not constitute ""property"" under the fraud laws, Kagan added.
Prosecutors accused Kelly and Baroni of creating days of lane closures on the George Washington Bridge, which connects Fort Lee, New Jersey, to New York City, the most populous U.S. city.
The closures caused traffic gridlock and were intended to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, after he declined to endorse the Republican Christie for re-election, according to prosecutors. The traffic was so bad that local authorities at the time called it a threat to public safety because it delayed emergency responders.
Christie denied involvement and was not charged. The scandal sullied Christie's reputation, damaged his campaign for the 2016 Republican U.S. presidential nomination and contributed to his sagging public approval ratings in New Jersey.
Christie served as an adviser to President Donald Trump in 2016. Trump later fired him as the head of his transition team after being elected president.
The ruling marks the latest instance in which the Supreme Court hemmed in prosecutors in corruption cases involving political figures. The court in 2016 decision also threw out Republican former Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell's bribery conviction in another ruling that narrowed the types of conduct that can warrant prosecution.
McDonnell and former media mogul Conrad Black, who also was prosecuted in a corruption case, filed legal briefs in support of Kelly and Baroni. Trump in 2019 granted a full pardon to Black, who was convicted in 2007 of fraud and obstruction of justice and spent 3-1/2 years in prison.

Kelly told Port Authority executive David Wildstein in an email a month before the traffic chaos that it was ""time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" and they helped invent a sham ""traffic study"" to justify the lane closures. Wildstein, the accused Bridgegate mastermind, was sentenced to probation in 2017 after pleading guilty and cooperating with prosecutors.

805,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 11:25AM ET</span>",Minister defends Germany's limited gay therapy ban,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's ban on so-called gay conversion therapies needs to be robust enough to withstand court challenges, Health Minister Jens Spahn said in response to criticism that his proposed law would not protect young adults.
The Bundestag is expected later on Thursday to pass a law that will ban the therapies, which purport to turn gay people straight, but which critics say perpetuate the harmful myth that being gay is a disease.
But the Greens, who in 2013 were the first to call for a ban, say the conservative-Social Democrat coalition's proposal falls short since it protects only minors from the practice, even though those aged between 18 and 26 can also be exposed to harmful social pressures.
Spahn, the conservative health minister, said ahead of the vote that he wanted a law that could easily withstand legal challenge.
""I want a ban which will be robust, including if it's brought before the courts,"" said Spahn, who is the Christian Democrat party's most prominent gay politician.
""Young people are being forced into conversion therapies,"" he added, ""and so it is very important that they should find support in the existence of this law: a clear signal that the state does not want this to happen.""
Spahn was not specific, but German law makes it easier to protect minors, whereas freedom of speech and conscience laws may confuse the issue for those above 18.
Conversion therapies are banned in much of South America, in Switzerland and in many U.S. states, and bans are planned in much of the rest of the United States and Europe.
Advocates say bans spare young people pain and suffering at being harassed and humiliated because of their sexuality, an experience which has led to suicide.
Germany has been slower in reaching some key milestones on the road towards sexual equality, introducing marriage equality only in 2017, long after many other countries.
The Greens, running the conservatives a distant second in current polls, called for the current proposal to be strengthened to protect at least those aged up to 26, to protect young adults from being badgered by close family into opting for a procedure they neither want nor need.

""Only minors are to be protected from this life-endangering charlatanry,"" Green legislators wrote. ""At the very least young people aged between 18 and 26 need comparable protection, as is shown by the experiences of coming-out and many young people's dependence on their families.""

806,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 10:37AM ET</span>",Britain heading for a limited easing of lockdown next week,"By Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson will announce a very limited easing of Britain's coronavirus lockdown next week, adopting a cautious approach to try to ensure there is no second peak of infections that could further hurt the economy.
Johnson is due to announce the next steps in Britain's battle to tackle the novel coronavirus on Sunday following a review by ministers of the current measures that have all but shut the economy and kept millions at home.
His government has been criticised for moving too slowly to tackle the outbreak which has led to more than 30,000 deaths in Britain - a charge the government dismisses by saying it has taken the right decisions at the right time.
But with an increasing number of anecdotal reports that more people are flouting the lockdown in anticipation of Sunday's announcement and a public holiday on Friday, ministers are under pressure to make any new rules as clear as possible after being criticised for mixed messaging.
At a cabinet meeting of his top ministers, Johnson said Britain would advance ""with maximum caution"" and be guided by the science and data when considering whether any of the strict social distancing measures could be eased. 
""Any easement to the guidelines next week will be very limited,"" his spokesman told reporters.
""We are at a critical moment in the fight against the virus and we will not do anything which risks throwing away the efforts and sacrifices of the British public."" 
Ministers fear a swift easing could lead to a second peak in infection rates, which might overwhelm hospitals and force a second shutdown of businesses.
Earlier, the Bank of England underlined how deeply the lockdown had hurt the economy, saying Britain could be headed for its biggest economic slump in over 300 years.
Johnson, who says he fought for his life after himself contracting COVID-19, has ploughed money into a support programme for businesses, but appears to be erring on the side of caution of immediately firing up the economy.
GRADUAL MOVE
Officials suggest there will be a gradual move towards re-opening businesses. Ministers say that those operating outdoors might be able to find a way to work in the summer months but have warned that it was too soon to re-open schools. 
To try to shore up support for his action plan, Johnson briefed opposition leaders on the latest situation, with Labour leader Keir Starmer saying there needed to be a national consensus on the next steps in tackling the virus.
""He also reiterated the seven principles that he wants the government to consider when planning for the next phase, including safety at work and preventing a cliff-edge to the job protection scheme,"" a spokesperson for Starmer said.
Johnson also wants to pursue a strategy that unites the four countries of the United Kingdom: Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland, with his spokesman saying the four-nation approach was the best way forward.
But Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the only change to the lockdown which had been floated in the media that she might agree to in the immediate future was the limit on people only exercising once a day.

""I must make judgments informed by the evidence that are right and safe for Scotland,"" Sturgeon, who will decide on whether to ease measures in Scotland, told reporters.

807,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>","Public Masses in Italy to resume May 18, ending bitter Church-state rift","By Philip Pullella
ROME (Reuters) - Italy's government and Roman Catholic bishops signed an agreement on Thursday to allow the faithful to attend Masses again from later this month, ending a standoff between the Church and state over the coronavirus lockdown.
The government banned attendance at Masses in early March, part of its prohibition on gatherings as it sought to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Many Catholics asserted that church services should have been permitted along with other essential activities such as food shopping.
Tensions ran high again late last month when the government announced a gradual staged easing of the lockdown, but did not include a return to Masses in a phase that began on May 4.
The bishops told the government they could ""not accept seeing the exercise of freedom of religion being compromised"". Most of Italy's churches have remained open during the crisis, but only for individual prayer.
Catholics have been following Masses on television or on the internet as priests said them in empty churches.
With Thursday's agreement, Masses for the public can resume on May 18 but under strict conditions outlined in a protocol signed by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and Cardinal Gualtiero Bassetti, president of the Italian Bishops Conference.
Individual pastors will determine the maximum number of people who can fit in a church while staying at least a meter (yard) apart.
If there is demand, additional Masses should be held, rather than allowing more people into the church for one service, the protocol says. 
The faithful will have to wear masks in church. Priests can celebrate most of the Mass without masks but they will have to wear one, as well as gloves, when they distribute the communion wafer.
Initially, choirs will be banned, holy water fonts will remain dry, and the traditional exchange of a sign of peace - usually in the form of a handshake - will be eliminated.
The collection, in which a basket is passed around for offerings of money, will be replaced by containers where the faithful can make contributions.
Nearly 30,000 people have died of the coronavirus in Italy, the third highest death toll in the world after the United States and Britain. A new phase of loosening of restrictions began on Monday, when some 4.5 million people returned to work.
The Masses will resume on the same day Italian museums and libraries can reopen.

The Vatican, which for the most part has been mirroring Italy's containment measures, has not yet said when St. Peter's Basilica or the Vatican museums will reopen. Pope Francis celebrated the major Christian feast of Easter last month with none of the usual packed crowds.

808,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Turkey says it is still delivering parts for U.S. F-35 jets,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is still producing and delivering parts for U.S. F-35 jets despite being suspended from the program nearly a year ago over its purchase of a Russian anti-aircraft defense system, Defence Industry Director Ismail Demir said on Thursday.
Washington announced last July, when the first Russian S-400 units arrived in Turkey, that it was suspending Ankara from the F-35 program and expected to ""wind down"" Turkey's involvement by March 2020.
The United States also said the purchase meant Turkey could be subjected to sanctions under U.S. legislation aimed at discouraging defense purchases from Moscow.
Turkey was both a parts manufacturer and major buyer of the  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-35 stealth jets. Washington says the S-400s jeopardize the jets - which Ankara denies - and are incompatible with NATO defense systems.
""There was an understanding in the United States that nothing would be bought from Turkey for the F-35s after March 2020, but that approach is no longer there,"" Demir said. He suggested the global coronavirus pandemic meant the March deadline no longer applied, without elaborating.
""Our companies continue their production and delivery,"" Demir said in an online interview, adding that Turkey remained a ""loyal partner"" of the F-35 program.
Taking Turkey out of the project would cost other members of the program up to $600 million, he said.
Turkish officials have said the deployment of the S-400s has been put back from April because of the coronavirus outbreak, but will ultimately go ahead.

Demir said a new timetable for activating the S-400s would be drawn up once operations were back to full capacity after the outbreak.

809,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 08:43AM ET</span>",'What's the point of staying?': Gulf faces expatriate exodus,"By Davide Barbuscia and Marwa Rashad
DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - A popular Saudi talk show host told private businesses this week it was their national duty to lay off foreign rather than local employees, warning that the dominance of Saudi Arabia's workforce by expatriates was a ""real danger"".
Khaled al-Oqaily's comments on his daily TV show encapsulated the dilemma faced by 35 million foreigners who form the Gulf's economic backbone: as firms shed jobs because of the coronavirus pandemic and oil price crash, and governments move to protect citizens' jobs and wages, should they stay or go?
The expatriate exodus is expected to be larger than after the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the 2014-2015 plunge in prices for oil, the region's main export, the International Labour Organization (ILO) said, without giving figures.
In Oman alone, the number of expatriates dropped by over 340,000 in 2010 following the 2008-2009 crisis, according to official data. That year, Oman's economic growth slowed by 1.3 percentage points, World Bank data show.
This time around, many foreign workers remain stranded without a safety net as Gulf states try to organise ways of getting them home.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants, mostly Asians, have registered for repatriation, according to figures from embassies and authorities in the region, which has seen COVID-19 spread among low-income foreign workers in overcrowded living quarters.
Pakistan and India have started evacuating citizens from the Gulf. Egypt has begun repatriation flights from Kuwait, where security forces quelled a riot by Egyptians at a shelter housing residency violators this week.
In the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Qatar the numbers leaving ""could be very significant"", said Ryszard Cholewinski, ILO's senior migration specialist for Arab states.
Farman, one of 60,000 Pakistanis registered to leave the UAE, lost his job as a school bus driver two months ago after education centres closed under virus containment measures.
""I want to go home because what's the point of staying without work?"" he said, standing in a dimly lit street in front of communal housing in Dubai's Al Quoz industrial area.
And it is not only blue-collar workers who are caught up in the coronavirus squeeze. Many qualified professionals have not been spared.
""You go online, you apply for thousands of jobs, but they're all expired,"" said Egyptian-American architect Nada Karim, who was due to start a new job in Dubai when the firm froze hiring.
""I can resist here for two or three months without a salary, then I'll have to leave.""
Samer, a Lebanese-Canadian working at an advertising agency in Saudi Arabia, has been put on six-month unpaid leave and is considering moving to Canada if things do not improve.
""It is very confusing and worrying when you suddenly cannot plan for your future,"" he said. 
DOWNTURN
The Middle East is headed for an economic downturn this year that dwarfs 2008 and 2014/2015 as countries are hit by the double blow from coronavirus closures and record low oil prices, the International Monetary Fund said.
""Fewer expats will crimp demand for everything from pizzas to villas, and the danger is that this leads to a cascading deflationary impact with secondary job losses,"" said Tarek Fadlallah of Nomura Asset Management Middle East.
Official unemployment data is not available, but several Gulf airlines and ride-sharing firm Careem have said they are laying off hundreds of workers.
Dubai, a business and tourism hub, was hoping for an economic boost from hosting the Expo world fair this year but the event was postponed until Oct. 2021 due to the pandemic.
Last week, Expo 2020 Dubai made redundant 179 employees, according to an internal document seen by Reuters. Expo declined to comment.
""Expatriates are not just a cog in the machine - they play an integral part in the domestic recycling of capital that helps sustain Gulf economies,"" said Robert Mogielnicki, a resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington.
REFORMS
The flight of expats could reduce government income from fees and value-added tax and slow reform efforts, including reducing state spending on wages and subsidies, analysts have said.
In Kuwait, several parliamentarians warned they would block any draft law allowing private firms to cut wages of nationals, local newspapers reported on Wednesday.
Gulf states will likely speed up programmes to ""nationalise"" jobs, with Oman last month ordering state firms to replace foreign employees with nationals. But this could make it even more difficult to jump-start economic growth, analysts said.
Some Gulf diversification plans, such as Saudi Arabia's bid to build entertainment and non-religious tourism industries, hinge ""largely on the economic activities surrounding expatriate residents and foreign visitors"", said Mogielnicki.
Presenter Oqaily, in a show aired on state-owned SBC TV, criticised Saudi businesses retaining expatriates as ""having no shame and knowing nothing about loyalty to the country.

""We have to stop making the Saudi employee a scapegoat with every crisis,"" he said. ""Get rid of the foreign labour that replaced the more skilled Saudis.""

The stress and anxiety bred by weeks of restrictions on public life have made uncertainty, separation, and fear part of daily life for many, WHO Regional Director for Europe Hans Kluge said.
Kluge cited reports from many countries including Belgium, Bulgaria, France, Ireland, Russia, Spain and Britain of increases in violence against women and men by an intimate partner and against children because of the response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Although data is scarce, member states are reporting up to a 60% increase in emergency calls by women subjected to violence by their intimate partners in April this year compared to last,"" he told an online briefing from Copenhagen. 
Online enquiries to violence prevention hotlines had increased by up to five times, the agency said, calling the issue a global problem.
Kluge noted some countries had provided examples of how to address the issue. Italy has an app to ask for help without a phone call, while victims can alert pharmacists in Spain and France through code words. 
Hotels in France and Belgium have converted to shelters, and Greenland has limited the sale of alcohol to make homes safer for children. 

""With job losses, rising alcohol-based harm and drug use, stress and fear, the legacy of this pandemic could haunt us for years,"" he said.

811,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 08:05AM ET</span>",Philippine broadcaster fights order to shut down,"MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' biggest broadcaster asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to quash an order by the telecoms regulator to shut down its operations, saying it undermined freedom of speech and the public right to information.
The regulator's order for ABS-CBN Corp to cease operations after its 25-year license expired has prompted allegations by critics of President Rodrigo Duterte that his allies are trying to intimidate the media.
The president repeatedly threatened to block the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise after the channel angered him during the 2016 presidential election by refusing to air his campaign commercial. 
""The continued operation of ABS-CBN is a matter of public interest and transcendental importance, it being among the largest broadcasting entities in terms of coverage and audience,"" the company said. 
ABS-CBN Corp also asked the Supreme Court to hear its petition quickly, saying the livelihood of thousands of its employees and their families were at stake.
The 66-year-old entertainment and media conglomerate, said in it its petition that it employs 11,000 people. 
It also operates 21 radio and 38 television stations nationwide and distributes online content. It went off air on Tuesday to comply with the regulator's order, to widespread dismay from labor, business and media groups and opposition lawmakers. 
""To close ABS-CBN now when it is most needed would certainly be detrimental to the public,"" it said. ""ABS-CBN cannot be closed without compromising the fundamental guarantees of freedom of speech and the press."" 
ABS-CBN said the National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) abused its discretion when it ordered its closure even after it indicated in March the broadcasting company could remain on air pending its license renewal. ABS-CBN's 25-year congressional franchise expired on May 4.
""The NTC's bad faith, malice and underhandedness are simply shocking and abhorrent,"" ABS-CBN said.
The NTC was not immediately available for comment. The regulator said on Wednesday it stood by its decision and that ABS-CBN could seek a temporary restraining order from a court.
Several bills extending ABC-CBN's license have been pending as a parliament dominated by Duterte's loyalists dragged its feet over renewing its franchise. 
ABS-CBN had apologised for what happened during the 2016 election campaign and the president's office said the mercurial leader no longer had an axe to grind with the station, despite past grievances. 
""Even if the president would wish to give them a franchise, under the constitution, only Congress has the power to grant it,"" presidential spokesman Harry Roque said on Thursday.

812,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 07:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Virus exposes gaping holes in Africa’s health systems,"By Katharine Houreld, David Lewis and Ryan McNeill
NAIROBI (Reuters) - African nations are facing a surge of COVID-19 cases with less than one intensive care bed and one ventilator per 100,000 people, a Reuters survey has found.
Even in a best-case scenario, the continent could need at least 10 times the number it has now as the outbreak peaks, an analysis of researchers' projections showed.
The shortages across Africa's national health systems are among the starkest elements to emerge from the survey, which polled 54 countries and received responses from health officials or independent experts in 48 of them. The results provide the most detailed public picture to date of the continent's key resources, testing and personnel for the disease caused by the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 262,000 people worldwide, according to a Reuters tally.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that Africa, home to 1.3 billion people, could become the next epicentre of the pandemic.
The continent has recorded over 51,000 COVID-19 cases, a fraction of the 3.76 million recorded globally, according to a Reuters tally. But low levels of testing make it impossible to know the true scale of infection. The United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) has said Africa could see nearly 123 million cases this year, causing 300,000 deaths. 
Assuming a complete lockdown for an indefinite period, at least 121,000 critical care beds will be needed continent-wide when the pandemic peaks, according to a Reuters analysis of the projections by scientists at Britain's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, on which the UNECA forecasts are based.
That compares with just 9,800 available intensive care beds found in the survey, conducted through April and May. The survey also revealed severe shortfalls in testing, personnel and oxygen supplies.
Many African nations moved quickly to contain the virus, launching high-profile public health campaigns, restricting movement and repurposing factories to produce protective equipment. 
""We are preparing,"" said Dr. Juliet Nyaga, chief executive of Karen Hospital, a private facility in Kenya, as she showed Reuters an isolation unit they had set up in a nursing school. ""But it's like being in a movie that no one has ever rehearsed, and we didn't get the script.""
International organizations including the WHO and World Bank are helping, but they say they are hampered by problems finding reliable data to measure the continent's needs.
For full details, see this interactive graphic: https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS/AFRICA/yzdpxoqbdvx
TESTS
Africa's testing capacity has expanded sharply but the continent has still carried out only around 685 tests per million people, according to Reuters' tally of figures from the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC).
By comparison, Europe has carried out nearly 17 million tests, or just under 23,000 per million.
""If you don't test, you don't find,"" said John Nkengasong, director of the Africa CDC. 
The organization, set up by the African Union in 2017, worked with the WHO to rapidly roll out testing.
In January, only South Africa and Senegal could test; now all African countries can except for tiny Lesotho and the island nation of Sao Tome and Principe.
Yet many cannot make full use of their capacity. Kenya's labs could carry out 37,000 tests daily, a Senate report based on information from the health ministry found, but it has only done 26,000 to date. It lacks laboratory personnel, sample collection kits and supplies, and has also received faulty test kits as donations, the report said.
Chad and Burundi have carried out fewer than 500 tests each. Mahamout Khayal, Chad's health minister, told Reuters that testing levels were low due to a lack of kits, but also because many staff who had been carrying out tests had themselves fallen ill, so were no longer able to work.
CRITICAL CARE
The WHO estimates around 14% of COVID-19 patients will require hospitalization and oxygen support, and about 5% will need a ventilator - generally found in an intensive care unit (ICU).
Even in the best-case scenario, the Reuters survey suggests, an average of 12 COVID-19 patients in Africa could be lined up for each available ICU bed at the height of the outbreak, although the timing of peak demand will differ in each country.
The continent's three most populous nations - Nigeria, Ethiopia and Egypt - have 1,920 intensive care beds between them for more than 400 million people. Nigeria's health minister said the country had not had to use most of its ICU equipment yet, but had still ordered more. The other two nations did not respond to requests for comment.
Intensive care beds are expensive, difficult to run, and unevenly distributed. Chad, an oil-rich but impoverished nation of 15 million people, has only 10, whereas the island nation of Mauritius, a financial hub home to 1.2 million, has 121.
Most COVID-19 patients who need critical care also need a ventilator. However, Reuters found that just over 9,300 of the continent's 9,800 intensive care beds have them.
Some nations, such as Guinea Bissau, have no ventilators at all. Mauritania has one; Liberia said it has six; Somalia has 19. 
Tumane Balde, head of an inter-ministerial commission to tackle COVID-19 in Guinea-Bissau, said the country only had 10% of the equipment it needs. ""Our staff are under-equipped and unmotivated,"" he said. ""We need three times more beds than we have."" 
Officials at Mauritania's health ministry, and a representative for Liberia did not respond to requests for comment.
South Africa has 3,300 ventilators, but about two-thirds are in private hospitals, which most people cannot afford. The health ministry said the state has the right to use private facilities in an emergency.
Ventilators need oxygen, which can come from oxygen plants, cylinders or machines. Kenya has nearly 300 ventilators but a ""critical shortage"" of oxygen, the Senate report found.
Last month, its ministry of health implored hospitals to pay outstanding bills to the company that supplies many of them with cylinders.
SECRETIVE NATIONS
Information is as important as equipment. Some nations have been quick to provide health data. In others, information is patchy, out of date or secret. Some leaders may fear public criticism over crumbling public services, said Michel Yao, emergency operations manager in Africa for the WHO.
""Information is critical for us to better help,"" he told Reuters. ""It's difficult to anticipate their overall needs if you don't have accurate information.""
The East African nation of Tanzania, publicly criticised by the WHO for not restricting large gatherings, has sometimes gone for days without updating its coronavirus figures.
It won't tell donors about its public health resources, a diplomat told Reuters. A government spokesman denied allegations Tanzania was not sharing information and referred Reuters to the health ministry, which did not respond.
And official figures don't always match frontline experience.
Uganda said it has 268 ICU beds in public hospitals. But only about 70 ICU beds countrywide have enough staff and equipment to function, said Arthur Kwizera, a lecturer in anaesthesia and intensive care at Makerere University College of Health Sciences, whose team carried out a study on intensive care capacity late last year. The government did not respond to requests for comment on that point.
Many ICU beds are also already in use. Kenya, for example, has 518 beds in its public and private facilities, but 94% are already occupied by non-COVID-19 patients, said the Senate report.
POWER AND PEOPLE
Even where equipment is available, power and personnel may not be. In nations such as Nigeria, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, electricity is extremely unreliable. Hospitals depend on diesel-powered generators, but some can't afford refueling and maintenance.
Doctors, critical care nurses, anaesthesiologists and biotechnicians - essential for maintaining equipment - are in short supply, data from the World Federation of Societies of Anaesthesiologists (WFSA) and World Bank shows - although figures from many countries date back years.
Continent-wide, one doctor serves an average of 80,000 people, World Bank data shows. 
Anaesthetists often run critical care units in Africa. But only nine countries have one or more physician qualified to administer anaesthetics per 100,000 people, according to the WFSA.
Equipment and personnel are arriving: The World Bank is helping more than 30 African nations obtain more than $1 billion worth of equipment. And planeloads of aid are arriving from Turkey, China, Europe and the Middle East. 
The private sector is also gearing up. Private hospitals are generally better staffed, but their revenues have been squeezed by a decline in elective surgeries and regular outpatient chronic treatment, said the Africa Healthcare Federation, an umbrella organisation for private healthcare.
Some governments on the continent are trying to negotiate access to private hospitals for patients who can't afford the fees.

But most private hospitals need some form of payment and - mindful of governments that pay bills late or not at all - some want an internationally-administered independent fund to handle the payments.

813,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>",Pakistan excludes religious sect from minority commission,"By Gibran Naiyyar Peshimam
ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's cabinet has declined to include a religious sect that rights group says suffers widespread persecution in a newly formed commission for minorities, after opposition from conservatives in the government, officials said on Thursday.
The cabinet set up the National Commission for Minorities (NCM) on Tuesday to oversee their concerns in Muslim-majority Pakistan, but Ahmadis, who are categorised as non-Muslim in the constitution, were not included.
Ahmadis consider themselves to be Muslims in contradiction to the constitution, to the anger of many in Pakistan. Their exclusion from the commission deprives them of a voice and the status and protection it would likely confer.
""The Ahmadi community must not be included in the NCM, given the religious and historical sensitivity of the issue,"" the Ministry of Religious Affairs said in a note on the issue, seen by Reuters.
Ahmadis recognize Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, who founded the sect in British-ruled India in 1889, as a “subordinate prophet”, which mainstream Muslims see as a breach of the Islamic tenet that the Prophet Mohammad was God’s last direct messenger.
The sect has up to 20 million followers worldwide with about half a million in Pakistan, community leaders say, though other estimates have put the number in Pakistan higher, with many hiding their identity fearing persecution.
State Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan has been among the most vocal opponents of Ahmadi inclusion in the new commission, referring to them on social media as agents of chaos.
""If they want to avail constitutional rights they must accept the constitution first,"" Khan told Reuters in a text message. 
""The Pakistani constitution considers them non-Muslims.""
Khan defended a now-deleted Twitter post in which he said: ""There is only one punishment for insulting the Prophet - chopping off the head"".
He stressed he believed in ""legal procedures and court proceedings"" for anyone accused of blasphemy and said Twitter had asked him to delete the post.
Ahmadis, probably more than members of other minorities, find themselves facing accusations of blasphemy, which in Pakistan can carry the death penalty. 
'SEVERE PERSECUTION'
A Hindu has been nominated as chairman of the commission which also has representatives of the Christian, Sikh, Zoroastrian and Kalash communities. Government officials and the head of the Council of Islamic Ideology are also members.
The U.S. Commission for International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan U.S. federal government body, said in a report this year that Pakistan's Ahmadis ""continued to face severe persecution from authorities as well as societal harassment due to their beliefs, with both the authorities and mobs targeting their houses of worship"".
It recommended that the U.S. government designate Pakistan a country of particular concern for engaging in ""systematic, ongoing, and egregious violations of religious freedom"".
Minister of Information Shibli Faraz defended the government's handling of the commission for minorities and said the rights of all were fully respected.
""Every country has the sovereign right to make judgements according to its ground realities,"" Faraz said in a statement sent to Reuters.
A representative of the Ahmadi community, Usman Ahmad, said they were used to exclusion but rejected as a ""complete myth"" the assertion that Ahmadis did not accept the constitution.
He said many people disagreed with parts of the constitution but that did not exclude them from rights conferred under it. 
But Ahmad said they have never accepted being classified as non-Muslims, which would rule out joining the commission anyway.
""We've never joined such commissions that require us to accept our non-Muslim status,"" Ahmad told Reuters.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - At least 9 people were killed in southern India by a gas leak at a South Korean-owned factory making polystyrene products, with emergency services rushing over 300 people to hospitals and evacuating 1,500 from a nearby village, a police official said.
The accident occurred some 14 kilometres (9 miles) inland from the east coast city of Visakhapatnam, in Andhra Pradesh state, at a plant operated by LG Polymers, a unit of South Korea's biggest petrochemical maker, LG Chem Ltd.
Srijana Gummalla, Commissioner, Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation said styrene leaked from the plant during the early hours of the morning, when families in the surrounding villages were asleep.
A spokesman for LG Chem in Seoul said the leak was discovered by a night shift maintenance worker and has been brought under control.
According to both the company spokesman and Gummalla, the plant was being reopened after India relaxed a nationwide lockdown that had been imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
Swarupa Rani, an Assistant Commissioner of Police in Visakhapatnam told Reuters that at least 9 people had died and between 300-400 were hospitalised. Another 1,500 people had been evacuated, mostly from a neighbouring village.
""All those who have been hospitalised are currently stable,"" said Dr B. K. Naik, a local health official.
Areas within an approximately 3-kilometre (nearly 2-mile)radius of the plant were vulnerable, the municipal corporation said in a tweet. Cross-referencing maps of the affected area, there is at least one coronavirus containment zone in the neighbourhood.
LISTLESS AND UNCONSCIOUS
Yashwanth Saikumar Ambati, 23, who lives about 300 metres away from the plant, said he woke up around 4.30 a.m. on Thursday because of a strong smell.
""I went back to sleep and I woke up around 6 because the smell got stronger. My eyes were itchy, and I was feeling drowsy, light-headed and slightly breathless,"" he told Reuters.
Others in his neighbourhood also complained of eye irritation, Ambati said, while some said they had a stomach ache. He then called a friend living a few kilometres away and quickly moved there.
Local revenue official B. V. Rani said she received a call at around 4 a.m. from a police officer near the facility, who sounded panicky. ""He asked me to come to the spot immediately,"" Rani told Reuters.
When Rani went there, she saw that people had collapsed unconscious in the village adjoining the 60-acre site of the plant.
""I personally helped more than 15 people get to an ambulance who had tried to run away from the village but dropped down within a few metres,"" she said.
Video from Reuters partner ANI shot later on Thursday showed emergency workers in the area rushing to help victims, some of whom appeared to be listless and disoriented. 
A number of victims lay unconscious on the streetside, as some volunteers fanned them and others rushed to carry them into ambulances.
At least one child was among the dead, a policeman at the site told ANI, and video showed at least two other children being lifted into an ambulance.
India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he had spoken to officials from the federal home ministry and the National Disaster Management Authority, who were monitoring the crisis.
""I pray for everyone’s safety and well-being in Visakhapatnam,"" Modi said in a tweet.
Thursday's incident evoked memories of a gas leak at an factory of U.S. chemical firm Union Carbide that killed thousands in the central Indian city of Bhopal in 1984.
TOP PETROCHEMICAL MAKER
LG Chem's share priced closed nearly 2% weaker on Thursday.
South Korea's top petrochemical maker by capacity, LG Chem acquired the plant in 1997 and established LG Polymers India Private Limited (LGPI), according to a company website.
The LG Polymers plant makes polystyrene products which are used in manufacturing electric fan blades, cups and cutlery and containers for cosmetic products such as make up.
The raw material, styrene, is highly flammable and releases a poisonous gas when burnt.
In a statement, LG Chem said that the gas emitted in the leak can cause nausea and dizziness when inhaled, adding that it was seeking to ensure casualties received treatment quickly. 
LG Chem operates two naphtha crackers in South Korea, with a total ethylene output capacity of 2.5 million tonnes each year.

It also makes electric vehicle batteries and General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) are among its customers.

But as they struggle to rekindle the spirit of protest in the age of coronavirus, despite lockdowns or bans on public gatherings, most demonstrators have sought to obey social-distancing rules.
Measures to stop contagion have stifled protest movements worldwide, from the mass demonstrations of Hong Kong to the civil disobedience of climate activists in London who last year caused gridlock by shutting roads and bridges.
Now, there is little traffic to disrupt, traditional targets of popular unrest - a parliament building, government office or bank headquarters - are mostly empty, and some activists are reluctant to venture out due to fears of catching the virus.
But protesters have learnt to adapt.
Swedish climate change activist Greta Thunberg, who set in motion climate strikes by school children worldwide, has shifted emphasis to social media, with her followers posting photos of themselves at home with banners and placards, and holding webinars and video discussions.
Serbians also found a way to make their protest heard without leaving home. For two nights last week, a cacophony of tin pans, drums, whistles and horns reverberated through much of the country as citizens, stuck at home under curfew, vented their anger at the government's tough containment measures.
In Athens, Greeks took the traditional approach on May Day, turning out in front of parliament, but they used red ground markers to ensure they obeyed social-distancing rules.
""The time has come to fight and to live,"" hospital union official Elias Sioras told hundreds of masked and gloved Greeks neatly spaced more than a metre apart.
""The battle is twofold, to stay healthy and to fight for a free public healthcare system.""
Many of the protests bubbling away across Europe are focused on national lockdowns, either calling on governments to lift them or demanding more state support to endure them. Others are picking up on grievances that predated the pandemic.
In Poland, women took up their campaign against a renewed push by conservative activists to limit abortion rights, sidestepping a lockdown ban on public gatherings by posting slogans on social media, car windows and black umbrellas.
In Britain, environmentalists against a planned high-speed rail link, known as HS2, took advantage last month of a loophole in lockdown rules - you can still climb a tree.

""This tree is threatened by HS2 as are thousands up and down the country, but we can stop this,"" said Larch Maxey, one of several protesters who scaled a tree near an HS2 site outside London's Euston station, in a video posted on social media.

816,By Reuters,"<span>May 07, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>",Australian inquiry found Pell should have reported child sex abuse,"By Sonali Paul
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An Australian government-appointed inquiry into child sex abuse in the Catholic Church and other institutions found former Vatican treasurer Cardinal George Pell was aware of child sex abuse by at least two priests in the 1970's and 1980s and failed to take steps to get the priests removed.
Previously redacted sections of the Royal Commission's report, first issued in late 2017, were released on Thursday following Pell's acquittal last month on five counts of sexually assaulting two teenaged choirboys in the 1990s when he was archbishop of Melbourne.
The report from the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse said Pell was aware of child sexual abuse in the church by the 1970s. 
""We are also satisfied that by 1973 Cardinal Pell was not only conscious of child sexual abuse by clergy but that he also had considered measures of avoiding situations which might provoke gossip about it,"" said the Commission, the country's most powerful public inquiry forum.
The Commission did not look into specific abuse allegations against Pell, but focused on whether he and other church leaders in Australia were aware of thousands of incidents of abuse dating from the 1970s and what they did to address those issues over the next three decades.
During that period, Pell rose from being a priest in regional Australia to become archbishop of Melbourne, then archbishop of Sydney. 
The former Vatican treasurer was the most senior Catholic cleric worldwide to be jailed for child sex abuse. He was freed in April after just over a year in prison, when the High Court of Australia overturned his conviction on the grounds there was not enough evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.
The Commission found Pell was aware of allegations of child abuse by two priests, Father Peter Searson and Father Wilfred Baker, and should have pushed for their removal. It also rejected Pell's evidence that he was unaware of why Gerard Ridsdale, another offending priest, was being moved from one parish to another during the 1970s and 1980s.
Pell, who is now living in Sydney, did not immediately respond to a request for comment through his spokeswoman. He has previously denied allegations he was aware of sexual abuse in the church and failed to act.
The Catholic Church in Australia declined to comment and referred to statements from the archbishop of Melbourne and from Bishop Paul Bird of Ballarat, where Pell was an assistant priest from 1973 to 1984. The bishop said the diocese would considering the findings released on Thursday.
""I acknowledge the past failings in governance in the Diocese that allowed terrible abuse of so many children who were entitled to feel safe in their interactions with the church,"" he said in a statement.
The Royal Commission's five-year investigation was one of the world's biggest inquiries into child abuse and found several institutions, including the Catholic Church, had repeatedly failed to keep children safe with cultures of secrecy and cover-ups. 
The long awaited findings on Pell will now be studied by Victoria Police to assess whether any further investigations into abuse within the church are warranted. ""At this time it would not be appropriate to comment further about any possible action,"" a police spokeswoman said in an emailed comment. 
PAEDOPHILE PRIESTS 
Baker, who was sentenced in 1999 to four years' jail for child sex offences, was allowed to serve as a priest until 1997, even though there were complaints about him for years. He died in 2014.
""Archbishop Pell had the authority to remove Father Baker. Despite that knowledge, Archbishop Pell did not stand down Father Baker at that point in time,"" the Commission said in its findings.
Searson, who died in 2009, had faced a range of allegations of physical and sexual abuse over decades but was never charged with child sexual abuse.
The commission said Pell should have asked questions about why Ridsdale was being moved, given that he knew as early as 1973 that Ridsdale's actions, such as taking groups of boys away on overnight trips, were a risk. 
Ridsdale, in jail since 1994, has been convicted on more than 130 charges of sexually abusing children over nearly three decades. His lawyer declined to comment as Ridsdale is awaiting sentencing next week on further abuse charges. 
The commission did not hold Pell responsible for not pushing harder for investigations into two Christian Brothers, a religious community within the Catholic church, who were alleged to have abused children during Pell's time as an assistant priest in the town of Ballarat. 
""Father Pell said he had no jurisdiction 'in any sense' over the Christian Brothers. It was not unreasonable for Father Pell, as a diocesan priest, to believe it was not for him to raise the conduct of Brother Fitzgerald with the provincial,"" the commission said.

The commission's findings were held back by the government to avoid prejudicing Pell's two-year long court proceedings on allegations of abusing two boys at Melbourne's St Patrick's Cathedral was completed.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's two most populous states on Thursday refused to allow a one-day reprieve from strict limits on personal movement for Mother's Day this weekend, even as the country's rate of new coronavirus cases remains low.
The premiers of New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria said the states' roughly 14 million residents, 56% of the country's population, would have to stick to existing restrictions on movement on Mother's Day, which is celebrated nationally on Sunday. 
""Whilst national cabinet is considering easing some restrictions from Friday in terms of the national guidelines, I doubt very much that NSW will be in a position to implement anything before Mother's Day,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters on Thursday.
""We will be able to visit them, two adults and children at any one time, and of course that can happen multiple times a day as long as everybody is careful.""
NSW recently eased a stay-at-home order to allow social visits in groups of up to two, while some other states have also taken tentative steps to unwind lockdown measures, but most have kept restrictions broadly in place.
Australia has confirmed just under 6,900 COVID-19 cases, including 97 deaths. Twenty new infections were reported across four states on Thursday, the bulk linked to an outbreak at a meat processing plant in Victoria. The rate could rise as other states and territories report during the day. 
The federal government has said it will discuss the possible relaxation of nationwide ""social distancing"" rules on Friday at a meeting of an emergency cabinet formed to deal with the crisis, which includes state leaders.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has made increased testing and the downloading of a contact tracing smartphone app prerequisites for relaxing restrictions. 
About 700,000 of the country's 25 million people have been tested for the virus. About 5.2 million people have downloaded the tracking app, Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Thursday, just half the government's 10 million target.
""The last thing we want to do is to ease off any of those restrictions without a sense of confidence that we are truly on top of this,"" Victorian premier Daniel Andrews said, adding that he would not visit his mother on Sunday. ""Nobody is enjoying these settings, I understand that.""
In Tasmania state, Premier Peter Gutwein said ""the best present that you can provide for your mother is to keep her safe"".
Queensland state broke away to allow up to five adults to visit a private home on Sunday, but Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said other restrictions remained firmly in place.

""You can't go shopping, you can't go to the beach, you can't can't go further in that community, it's all about one household meeting with another household,"" she said.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi lawmakers approved a new government on Wednesday after six months without one as parties squabbled until the last minute over Cabinet seats in backroom deals.
Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi, Iraq's intelligence chief and a former journalist, will head the new government. He will begin his term without a full Cabinet, however, after several ministerial candidates were rejected.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the new government in a call with Kadhimi, the U.S. State Department said in a statement.
It also said Washington would renew for 120 days a waiver allowing Iraq to import electricity from Iran ""to help provide the right conditions for success"" of the new government.
Former prime minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who has been leading a caretaker government, resigned last year as anti-government protesters took to the streets in their thousands, demanding jobs and the departure of Iraq's ruling elite. 
They accuse the political class that took over after the 2003 U.S. invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein of corruption that has driven the country into dysfunction and economic ruin.
The battle over government portfolios since Abdul Mahdi's resignation in November prevented two previous nominees for prime minister from forming a Cabinet.
Kadhimi's candidates for Cabinet posts including interior, defence, finance and electricity passed with votes from a majority of lawmakers present. 
Voting on the oil and foreign ministries was delayed as the parties failed to agree on candidates. They rejected the incoming premier's picks for justice, agriculture and trade.
""The security, stability and blossoming of Iraq is our path,"" Kadhimi wrote on his Twitter account after parliament voted for his Cabinet.
He said he would make tackling the coronavirus pandemic, of which Iraq has suffered more than 2,000 cases and more than 100 deaths, a priority and hold to account those who had killed protesters in previous months of anti-government unrest.
Iraqi officials say Kadhimi is acceptable to both the United States and Iran, whose battle for influence over Iraq has boiled into open confrontation in the past year.
MULTIPLE CHALLENGES 
The United States killed Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani and his close ally the Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike next to Baghdad International Airport in January.
Iran responded with its first ever direct missile attack against U.S. forces at a base in Western Iraq several days later but did not kill anyone. 
Washington accuses paramilitary groups backed by Tehran of carrying out a series of rocket attacks on other bases in recent months, one of which killed three troops in the U.S.-led military coalition based in Iraq.
Rockets have regularly been fired near the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. None of the rocket attacks have been claimed by known Iran-backed groups.
Kadhimi's government must deal with an impending economic crisis precipitated by the coronavirus pandemic, which has caused the prices of oil - Iraq's principal source of revenue - to plummet.
It also faces a growing Islamic State insurgency as the extremist group steps up attacks on government troops from hideouts in remote areas of northern Iraq.

Iraq risks being caught up in any regional conflagration between Washington and Tehran, as militia groups vow revenge for the killing of Soleimani and Muhandis and President Donald Trump continues his bellicose rhetoric against Iran.

In its ruling against opposition petitioners, the Supreme Court also found that Netanyahu's unity government deal with his election rival Benny Gantz does not violate the law, dismissing arguments that it unlawfully shields him in a corruption trial.
The ruling removes a critical legal hurdle to the coalition government the right-wing Netanyahu and centrist Gantz plan to swear in next week, following three inconclusive elections in the past year. 
It also moves the country closer to ending its political deadlock as it grapples with the coronavirus crisis and its economic fallout. 
In unanimous rulings, the 11-justice panel ""found no legal basis to prevent Knesset member Netanyahu from forming the government"". 
But it added that its decision ""should not be construed as diminishing the gravity of the charges faced by against public probity, nor the difficulty posed by the tenure of a prime minister accused of crimes.""
The court added that Netanyahu has the right to presumption of innocence. 
Netanyahu was indicted in January on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He denies any wrongdoing in all three cases. 
The enormity of the coronavirus pandemic pushed Gantz to backtrack on a campaign pledge not to serve in a government led by a premier facing criminal charges, and instead sign an emergency unity deal with his rival. 
Under the terms of the deal, Netanyahu would serve as prime minister of a new administration for 18 months before handing the reins to Gantz.
Court petitioners, including opposition parties and democracy watchdogs, had argued that the pact shields Netanyahu from legal penalties -- in part by giving the premier what they saw as undue sway over the outcome of his own corruption trial.
The justices acknowledged that the former rivals' deal was ""unusual"" in the country's history, but said they had decided ""there are no grounds for interference in any of its clauses"". 
In a joint statement issued on Wednesday night, Netanyahu's Likud party and Gantz's Blue and White said they would hold a swearing-in ceremony for their government on May 13, ""following the completion of the legislative process this evening"".

Netanyahu, 70, was indicted in January on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He denies any wrongdoing in all three cases. His trial is set to open on May 24.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court's experiment in conducting oral arguments by teleconference this week - a change forced by the coronavirus pandemic - went rather smoothly right up until what sounded suspiciously like a toilet flush was broadcast to the world.
It occurred during the court's second argument on Wednesday and fourth of the week when liberal Justice Elena Kagan was questioning attorney Roman Martinez in a case involving a federal law cracking down on so-called robocalls. 
While Martinez was speaking, what sounded like a click and a rush of water could be heard on the audio feed provided by the court and broadcast live on cable channel C-SPAN and elsewhere. A clip of the audio quickly swirled around on social media.
Martinez said in an email the sound did not come from his end of the conversation. Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg did not immediately respond to a request seeking comment.
Wednesday was the third day that the justices heard arguments by teleconference instead of in person - a historic first for a tradition-bound court that has long been reluctant to embrace new technology, taken in response to the health risks posed by the pathogen. The justices will use the new format three days next week as well.
The various glitches encountered during the arguments were small. As in prior days, some justices on Wednesday could not immediately be heard when called upon by Chief Justice John Roberts, likely because they had forgotten to unmute their phones. Roberts each time gave them their turn later. 
In addition, in a couple of instances, cellphones could be heard pinging in the background. Roberts, before the second argument on the telephone law, said, ""Before we get started I'd like to remind everyone to turn their cellphones off.""
Justice Stephen Breyer missed his turn to ask questions, but when he finally got his chance he said the reason for his delay was that someone had tried to call him at the same time he was about to speak.
This week marked the first time the court had ever provided a live audio feed, making them the first arguments that the public could follow as they unfolded.
Justice Clarence Thomas, in a departure from his usual practice of remaining silent during arguments, asked questions during all four of the cases argued by teleconference. The call-in format also enabled Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who was hospitalized in Baltimore for treatment on Tuesday for a benign gall bladder condition, to take part in Wednesday's two arguments.

Advocates for greater transparency at the high court have seized on the teleconference format to renew their calls for the justices to make live coverage of arguments a permanent change.

The state of economic, social and environmental emergency allows the president to issue decrees without prior authorization from the Andean country's congress during times of crisis or a threat to Colombia's security. 
Under the Constitution, the government can declare a state of emergency for up to 30 days. The total period of rule by presidential decree cannot exceed more than 90 days a year, however.
The first state of emergency expired in April, although a separate health emergency - which ordered mandatory isolation for the elderly until the end of May among other measures - remained in place. 
Under the initial state of emergency, President Ivan Duque issued a raft of economic measures worth around $4 billion. The measures include support for family social welfare programs and the elderly as well as credit guarantees for some businesses. 
But Finance Minister Alberto Carrasquilla said more was needed, including support for businesses that will remain sidelined longer than expected due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""We are drawing it up,"" Carrasquilla said of a new state of emergency, speaking to a congressional commission during a virtual session on Wednesday.
Although he did not go into detail, calling it ""something we have to do,"" he said subsidies for small and medium-sized businesses were being considered to pay workers.
The country is under a nationwide lockdown until May 25.
On Tuesday, Duque said car sales and some industrial sectors could re-start beginning from May 11. But he warned that certain sectors will see a delayed return to normality.
Colombian fiscal authorities on Monday cleared the way for the government to widen its deficit to 6.1% of gross domestic product this year, owing to an expected 5.5% economic contraction.
The new deficit limit will allow the government to take on around 40 trillion pesos ($10.2 billion) in extra debt from a previous forecast, when a deficit reaching 2.2% of GDP was expected.

U.S. President Donald Trump has denied involvement. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the U.S. government would use ""every tool"" to secure the Americans return, if they were being held in Venezuela.
Denman, 34, in the video from an undisclosed location, answered questions from a person off-camera speaking in English. Denman said his mission was to secure the airport and establish outer security, though it was unclear how they planned to get Maduro on a plane.
In March, the U.S. Department of Justice charged Maduro and a dozen other current and former Venezuelan officials with ""narco-terrorism"" and the Trump administration offered a reward of $15 million for information leading to his arrest.
""I was helping Venezuelans take back control of their country,"" Denman, a former special operations forces member, said in the video.
Denman said he and Berry were contracted by Jordan Goudreau, an American military veteran who leads a Florida-based security company called Silvercorp USA, to train about 50 Venezuelans in Colombia in January for the operation. Goudreau supplied the group with equipment, Denman said.
Venezuelan authorities said they arrested the group by the isolated coastal town of Chuao, about 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of Caracas' airport, after locals raised suspicions. Authorities published photos of what they said was the group's boat, loaded with ammunition, weapons and communication equipment. 
Eight people involved in the same operation were killed on Sunday in La Guaira state, near Caracas, Maduro's government said.
Maduro had originally said he would show videos of the two, but did not end up showing a video of Berry.
Denman said Silvercorp had signed a contract with Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido to seek Maduro's removal. Guaido's team, in a statement, said they had ""no relationship with any company in the security and defense branch,"" including Silvercorp.
Venezuela would seek the Goudreau's extradition, Maduro said. Goudreau has confirmed his role in the operation, and could not be immediately reached for comment on Wednesday.
Maduro said that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, via drug cartels, were the ""operational and logistical part of this conspiracy.""
A DEA spokeswoman said the DEA had no involvement in the events.

After Denman's televised statement, a U.S. State Department spokesman reiterated that the U.S. government had nothing to do with the incident. The official declined comment on Denman's claims.

832,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>","Up to 1,200 deployed in Libya by Russian military group: U.N. report","By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russian private military contractor Wagner Group has up to 1,200 people deployed in Libya, strengthening the forces of eastern-based military leader Khalifa Haftar, according to a confidential United Nations report seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
The 57-page report by independent sanctions monitors, submitted to the U.N. Security Council Libya sanctions committee, said the Russian contractor deployed forces in specialized military tasks, including sniper teams. 
Haftar launched a war a year ago to grab the capital Tripoli and other parts of northwest Libya. Since 2014, Libya has been split between areas controlled by the internationally recognized Government of National Accord in Tripoli and the northwest, and territory held by Haftar's eastern-based forces in Benghazi.
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia, while the government is backed by Turkey. The U.N. Security Council imposed an arms embargo on Libya in 2011 amid an uprising that ousted longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi.
The sanctions monitors said that while they could not independently verify the scale of the deployment to Libya by Wagner Group, ""based on open source reporting and the limited sightings assesses that the maximum number of individual private military operatives deployed to be no more than 800 to 1,200.""
""Their deployment has acted as an effective force multiplier for (Haftar),"" the sanctions monitors wrote. 
When asked in January if the Wagner Group were fighting in Libya, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that if there are Russians in Libya, they are not representing the Russian state, nor are they paid by the state.
Wagner Group did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
'NO HELP' TO LIBYAN PEOPLE
Russian private military contractors have clandestinely fought in support of Russian forces in Syria and Ukraine, Reuters and other media have previously reported. The Russian state denies it uses private military contractors abroad.
The U.N. sanctions monitors identified more than two dozen flights between Russia and eastern Libya from August 2018 to August 2019 by civilian aircraft ""strongly linked to, or owned by"" Wagner Group or related companies.
The monitors also listed the details of 122 Wagner operatives of ""whom many are highly probably operational, or have been operational, within Libya."" They said 39 were from Wagner's specialist sniper group and the remaining 83 operatives were from Wagner combat units.
The report said forces affiliated with the Government of National Accord had captured arms ""typical of the weaponry observed being used by ChVK Wagner operatives elsewhere in eastern Ukraine and Syria."" 
The monitors are also investigating social media reports that a six-month contract between Wagner and Haftar ended on Oct. 15 last year and accusations that by this time Hafter had only paid half of the more $173 million owed. 
Across Wagner Group, personnel are predominantly Russian, but also include citizens of Belarus, Moldova, Serbia and Ukraine, the report said. It also said they have been identified using equipment typically reserved for Russia's armed forces.
When asked about the use of private military contractors in Libya on Wednesday, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said it was a matter of concern for Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
""It is of no help to the people of Libya who are in dire need of political reconciliation so peace can return to their country,"" Dujarric told reporters.

833,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Georgian ex-president Saakashvili to get Ukraine reform role: sources,"By Ilya Zhegulev
KIEV (Reuters) - Mikheil Saakashvili, the former president of Georgia, is set to join a Ukrainian advisory body on reforms, two sources in President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's office told Reuters.
Saakashvili's appointment will mark another comeback for one of the most recognisable figures in post-Soviet politics, who also served for a brief but turbulent spell in Ukraine under Zelenskiy's predecessor Petro Poroshenko. 
A presidential decree confirming Saakashvili's appointment to lead the executive committee of Ukraine's National Reform Council, first reported by local media on Wednesday, is expected on Thursday, the sources said.
The council, which is chaired by the president, is an advisory body set up by Poroshenko in 2014 to carry out the strategic planning and coordinated implementation of reforms.
Saakashvili said last month that he had been offered the post of deputy prime minister, an appointment that needed to be confirmed by parliament. But momentum petered out after Saakashvili held consultations with lawmakers. 
But news of his planned move needled Georgia's government, which said it was ""unacceptable"" for Saakashvili to be deputy prime minister given he had been convicted of several crimes. It threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Kiev for consultations. 
CITIZENSHIP 
Saakashvili was brought in to run the southern Odessa region of Ukraine by Poroshenko, based on a track record of fighting corruption as Georgian president after the 2003 Rose Revolution. 
But he resigned a year later, accusing Poroshenko of corruption, which Poroshenko denied.
The Ukrainian authorities stripped Saakashvili of his citizenship when he was abroad, but he barged his way through a checkpoint at the Polish border to get back into Ukraine in September 2017, only to be deported five months later.
He returned last year after Zelenskiy restored his citizenship in one of his first official acts as president. 
A Georgian court sentenced Saakashvili in absentia to six years in prison in June 2018 for abuse of power and seeking to cover up evidence about the 2005 beating of an opposition member of parliament when he was president. 
    Saakashvili, who has denied all charges against him, was sentenced to a separate three years in prison in January 2018 after he was convicted of seeking to cover up evidence about the murder of a Georgian banker.

His supporters said the verdict was politically motivated, while Western countries expressed concern that the Georgian Dream government, which came to power after defeating Saakashvili's party in 2012 elections, had used selective justice and political persecution against opponents.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A 97-year-old Russian World War Two veteran has taken inspiration from the record-breaking charity efforts of British centenarian Captain Tom Moore and raised $27,500 for the families of doctors who died of COVID-19.
Zinaida Korneva, who reached the rank of senior sergeant in the Red Army and served in the Soviet Union's anti-aircraft forces, has also knitted a pair of socks as a gift to Moore.
The British war veteran, who turned 100 last month, gained international fame when he completed 100 laps of his garden with the help of a walking frame to raise funds for the National Health Service's fight against the coronavirus.
He has earned over 30 million pounds ($37 million), having originally set out to raise 1,000 pounds.
""You're a strong person and a real soldier,"" Korneva told Moore in a video addressed to him on YouTube. ""We defeated fascism together in 1945. And now we're battling this virus together.""
Korneva, who fought with Soviet forces in Stalingrad, has set a fundraising target of 3 million roubles ($40,187) and, instead of doing laps of the garden, is recounting her war stories on YouTube.
The clips will be uploaded regularly ahead of May 9, when Russia marks the Soviet victory in World War Two. Russia usually celebrates the event with a military parade across Red Square (NYSE:SQ), but it has been postponed this year because of the pandemic.
One video on YouTube shows Korneva knitting a pair of socks for Moore before folding them into a parcel with a letter due to be delivered to him. 
""My children and grandchildren showed me a video clip of Tom Moore. I watched it and I really liked the idea. I decided to take up this question in Russia,"" Korneva said, wearing a jacket adorned with medals. 
As in many other countries, Russia's doctors have been disproportionately hit by the coronavirus. 
The total number of confirmed cases in Russia rose by more than 10,000 on Wednesday for a fourth consecutive day and now stands at 165,929, although at 1,537, the death toll remains far lower than in many other countries.
Korneva said she had decided to direct her fundraising campaign towards the bereaved families of doctors because her daughter and granddaughter were doctors and she knew the strain they were under.

Pompeo told a news conference the delay was to allow the report to ""to allow it to account for any additional actions that Beijing may be contemplating in the run up"" to China's May 22 National People’s Congress ""that would further undermine the people of Hong Kong's autonomy.""
The ""Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act"" approved by the U.S. Congress and President Donald Trump last year requires the State Department to certify at least annually that the former British colony retains enough autonomy to justify the favorable U.S. trading terms that have helped it maintain its position as a world financial center.
Under it, officials responsible for human rights violations in Hong Kong could also be subject to sanctions, including visa bans and asset freezes.
Hong Kong was rocked in 2019 by months of massive, and sometimes violent, political protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial and calls for greater democracy. 
China's Hong Kong affairs office warned earlier on Wednesday that the city will never be calm unless ""black-clad violent protesters"" were all removed, describing them as a ""political virus"" seeking independence from Beijing.
Riot police dispersed a crowd of 300 pro-democracy activists late last month, the first sizable protest since the government imposed a ban on public meetings at the end of March to curb coronavirus infections.
The arrests of 15 activists in April, including veteran politicians, a publishing tycoon and senior barristers, thrust the protest movement back into the spotlight and drew condemnation from Washington and international rights groups.

Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, and the territory was promised a ""high degree of autonomy"" for 50 years, something that has formed the basis of the territory's special status under U.S. law.

839,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 01:16PM ET</span>","Germany eases lockdown, with 'emergency brake' on hand if needed","By Madeline Chambers and Paul Carrel
BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel announced steps on Wednesday to ease the coronavirus lockdown in Germany but at the same time launched an ""emergency brake"" mechanism allowing for renewed restrictions in case infections pick up again.
Declaring an end to the first phase of the pandemic in Germany, Merkel said there was still a long way to go in the battle against the virus, which has battered Europe's largest economy.
The government will decide on an economic stimulus package in June, Merkel said, adding this was a ""very ambitious"" time frame.
Germany went into lockdown in March to contain coronavirus contagion. Its reproduction rate has been falling for several days, and Merkel said it was now consistently below 1 - meaning a person with the virus infects fewer than one other on average.
""We are at a point where our goal of slowing the spread of the virus has been achieved and we have been able to protect our health system..., so it has been possible to discuss and agree on further easing measures,"" Merkel told reporters.
Under measures agreed with Germany's 16 federal state leaders, people from two households will be allowed to meet, and more shops will open, provided hygiene measures are in place.
But guidelines on people keeping a distance of 1.5 metres (5 feet) from each other and wearing mouth and nose masks on public transport will remain in place.
Germany's Bundesliga soccer league can resume in the second half of May, Merkel said. 
Schools would gradually start reintroducing all pupils and emergency care for kindergarten-aged children would be expanded, with details to be regulated by the states.
People in care homes may again receive regular visits from ""a permanent contact person"", Merkel said after talks with regional leaders.
Their plan includes an ""emergency brake"", a fail-safe under which restrictions would be reintroduced if an area registers more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within seven days.
""If something happens locally, we won't wait until it has spread through the whole republic, but rather we will act locally,"" Merkel said.
She said she had a good feeling about Wednesday's decisions, particularly given the emergency brake, but warned: ""We have to be careful that we don't lose control of this thing.""
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 947 to 164,807, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed earlier on Wednesday. The reported death toll rose by 165 to 6,996.
The federal and state governments will wait and see how the easing measures pan out, Merkel said, adding: ""We now face a phase in which there will be a lot more (person-to-person) contact than was the case up to now.""

""We are following a bold path. We can afford to be a bit bold but we must remain cautious.""

840,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",U.S. announces $225 million in emergency aid to Yemen,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will provide $225 million in emergency aid to Yemen to support food programs, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, as aid groups there are forced to scale down operations due to Houthi interference and amid a spreading coronavirus outbreak. 
""This assistance will provide the U.N. World Food Program’s emergency food operation in southern Yemen, as well as a reduced operation in northern Yemen, which the WFP was forced to scale down earlier this month because of the ongoing interference of (the) Iran-backed Houthis"" Pompeo told a news conference.
Yemen is already grappling with the world's biggest humanitarian crisis caused by a war between the Saudi-led coalition seeking to restore the internationally recognized government, and the Houthi movement that drove the government from power in Sanaa in late 2014.
Around 80% of Yemen's population, or 24 million people, rely on aid, and 10 million are facing famine. Yemen has the world's fourth highest internally displaced population and healthcare is scarce in rural areas.
The country has reported a total of 26 coronavirus infections with 6 deaths but due to inadequate testing and a shattered health system aid groups fear a devastating outbreak. According to WHO only 200 tests with results have been delivered nationwide.
Under such circumstances, a gap in aid funding is a major risk. The United Nations last week warned that 31 of 41 major U.N. humanitarian assistance programmes will scale down or stop in coming weeks without more money as donors and aid agencies have increasingly complained of interference and obstruction from Houthi authorities.

Reuters reported last month the United States was readying a ""substantial contribution"" to help Yemen but that it had to find alternatives to the WHO after President Donald Trump criticized the agency being ""China-centric"" over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, and paused funding.

841,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",WHO warns of new lockdowns if transition not managed carefully,"By Emma Farge and John Revill
GENEVA/ZURICH (Reuters) - The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday warned of the risks of returning to lockdown if countries emerging from pandemic restrictions do not manage transitions ""extremely carefully and in a phased approach"".
Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus listed a series of steps needed before countries lift measures designed to control the spread of the COVID-19 respiratory disease, such as surveillance controls and health system preparedness.
""The risk of returning to lockdown remains very real if countries do not manage the transition extremely carefully and in a phased approach,"" he said at a virtual briefing in Geneva.
Tedros, who has come under fire for his handling of the outbreak, said that he would conduct an ""after-action"" assessment of the agency's response, but wait until the pandemic recedes to do so.
""While the fire is raging I think our focus should not be divided,"" he said.
He defended the WHO's record on warning about the potential for human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus, saying it informed the world of that in early January.
The Geneva-based body has been accused of being ""China centric"" by top donor the United States, which has cut off funding to the body.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said he has ""evidence"" that the new coronavirus emerged from a laboratory in Wuhan, China, whereas scientists have advised the WHO that it is of animal origin.
WHO epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhove said that the agency was discussing a further ""academic"" mission to China to look at the virus origins.
""Without knowing where the animal origin is it is difficult for us to prevent this from happening again,"" she said.
""There is discussion with counterparts in China for a further mission which would be more academic in focus and really focus on looking at what happened at the beginning in terms of the exposures with different animals so that we can look to have an approach to find the zoonotic source,"" she added.
Tedros stressed the need for investment in health systems now to save lives later.

""The COVID-19 pandemic will eventually recede but there can be no going back to business as usual,"" he said. He also urged countries to address inequalities that he said were ""fuelling"" the pandemic.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Warsaw preschool director Beata Mizerska says she understands why the city's liberal local council ordered her nursery to stay closed, despite Poland's conservative government allowing nurseries to reopen from Wednesday, four days before a presidential election.
""It is a very short time to put in place all of the procedures from the chief sanitary inspector,"" she said.
""(We have) to measure the temperature of the parent, measure the temperature of the child... (have a) specific number of children in the rooms and all the time have to disinfect everything.""
Nevertheless, she says she feels ""immense sadness"" at not being able to welcome the children back.
""We really miss the children, we miss that noise, that cry of joy as a welcome,"" she said.
When Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on April 29 that shopping centres, hotels and preschools could reopen in the week before the election which the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party wants to hold as a postal ballot, critics said the timing might not be a coincidence. 
""The plan to open up the economy... seems to be a bit haphazard and a bit political in a sense that I think that the government wants to prove beyond any doubt that it is possible to organise elections in May,"" said the mayor of Warsaw, Rafal Trzaskowski, of the liberal opposition party Civic Platform (PO).
Marta Jagodzinska, 37, an office worker from the northern port city of Gdynia who has two daughters aged five and two, also thinks the election influenced the decision.
""I think that it's mainly due to the elections... our government is trying to show us as much as possible that the situation has become normal but it's not in my opinion,"" she said. 
Trzaskowski said he plans to reopen preschools later in May.
""We are concerned about safety and here three of four weeks makes a hell of a difference,"" he said.
Poland, a country of 38 million, has reported 14,740 cases of the coronavirus and 733 deaths. 
UNFREEZING THE ECONOMY 
When asked about the allegations that election considerations had influenced the decision to reopen preschools, Education Minister Dariusz Piontkowski said the move was part of the government's efforts to restart the economy, which has been brought to a virtual standstill by the pandemic.
""We want to avoid serious economic problems and as long as some families don't go back to work it will be difficult to unblock the economy,"" he told Reuters.
He said the decision was informed by a stabilisation in the number of infections and the needs of parents who want to work. 
""I think it is essential (to open preschools) so we are able to go to work,"" said Gdynia resident and mother of two Justyna Gabka, 34, who runs an optician's shop.

It was unclear on Wednesday how many preschools opted to reopen, as councils in some regions told them to stay closed.

NEW PALTZ, New York (Reuters) - For 56 days, the coronavirus pandemic kept Howard Smith apart from Lois Kittson, his wife of half a century. Their separation ended this week with a short but stirring reunion – at a safe distance – outside her nursing home in upstate New York.
Howard, who for years had visited his wife almost every day at the home, was able to meet Lois for 35 minutes Tuesday at the entryway of the New Paltz Center facility where she has lived since 2015 as a late-stage Alzheimer's patient. The visit came with special precautions in the coronavirus era: No touching was allowed. Howard had to wear a mask and stay more than six feet from Lois.
Howard's eyes lit up when Lois, wrapped in a blanket and wearing a sun hat, was rolled out of the nursing home in her wheelchair, with assistance from the facility's activities director. He spent the visit calmly bringing her up to date on news of the world, their family home in New York's Hudson (NYSE:HUD) River Valley, and their 27-year-old daughter, Laurel, in Manhattan, who hopes to join him for another visit soon.
Lois, whose illness has taken away her ability to speak, smiled several times and made faint noises. It is her way of communicating joy, Howard said.
Last month, Reuters published a story about the couple's life together, culminating in their recent separation during the pandemic. As COVID-19 ravages vulnerable populations in nursing homes across America and the world, it was unclear whether Howard and Lois would ever see each other again.
Their visit may offer a glimmer of hope for thousands of families separated from loved ones who live in U.S. nursing homes. Even as expectations grow that the coronavirus pandemic will drag on for many months, the reunion underscores how U.S. nursing homes and other long-term elder-care facilities are trying to arrange for limited visits without putting residents or staff at risk.
Across the country, the facilities that house more than 1.5 million vulnerable seniors have been in lockdown since March. Banning visitation is meant to keep the virus at bay, but for loved ones, it's been a painful separation. During normal times, family visits are a vital part of weekly routines for many residents, including those with dementia like Lois.
For weeks in many nursing homes, phone calls and video have been the only means of checking in on loved ones. But as the pandemic continues, many of the facilities are coming up with creative solutions to allow non-traditional visits.
Some offer staff-supervised patio or parking lot visits, as long as family members and residents keep their distance. Others encourage so-called window visits, in which loved ones can interact with residents separated by glass, singing ""Happy Birthday,"" eating a common meal on either side, or bringing signs to cheer up residents.
In addition, nursing homes in New York and elsewhere are introducing new measures to ensure residents and staff can all be tested for the coronavirus. New York also now requires nursing home operators to inform families when residents at a facility have tested positive. To date, the New Paltz Center facility has reported no cases of COVID-19.
After Tuesday's meeting, Howard said he felt a deep sense of relief that his wife remains stable and well taken care of by staff at the home. He said the nursing home should be ""commended for making these efforts"" and hopes it's just the first of many such visits.
""One robin doesn't make a spring, but she was pretty engaged,"" he said. ""This was an experience for her, and it was reassuring to me.""
Of the distancing requirement, Howard said it was perfectly understandable, and a small price to pay for the chance to see his wife again.

""It wasn't as good as being next to her, but I was OK with it.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government will use “every tool” available to secure the return of Americans if they are being held in Venezuela, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vowed on Wednesday, after Venezuelan officials said they had captured two U.S. “mercenaries” in a failed armed incursion.
""There was no U.S. government direct involvement in this operation,” Pompeo told reporters, echoing President Donald Trump’s remarks a day earlier. He added: “(If) we’d have been involved, it would have gone differently.”
Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said on Monday that authorities there had detained a pair of U.S. citizens working with a U.S. military veteran who has claimed responsibility for the foiled incursion, launched last weekend.
Pompeo stopped short of confirming the Americans’ detention but called it a “consular matter.""
“We will start the process of trying to figure a way, if in fact these are Americans that are there, that we can figure out a path forward,” he said. “We want to get every American back. If the Maduro regime decides to hold them, we will use every tool that we have available to try and get them back.”
Asked who may have bankrolled the operation, Pompeo said: “We're not prepared to share any more information about what we know took place.""
Maduro said authorities arrested 13 ""terrorists"" involved in what he described as a plot coordinated with Washington to enter the country via the Caribbean coast and oust him. Eight people were killed, Venezuelan authorities said.
Maduro on Monday showed what he said were the U.S. passports and other identification belonging to Airan Berry, 41, and Luke Denman, 34. He said they were in custody and had been working with Jordan Goudreau, an American military veteran who leads a Florida-based security company. All three men are former U.S. special operations force members.
Washington has waged a campaign of sanctions and diplomatic measures against Venezuela in an effort to oust Maduro, a socialist leader they accuse of rigging elections in 2018. But the Trump administration has shown no apparent interest in military action.
Maduro's government says the United States wants to control the OPEC member nation's massive oil reserves.
Since early 2019, the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate interim president.
But Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela's military as well as Russia, Cuba and China, which some U.S. officials say privately is a source of frustration for Trump.

Guaido - often derided by Maduro as a U.S. puppet - has cast doubt on the government's version of Sunday's events.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 87 the oldest member of the U.S. Supreme Court, participated in oral arguments on Wednesday a day after being hospitalized to undergo treatment for a benign gall bladder condition, the latest in a series of medical issues. 
The argument in a case involving a dispute over an Obamacare requirement that employers that offer employees health insurance provide coverage for women's birth control was conducted by teleconference amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
Ginsburg, who was treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, posed lengthy questions expressing doubt over a bid by President Donald Trump's adminstration to implement rules allowing employers to obtain religious exemptions from the contraception mandate.
The liberal justice told Solicitor General Noel Francisco that the administration has ""tossed entirely to the wind what Congress considered to be essential, that women be provided this service, with no hassle and no cost to them.""
Ginsburg had a gallstone that had caused an infection and was treated non-surgically, court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said on Tuesday, adding that the justice was to remain hospitalized for a day or two. Ginsburg has experienced a number of serious health issues in recent years, including treatment for pancreatic cancer last year. 
Tuesday's hospitalization could present a risk as it comes amid a pandemic that continues to surge throughout the United States and around the world. The coronavirus has proven to be particularly dangerous in elderly people, especially those with underlying medical issues. Three of the nine justices are over age 70, including Ginsburg as well as Justices Stephen Breyer (81) and Clarence Thomas (71).
The hospital on Wednesday referred questions to the court about how it is handling Ginsburg's presence. The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Ginsburg's was treated for an inflammatory condition of the gallbladder known as acute cholecystitis. Following an oral argument session on Monday, tests found that a gallstone that had migrated to Ginsburg's cystic duct, a tube that empties the gallbladder, blocking it and causing an infection, Arberg said. 
Ginsburg has had several health scares in recent years. In November 2018, she broke three ribs in a fall. Subsequent medical tests led to treatment for lung cancer that caused her to miss oral arguments in January 2019. She returned to the bench, but said in August that she had received radiation therapy to treat pancreatic cancer. 
Most recently, Ginsburg was hospitalized in November for two nights suffering from a fever and chills, but returned to work at the court the day after being released.

Her health is closely watched because a Supreme Court vacancy would give Republican President Donald Trump the opportunity to appoint a third justice to the nine-member court and prod it further to the right. The court currently has a 5-4 conservative majority including two justices appointed by Trump.

The country of 11.5 million people, among the European nations worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, began easing lockdown restrictions at the start of this week, allowing businesses that do not have contact with consumers to restart.
Belgium, whose capital Brussels hosts the headquarters of the European Union and the NATO military alliance, has 50,781 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 8,339 deaths. However, the rate of new cases, hospital admissions and deaths has fallen steadily from early April peaks.
From Sunday, Mother's Day, Belgian families will be able to host up to four people, and always the same people, at their homes while respecting a social distance. Ideally, this would be outside, such as in a garden or on a terrace.
""I recognise this does not replace the pleasure of being able to embrace someone you love, but we cannot do more for the time being,"" Wilmes told a news conference
The day after, all stores will be able to open, although they will have to limit the number of shoppers inside and make changes to protect staff. Shoppers are strongly encouraged but not obliged to wear masks.

Markets cannot reopen. Cafes, restaurants, sports, cultural centres and tourist sites will also have to remain closed. Sports competitions will not restart before August.

(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge has dismissed a worker advocacy group's lawsuit accusing Smithfield Foods Inc, the world's largest pork processor, of failing to adequately protect employees from the novel coronavirus at a plant in Missouri.
Smithfield is already taking many of the steps called for by the Rural Community Workers Alliance, including screening production-line workers for symptoms and installing barriers between them, U.S. District Judge Greg Kays in Kansas City, Missouri said in his ruling on Tuesday. 
Kays also said that under President Donald Trump's executive order in April requiring meatpacking plants to remain open during the pandemic, the federal government, and not the courts, were responsible for overseeing working conditions. 
Virginia-based Smithfield, which is owned by China's WH Group (OTC:WHGLY) Ltd, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
David Muraskin, a lawyer for the advocacy group, on Wednesday said the decision was disappointing but that the lawsuit had spurred Smithfield to make changes in response to workers' concerns.
""We wish that Smithfield would do more, but the decision shows that workers can organize and move companies to make changes, and that's a really important development,"" Muraskin said.
In the lawsuit filed last month, the RCWA accused Smithfield of creating a ""public nuisance"" by failing to protect workers at the Milan, Missouri plant and endangering the surrounding community. 
Smithfield responded that it had implemented protections recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and other agencies. 
The company said the lawsuit should be dismissed because OSHA is already conducting an investigation of the Milan plant, and government agencies are continually changing their guidance for the industry.
Kays agreed in his decision on Tuesday.
""Under these circumstances, where the guidelines are rapidly evolving, maintaining a uniform source for guidance and enforcement is crucial,"" the judge wrote.
Smithfield has closed other pork-processing plants in Missouri, Wisconsin and South Dakota after outbreaks of coronavirus cases among workers. Companies like  Tyson Foods  Inc (NYSE:TSN), Cargill Inc and National Beef Packing Co have also shut U.S. meat plants during the pandemic. 

Last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that about 4,200 workers at meat and poultry plants had contracted the novel coronavirus, and 20 had died.

850,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",UK denies sacrificing care homes; Johnson says situation improving,"By Kylie MacLellan and Elizabeth Piper
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday the situation in care homes had improved, after his health minister denied Britain had prioritised hospitals over many elderly people in homes in its fight against the coronavirus outbreak.
A Reuters investigation found policies designed to prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed pushed a greater burden onto care homes which struggled to get access to tests and protective equipment.
Johnson and his government have been criticised by opposition parties and some scientists for their response to the outbreak of the coronavirus, with many raising questions over the testing strategy, provision of protective equipment and timing of a lockdown which has all but shut the economy.
The government has countered that it took the right decisions at the right time, but has also acknowledged an earlier mass testing programme would have been beneficial and that it has more to do in dealing with the virus' spread in care homes.
Asked by a member of the public during a question session on Sky News whether the government had sacrificed the elderly in residential homes to ensure the health service was not overrun, health minister Matt Hancock said: ""No we didn’t do this ... we have, from the start, worked very hard to protect people in care homes.""
Hancock said the government had put a ""huge amount of effort and resources behind supporting care homes"", but Britain had not had the capacity to test more widely early in the outbreak.
Asked about the situation in care homes by opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer, Johnson told parliament: ""He is absolutely right to say there is an epidemic going on in care homes which is something I bitterly regret and we have been working very hard for weeks to get it down.
""He is not right in what he just said about the state of the epidemic in care homes. If he looks at the figures in the last few days there has been a palpable improvement. We must hope that that continues and we will ensure that it does continue.""
Ministers have repeatedly said that questions over Britain's handling of the crisis should come after it has been overcome.
But on Tuesday, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics, the United Kingdom overtook Italy to report the highest official death toll from the new coronavirus in Europe, prompting fresh questions over its approach.
REVIEW
After more than six weeks of lockdown, Britain will review its stringent social distancing measures on Thursday, and set out details of its plan for the next phase on Sunday.
Officials suggest there will be a gradual move towards re-opening businesses.
The Times reported the government has drawn up a three-stage plan to ease the lockdown, with the first involving small shops reopening alongside outdoor workplaces. 
Large shopping centres would be in the second phase with more people encouraged to go into work, and pubs, restaurants, hotels and leisure centres would be among the last to open, it said. 
""This is not going to be a case of flicking a switch and people will have to prepare for a different type of normal,"" the prime minister's spokesman said.

""We will obviously want to ensure that any easements that we do make are carefully monitored and we aren't doing things which risk increasing the rate of infection.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, the son of Britain's Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan, celebrated his first birthday on Wednesday, with his parents marking the occasion with a video of his mother reading him a story.
In footage posted on the Instagram page of the Save the Children charity, Meghan reads giggling Archie, who is pictured wearing a simple white bodysuit, one of his favourite books, ""Duck! Rabbit!"".
The video was recorded last weekend by Harry, who can be heard chuckling and cheering from behind the camera.
Archie is the seventh-in-line to the British throne and Queen Elizabeth's eighth great-grandchild. His parents, who have become huge global celebrities since their star-studded wedding in 2018, are officially known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex but their son has no title.
The family are now living in Los Angeles after Harry and Meghan stepped down from their royal roles at the end of March to forge new careers. Their exit caused a crisis in the royal family, and came after a reported rift with Harry's elder brother Prince William and growing hostility to the media's intense coverage. 
A spokesman for the couple, who had to give up their SussexRoyal Instagram page and branding as part of the deal to exit their royal duties, said they had chosen to publish Archie's video on the charity's page to highlight its campaign to support children impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
""As they celebrate this family moment, the Duke and Duchess wanted to continue to raise awareness around the urgency of bringing food and learning resources to millions of children,"" the spokesman said. 
Members of the royal family posted messages and pictures on social media to mark the occasion.
""Wishing Archie a very happy first birthday today!"" Kensington Palace, the office of Prince William, said on Twitter.
Archie's birth at London's Portland Hospital last May was shrouded in secrecy after the couple declined to disclose any details beforehand and then only allowed a small, select group of media access for a brief photocall to show him off two days later.
While the couple wanted the birth to be a private matter, newspapers, for whom stories about the royals are popular with many readers, felt that as members of the British royal family, they needed to recognise that the public which funded the institution had a right to know about it. 
The criticism over Archie's birth marked the first overt deterioration in the couple's relations with the press, which ultimately was a key factor in their decision to step back from their royal lives.

The Sussexes said last month they would have ""zero engagement"" with four of Britain's top tabloids while on Friday, Meghan lost an initial part of her legal claim against one newspaper for breaching her privacy by printing parts of a letter she had sent to her estranged father.

RAMALLAH, West Bank/GAZA (Reuters) - One man has become the face of the Palestinians' response to the COVID-19 crisis, and it's not President Mahmoud Abbas.
Rather it is Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh, an economist-turned-politician whose prominence in tackling the coronavirus has led many Palestinians to predict that he may one day succeed 84-year-old Abbas as president.
For Shtayyeh - an unelected Abbas appointee - the urgency of the Palestinian Authority (PA) efforts to curb the virus have helped reinvigorate the domestic image of a body long viewed by some as corrupt and unproductive.
Some 96 percent of West Bank Palestinians trust the way the PA under Shtayyeh has handled the pandemic, said a recent poll by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Centre.
The West Bank has recorded 354 cases and just two deaths. After an outbreak in Bethlehem in March the PA moved quickly to impose a full lockdown, fearing its weak health system would be overwhelmed.
""The current crisis has bolstered Shtayyeh's presence and cemented the impression that he might be the next president,"" said political analyst Akram Atallah.
""He has brandished an image as a successful administrator in the eyes of the media, a leader who can be trusted to navigate a pandemic.""
Shtayyeh has consistently said he does not harbour ambitions of the presidency, deferring instead to senior colleagues in the umbrella Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) and Fatah, the party that has long dominated it.
DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD
Certainly, as Palestinian president and chairman of the PLO, Abbas still holds the levers of power.
It is Abbas who retains final authority to impose and lift coronavirus restrictions, acting through press releases and rare television appearances. 
But Shtayyeh, a Fatah loyalist two decades younger than Abbas, has taken the podium each week to reassure Palestinians.
So far, it has helped his rise. But prominence is a double-edged sword: if things go wrong, he will likely shoulder much of the blame.
Shtayyeh's grasp of financial issues facing ordinary Palestinians has earned him respect. He was born in the village of Tell, near Nablus, before going on to earn a PhD in economic development from the University of Sussex in Britain.
Before Abbas installed him as prime minister in 2019, the fluent English-speaking Shtayyeh headed the Palestinian Economic Council for Development and Reconstruction, a donor coordination institution.
But some criticise what they call his ""capitalist"" background - a criticism also levelled at his technocrat predecessor, Salam Fayyad, who was seen as too close to the West.
Unlike Fayyad, Shtayyeh has the advantage of belonging to Fatah.
STAGNATION
Palestinian political institutions have stagnated, without any presidential or parliamentary elections for more than a decade, and any successor, no matter who it is, will inherit a multitude of problems.
Negotiations with Israel broke down in 2014, relations with the United States are at an all-time nadir and the PA's power base is now confined to parts of the occupied West Bank after the Islamist group Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007.
Beyond coronavirus, Shtayyeh has failed to reconcile with Hamas, and his government has been squeezed by U.S. aid cuts and tax and trade disputes with Israel.
Shtayyeh also faces internal opposition from Fatah power brokers and security chiefs, who themselves harbour leadership ambitions, said sources within the group.
Two Fatah sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said some establishment figures initially backed Shtayyeh, but now regard him as ""a threat"".
""They thought (Shtayyeh) would serve as an employee at their service, but he proved he could work without them,"" said one.
""Abbas is holding on to power. He keeps his grip on security, foreign affairs and finance,"" said another insider.
But Fatah official Fahmy Azzaarir said Shtayyeh's main focus was the pandemic, not succession.

""We all hope the prime minister will succeed in getting us out of the crisis,"" Azzaarir said. ""Everyone must support him.""

854,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Israel plans thousands of new homes for West Bank settlement,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel announced a plan for thousands of new Jewish settlement homes in the occupied West Bank on Wednesday as Washington voiced readiness to back de facto Israeli annexations there.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is trying to clinch a deal to form a coalition government, wants to start cabinet discussions on July 1 about declaring Israeli sovereignty over the settlements and the strategically important Jordan Valley in the West Bank.
Fresh construction for the settlement of Efrat was approved on land that could accommodate ""around 7,000 housing units"", Defence Minister Naftali Bennett's office said in a statement.
""The building momentum in the country must not be stopped, even for a second,"" tweeted Bennett, a religious-nationalist in Netanyahu's current caretaker government.
The settlements are deemed illegal by most world powers and condemned by the Palestinians, who see all the West Bank, which Israel captured in a 1967 war, as theirs for a future state. 
The United States has offered to recognise Israeli sovereignty in the West Bank as part of a proposal President Donald Trump unveiled in February, which also envisages talks on founding a Palestinian state in up to 70% of the territory. 
""Sovereignty in Judea and Samaria (the West Bank) and the Valley is an Israeli decision. We are ready,"" the newspaper Israel Hayom quoted U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman as saying.
In separate remarks to the Jerusalem Post newspaper, Friedman reiterated a call for Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking:
""The expectation is that the prime minister will agree to negotiate and, if the Palestinians show up, he will negotiate in good faith based on this (Trump) plan.""
The Palestinians say the plan is biased against them, and have boycotted Washington's mediation efforts since it recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital in late 2017.
""The Trump Administration's Annexation plan endorses everything that the illegal Israeli colonial-settlement enterprise is about: A racist narrative, violations of international law and the perpetuation of the denial of Palestinian rights,"" Palestinian official Saeb Erekat said.
Israel and the United States do not use ""annexation"" for Israel's planned moves, arguing that the term applies to land taken from a sovereign country, whereas the West Bank was controlled by Jordan but not generally recognised as part of its sovereign territory before the 1967 war.

Under the deal, Israel's Defence Ministry will lease the Heron unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system, made by state-owned Israel Aerospace Industries for three years.
The Heron system, which is used by Israel's military and in naval forces around the world, is equipped with both day and night activity platforms, maritime patrol radars and satellite communications.
It will be used by Greece primarily for border defence, the Israeli ministry said in a statement, adding that security relations between Israel and Greece were expanding.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan security forces arrested eight members of a network grouping Islamic State and Haqqani militants responsible for bloody attacks in the capital including on Sikh worshippers, the country's security agency said on Wednesday. 
The arrests were made as special forces carried out a raid on a property in Kabul on Tuesday evening, seizing weapons and explosives and killing five members of the joint network. 
The group was responsible for shootings of worshippers at a Sikh complex and at a large ceremony attended by many in the Hazara community, as well as rocket attacks on President Ashraf Ghani's swearing-in ceremony and on Bagram airbase, the National Directorate of Security said in a statement. 
Gunmen and suicide bombers raided a Sikh religious complex in Kabul in March, killing 25 people. That was the second attack on a minority group claimed by Islamic State in a month after more than 30 people were shot dead in a gathering attended by many members of the ethnic Hazara community marking the anniversary of the death of a Hazara leader.
Also in March, attackers fired rockets at Ghani's inauguration ceremony and in April sent rockets into the Bagram airbase, though no one was killed in either attack.
The violence underscored the challenges to securing lasting peace in Afghanistan even after the United States signed a troop withdrawal agreement with the militant Taliban in February. The Islamist group has since held off on large-scale attacks on foreign forces or in major centres, though it has continued attacking Afghan security forces throughout the provinces. 
Islamic State, which is not a party to the agreement and has fought the Taliban in the past, has a small presence in Afghanistan, largely in the north, though it has waged high profile attacks further south in the capital.
The militant Haqqani network, founded in the 1970s, is one of the most powerful and feared groups in the Afghan insurgency and has in the past had links to the Taliban.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will begin flights on Thursday to bring home some 400,000 citizens stranded overseas by travel restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic, prompting some worries over the risk that imported infections could fuel contagion in the country.
India's coronavirus cases totaled 49,390 as of Wednesday, of whom 1,694 people had died, and there is still no sign of the curve in new cases flattening despite a stringent, weeks-long lockdown in the world's second most populous country.
But, responding to the distress among India's huge diaspora, the government has asked national carrier Air India to provide aircraft to bring back Indians who want to return from the Middle East, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. 
The Indian Navy has also been asked to help by sending two ships to evacuate citizens from the Maldives, in the Indian Ocean.
Migrant workers, students and business people were left with no way home after India suspended air travel in March, just before entering a nationwide shutdown that remains in force until May 17.
And there have numerous tales of hardship, both financial and emotional, from people desperate to see sick relatives, attend funerals or births, while others have simply lost their jobs and are running out of money stranded abroad. 
""Priority will be given to workers in distress, elderly people, urgent medical cases, pregnant women, as well as to other people who are stranded in difficult situations,"" the Indian consulate general in Dubai said.
The first round of evacuations would bring back around 200,000 people by the middle of May and then by mid-June a total of 350,000-400,00 would be flown back, a foreign ministry official said.
""By then, we are hopeful that foreign travel will be re-opened,"" the official said. 
Four of the ten flights that Air India will operate on Thursday will bring back people from Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Riyadh and Doha and all into the southern state of Kerala, according to a seven-day flight plan released by the government. 
Nearly 300,000 have signed up for the flights from the Middle East for which Air India is charging a little less than a normal commercial fare. 
""This is easily the most comprehensive, complicated and challenging programme I have seen in my career,"" said civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri. 
Passengers will be screened at the departing airport and only those who are asymptomatic will be allowed to board. Once they land, they will be quarantined for two weeks, the government said.
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, whose state has large numbers of people working in the Gulf, voiced concerns over the risks of not testing people for the virus before bringing them home.
“There will be around 200 passengers on each flight. If two or three of them are carriers, it would affect everyone on that flight,"" he said.

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Indian troops killed four militants in gun battles in Kashmir on Wednesday, including the commander of the biggest separatist group fighting New Delhi in the disputed Himalayan region, a police official said.
Hundreds of Indian soldiers launched an operation late on Tuesday after receiving intelligence that Hizbul Mujahideen commander Riyaz Naikoo was hiding in a village in south Kashmir's Pulwama district.
Authorities also disabled mobile internet across the Kashmir region early on Wednesday to forestall large crowds from gathering in the streets to mourn his killing.
""He was trapped in a house and early today a gun battle took place during which he and his associate were killed,"" Kashmir's Inspector General of Police, Vijay Kumar, told Reuters.
Two militants were killed in another gun battle nearby on Wednesday, Kumar added.
For decades, separatists have fought an armed conflict against Indian rule in Kashmir, with the majority of them wanting independence for the Himalayan region, or to join New Delhi's arch rival Pakistan.
Kashmir is claimed in whole but ruled in part by both India and Pakistan.
Naikoo, 35, had joined the militants in 2010, two years after around 100 people were killed by troops during a restive summer marked by protests and violence.
A former maths teacher with a bounty of 1.2 million rupees ($15,800) on his head, Naikoo was an aide to Hizbul Mujahideen commander Burhan Wani who was killed in July 2016, leading to months of unrest.
""It is a major success for the troops in Kashmir"", Kumar said.
Amid a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus, Indian troops have intensified operations in Kashmir, the country's only Muslim-majority state that was split into two federally administered territories last August.
Since late March, Indian forces have killed 36 militants, losing around 20 soldiers, including a high-ranking army officer, during the same period, according to official data.

861,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 06:28AM ET</span>",Special Report: U.S. rearms to nullify China's missile supremacy,"By David Lague
HONG KONG (Reuters) - As Washington and Beijing trade barbs over the coronavirus pandemic, a longer-term struggle between the two Pacific powers is at a turning point, as the United States rolls out new weapons and strategy in a bid to close a wide missile gap with China.
The United States has largely stood by in recent decades as China dramatically expanded its military firepower. Now, having shed the constraints of a Cold War-era arms control treaty, the Trump administration is planning to deploy long-range, ground-launched cruise missiles in the Asia-Pacific region.
The Pentagon intends to arm its Marines with versions of the Tomahawk cruise missile now carried on U.S. warships, according to the White House budget requests for 2021 and Congressional testimony in March of senior U.S. military commanders. It is also accelerating deliveries of its first new long-range anti-ship missiles in decades.
In a statement to Reuters about the latest U.S. moves, Beijing urged Washington to ""be cautious in word and deed,"" to ""stop moving chess pieces around"" the region, and to ""stop flexing its military muscles around China.""
The U.S. moves are aimed at countering China's overwhelming advantage in land-based cruise and ballistic missiles. The Pentagon also intends to dial back China's lead in what strategists refer to as the ""range war."" The People's Liberation Army (PLA), China's military, has built up a huge force of missiles that mostly outrange those of the U.S. and its regional allies, according to senior U.S. commanders and strategic advisers to the Pentagon, who have been warning that China holds a clear advantage in these weapons.
And, in a radical shift in tactics, the Marines will join forces with the U.S. Navy in attacking an enemy's warships. Small and mobile units of U.S. Marines armed with anti-ship missiles will become ship killers.
In a conflict, these units will be dispersed at key points in the Western Pacific and along the so-called first island chain, commanders said. The first island chain is the string of islands that run from the Japanese archipelago, through Taiwan, the Philippines and on to Borneo, enclosing China's coastal seas.
Top U.S. military commanders explained the new tactics to Congress in March in a series of budget hearings. The commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps, General David Berger, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 5 that small units of Marines armed with precision missiles could assist the U.S. Navy to gain control of the seas, particularly in the Western Pacific. ""The Tomahawk missile is one of the tools that is going to allow us to do that,"" he said.
The Tomahawk - which first gained fame when launched in massed strikes during the 1991 Gulf War - has been carried on U.S. warships and used to attack land targets in recent decades. The Marines would test fire the cruise missile through 2022 with the aim of making it operational the following year, top Pentagon commanders testified.
At first, a relatively small number of land-based cruise missiles will not change the balance of power. But such a shift would send a strong political signal that Washington is preparing to compete with China's massive arsenal, according to senior U.S. and other Western strategists. Longer term, bigger numbers of these weapons combined with similar Japanese and Taiwanese missiles would pose a serious threat to Chinese forces, they say. The biggest immediate threat to the PLA comes from new, long-range anti-ship missiles now entering service with U.S. Navy and Air Force strike aircraft.
""The Americans are coming back strongly,"" said Ross Babbage, a former senior Australian government defense official and now a non-resident fellow at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a security research group. ""By 2024 or 2025 there is a serious risk for the PLA that their military developments will be obsolete.""
A Chinese military spokesman, Senior Colonel Wu Qian, warned last October that Beijing would ""not stand by"" if Washington deployed land-based, long-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region.
China's foreign ministry accused the United States of sticking ""to its cold war mentality"" and ""constantly increasing military deployment"" in the region.
""Recently, the United States has gotten worse, stepping up its pursuit of a so-called 'Indo-Pacific strategy' that seeks to deploy new weapons, including ground-launched intermediate-range missiles, in the Asia-Pacific region,"" the ministry said in a statement to Reuters. ""China firmly opposes that.""
Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Dave Eastburn said he would not comment on statements by the Chinese government or the PLA.
U.S. MILITARY UNSHACKLED
While the coronavirus pandemic rages, Beijing has increased its military pressure on Taiwan and exercises in the South China Sea (NYSE:SE). In a show of strength, on April 11 the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning led a flotilla of five other warships into the Western Pacific through the Miyako Strait to the northeast of Taiwan, according to Taiwan's Defense Ministry. On April 12, the Chinese warships exercised in waters east and south of Taiwan, the ministry said.
Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy was forced to tie up the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt at Guam while it battles to contain a coronavirus outbreak among the crew of the giant warship. However, the U.S. Navy managed to maintain a powerful presence off the Chinese coast. The guided-missile destroyer USS Barry passed through the Taiwan Strait twice in April. And the amphibious assault ship USS America last month exercised in the East China Sea and South China Sea, the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said.
In a series last year, Reuters reported that while the U.S. was distracted by almost two decades of war in the Middle East and Afghanistan, the PLA had built a missile force designed to attack the aircraft carriers, other surface warships and network of bases that form the backbone of American power in Asia. Over that period, Chinese shipyards built the world's biggest navy, which is now capable of dominating the country's coastal waters and keeping U.S. forces at bay.
The series also revealed that in most categories, China's missiles now rival or outperform counterparts in the armories of the U.S. alliance.

China derived an advantage because it was not party to a Cold War-era treaty - the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF) - that banned the United States and Russia from possessing ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges from 500 kilometers to 5,500 kilometers. Unrestrained by the INF pact, China has deployed about 2,000 of these weapons, according to U.S. and other Western estimates.
While building up its missile forces on land, the PLA also fitted powerful, long-range anti-ship missiles to its warships and strike aircraft.
This accumulated firepower has shifted the regional balance of power in China's favor. The United States, long the dominant military power in Asia, can no longer be confident of victory in a military clash in waters off the Chinese coast, according to senior retired U.S. military officers.
But the decision by President Donald Trump last year to exit the INF treaty has given American military planners new leeway. Almost immediately after withdrawing from the pact on August 2, the administration signaled it would respond to China's missile force. The next day, U.S. Secretary for Defense Mark Esper said he would like to see ground-based missiles deployed in Asia within months, but he acknowledged it would take longer.
Later that month, the Pentagon tested a ground-launched Tomahawk cruise missile. In December, it tested a ground-launched ballistic missile. The INF treaty banned such ground-launched weapons, and thus both tests would have been forbidden.
A senior Marines commander, Lieutenant General Eric Smith, told the Senate Armed Services Committee on March 11 that the Pentagon leadership had instructed the Marines to field a ground-launched cruise missile ""very quickly.""
The budget documents show that the Marines have requested $125 million to buy 48 Tomahawk missiles from next year. The Tomahawk has a range of 1,600km, according to its manufacturer, Raytheon Company (NYSE:RTN).
Smith said the cruise missile may not ultimately prove to be the most suitable weapon for the Marines. ""It may be a little too heavy for us,"" he told the Senate Armed Services Committee, but experience gained from the tests could be transferred to the army.
Smith also said the Marines had successfully tested a new shorter-range anti-ship weapon, the Naval Strike Missile, from a ground launcher and would conduct another test in June. He said if that test was successful, the Marines intended to order 36 of these missiles in 2022. The U.S. Army is also testing a new long-range, land-based missile that can target warships. This missile would have been prohibited under the INF treaty.
The Marine Corps said in a statement it was evaluating the Naval Strike Missile to target ships and the Tomahawk for attacking targets on land. Eventually, the Marines aimed to field a system ""that could engage long-range moving targets either on land or sea,"" the statement said.
The Defense Department also has research underway on new, long-range strike weapons, with a budget request of $3.2 billion for hypersonic technology, mostly for missiles.
China's foreign ministry drew a distinction between the PLA's arsenal of missiles and the planned U.S. deployment. It said China's missiles were ""located in its territory, especially short and medium-range missiles, which cannot reach the mainland of the United States. This is fundamentally different from the U.S., which is vigorously pushing forward deployment.""
BOTTLING UP CHINA'S NAVY
Military strategists James Holmes and Toshi Yoshihara suggested almost a decade ago that the first island chain was a natural barrier that could be exploited by the American military to counter the Chinese naval build-up. Ground-based anti-ship missiles could command key passages through the island chain into the Western Pacific as part of a strategy to keep the rapidly expanding Chinese navy bottled up, they suggested.
In embracing this strategy, Washington is attempting to turn Chinese tactics back on the PLA. Senior U.S. commanders have warned that China's land-based cruise and ballistic missiles would make it difficult for U.S. and allied navies to operate near China's coastal waters.
But deploying ground-based U.S. and allied missiles in the island chain would pose a similar threat to Chinese warships - to vessels operating in the South China Sea, East China Sea and Yellow Sea, or ships attempting to break out into the Western Pacific. Japan and Taiwan have already deployed ground-based anti-ship missiles for this purpose.
""We need to be able to plug up the straits,"" said Holmes, a professor at the U.S. Naval War College. ""We can, in effect, ask them if they want Taiwan or the Senkakus badly enough to see their economy and armed forces cut off from the Western Pacific and Indian Ocean. In all likelihood the answer will be no.""
Holmes was referring to the uninhabited group of isles in the East China Sea - known as the Senkaku islands in Japan and the Diaoyu islands in China - that are claimed by both Tokyo and Beijing.
The United States faces challenges in plugging the first island chain. Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte's decision to distance himself from the United States and forge closer ties with China is a potential obstacle to American plans. U.S. forces could face barriers to operating from strategically important islands in the Philippines archipelago after Duterte in February scrapped a key security agreement with Washington.
And if U.S. forces do deploy in the first island chain with anti-ship missiles, some U.S. strategists believe this won't be decisive, as the Marines would be vulnerable to strikes from the Chinese military.
The United States has other counterweights. The firepower of long-range U.S. Air Force bombers could pose a bigger threat to Chinese forces than the Marines, the strategists said. Particularly effective, they said, could be the stealthy B-21 bomber, which is due to enter service in the middle of this decade, armed with long-range missiles.
The Pentagon is already moving to boost the firepower of its existing strike aircraft in Asia. U.S. Navy Super Hornet jets and Air Force B-1 bombers are now being armed with early deliveries of  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s new Long Range Anti-Ship Missile, according to the budget request documents. The new missile is being deployed in response to an ""urgent operational need"" for the U.S. Pacific Command, the documents explain.
The new missile carries a 450 kilogram warhead and is capable of ""semi-autonomous"" targeting, giving it some ability to steer itself, according to the budget request. Details of the stealthy cruise missile's range are classified. But U.S. and other Western military officials estimate it can strike targets at distances greater than 800 kilometers.
The budget documents show the Pentagon is seeking $224 million to order another 53 of these missiles in 2021. The U.S. Navy and Air Force expect to have more than 400 of them in service by 2025, according to orders projected in the documents.
This new anti-ship missile is derived from an existing Lockheed long-range, land attack weapon, the Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile. The Pentagon is asking for $577 million next year to order another 400 of these land-attack missiles.
""The U.S. and allied focus on long-range land-attack and anti-ship cruise missiles was the quickest way to rebuild long-range conventional firepower in the Western Pacific region,"" said Robert Haddick, a former U.S. Marine Corps officer and now a visiting senior fellow at the Mitchell Institute for Aerospace Studies based in Arlington, Virginia.
For the U.S. Navy in Asia, Super Hornet jets operating from aircraft carriers and armed with the new anti-ship missile would deliver a major boost in firepower while allowing the expensive warships to operate further away from potential threats, U.S. and other Western military officials say.
Current and retired U.S. Navy officers have been urging the Pentagon to equip American warships with longer-range anti-ship missiles that would allow them to compete with the latest, heavily armed Chinese cruisers, destroyers and frigates. Lockheed has said it successfully test-fired one of the new Long Range Anti-Ship Missiles from the type of launcher used on U.S. and allied warships.
Haddick, one of the first to draw attention to China's firepower advantage in his 2014 book, ""Fire on the Water,"" said the threat from Chinese missiles had galvanized the Pentagon with new strategic thinking and budgets now directed at preparing for high-technology conflict with powerful nations like China.

Haddick said the new missiles were critical to the defensive plans of America and its allies in the Western Pacific. The gap won't close immediately, but firepower would gradually improve, Haddick said. ""This is especially true during the next half-decade and more, as successor hypersonic and other classified munition designs complete their long periods of development, testing, production, and deployment,"" he said.

But Levada cautioned that a change in its polling methodology may have slightly distorted the result to Putin's disadvantage. 
The poll was conducted by phone this time because of the coronavirus-related lockdown, rather than face-to-face, something that Levada's Deputy Director Denis Volkov said may have clipped 1-2% off Putin's rating. 
Even taking that into account, Volkov said an outcome of 61% would still mean Putin's approval rating was on a par with its lowest level recorded yet in 2013, a year before Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea prompted his ratings to surge. 
Putin, 67, has dominated Russian politics as president or prime minister for more than 20 years, but economic fallout from the coronavirus poses a political challenge for him.

Levada said the poll was conducted on April 24-27 and that a total of 1,608 people were polled across Russia.

864,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",Poland raises prospect of snap election in standoff over presidential vote,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland may need to dissolve parliament and hold a snap election unless lawmakers allow a presidential vote, which the government wants to hold by postal ballot during the coronavirus crisis, the prime minister's chief of staff said on Wednesday.
Polls show incumbent Andrzej Duda of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party on course to win the presidential election, which was scheduled for May 10. But politicians have been bitterly divided over whether it is possible to stage the election during a pandemic that has put the country on lockdown.
PiS wants the vote to go ahead this month, and has proposed a postal ballot to reduce the health risks from the coronavirus. But so far it has been unable to persuade parliament to back that proposal, with many lawmakers arguing that even voting by mail would be too dangerous.
The upper house of parliament voted on Tuesday to reject a postal ballot. Poland's lower house, the Sejm, is expected to vote again on Wednesday or Thursday on the issue.
PiS has a fragile majority in the Sejm and the vote is seen as a test for the ruling coalition, with some members of PiS ally Accord expressing opposition to postal voting.
""We hope that there will be enough lawmakers who...will adopt the draft bill. However, one also has to consider options in which the bill is not backed and then we will have to deal with a very serious political crisis,"" the prime minister's chief of staff, Michal Dworczyk, said on public radio.
""I think that such discussions have to be very cautious, but a scenario in which early elections take place cannot be excluded,"" he also said.
Under Poland's parliamentary system, most power lies with the prime minister. The president has the power to veto laws.
Dworczyk said that the presidential election is now unlikely to be held on May 10 as there is not enough time to prepare.
PiS says that latest possible date for the election under the constitution is May 23. The PiS-nominated Parliament speaker, Elzbieta Witek, said on Tuesday she would ask the Constitutional Tribunal whether she can postpone the election, signalling the party's preferred course of action if the postal vote rules are rejected.
As of Wednedsay, the new coronavirus had infected 14,647 and killed 723 people in Poland.

PiS has held up as an example an election in the German state of Bavaria, which was carried out by post on March 15.

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Security officials said it was not immediately clear whether a military base hosting U.S. troops next to the airport was the target.
The United States blames a series of rocket attacks near or on bases hosting its troops this year on Iran-aligned militia groups, although those groups have not claimed them. 
Tension between the United States and Iran has ramped up over the last year, culminating in the U.S. killing of Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani and Iraq's paramilitary chief Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike at Baghdad airport in January.
Iran-backed paramilitary groups vow to avenge their deaths and rocket attacks on bases hosting U.S. troops have persisted. Rocket attacks have also hit near the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, with at least one direct hit on the compound.
After Wednesday's attack the military said it found a rocket launcher with a timer in a rural area in western Baghdad, and there were no reported damages or casualties.
The rockets were fired from the Bakriya neighbourhood, about 6 km (4 miles) northeast of the airport, and security forces were deployed to search the area, security sources said.
Iraq faces the COVID-19 pandemic, a looming economic crisis and increased security threats, including the U.S.-Iran standoff and a resurging Islamic State, without a sitting government.
IS has stepped up attacks this month including one that killed at least 10 paramilitaries in the northern province of Salahuddin, according to paramilitary and security statements.
The U.S.-led coalition that is in Iraq to fight Islamic State militants has begun to reduce troop numbers and moved soldiers into fewer bases. It says this is because Iraqi forces are now mostly able to fight IS remnants on their own.

Iraqi lawmakers are set to vote on a new government presented by Prime Minister-designate Mustafa al-Kadhimi later on Wednesday. It has been without a prime minister since Adel Abdul Mahdi, who remains in a caretaker capacity, resigned amid anti-government protests in November.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Most visitors wanting to see big game in Africa jet in from faraway places, so when the new coronavirus grounded flights and put the world into lockdown, the legendary African safari died.
But for South African company WildEarth -- which brings virtual safaris to your living room via a camera that their guides drive around in an open top vehicle -- it is boom time.
""We've seen a dramatic rise in our viewership of our live safaris,"" founder Graham (NYSE:GHM) Wallington told Reuters. ""A fivefold increase in the first two weeks in March.""
Wallington said they are currently attracting up to 3 million viewers a month, with an individual virtual safari hooking in as many as 200,000 at their most watched.
Twice a day, viewers can watch whatever animals the guides spot as they zoom around game reserves -- they've filmed 200 spots across east and southern Africa since founding it in 2006. A 24-hour camera perched over a watering hole in South Africa's Djuma Game Reserve also shows live images of whatever comes there to drink.
Highlights include a pack of jackals and African wild dogs fighting over a kudu carcass, a leopard cub jumping out of a tree, a mother cheetah playing with her kids and close encounters with elephants, hippos, lions, baboons and giraffes.
In all, the guides narrate the trials of the animals as they follow them around. 
The footage is free to access. WildEarth makes revenue from selling premium video to broadcasters, from merchandise and a small amount of advertising, Wallington said, declining to give figures on turnover.
The main benefit for conservation efforts is that the videos are ""making people fall in love with nature,"" he said.
""They start seeing those animals as individual beings. That is the moment that the viewer empathises,"" he said.
Whether it is commutes to work, long-haul business travel or sightseeing, the COVID-19 shutdown has a lot of people thinking about whether they need to always rush from place to place, or whether a virtual interaction would sometimes do just fine.
Wallington said the crisis had created ""a real opportunity for people to generate money by creating virtual experiences.""
From an environmental point of view, it also cuts back on carbon emitted by flights, and could help popular spots, like East Africa's Serengeti, recover from over-tourism.
""If our mission was just to bring more and more tourists, we would destroy the thing we want to save,"" he said.
In the coming weeks, they plan to start paid-for private tours with currently out-of-work guides via a Zoom video call.

Under Iran's deal with world powers to accept limits to its nuclear programme in return for the lifting of sanctions, a U.N. weapons embargo is due to expire in October. The United States, which exited the deal in 2018, says it wants to extend the embargo.
In a speech on Wednesday, Rouhani repeated Iran's longstanding criticism of Washington's decision to exit the nuclear deal, which he called a ""stupid mistake"".

""Iran will give a crushing response if the arms embargo on Tehran is extended,"" Rouhani added. 
Iran has gradually rolled back its commitments under the accord in response to the U.S. decision to quit, but says it wants the agreement to remain in place. It has criticised European parties to the deal for failing to salvage the pact by shielding its economy from U.S. sanctions.

The paper seen by Reuters, dated late on May 5, was prepared by federal chancellery chief Helge Braun and the heads of the regional chancelleries for a telephone conference Chancellor Angela Merkel is due to hold with premiers of the 16 states later on Wednesday.
Based on infection levels, states will decide on their own about a gradual opening of universities, restaurants, bars, hotels, trade fairs, cosmetic studios, brothels, theatres, fitness studios, cinemas and discos all under certain hygiene and distancing concepts, said the draft.
States will also decide on limiting contact between people.
It is unclear from the draft when the Bundesliga will restart. Some German states want it to kick off again on May 15 and two people familiar with the preparations have told Reuters it is probably set to be given the green light to restart then.
The draft document says the start of matches must be preceded by two weeks of quarantine, possibly as a training camp.
In a bid to prevent a second widespread coronavirus outbreak, the federal and state governments agreed in preliminary talks that if the number of new infections rises after restrictions on public life are eased, local restrictions should be reintroduced immediately.
The plan is for this threshold to be set at ""more than 50 new infections per 100,000 inhabitants within the last seven days"" in districts. If there is a limited outbreak, such as in a nursing home, restrictions might only be applied there, the paper showed.
""If there is a dispersed regional outbreak and infection chains are unclear, general restrictions, such as those in force in Germany before 20 April, must be consistently reintroduced regionally,"" the paper says.
It added that this would include restricting travel to and from these regions.
Germany has been more successful than other large European countries in slowing the virus' spread.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's health minister asked the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday to ensure the island had access to first-hand information about the coronavirus, saying that not having the full picture slows down epidemic-prevention work.
Taiwan's exclusion from WHO - China, which considers the island one of its provinces, objects to Taiwan's membership - has infuriated Taipei. Officials there say it has created a gap in the global fight against the coronavirus and threatened the island's health.
Speaking to foreign reporters in Taipei, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said Taiwan wanted proper access to the WHO.
""For Taiwan, what we want is first-hand information. Any second-hand information slows down any actions we take, and distorts our judgement about the epidemic, like we're unable to see the woods for the trees,"" he said.
""But if we can we get first-hand information within the organisation, we can see the whole picture and can react proactively by creating various systems or policies,"" he added.
""Our speed in reacting will become faster, so Taiwan does not become a gap"" in epidemic prevention.
Taiwan has produced a list of complaints against the WHO, including that it gave wrong case numbers for Taiwan, ignored requests for information, and has bent to Chinese pressure to interfere with the island's requests for help.
Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help it needs. China says only it has the right to speak for Taiwan's 23 million people internationally, a claim Taipei's democratically elected government angrily rejects.
Taiwan has stepped up its campaign to attend, as an observer, this month's virtual meeting of the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), though government and diplomatic sources say China will not agree to that.
Taiwan attended the World Health Assembly as an observer from 2009-2016, when Taipei-Beijing relations were warmer.
But China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, whom China views as a separatist, a charge she rejects.
Chen would not say whether he was optimistic or pessimistic about Taiwan's chances of participating, but said there was ""of course no problem"" in trying to reach a consensus to allow this to happen.
""Our only standard is that we cannot be belittled,"" he said.
Steven Solomon, the WHO's principal legal officer, said on Monday that the WHO recognised the People's Republic of China as the ""one legitimate representative of China"", in keeping with U.N. policy since 1971, and that the question of Taiwan's attendance was one for the WHO's 194 member states.
Taiwan says the 1971 decision, under which Beijing assumed the U.N. China seat from Taipei, only resolved the issue of who represented China, not the issue of Taiwan, and did not grant China the power to represent Taiwan internationally.
Chen said the world should not be locked in the past and have to stick by something from almost five decades ago.

""The times keep changing,"" he added.

874,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 01:55AM ET</span>",China says Hong Kong will never be calm unless violent protesters removed,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Hong Kong affairs office warned on Wednesday that the city will never be calm unless ""black-clad violent protesters"" were all removed, describing them as a ""political virus"" that seeks independence from Beijing.
The strongly worded statement comes amid mounting concerns among democracy activists that China is tightening its grip over the former British colony, while a lockdown to prevent coronavirus infections has largely kept their movement off the streets. 
The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office warned that China's central government will not sit idly by ""with this recklessly demented force in place"" and that China's central government has the greatest responsibility in maintaining order and safeguarding national security.
""The scorched-earth action of the black-clad violent protesters is a political virus in Hong Kong society and a big enemy to 'one-country-two-systems',"" the office said in a statement on Wednesday. 
""As long as the protesters are not removed, Hong Kong will never be calm,"" it said.
The Asian financial hub was rocked in 2019 by months of massive, and sometimes violent, political protests over a now-withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed people to be sent to mainland China for trial. 
Many young protesters dressed in black fought running battles with Hong Kong police as the demonstrations evolved into calls for greater democracy.
Protesters said Beijing was seeking to erode the “one country, two systems” style of governance that guarantees broad freedoms for Hong Kong since its return to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing rejects criticism that it is seeking to encroach on the city’s much-cherished freedoms.
Hong Kong riot police dispersed a crowd of 300 pro-democracy activists, some wearing black, late last month -- the first sizable protest since the government imposed a ban on public meetings at the end of March to curb coronavirus infections.
The arrests of 15 activists in April, including veteran politicians, a publishing tycoon and senior barristers, thrust the protest movement back into the spotlight and drew condemnation from Washington and international rights groups.
Beijing's top representative office in Hong Kong on Saturday condemned what it described as extreme radicals for holding illegal assemblies over the Labour Day holiday and accused them of undermining the rule of law.
A war of words has intensified in the past few weeks, with Beijing's top official in Hong Kong urging the local government to work to enact national security legislation ""as soon as possible"", fuelling worries over what many see as encroachment on the territory's freedoms.
Fear that Beijing is flexing its muscle over Hong Kong risks a revival of anti-government protests after months of relative calm amid social distancing rules to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Hong Kong’s economy recorded in the first quarter its deepest annual contraction since at least 1974, as the coronavirus pandemic dealt a heavy blow to business activity, already in decline following the anti-government protests.
The Hong Kong and Macau Affairs office said that while there were many factors contributing to Hong Kong's economic woes, the main problem was anti-government protests.
""Hong Kong's biggest trouble comes from within, that is the violent forces openly calling for and engaging in 'lanchao',"" said the office, referring to a scorched-earth tactic.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - When shops and homes shutter at curfew, some Iraqis in this Baghdad district say it reminds them of past traumas that destroyed lives and livelihoods: sectarian death squads, foreign invasion, and the ruin wrought by international sanctions.
The COVID-19 pandemic is the source of their current suffering. In interviews with Reuters, half a dozen people in the Adhamiya neighbourhood said it has driven their families into the worst poverty they can remember.
""For two years I squatted at a friend's to save rent and sent all my earnings - maybe $350 a month - to my sick wife and children in Turkey,"" said Abdul Wahhab Qassim, a 46-year-old day labourer. ""Since the coronavirus lockdown there's no work. I can offer my family nothing.""
Qassim says he and a growing number of neighbours who do casual labour or run small stores have watched their modest incomes evaporate. They collect evening meals donated by a family at the local mosque during the holy month of Ramadan, often accepting this charity for the first time.
""It took less than two months of curfew for many to lose work,"" Qassim said. 
Iraq has so far avoided a catastrophic spread of the new coronavirus, recording some 2,200 cases and less than 100 deaths, according to the health ministry.
But as in many countries, the measures required, including a nationwide curfew in place since March, have put stores out of business and left breadwinners idling at home, hitting vulnerable sections of the population hard.
A spokesman for Iraq's planning ministry, Abdul Zahra al-Hindawi, said 20 percent of the population currently lives in poverty and that is expected to rise to nearly 30 percent this year because of people put out of work by the crisis.
The government last month announced a $25 monthly stipend for households struggling for income without state wages. Hindawi said 13 million people, almost a third of Iraqis, applied for the aid.
Plummeting prices for oil, which accounts for almost all Iraq's revenue, are already squeezing the economy, forcing the government to mull cuts to its vast public sector payroll. The price of oil has fallen more than 55% since the year began.
LOCAL DEBT
Iraq faces the same dilemma as much of the world - whether to ease restrictions to help economic activity, or maintain a lockdown to avoid the virus's spread. 
Authorities recently lifted the curfew during the daytime but announced new fines for breaking it at night. The World Health Organization says Iraq should maintain a lockdown.
To get their free evening meals, Qassim and his neighbours say they skirt the curfew. With the mosque closed, they gather to pray, shake hands and break the Ramadan fast at a shopfront each night. Men eat from large plastic trays. Women collect polystyrene boxes of rice and chicken to take home.
Ikhlas Majeed, who cooks the food in her small kitchen, said there are more families in need than ever. 
""These people have no state income. They earn what they can make in a day running stores or doing labouring. Because of past conflict there are many households without men who have no income,"" she said.
Israa Khalil, whose two brothers were killed by militias in 2006 and whose husband died of a throat infection several years ago, supported her two children with money from a state fund paid to her mother. But her mother died in March and that compensation is no longer paid.
""As a widow, I can't go out looking for jobs,"" she said. She said she now owes money to local stores including the grocer, who said he makes a quarter of what he did before coronavirus.
Hindawi said the planning ministry was undertaking a study to measure the number of Iraqis who had lost work or fallen into poverty. A government spokesman could not be reached for further comment on the economic crisis. 
NO SITTING GOVERNMENT
Iraq is facing the economic and health challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic without a sitting government.
Mass protests by mostly young, unemployed Iraqis against what they say is a corrupt ruling elite forced Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi to resign last year. He remains as head of a caretaker government.
Prime Minister-designate Mustafa al-Kadhimi, Iraq's third in three months, is struggling to form a cabinet that rival parties will accept as a deadline looms this week. 
Without a new government, Iraq's budget, based on oil prices of nearly three times their current value, cannot be revised. The World Bank this week projected Iraq's economy will contract 9.7 percent this year.

Abdul Mahdi said in a statement last month that all countries faced a crisis from the pandemic and that it was important for Iraq to reduce its oil income dependency.

876,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 12:50AM ET</span>","Facility near Pyongyang airport linked to North Korea's missile programme, U.S. think-tank says","By Sangmi Cha and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - A new facility near Pyongyang International Airport is almost certainly linked to North Korea's expanding ballistic missile programme, according to a report from a Washington-based think-tank.
The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) cited commercial satellite imagery it says shows the facility and a nearby underground structure have the capacity to accommodate North Korea's largest intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) that experts believe are able to strike anywhere in the United States.
The facility has been under construction since 2016, and includes a number of notable features, including an unusually large covered rail terminal and buildings that are linked by drive-through access, according to the CSIS report, published on Tuesday. The facility is also relatively close to ballistic missile component manufacturing plants in the Pyongyang area.
""Taken as a whole, these characteristics suggest that this facility is likely designed to support ballistic missile operations,"" the report said, calling it the Sil-li Ballistic Missile Support Facility.
The North Korean embassy in Beijing could not immediately be reached for comment on the report.
When asked about the report at a regular briefing in Seoul on Wednesday, a spokesman for South Korea's Unification Ministry said it would be inappropriate to comment.
Negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes have been at a standstill after working-level meetings with the United States collapsed last year.
In 2018, North Korea said it closed its Punggye-ri nuclear test site, and last year it offered to dismantle its Yongbyon nuclear complex in return for the revocation of five key U.N. resolutions during a failed summit between leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam.
But experts and U.S. officials say in the absence of a denuclearisation deal, North Korea has continued to expand its arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
In recent months, North Korea has also warned it could rethink its self-imposed moratorium on nuclear weapons tests and ICBM launches.
Located on the southwest corner of Pyongyang International Airport - approximately 17km (10 miles) northwest of the North Korean capital - the Sil-li facility encompasses approximately 442,300 square metres (4.76 million square feet), according to CSIS.
""A high-bay building within the facility is large enough to accommodate an elevated Hwasong-15 intercontinental ballistic missile and, therefore, the entirety of North Korea’s known ballistic missile variants,"" the report said. 
""The facility has been constructed next to an underground facility whose likely size is also large enough to easily accommodate all known North Korean ballistic missiles and their associated launchers and support vehicles.""
The buildings are connected by a wide surfaced road network that could help move large trucks and ballistic missile launchers, the report said.
North and South Korea on Saturday exchanged gunfire around a rural guard post, raising tension a day after North Korean state media showed Kim visiting a factory, the first report of him making a public appearance since April 11.

North Korea launched multiple short-range anti-ship cruise missiles into the sea and Sukhoi jets fired air-to-surface missiles on April 14.

877,By Reuters,"<span>May 06, 2020 12:19AM ET</span>",Reuters Pulitzer team captured Hong Kong's descent into chaos,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - The young woman is pressed to the ground next to a riot police shield. Detained by Hong Kong authorities, she screams her name out to friends so they can call a lawyer to help.
The picture, taken on Sept. 2 last year in the midst of huge and violent protests that rocked Hong Kong for more than six months, was part of a series of images by a team of Reuters photographers that won a Pulitzer Prize this week for breaking news photography.
The photographs range from sweeping bird's eye views of boulevards packed with tens of thousands of demonstrators to close-ups of pitched battles between anti-China protesters and police seeking to restore order.
Most of the violence took place at night, lending an eerie aura to the action - protesters stood out as silhouettes against teargas smoke; giant neon letters reading ""FREE HK"" and carried aloft by protesters glowed in the gloom from a hilltop.
For Tyrone Siu, a Reuters photographer who is from Hong Kong, covering the story was intensely personal.
A graduate of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, scene of some of the fiercest clashes between police and protesters, he saw his alma mater turned into a battleground. The city sports stadium became a giant shelter for injured protesters.
""At the same time, I must remain calm amid the intense atmosphere in order to carry out my duty as a photojournalist, helping foreign colleagues to get about and handling the fast-changing situation,"" he recalled.
Siu took the picture of the shouting woman and, despite spending months on the streets of a city that resembled a war zone at times, it sticks in his memory.
""The emotions shown on her face were so strong and striking that it left a lasting memory,"" he said.
""But it was only one day of many days, one face of many young faces being detained by the police in this manner throughout the months-long protest.""
'CHASING AROUND'
The Pulitzer Prize for Reuters, a unit of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), was the newsroom's eighth since 2008, and fifth in the last three years. Reuters coverage of the Hong Kong uprising was also a Pulitzer finalist https://www.reuters.com/investigates/section/hongkong-protests in the international reporting category.
Many of the winning photographs depicted violent clashes between Hong Kong protesters and authorities, including images taken in the midst of skirmishes with tear gas, rubber bullets and hurled bricks.
Ahmad Masood, Asia Editor for Reuters Pictures who oversaw the coverage, said he and others began to prioritise the Hong Kong story in June, when big rallies were announced.
As mass protests turned violent and time passed, the protest movement began to fracture, making it harder to plan.
""This is where Tyrone's local knowledge and network of contacts kept the team informed of what the next development was likely to be,"" said Masood.
""There was a lot of chasing around. Sometimes there were four photographers at different spots across the city with some serious clashes going on during daylight and night.""
In some pictures, civilians are caught up in the chaos - passengers outside an airport running with their luggage or a man crouching as he leaves an optician store, the flames of a molotov cocktail licking the street in front of him.
In others, police clash with demonstrators, many of them students wearing gas masks and helmets.
There are moments of brutality. A photograph taken by Thomas Peter shows a masked anti-government protester attacking a man suspected of being a pro-Beijing activist with a hammer. Blood pours from the victim's head.
Jorge Silva photographed a woman with fury etched on her face as she held a Chinese flag in support of Beijing and shouted into her smartphone, while anti-China protesters crowded around her.
Rickey Rogers (NYSE:ROG), Global Editor for Reuters Pictures, said the prize was a testament to the teamwork that went into covering a protracted and often dangerous story.
""Eleven photographers have their names inscribed in journalistic history, but there were 28 Reuters photographers who rotated through Hong Kong during 2019, plus security and legal advisers, and a team of editors.

""All of them were critical in what truly matters beyond any prize – telling the news story to the world.""

After lengthy talks behind closed doors, the Taliban and Washington signed an agreement in February for reduced violence and a move toward talks with the Afghan government, but attacks by the group have increased since then.
""I don't think they are,"" Esper told reporters when asked if the Taliban were living up to their commitment. 
He added that he believed the Afghan government was also not living up to its commitment. The Afghan government was not part of an agreement between the United States and the Taliban. 
Esper said the Afghan government and the Taliban ""both need to come together and make progress on the terms that (are) laid out."" 
Progress on moving to negotiations between the militant group and the Afghan government has been delayed, in part by the political feud between President Ashraf Ghani and Abdullah Abdullah, who both claimed to be Afghanistan's rightful leader following September's disputed election.
The political deadlock comes as the Taliban has increased the pace of violence. 
The Taliban have mounted more than 4,500 attacks in Afghanistan in the 45 days since signing a deal with the United States that paves the way for a U.S. troop drawdown, according to data seen by Reuters. 
The United States is continuing it's drawdown of forces in Afghanistan, which are expected to reach about 8,600 troops in this summer. 
Senior Western, Afghan and independent officials tracking the ground situation say that the increase in attacks shows the insurgent group's wilful disregard of a pledge to reduce violence made as part of the accord signed in late February.

The violence in the war-damaged nation has coincided with the rapid spread of the coronavirus infection.

880,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 09:55PM ET</span>",U.S. expected to deport Iranian professor acquitted of sanctions busting: officials,"By Humeyra Pamuk and Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is expected to deport Iranian professor Sirous Asgari, who was acquitted of stealing trade secrets, once he receives medical clearance to leave, U.S. and Iranian officials said on Tuesday.
Asgari might be part of a rare prisoner swap between foes Iran and the United States. Iranian sources have told Reuters that Tehran is prepared to take part in a swap.
The 59-year-old Asgari, who tested positive for the novel coronavirus around 10 days ago, is under the medical care of U.S. immigration authorities and awaits a health clearance to travel, said Abolfazl Mehrabadi, an Iranian diplomat who is deputy director of Tehran's interests section at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington. 
""We are working and cooperating with the immigration office to deport him as soon as possible to Iran,"" Mehrabadi said.
A spokesman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) declined to provide a specific timeline but confirmed that the agency was expecting to carry out Asgari's removal from the country once he is medically cleared to travel.
Connecting flights that normally carry deportees to Iran have been canceled and the agency is waiting for service to resume, the spokesman said. He did not say how long this could take. 
The ICE spokesman, who asked not to be named, confirmedAsgari had tested positive for COVID-19 and was currently in quarantine, receiving care. 
A federal judge in Ohio acquitted Asgari, a materials science professor, last November of stealing trade secrets in violation of U.S. sanctions on Iran.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in March urged the United States to release Asgari, who he said was one of several Iranian scientists taken ""hostage"" by the United States.
DETAINED AMERICANS
Three Iranian officials said a prisoner swap between the two countries is in the works. Michael White, a U.S. navy veteran who has been detained in Iran since 2018, is a likely candidate to be swapped. He was released from prison in mid-March on medical furlough but remains in Iran. 
If a swap goes ahead, that would be a rare instance of cooperation in an otherwise deeply frayed U.S.-Iran relationship. The two have grown more hostile towards each other since President Donald Trump took office.
The U.S. State Department referred questions about Asgari's release to ICE but a spokesman said: ""Bringing home wrongfully detained Americans is a top priority for President Trump. We work with the Swiss every day on the health, safety, and release of U.S. citizens wrongfully held in Iran."" 
Because the United States and Iran lack diplomatic relations, Switzerland looks after U.S. interests with Tehran.
Last December, Iran freed U.S. citizen Xiyue Wang, who had been held for three years on spying charges, and the United States released Iranian Massoud Soleimani, who faced charges of violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.
In mid-March U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a press conference said Tehran was considering freeing some U.S. citizens and urged them to do so as a humanitarian gesture because of the coronavirus. Iran has been one of the worst hit countries in the Middle East by the outbreak.
U.S.-Iranian relations have been bitter since the Islamic Revolution toppled the U.S.-backed Shah of Iran in 1979 and ushered in an era of theocratic rule. Tensions flared up after Trump pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimposed U.S. sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.
Further worsening ties, a Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force. It also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who founded Iraq's Shi’ite Kataib Hezbollah militia after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.

It is not clear exactly how many Americans Iran may hold, but they include father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi. Robert Levinson, a former FBI agent who disappeared in March 2007 after traveling to an island controlled by Iran, is believed to have died in Iranian custody, his family said in March.

BRUSSELS/BELGRADE (Reuters) - European Union (EU) leaders host a summit on Wednesday with their six Balkan counterparts whose praise for Chinese and Russian support during the coronavirus crisis has ruffled feathers in the bloc, officials and diplomats said.
The EU says it has not been given enough credit for the 3.3 billion euros ($3.6 billion) it is providing, which officials said outweigh medical supplies Beijing and Moscow sent to Serbia and Bosnia in the early phase of the epidemic. 
The summit, planned for the Croatian capital Zagreb 20 years after the first ever EU-Balkan gathering, will take place via video from 1430 GMT, linking the heads of Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia with the 27 EU leaders.
Still scarred by 1990s wars, all six countries aspire to join the EU, though the response to the COVID-19 disease is likely to dominate.
""The summit itself is the message, to say: we want you to join,"" said a senior EU diplomat involved in preparing the summit. ""But we will also say that you cannot pander to the Chinese and the Russians when it suits you.""
China and Russia flew doctors and medical supplies to Bosnia and Serbia in March to help halt spreading of the coronavirus at a time when the EU's initial response was slow. 
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic publicly thanked President Xi Jinping and the Chinese people.
The Serb member of Bosnia's tripartite presidency, Milorad Dodik, praised Russia last month, criticising Brussels for initially limiting exports of medical aid to non-EU members.
    ""The Europe we believed in ten years ago does not exist today,"" he said at the time, although he later softened his language. 
BATTLE FOR INFLUENCE
After years of neglect, the six countries now have the attention of EU governments, who have been worried about Chinese and Russian influence in the region for several years.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen warned in November that if the EU did not do more, ""others will.""
In March, North Macedonia and Albania won approval to start EU membership talks after a two-year delay, helping to counter a sense in the region that hopes of joining the bloc were fading.
""We can't go backwards. The people in the region have nothing to fear,"" North Macedonia's Foreign Minister Nikola Dimitrov told a think-tank event. ""The whole (EU) process is to help become prosperous, functioning democracies.""
Vucic said on Saturday he had his own demands of EU leaders: ""We will be asking (EU enlargement) commissioner Oliver Varhelyi for a bit more grants and fewer loans."" 
To add to the problems, five EU countries do not recognise Kosovo's independence, including Spain.
At the summit, all leaders will appear against neutral backgrounds to avoid any insignia that one EU official said ""would make the video conference difficult"" as lingering diplomatic tensions mean nationalist symbols could cause offence.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's São Luis became the nation's first major city to begin a coronavirus ""lockdown"" on Tuesday, a measure that underscores widespread fears that health services across Brazil could soon collapse under the pressure of the coronavirus pandemic.
Tuesday's lockdown measure covers São Luis and parts of three other municipalities with a total population of around 1.3 million people in the Maranhão state. It forbids people from going outside except to obtain groceries, medication or cleaning supplies.
Maranhão - the poor, northeastern state of which São Luis is the capital - has not felt the brunt of the crisis, in contrast to the interior state of Amazonas, where hospitals are overwhelmed and authorities have resorted to burying victims in mass graves.
But with 4,227 confirmed cases and 249 deaths, Brazil's poorest state is still dealing with a significant caseload. 
In an interview with Reuters, Maranhão Governor Flavio Dino of the Brazilian Communist Party said 95% of intensive care beds in state-run public hospitals in the area under lockdown are occupied.
""We're doing a preventative lockdown,"" Dino said. ""We aren't dealing with chaos, but what we were observing is that demand was growing quickly and was above our expansion capacity for beds and health professionals.""
The lockdown, which lasts until May 14, was mandated by a court, but has the support of the governor. It comes as support for social and business restrictions has slipped in Brazil, as the economic impact of the pandemic raises concerns about hunger in poor communities.
Brazil is by far the hardest hit nation in Latin America, with 105,222 confirmed cases and 7,288 deaths as of Monday, according to the Health Ministry.
President Jair Bolsonaro has downplayed the virus, comparing it to ""a little cold,"" but the reaction of Brazil's 27 state and district governments has varied widely.
Most have imposed business restrictions of some sort, in which non-essential services and commerce are forbidden. But they have stopped short of mandating an official lockdown, which would limit people's movement. In some areas, enforcement has been spotty, and shops have remained open despite official decrees.
While Brazilians initially supported nationwide social isolation measures by wide margins, polls have showed support slowly slipping, with one late April poll showing a statistical tie between those who favor a generalized quarantine and those who favor allowing low-risk individuals to return to work.

Branko Bacic, head of the Croatian Democratic Union's (HDZ)parliamentary group, told reporters that could be in June, July or August. ""We want the epidemiological conditions to be conducive for organising the elections,"" he said.
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic's government is widely perceived as having successfully limited the spread of COVID-19 and some analysts believe the HDZ wants to take advantage of that by bringing forward a vote originally due for the autumn.
In lockdown for more than a month, Croatia has had just 2,112 coronavirus cases with 83 deaths and began reopening its economy last week.
In one recent public opinion poll, HDZ led with 27.9% of support from the opposition Social Democrats with 23.2%.
Media had been speculating that an election would be held in the summer given the possibility of a second coronavirus wave later in the year. Some quoted HDZ officials anonymously speculating the date could be July 5, 12 or 19. 
Parliament must be dissolved between one and two months before.
In recent years, Plenkovic's government has strongly improved fiscal performance and run a budget surplus for three years, but it has failed to improve the investment climate and reduce the bloated public sector or over-reliance on tourism.

Due to the coronavirus, Croatia expects an economic downturn of 9.4% this year, largely due to a collapse in tourism, which accounts for nearly one fifth of gross domestic product.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Alis Nicolette Rodriguez is bracing themself, nervously looking over their shopping list and preparing in case someone tries to bar their way at the grocery store. It has happened before.
To keep crowds thin during the coronavirus quarantine, Colombian capital Bogota - like some other places in Latin America - has specified that men and women must go out on separate days. That has turned a routine food shopping trip into an outing fraught with tension for social work student Rodriguez, who is transgender and non-binary.
From Panama to Peru, transgender people say gender-based quarantine restrictions have exposed them to discrimination and violence from people questioning their right to be out.
In Bogota, women can only go out on days with even-numbered dates and men on odd, while transgender people are allowed to choose.
However, rights group Red Comunitaria Trans said it had received 18 discrimination complaints since the measure began. One of those complaints was from a transgender woman in southern Bogota stabbed by a man who said she was out on the wrong day, a case also reported in local media. The woman is recovering from her injuries.
""The last time I went out things happened that were really tense,"" said Rodriguez, 20, who uses neutral pronouns and began hormone treatments four months ago. ""My features are still very masculine so people still say 'I see the body of a man' and they deny who you are.""
Rodriguez said the previous Sunday an employee stopped them at a grocery entrance and a police officer asked to see their identification, although the mayor's office has told police not demand ID to prove gender during the quarantine.
A spokeswoman for Bogota's government department for women confirmed the police do not have the right to question anyone's gender identity. 
In response to questions about the accusations of discrimination, Bogota's Metropolitan Police sent Reuters a publicity video of officers and members of the transgender community speaking to store employees, explaining that transgender people can choose their shopping day.
Rodriguez was eventually allowed into the store, but at the check-out one cashier asked another why ""this man"" had been able to shop, they said. Being non-binary complicates the choice about which day to go out, said Rodriguez, who has chosen the women's days.
""If you don't go out with make-up on, with a skirt... If you don't comply with those stereotypes and gender roles then you can't identify yourself or be in a public space,"" said Rodriguez, who was wearing pink eye shadow and a sparkly silver jacket. 
AFRAID TO REPORT DISCRIMINATION 
Juli Salamanca, communications director for Red Comunitaria Trans, said the coronavirus pandemic had left transgender people particularly exposed.
""They're trying to protect themselves from the violence of the police, the violence of the supermarkets, the violence of society in general,"" Salamanca told Reuters, referring to the physical and emotional toll of discrimination and prejudice.
She said some transgender people may be afraid to report discrimination because of previous police abuse. 
Colombia's second-largest city, Medellin, has restricted outings based on ID numbers rather than gender, a valid alternative to enforce social distancing, Salamanca said. 
Colombia is not the only Latin American country where restrictions have stoked fear among transgender people.
The Panamanian Association of Trans People has received more than 40 discrimination complaints since restrictions began in April, director Venus Tejada said, including problems getting into supermarkets or buying medicine.
Transgender people who are immunocompromised are particularly worried, according to Tejada, and some with HIV fear additional discrimination because of their illness.
""If they need anything we've advised them to ask a neighbor or someone else to get it,"" Tejada said. 
In Peru, the government canceled restrictions based on gender after just over a week, as retailers struggled to control crowds on women's days and LGBT groups complained of discrimination.
Back in Bogota, Rodriguez is piling a shopping cart with items. They avert their eyes when two police officers walk into the store.
The officers escort out an older man who is violating the rules and then stare briefly at Rodriguez before leaving.

Today, at least, they shopped in peace.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's Tigray region plans to hold elections, its main party said, setting it on a collision course with the federal government and testing the country's fragile unity.
The Horn of Africa country in March postponed parliamentary and regional elections scheduled for August due to the novel coronavirus outbreak. A new date has yet to be set, and parliament failed to settle on one in a meeting on Tuesday.
The Tigray People's Liberation Front, the region's governing party, split acrimoniously from the national Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition last year when its three other parties merged to form the new Prosperity Party.
The TPLF said late on Monday it would proceed with elections in Tigray despite the nationwide postponement of voting.
""We are making preparations including the holding of a regional election in order to safeguard the rights of our people from chaos,"" a TPLF statement said. It did not mention a date for the vote.
Ethiopia's National Elections Board said no request for a vote was submitted by TPLF and no organisation other than the NEBE had a mandate to conduct any type of election.
The EPRDF that seized power in 1991 was dominated by minority Tigrayans, and it kept a lid on bubbling tensions for decades by quashing virtually all dissent, including expressions of ethnic nationalism.
When Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took power in Africa's second most populous country in 2018, he rolled out a series of reforms allowing greater freedoms in what had long been one of Africa's most repressive states.
But the reforms have made it possible for long-held grievances against the government's decades of harsh rule to resurface, and emboldened regional power-brokers such as the TPLF seeking to secure more power for their ethnic groups.
Jawar Mohammed, a prominent activist from Abiy's Oromo ethnic group, told Reuters that the Tigray dispute could destabilise the Horn of Africa.
    ""The federal and Tigray authorities are being unreasonable. The Tigray regional council can decide to hold elections and have the power to actually carry out the election,"" Jawar said.
The TPLF statement accused Abiy's Prosperity Party of having no genuine interest in holding elections and that he was using the coronavirus pandemic as ""an excuse to establish a one-man dictatorship"".
The PP rebuffed the accusation. ""The TPLF's stand has no constitutional basis. They have no mandate to hold elections. They are trying to destabilise the country in an attempt to grab power,” PP spokesman Awelu Abdi said.
Ethiopia's constitution sets a maximum five-year term for the national government. Abiy's mandate expires in September.
William Davison, the International Crisis Group think tank's senior analyst for Ethiopia, said the TPLF's decision to proceed with elections before the rest of the country could be politically explosive given a lack of legal clarity.

""(It) threatens to deepen Ethiopia’s political crisis, as the legality of regions holding polls without federal permission is unclear and disputed,"" he told Reuters.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan authorities have detained two U.S. citizens working with a U.S. military veteran who has claimed responsibility for a failed armed incursion into the oil producing country, President Nicolas Maduro said on Monday. 
In a state television address, Maduro said authorities arrested 13 ""terrorists"" on Monday allegedly involved in a plot he said was coordinated with Washington to enter the South American country via the Caribbean coast and oust him. 
Eight people were killed during the foiled incursion attempt on Sunday, Venezuelan authorities said.
Maduro showed what he said were the U.S. passports and other identification cards belonging to Airan Berry and Luke Denman, who he said were in custody and had been working with Jordan Goudreau, an American military veteran who leads a Florida-based security company called Silvercorp USA.
""They were playing Rambo. They were playing hero,"" Maduro said, adding that Venezuelan authorities had caught wind of the plot before its execution. 
Goudreau, who identified himself as an organizer of the invasion on Sunday, told Reuters on Monday that Berry and Denman were also involved. 
""They're working with me. Those are my guys,"" he said by telephone.
The State Department did not provide any immediate comment on the alleged arrests. U.S. officials have strongly denied any U.S. government involvement in the incursions. 
A person familiar with the matter said the two U.S. citizens were captured on Monday in a second-day roundup of accomplices and were believed to be in the custody of Venezuelan military intelligence. 
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the details came from contacts with Venezuelan security forces.
Opposition leader Juan Guaido cast doubt on the government's version of Sunday's events, insisting Maduro is seeking to distract from other problems in recent days including a deadly prison riot and a violent gang battle in Caracas. 
Guaido's communications team on Monday denied media reports that Guaido had hired Silvercorp to remove Maduro by force, adding the opposition leader and his allies ""have no relationship with or responsibility for the actions of the company Silvercorp."" 
In a statement on Monday evening, Guaido's team said: ""We demand the human rights ... of the people captured in recent hours be respected.""
Washington has imposed tough economic sanctions against Venezuela in an effort to oust Maduro, whom it accuses of having rigged elections in 2018. Maduro's government says the United States wants to control Venezuela's massive oil reserves.
'ATTACK AGAINST OUR FATHERLAND'
Monday's arrests come after Maduro's government on Sunday said mercenaries had attempted to enter the South American country on speed boats from neighboring Colombia, saying eight people had been killed and two detained.
Later on Sunday, Goudreau released a video identifying himself as an organizer of the invasion, alongside dissident Venezuelan military officer Javier Nieto. 
Goudreau said in the video that fighters on the ground continued to carry out operations in different parts of the country. 
He identified one of the fighters as ""Commander Sequea,"" which appeared to be a reference to Antonio Sequea, who was identified on Monday by state television as one of the people arrested. 
Silvercorp's website describes Goudreau as a ""highly decorated Special Forces Iraq and Afghanistan veteran."" 
A Venezuelan state television anchor on Monday showed photos of men laid out on the ground with their hands behind their backs, adding that the group was traveling near the town of Chuao area in central Aragua state.
The group was ""caught by popular force, by fishermen,"" the anchor said.
Cabello posted a video of men in black with balaclavas pulling a shirtless man from a helicopter, whom they identified as part of the group captured.
""Without a doubt, the imperialists directed this attack against our fatherland,"" Cabello said on Twitter, in reference to the U.S. government. 

A U.S. official, who asked not to be named, said the U.S. government had no involvement with the incident. Another source familiar with U.S. intelligence analysis and reporting also said that U.S. agencies have nothing to do with any military incursions in Venezuela.

Palestinian refugee agency operating on 'month-to-month' basis due to U.S. aid cut: official,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Scrambling to tackle COVID-19 in camps across the Middle East, the U.N. agency supporting Palestinian refugees said on Tuesday it only has enough cash to operate until the end of May because of American funding cuts.
In 2018 President Donald Trump's administration halted annual payments of $360 million to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides assistance to some 5.5 million registered refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.
Elizabeth Campbell, UNRWA's director in Washington, told reporters that the loss of U.S. aid had a ""corrosive impact"" on the agency's ability to help vulnerable people.
""We are basically operating on a month-to-month basis. Right now, we have funding to pay our 30,000 health care workers until the end of this month,"" Campbell said in a Zoom conference call from Washington. 
She said UNRWA had only secured a third of its $1.2 billion annual budget and that it was suffering its ""worst financial crisis"" since beginning operations some 70 years ago. 
The agency is trying to plug the $800 million shortfall in part by appealing to European and Gulf countries for emergency donations, Campbell said. 
Donations from the European Union, Britain, Germany, Sweden, Canada and Japan have helped fill UNRWA's 2020 budget gap, Campbell said, while Saudi Arabia has also provided project-specific funding. 
The United States was by far UNRWA's biggest donor until it withdrew funding, calling for reforms and suggesting its services be transferred to refugee host countries.
Palestinian refugees are mostly descendants of some 700,000 Palestinians who were driven out of their homes or fled amid fighting in the 1948 war that led to Israel's creation. Nearly a third live in 58 camps where UNRWA provides services.
Many refugees fear the dwindling aid they receive could fall further as the coronavirus crisis persists and donors shift priorities.
UNRWA has tried to halt the spread of COVID-19 in and around camps, closing all its 276 schools that are attended by close to 300,000 children. 

It has launched a $14 million emergency appeal for coronavirus funding, and says it will issue another, larger, aid request in the coming days.

Amjad Adailah said the Cabinet, which imposed a curfew on March 21 after enacting emergency laws that gave the government sweeping powers, would also continue to impose a weekend lockdown.
""We have contained the outbreak but the danger is real and the possibility of its return is real and serious,"" Adailah said.
Jordanians took to the streets after a ban was lifted on driving and many businesses reopened in a rapid return to normality after the authorities relaxed a tough nearly 50-day curfew to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz said in remarks on state television that the country's early tight lockdown measures had brought results that were far better than expected.
The government has not registered any coronavirus cases for the eighth day in a row, Razzaz added. The country has had a total of 465 cases and nine deaths.

It was the first move by the new national head of the federal police Rolando Alexandre Souza, who Bolsonaro swore in quickly on Monday in a closed-door ceremony following a Supreme Court decision to block his attempt to appoint a family friend. 
Bolsonaro denied he had interfered in the appointments to shield his son, as alleged by his former justice minister, Sergio Moro, who resigned on April 24, saying the president was pressing him to change the police chiefs.
""No one of my relatives are being investigated by the federal police, not I, nor my sons,"" an angry Bolsonaro told reporters outside the presidential palace.
He said the outgoing Rio police chief had been appointed executive director of the federal police in Brasilia, the second highest post in the force, but essentially a desk job with no involvement in investigations.
Annoyed by the Tuesday headlines that pointed to political meddling in the police appointment, Bolsonaro attacked reporters, calling them ""scoundrels"" who only published ""villainous"" stories.
He accused the media of blowing his alleged interference in the police out of proportion because it was trying to get him ousted from office.
Moro, a popular figure in Brazil's anti-corruption efforts who locked up scores of business leaders and politicians as a judge, testified to prosecutors and police on Saturday as part of an investigation authorized by the Supreme Court.
The court blocked Bolsonaro's first choice as top cop, Alexandre Ramagem, the head of Brazil's intelligence agency Abin and a friend of the president's sons since he headed their father's security detail during the 2018 election campaign.

Moro's resignation and the prospect of damaging evidence emerging from his testimony to prosecutors have set off Bolsonaro's most serious political crisis, which has eroded his popularity and fed talk of impeachment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday denied any involvement by the U.S. government in what Venezuelan officials have called a failed armed incursion in the South American country that led to the capture of two American ""mercenaries.""
Trump made the comment to reporters at the White House after socialist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Monday said authorities there had detained two U.S. citizens working with a U.S. military veteran who has claimed responsibility for the foiled operation.
""We'll find out. We just heard about it,"" Trump said when asked about the incident and the Americans' arrests. ""But it has nothing to do with our government.""
In a state television address, Maduro said authorities arrested 13 ""terrorists"" on Monday involved in what he described as a plot coordinated with Washington to enter the country via the Caribbean coast and oust him.
Eight people were killed during the incursion attempt on Sunday, Venezuelan authorities said.
Maduro showed what he said were the U.S. passports and other identification cards belonging to Airan Berry and Luke Denman, whom he said were in custody and had been working with Jordan Goudreau, an American military veteran who leads a Florida-based security company called Silvercorp USA.
The two detained Americans, former special operations forces members who had served with Goudreau, were believed to be in the custody of Venezuelan military intelligence, according to a person familiar with the matter.
The State Department did not provide any immediate comment on the arrests. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, had strongly denied any U.S. government role in the incursions.
Washington has waged a campaign of tough economic sanctions and diplomatic measures against Venezuela in an effort to oust Maduro, accusing him of having rigged elections in 2018.
But while Trump has repeatedly said all options are on the table, his administration has shown no apparent interest in military action as it pursues what it calls a ""maximum pressure"" strategy against Maduro.
Maduro's government, however, says the United States wants to control the OPEC member nation's massive oil reserves.
GUAIDO: MADURO SEEKS TO DISTRACT
Since early 2019, the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate interim president.
But Maduro remains in power, backed by the military as well as Russia, Cuba and China, which some U.S. officials say privately is a source of frustration for Trump.
Guaido - often derided by Maduro as a U.S. puppet - cast doubt on the government's version of Sunday's events. He insisted that Maduro was seeking to distract from other problems in recent days, including a deadly prison riot and a violent gang battle in Caracas, the capital.
The Venezuelan government, presiding over an economic meltdown, is also struggling to cope with the global spread of the coronavirus.
Monday's arrests come after Maduro's government on Sunday announced it had thwarted a ""mercenary incursion.""
Goudreau released a video identifying himself as an organizer of the operation, alongside dissident Venezuelan military officer Javier Nieto. He identified one of the fighters as ""Commander Sequea,"" which appeared to be a reference to Antonio Sequea, who was identified by state television as one of the people arrested.

KIEV (Reuters) - The mayor of a town in central Ukraine has unilaterally decided to ease lockdown restrictions, causing a row with President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's government as it seeks to avoid a second wave of novel coronavirus infections.
Cherkasy mayor Anatoliy Bondarenko decided to open shops, hairdressers and restaurants on April 30 after appeals from businesses. 
The move comes amid signs of growing impatience in Ukraine against lockdown measures imposed in March which the authorities say have kept infection rates lower than much of Western Europe.
The government announced a partial lifting of restrictions from May 11 but has cajoled citizens and local authorities not to let their guard down in the meantime. 
Police have recorded more than 10,000 violations of lockdown rules, and the health minister has spoken out against people going to parks or holding rallies. Hundreds of businessmen protested against the lockdown in Kiev last week.
Ukraine has 12,697 coronavirus cases, including 316 deaths.
Bondarenko's decision prompted police to launch criminal proceedings against the Cherkasy authorities and summon the mayor for questioning. Zelenskiy accused Bondarenko of trying to boost his popularity at the expense of citizens' lives.
Bondarenko responded in a video message, invoking the spirit of Cossack resistance for which the area was once known.
""Cherkasy will resist. Cherkasy is a free Cossack city,"" he said.
In a separate post, he said that although Cherkasy businesses could reopen, citizens should behave responsibly and observe social distancing rules.
The region is an historic centre for the warlike Cossack communities known for their horsemanship, as well as the birthplace of Ukraine's national poet Taras Shevchenko, whose name Bondarenko also referenced.
More recently, Cherkasy lent its name to the last Ukrainian navy vessel to resist Russian forces during the annexation of Crimea in 2014, an episode which was turned into a film last year. 
Deputy Mayor of Cherkasy Ihor Voloshyn told Reuters other cities such as Lviv in the west and Dnipro to the east had come out in solidarity with Bondarenko.
The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, called on the government to stop the ""persecution"" of Bondarenko and said Kiev should give cities more autonomy to decide whether to lift lockdown restrictions.

Bondarenko, accompanied by some supporters, appeared at a police station for interrogation on Monday but he was not allowed into the building. A senior local police official later said the interrogation of witnesses in criminal cases related to lockdown violations would be postponed – due to the lockdown.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Coronavirus lockdowns present a plethora of challenges for families suddenly forced to spend weeks on end under one roof. But try hunkering down at home with 31 kids.
Costa Rican couple Melba Jimenez and Victor Guzman, parents to 31 adopted children living in their home, have done just that for the past six weeks as the pandemic widened in Latin America.
""This is about life or death. We have to take care of ourselves,"" said Jimenez, a retired fashion design worker. ""We have to do it out of love and out of responsibility.""
Aged between 3 and 25, their charges are among over 150 children the couple have taken in over the past four decades, after doctors saved one of their six biological offspring from a brain tumor. Their own six are now grown up and have left home.
Their adopted children at least have some room to roam, thanks to the spacious home with a large yard in the capital San Jose that an anonymous donor gave the family.
Jimenez, 68, and Guzman, a 74-year-old former sales agent, live off their pensions, though neighbors who admire their dedication to raising children help with food and clothing.
Keeping the youngsters occupied can be challenging.
""It's an experience that I think is beautiful. It's nice and it's difficult,"" Jimenez said. ""We can't say that everything is easy. ... We have to look for interesting things for them, to change things up, so they don't get stressed out.""
They are also living in one of the countries that appears to have dealt most successfully with the crisis. Costa Rica has reported six deaths from the virus and 742 cases, but for weeks the number of people recovering has outstripped new cases. 
Daily tasks for the kids include housework like sweeping and cooking, and helping the younger ones with homework.
Older siblings are entrusted with chores beyond the front gate, like David Guillen, 21, who goes into town on his bicycle for groceries wearing gloves and a mask.
His younger sister Maritza Martinez said the quarantine presented the rare opportunity to enjoy time with her family.

""I know it's boring to spend time at home,"" she said. ""But you have to find ways to stay entertained, to get off social media, to spend more time with people, something we hardly do anymore.""

CHANTILLY, France (Reuters) - Beekeepers in France are celebrating a bumper spring honey harvest after weeks of warm weather but will need a smooth unwinding of the coronavirus lockdown if they are to find a market for their produce.
Down an overgrown track near the Chantilly Palace, where the James Bond film ""A View to a Kill"" was filmed in the 1980s, beekeeper Franck Portefaix says it could be the best season in four decades.
""The blossom was almost three weeks early and the harvest is very, very good,"" said Portefaix, who followed his parents into beekeeping 30 years ago. 
Nearby, colleagues in protective suits sprayed smoke over hives before opening them to extract the raw honey, most of which Portefaix's business sells in markets. 
Temperatures in the l'Oise, north of Paris, in April hit as high as 30 degrees Celsius, more typical of early summer. 
In a mediocre harvest, a beehive can produce 4-6 kg of honey, rising to 10 kg in a good harvest, but this spring Portefaix said the best performing among his 500 hives could produce up to 20 kg each.
""1976 was really the year of reference, a very good year. And this year has begun much like that year.""
But not all beekeepers are cheering 2020. While northern and western regions of France basked in ideal April weather, prolonged dry spells hurt harvests in the south. Unfavourable weather also in the Landes region hurt acacia honey production.
""With the upheaval to our climate, harvests are becoming increasingly unpredictable. It's still early in the season, we need to temper our expectations,"" said Henri Clement, a spokesman for the National Union of French Beekeeping.
France produced 28,000 tonnes in 2018, according to the French Federation of Professional Beekeepers (FFAP), before disappointing harvests in 2019. 
The challenge for beekeepers in 2020 will be selling the plentiful early supplies. Across France, mayors have closed open-air markets or imposed stringent conditions on openings, part of measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
Only one of the 20 markets Portefaix normally sells at is operating. There, he and his colleagues wear masks and store their jars behind cellophane sheets to prevent customers from touching them.

    ""We have an excellent harvest, so we will have stocks when the lockdown ends,"" Portefaix said. ""But this period is pretty difficult.""

Chinese-born Swedish citizen Gui Minhai is the highest-profile of five booksellers who disappeared in 2015, all linked to a bookshop in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong known for its gossipy texts on Chinese political leaders.
Such books are banned on the mainland but legal in Hong Kong, a former British colony which returned to China in 1997 with guarantees of freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland.
A Chinese court convicted Gui in February and said he had asked to have his Chinese citizenship reinstated.
Sweden retorted he had not asked to have his Swedish citizenship revoked and reiterated demands that he be allowed consular access, and for his release. 
Publishing house Kaunitz-Olsson said in an email the poems were written by Gui in prison. 
The themes of the poems, which are printed in Chinese and Swedish, span from a longing for Swedish forests to his imprisonment, with one stanza reading ""It would be embarrassing To stop writing poems Because the poetry has been caged"". 
Hong Kong was rocked by months of sometimes violent pro-democracy street protests last year, with demonstrators furious at perceived meddling my Beijing in the city's promised freedoms. China denies interfering in the city's affairs.

Germany also classified the Iranian-backed movement as terrorist, a step which Hezbollah's foe Israel has long urged along with the United States. 
Foreign Minister Nassif Hitti affirmed that ""Hezbollah is a main political component in Lebanon which represents a wide section of the people and part of parliament,"" his office said on Tuesday.
Hitti called in Germany's ambassador after the leader of Hezbollah, a military and political movement that is a major backer of the government, accused Germany on Monday of bowing to U.S. pressure.
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah denounced police raids on mosque groups in Germany suspected of being close to the heavily armed Hezbollah, which he said had no official presence in Europe. 
Nasrallah also said Lebanon's government was responsible for protecting its citizens in Germany. 
Iran has condemned Germany's move, while Israel has urged other European Union countries to take similar action.
The EU classifies Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group, but not its political wing. Britain introduced legislation in February of last year, before it left the EU, that designated Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.

The politically sensitive move, earlier reported in Italian media, was immediately attacked by right-wing opposition leader Matteo Salvini, whose League party has founded its success on a strong anti-migrant platform.
Agriculture lobbies have warned Italy will have to throw away huge amounts of fruit and vegetables because there is nobody to pick them, worsening the effects of a shutdown costing the food sector 7 billion euros ($7.58 billion).
The influx of seasonal workers to help on farms has been halted by the block on travel into Italy since its outbreak came to light in February. It has so far killed more than 29,000 people.
Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese is ready to offer temporary permits to some 200,000 irregular migrants currently jobless or living in the shadow economy, to work in agriculture, the ministry source told Reuters.
The move is also intended to help in the fight against the coronavirus. ""If someone falls ill we need to test them and it's difficult to do this if we don't even know their name,"" the source said.
Some 560,000 of the 6.2 million migrants living in Italy in 2019 were irregular, according to the most recent annual report of the Ismu Foundation, a think tank specialized in migration issues.
The regularisation will probably be included in a broader decree aimed at stimulating the economy, which the government is expected to approve later this week, the source said.

""They are working on a huge legalization of irregular migrants ... madness, we will try to stop them in any way,"" League leader and former Interior Minister Matteo Salvini wrote on Twitter.

Liberation Day celebrations have been cancelled or moved online to comply with a ban on public gatherings during the coronavirus outbreak. A virtual concert featuring favourite national musicians was due to broadcast on Tuesday evening.
People flew the Dutch tricolour flag from their balconies and gardens.
Speaking to an almost empty square in central Amsterdam late on Monday, the king drew parallels between the sacrifices the Dutch people made during the war and the lockdown imposed now to halt the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.
""In these exceptional months we have all had to give up some of our freedom. Our country hasn't known anything like this since the war,"" he said in a televised speech after the nation had observed two minutes silence in honour of the war dead.
Only Queen Maxima, Prime Minister Mark Rutte and a couple of other officials were present at the wreath-laying ceremony on Dam Square (NYSE:SQ) that would usually draw thousands of people.
While praising the Dutch soldiers, resistance heroes and civilians who opposed the Nazi occupiers, Willem-Alexander said on Monday country should recognise its failures too.
""(Some people at that time) felt abandoned, insufficiently heard, insufficiently supported, even if it were only in words. Including from London, including from my great-grandmother, as steadfast and fierce in her resistance as she was,"" he said, striking an unusually candid and personal note.
Queen Wilhelmina, who was strongly opposed to the Nazis and spent the war in exile in Britain, rarely mentioned the plight of the Jews in her radio addresses to the Dutch people.
In the early hours of Tuesday, dignitaries lit a torch outside the building in the eastern city of Wageningen where the German surrender was negotiated.
Around 250,000 Dutch people died in World War II, including around 100,000 Jews, according to figures from the country's Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide studies.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines' telecoms body ordered the country's leading broadcaster ABS-CBN Corp to cease operations on Tuesday, as a parliament dominated by President Rodrigo Duterte's loyalists dragged its feet over renewing its license.
Duterte has repeatedly threatened to block the renewal of ABS-CBN's franchise, after the channel angered him during the 2016 presidential election by refusing to air his campaign commercials.
Opposition lawmakers described the order for the channel to suspend operations as ""ill-timed"" given the need to inform the public in the battle against the coronavirus outbreak in the country.
In a statement, ABS-CBN said it will stop operations Tuesday evening to comply with the order from the National Telecommunications Commission, while also imploring lawmakers in Congress, the lower house of parliament, to renew its franchise, which expired on May 4.
""We trust that the government will decide on our franchise with the best interest of the Filipino people in mind, recognising ABS-CBN's role and efforts in providing the latest news and information during these challenging times,"" the channel said in a statement.
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque said the government was grateful for the broadcaster's service, but ABS-CBN's fate lay with the Congress.
The channel also said it had been given assurances that it could carry on broadcasting while the bills to extend its franchise still lay with the Congress.
Yet, NTC Deputy Commissioner Edgardo Cabarios said that the order for the channel stop operations took immediate effect, but added that ABS-CBN could appeal through the courts. The regulator also gave ABS-CBN 10 days to respond and explain why frequencies assigned to it should not be recalled.
ABS-CBN, a 66-year-old entertainment and media conglomerate, employs nearly 7,000 people, operates radio and television stations nationwide and distributes online content.
Antonio Albano, vice-chairman of the lower chamber's committee on legislative franchises, said Congress will order the telecoms body to explain its action.
""We are up in arms against this,"" Albano told DZMM, adding that only Congress can grant or revoke franchise. 
An opposition senator said the closure of the channel undermined the fight against the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 9,600 people in the Philippines, and killed more than 600. 

""This shutdown order goes against public welfare,"" Senator Risa Hontiveros said in a statement.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - The European Union's fraud prosecutor was wrongly removed from her previous job as head of Romania's anti-corruption agency, the European Court of Human Rights said on Tuesday in a landmark ruling against political interference in the judiciary.
Europe's highest court said Laura Codruta Kovesi's dismissal in 2018 had ""defeated the very purpose of maintaining judicial independence"" and must have had ""a chilling effect"" on the ability of magistrates to engage in public debate on legislative reforms. 
During Kovesi's five years at its helm, the anti-corruption agency secured convictions of mayors, lawmakers and ministers across party lines, exposing conflicts of interest and abuse of power in one of the EU's most corrupt states.
Her removal was the culmination of moves by the then Social Democrat government to change judicial legislation and replace chief prosecutors which led to massive street protests and alarmed the European Commission, the European Union's executive.
""We all know my dismissal was part of a campaign to intimidate the judicial system, in an attempt to discourage the fight against corruption,"" Kovesi told Reuters in a statement. 
""This court ruling consolidates the status of all European magistrates and protects them from discretionary political interference from other (state) powers at a time when the independence of those investigating corruption or other serious crimes is under question in several places and in several ways.""
President Klaus Iohannis was forced to dismiss Kovesi on the order of former justice minister Tudorel Toader, backed by a Constitutional Court ruling that set a precedent over how chief prosecutors can be removed. 
Toader had accused Kovesi of overstepping her powers by criticising the government’s changes to judicial legislation.
""One of her duties as anti-corruption chief prosecutor had been to express her opinion on legislative reforms which could have an impact on the judiciary and its independence, and on the fight against corruption,"" the Court said.
""It appeared that her premature removal had defeated the very purpose of maintaining judicial independence and must have had a chilling effect on her and other prosecutors and judges in taking part in public debate on legislative reforms affecting the judiciary and judicial independence.""
Kovesi, who was appointed the EU's first fraud prosecutor last year, had challenged her dismissal at the Luxembourg-based European court, saying she wanted to send a message of support to prosecutors facing political harassment.

Transparency International ranks Romania, a former communist state, as one of the EU's most corrupt member states and Brussels has kept its justice system under special monitoring since it joined the bloc in 2007.

MADRID (Reuters) - Chef Rodrigo de la Calle's Michelin-starred El Invernadero is one of the top restaurants in Calle Ponzano, a stretch of more than 70 bars, eateries and tapas joints near Madrid's business district that is normally packed with young professionals carousing after work.
That was until the coronavirus epidemic hit Spain. The shutters have stayed down all along the street since Spain entered a lockdown on March 14.
De la Calle closed his restaurant, which normally serves only about 16 diners at a sitting with a menu based on high quality vegetables, a few days before the government imposed a state of emergency. 
He had already had a similar experience in his two restaurants in Beijing, China. Even so, he could not imagine how far the situation would go in Spain, one of the countries most hit by the coronavirus with more than 25,000 deaths.
He also closed his star business, a paella corner in the Mercado de San Miguel, Madrid's biggest tourist draw, which last year served about 85,000 helpings of paella.
Faced with the gloomy prospects for tourism, De la Calle, 43, has decided to reinvent himself and is starting a takeaway and delivery service. He is also waiting for government permission to offer a cooking service in customers' homes.
""In the restaurant we have 30-40% of foreign customers for tourism and business and in the San Miguel Market they are 80% foreign, so we have some reluctance to open,"" he said.
""The idea is not to turn a  Michelin  (PA:MICP) restaurant into a delivery. The idea is to survive until we can recover that normality,"" added the chef, a farmer's son who won his first Michelin Star in 2010.
It is not the first time De la Calle has had to reinvent himself. His first restaurant went bankrupt in 2013, a victim of the financial crisis, and he again went bust on a new project in 2014. 
""I have a lot of experience in this kind of crisis unfortunately or fortunately,"" he said.
""It is very important to have attitude, a smile, ask for help from whomever you have to. But the most important thing is to do something for the society and not to be left thinking that the society has to do it for you."", he said, a smile hiding behind his protective mask. 
De la Calle's 26 employees in Spain are on furlough and he will take care of the whole business by himself, from cleaning vegetables to serving and packing orders through two websites named Verdelivery and Paella Corner.
He expected to handle 300 portions between lunch and dinner per day.
""We will be the fine dining of the delivery, and we will be pioneers in giving high quality vegetables take away and there will be versions of dishes from my (Michelin) menu, like the caramelised artichokes.""
His idea is to bring back his employees progressively and to move on to the second phase of the plan, which is to cook at his clients' homes even as the lockdown loosens.

""People won't want to go out and we want to get ahead of that situation,"" he said.

In some cases, fear of infection has led to riots, killing dozens of inmates in Venezuela, Peru and Colombia in recent weeks. OHCHR called for prompt, independent investigations into these incidents.
""In many countries of Latin America, you have really serious overcrowding,"" OHCHR spokesman Rupert Colville told a Geneva briefing, referring to the trend as ""deeply worrying"".

They shuttle back and forth every day between the five-star Hotel Dawliz and the Moulay Abdellah hospital in Sale, located on the other side of the Bouregreg river from the capital Rabat.
""My father is asthmatic and I would never forgive myself if I took the virus home,"" said Mustapha Zeroual, 36, an intensive care nurse.
The medics spend their free time watching television together, chatting, reading or working out, but must always stay more than a metre apart. They keep in touch with their families through phone calls and social media. 
The separation is especially gruelling during Ramadan, Islam's fasting month, when people traditionally get together during the long nights with loved ones, friends and neighbours to share food and drink.
""The last time I saw my parents was from the window 15 days ago when I went home to collect some clothes,"" Zeroual said. 
This year, Ramadan began on April 28. 
""RISK IS PART OF OUR JOB""
Large numbers of Moroccan healthcare workers have opted to stay in hotels since the country went into lockdown on March 20 to slow the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.
The North African country, which has about 36 million people, has so far reported 5,053 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 179 deaths. 
Morocco has fewer than 1,000 intensive care doctors, so keeping them healthy is critical to its pandemic response.
Many hotels across the kingdom have offered to host medical staff or to isolate mild cases until they test negative and can return home. Local authorities are paying. 
Hotel Dawliz, situated on the waterfront near where the broad sweep of the Bouregreg meets the Atlantic, would normally charge upwards of $170 for a room. 
But even there, the doctors and nurses find it hard to switch off from work.
""In our free time we continue to check on our patients. The recovery of every patient is a great victory for us all,"" Zeroual said. 
Not all healthcare workers are staying in hotels. Some decided to take the risk of remaining with their families and must take extra precautions to avoid contagion. 
Meryem Bouchbika, an intensive care doctor living with her husband and two daughters, burst into tears when speaking of the care she must take around them at home to prevent infection. 
""Risk is part of our job and the call of duty takes priority, but I am more concerned for my children than for myself,"" she said.

The plane belonged to African Express (NYSE:EXPR) Airways and was ferrying supplies for use in the fight against the coronavirus when it crashed in the town of Bardale, in the southern Bay region, killing six crew members.
""The Government of the Republic of Kenya urges the Federal Government of Somalia and International Agencies to thoroughly and swiftly investigate the matter because it impacts humanitarian operations at a time of highest need,"" a statement from Kenya's foreign affairs ministry said.

908,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Poland's May 10 presidential election hangs in balance,"By Anna Wlodarczak-Semczuk
WARSAW (Reuters) - The Polish Senate starts an acrimonious debate on Tuesday on legislation that would allow a presidential election scheduled for May 10 to be held entirely by postal ballot instead of at polling stations because of the coronavirus pandemic.
How parliament votes on the government-backed plan will affect whether the ballot is held on time, or later, and could determine the future of Poland's ruling coalition led by the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party.
Opinion polls suggest that President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally who is crucial to the party's policy agenda, could win re-election by a landslide if the ballot is held soon.
However, the opposition and some in the ruling coalition want the ballot postponed by a substantial period of time - months or even two years - amid concerns over public health and the fairness of an election held during a pandemic.
It is too early to say what the legislature will decide, but there are several scenarios that could play out in Poland in the coming weeks as a result of the outcome of its vote. 
POSTAL BALLOT WINS APPROVAL
First to debate the proposed legislation this week is the upper chamber, the Senate. Most observers expect the opposition-dominated chamber to reject it, in a vote likely to take place on Tuesday or Wednesday. 
However the Senate votes, the final word rests with the lower chamber, the Sejm. PiS and its ruling coalition allies hold a tight majority there and the party has pushed hard in recent weeks to ensure voting discipline.
If the Sejm overturns a Senate rejection, or in the unlikely scenario of the Senate also agreeing with it, PiS is expected to move the presidential ballot to May 17 or May 23 to allow for more time to prepare.
The proposed legislation gives it the option to do so.
POSTAL BALLOT IS BLOCKED
Even though PiS holds a majority in the lower house, it is possible it may lose the vote on the legislation there.
A junior partner in its coalition, Accord, has said it opposes holding the election now.
Accord has 18 deputies out of 235 ruling coalition lawmakers in the 460-seat Sejm. It is not clear how many of them will oppose the postal vote but as few as five could leave the PiS unable to overrule the Senate's decisions. 
In theory, that would mean Poland would go to the polls on Sunday. But preparations for this are lagging, and the head of the state electoral commission has said it would be impossible to organise it at such short notice.
PIS OPTIONS IF PLAN BLOCKED
PiS has not said what its Plan B is. It is not possible under current Polish law to change an election date after it has been announced. 
A rebellion by Accord could break up the ruling coalition and plunge Poland into political chaos at a time when the pandemic requires a strong government response to prop up a tottering economy.
PiS might end up governing as a minority cabinet, relying on ad hoc support. A snap parliamentary election could not be ruled out.
To avoid having to hold the presidential election on May 10, PiS could announce a state of emergency or natural disaster, something it has so far refused to do, arguing that there are not sufficient grounds to do so.
Under the constitution, this would then trigger a postponement of the presidential election. It could not then be held until at least 90 days after the eventual lifting of any such state of emergency.
PRESIDENT COULD RESET THE CLOCK
Polish media, citing unnamed sources, have also mentioned the possibility that Duda could resign as president before the end of his term. 
Under such a scenario a new vote would have to be announced no later than two weeks after his resignation and the election would be held within a period of 60 days from the day of the announcement.

A proposal by Accord to hold the presidential election in two years would require changing the constitution but this option does not have sufficient support in parliament.

909,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>",Tents and immunity testing: U.S. colleges weigh return to campus life,"By Jan Wolfe
Classes in tents. Roommates assigned based on coronavirus antibody tests. Residences set aside for quarantined students. U.S. college life could look dramatically different when classes resume in the fall.
Colleges emptied dormitories and moved classes online in March as the pandemic worsened — a decision that left many students clamoring for partial refunds.
Facing budget shortfalls, several colleges have said they are putting infrastructure investments on hold, freezing hiring, and furloughing employees. 
Now, universities are exploring creative, once-implausible approaches to make sure students can return to campus in the 2020-2021 academic year. 
""There will be changes for sure, but one way or another we are going to be open,"" said James Herbert, president of the University of New England (UNE), a private college in Maine.
The selling point of residential colleges is campus life and the sense of community it fosters, said Brian Rosenberg, president of Macalester College in Minnesota.
When classes are online, private schools cannot make money from housing and dining services, and they struggle to justify tuition costs, Rosenberg said.
The average tuition and fees at an in-state public college was $10,116 for the 2019-2020 year and $36,801 at private schools, according to U.S. News and World Report.
“The best scenario from a financial perspective for any residential college is to try get in as much of a full year open on campus as possible,"" Rosenberg said. 
School administrators are eyeing changes to dormitory life.
Herbert of UNE said the university is looking into assigning roommates based on the results of tests that can detect if someone has antibodies to the coronavirus.
Ideally, a student without antibodies would be paired with one who has them to prevent roommates from infecting each other, Herbert said.
""We require students to be vaccinated – to have certain vaccines – so I think you could certainly require students to have the antibody test,"" Herbert said. 
He added the plan is a ""work in progress"" and depends on the accuracy of tests and ongoing research.
""If the science improves, and the availability improves over the coming months, it could be a really useful tool."" 
David Greene, president of Colby College in Maine, said he expected some residential facilities would be set aside for infected students.
UNE is considering renting rooms at a hotel near campus to space students out, Herbert added.
Social distancing measures will also impact on-campus classes, transforming academic life for students. 
Because the virus spreads more easily in confined spaces, Stanford University in California is considering holding classes outdoors in large tents, a university spokesman said.
Colleges could suspend lecture classes that pack hundreds of students into big auditoriums and, instead, host smaller classes in auditoriums so students can sit further apart, Rosenberg said.
Brown University in Rhode Island may require students and faculty to wear face masks and place limits on athletics, concerts and parties, the school's president Christina Paxson wrote in an April 26 op-ed for the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT).
Even with precautions, colleges cannot eliminate the risk of outbreaks and should be transparent about it, Herbert said.
University of New England may send ""consent forms"" to students and their parents making clear they are ""assuming a somewhat higher risk"" by returning to campus, Herbert said.
Questions also remain about whether students on packed college campuses, known for partying and athletic culture, will adhere to social distancing and other safety measures.
""I expect there will be at least some groups of people that wouldn't listen and have normal social gatherings, but I think overall most people will be respectful,"" said Madeleine Larsen, a sophomore student at the University of California, Los Angeles. 
The 20-year-old added she was still undecided about returning to UCLA and might take a year off if classes in September are online.
Larsen said she will likely return to campus if there is in-person instruction, even if it means accepting dramatic changes to college life.

""There's no way things can go back to the way they were before — that's just not realistic at this point,"" she said.

910,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court to weigh overseas anti-AIDS funding restrictions,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Supreme Court on Tuesday is set to hear arguments over whether a U.S. law violates constitutional free speech rights by requiring overseas affiliates of American-based nonprofit groups that seek federal funding for HIV/AIDS relief to formally adopt a stance against prostitution and sex trafficking.
The case is the second in which the nine justices will hear arguments by teleconference following Monday's debut of the call-in format prompted by the coronavirus pandemic in a trademark dispute involving hotel reservation website Booking (NASDAQ:BKNG).com.
President Donald Trump's administration is appealing a 2018 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in favor of non-profit organizations that challenged a provision of the 2003 law as a violation of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.
Organizations including the Alliance for Open Society International, Pathfinder International, InterAction and the Global Health Council challenged the constitutionality of the measure.
The groups, which currently take no stance on prostitution, said the law interferes with their work providing advice and counseling to sex workers about the risks of HIV infection. The groups did not challenge a separate provision of the law that bars applicants from using federal funds to promote or advocate the legalization of prostitution or sex trafficking.
The plaintiffs obtained an injunction in 2006 that has prevented the policy from being enforced against them. The Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the law violated the free speech rights of the U.S.-based groups but did not decide the question over whether applying it to the overseas entities with which they are affiliated also is unconstitutional.
The Trump administration argued that foreign entities like those affiliated with the nonprofits do not have free speech rights that can be enforced in U.S. courts and that the rights of the American groups therefore were not violated.

The law, enacted under Republican former President George W. Bush, intended to bar funding for organizations that operate programs overseas but do not have a blanket policy opposing prostitution and sex trafficking. The United States has spent billions of dollars to fight HIV/AIDS overseas.

911,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",Seasonal and undocumented workers in Portugal fall through safety net,"By Victoria Waldersee
LISBON(Reuters) - Fatima, 57, was midway through a course for the long-term unemployed at her local job centre in Lisbon, earning about 10 euros a day selling jewellery and knick-knacks at street stalls and community centres to make ends meet.
Then the coronavirus pandemic hit.
""I'm so embarrassed to be here,"" she told Reuters as she picked up her daily meal from Comunidade Vida e Paz, a community organisation delivering food to the needy every night. 
""Without this pandemic I would never have considered it. But I'm not earning a cent.""
Like tens of thousands of undocumented, migrant or seasonal workers in Portugal hit hard by the outbreak, Fatima is falling through the national safety net. 
They lack the contracts and payslips needed to apply for unemployment benefits, and many are turning to charities for help.
Although unemployment rose 9% in March, spending on unemployment benefits fell by 7.1 million euros in March 2019 and unemployment benefit applications fell by 2.4%, indicating people are falling out of the system.
A total of 91,500 people registered as unemployed between the beginning of Portugal's state of emergency and the end of April, official figures showed, bringing total unemployment to just under 370,000 people.
But the true number of people out of work is likely to be much higher as seasonal and undocumented workers remain uncounted.
In the tourism-heavy Algarve region, unemployment soared 41% in March. About 50,000 workers rely on seasonal and often uncontracted jobs and so do not have the work record to qualify for benefits, union spokesman Tiago Jacinto told Reuters. But nor do they appear in unemployment figures.
""There are thousands who were expecting to start work in May, June and simply won't get a job,"" Jacinto said. ""These unemployment figures don't show the true scale of the problem.""
HUNGER BITES
Workers who lost or were suspended from their jobs because of the coronavirus outbreak have a range of options available to them, from obtaining 70% of their salary through a lay-off scheme to applying for unemployment benefits worth up to 65% of their average income in the past year.
Exceptional measures for independent and freelance workers were implemented in March for people earning at least 40% less because of the pandemic or unable to work due to caring responsibilities.
But all these require proof of social security contributions for at least three of the past 12 months, which new arrivals here for the summer season and undocumented workers cannot provide.
Migrants with ongoing applications to immigration authorities were granted permanent residence rights in March in order to give them access to public services, but with no history of paperwork and no jobs on the go, they too cannot access income.
And others - Portuguese and foreign - simply lived on cash-in-hand jobs vulnerable to the lockdown - from personal fitness trainers to hairdressers to tuk-tuk drivers.
""A lot of the people coming to us for the first time this month were not poor,"" said Isabel Jonet, head of a network of 21 food banks across the country which has received 60,000 new requests for support since the lockdown. 
""Their finances were finely balanced, and all the indicators said our economy was doing well. But now there's nothing coming in and nothing to fall back on,"" Jonet told Reuters.
An emergency food distribution fund set up during austerity years will be used to buy 90,000 food baskets for families affected by the outbreak in May, including those on layoff earning 30% less than usual and unable to afford meals.
""We are working on altering legislation to be able to respond to people who need it,"" Labour Minister Ana Mendes Godinho said on Monday.
Meanwhile, volunteers from Comunidade Vida e Paz drop off food at every spot where they know a homeless person sleeps each night in Lisbon, sometimes driving around the city until 3 a.m. 
Since the outbreak, they have been running out of meals as the number of people approaching their vans has jumped from 400 to 550 people a night – many of whom are not homeless, but simply out of income and cannot afford food. ""What can I do? If this goes on I'll die of hunger,"" said Fatima.

912,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 04:51AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Lesotho's murdered first lady agreed to divorce on day she died - sources,"By Tim Cocks
MASERU (Reuters) - Hours before she was shot dead on the outskirts of the capital, Lesotho's former first lady, Lipolelo Thabane, made a surprising decision.
According to both a close friend and a well-connected businessman, she agreed to divorce her husband, Prime Minister Thomas Thabane, after years of refusing to make way for her rival.
With the blessing of that rival - Thabane's current wife and first lady - the entrepreneur, Teboho Mojapela, met with Lipolelo on the day of her death to mediate.
""She said: '...I am ready to free him',"" Mojapela told Reuters. ""'I just want to be looked after.'""
The exchange was confirmed by her friend and confidante Thato Sibolla, who was present at the meeting.
Lipolelo's change of heart, which has not previously been reported, adds a new twist to a scandal that has attracted rare international attention to Lesotho, the tiny kingdom of 2 million people tucked inside South Africa.
Gunmen ambushed Lipolelo, 58, in her car as she made her way home on the outskirts of the capital Maseru on June 14, 2017. Sibolla was with her in the vehicle.
Two days after the killing, Thabane, now 80, was sworn in for a second term. Two months later he married Lipolelo's successor and one-time rival Maesaiah Liabiloe Ramoholi, now Maesaiah Thabane.
Police charged Maesaiah with Lipolelo's murder in February and named Thabane as a suspect, although he has yet to be formally charged in court. They both deny any involvement.
In Thabane's case, the high court must first decide whether he can be prosecuted while in office. The case has been postponed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although Lesotho remains one of a small number of nations yet to register a case.
Thabane's own government is trying to force him from office before the end of July, when he said he was willing to step down. It is unclear if he will bow to their demands.
Thabane and his wife declined to be interviewed or respond to written questions while the case is pending, and their lawyers said they had been instructed not to speak to the press.
""He's waiting for the police to lodge a complaint to court so that he can clear his name,"" Thabane's private secretary, Thabo Thakalekoala, said by telephone.
First lady Maesaiah also ""wants to present her side of the story,"" her adviser, Manama Letsie, told Reuters. ""But she has already been found guilty in the public (opinion) court.""
The high-profile murder case has destabilised a country already in turmoil.
Lesotho has seen four military coups since independence from Britain in 1966. South Africa, for whom this nation of jagged green mountains is an important source of tap water, is sometimes drawn in to help resolve upheavals, and it has stepped in as mediator in the latest crisis.
FATEFUL DAYS
Thabane was an up-and-coming politician in the All Basotho Convention (ABC) party when he divorced his first wife, Yayi, and married Lipolelo in 1987.
By the time he became prime minister in 2012, he had filed for another divorce so he could marry Maesaiah. 
Maesaiah had gone to court in 2015 to claim the right to be first lady on the basis of a 2012 so-called customary marriage – a practice common in a number of African countries that entitles a man to more than one wife.
She lost the case in 2015, on the grounds that Lipolelo was still married to Thabane. 
""There was this perpetual animosity between them,"" Lesotho's Deputy Police Commissioner Paseka Mokete, in charge of the murder investigation, told Reuters.
Three days before the killing, a Sunday, Lipolelo asked Sibolla to call Mojapela, a politically connected businessman who had funded the ruling party's election campaign.
Lipolelo seemed jumpy, was sleeping at friends' houses and said she feared her life was in danger, Sibolla and a neighbour recalled.
Mojapela, a wealthy money-lender known to friends as J.P., was a friend of Thabane and Maesaiah, Sibolla said, and Lipolelo hoped he could mediate a truce between them.
Before meeting with Lipolelo, Mojapela says he sought the blessing of Thabane and Maesaiah. Maesaiah told him ""by all means"" mediate, he said, but do not expect the two women to meet face-to-face. 
    On Wednesday, Sibolla and Lipolelo set off in Lipolelo's grey Chevrolet minivan to meet Mojapela at his lavish house, decked with Italian-style curtains and gilded furniture, in the South African border town of Ladybrand.
    He told them Maesaiah wanted more than anything to be first lady. Lipolelo gave her assent.
After Lipolelo and Sibolla left, Mojapela headed back to Maseru, where he says he met Thabane and Maesaiah at the Fu Li Chinese restaurant at around 6 p.m. and relayed Lipolelo's message.
    ""Maesaiah asked me to be more specific about what she wants,"" Mojapela said.
Reuters could not confirm the meeting. When a reporter visited the restaurant, it was under new management.
Thabane's private secretary, Thakalekoala, said he was not aware of a mediation attempt. Neither was Maesaiah's close friend, Motlatsi Kompi. The first lady's aide, Letsie, declined to comment.
Shortly afterwards, Lipolelo was dead.
""I saw the blood running down,"" said Sibolla, who was shot twice in the side in the attack. ""She was quite light in complexion, so you could really see it.""
Police found 9mm pistol shells at the scene, Mokete, the deputy commissioner, said. He added that the assassination was carried out by one of several gangs of traditional musicians, who are engaged in a deadly turf war.
Three men linked to the gang received calls from the phones of Thabane and Maesaiah in the days leading up to the killing, he said. Police issued arrest warrants for them, but they remain at large.
Finishing up at the Chinese restaurant, Mojapela says he headed to a friend's house where, at around 8 p.m., his bodyguard delivered the news of Lipolelo's death.

    ""I was disgusted. I cried,"" he said. ""There was absolutely no need for this woman to be assassinated.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Officials in India's capital imposed a special tax of 70% on retail liquor purchases from Tuesday, to deter large gatherings at stores as authorities ease a six-week lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Taxes on alcohol are a key contributor to the revenue of many of India's 36 states and federal territories, most of which are running short of funds because of the lengthy disruption in economic activity caused by the virus. 
Police baton-charged hundreds of people who had flocked to liquor shops when they opened on Monday for the first time in a relaxation of the world's biggest lockdown, which is set to run until May 17. 
The Delhi state government announced the ""special corona fee"" in a public notice late on Monday.
""It was unfortunate that chaos was seen at some shops in Delhi,"" said Arvind Kejriwal, the state's chief minister.
""If we come to know about violations of social distancing and other norms from any area, then we will have to seal the area and revoke the relaxations there,"" he added. 
Other states, such as southern Andhra Pradesh, where people also violated social distancing measures to queue up in their hundreds for alcohol, also hiked prices.
The increases come as India reported 3,900 new infections on Tuesday for its highest single day rise, taking the tally to 46,432. The death toll stood at 1,568, the health ministry said.
Health experts said the daily increase shows India remains at risk despite a severe lockdown that has confined its population of 1.3 billion to their homes since late March, with all public transport halted and economic activity nearly frozen. 
""The curve has not shown a downward trend. That is cause for concern,"" said Dr Randeep Guleria, director of New Delhi's premier All-India Institute of Medical Sciences.
India's average daily increase in cases has been 6.1 over the past week, behind Russia and Brazil but higher than Britain, the United States and Italy.
The biggest spikes were recorded in the western states of Maharashtra, home to India's commercial capital of Mumbai, and Gujarat as well as Delhi. These densely populated urban centres drive India's economy, powered by armies of migrant workers.
Government officials said the lockdown had helped avert a surge of infections that could have overwhelmed medical services, however.
Now cases are doubling every 12 days, up from 3.4 days when the lockdown began, said Lav Agarwal, a joint secretary in the health ministry.
""Lockdown and containment are yielding results, the challenge is now to improve on the doubling rate,"" he added.

""With regards to the geopolitics of who has received aid, I can confirm that our foreign policy today is identical to yesterday's,"" Giuseppe Conte was quoted as saying in a report by newspaper La Stampa. 
On Monday Esper, had told the daily that Russia and China were taking advantage of the virus outbreak to put their interests forward in Europe and ""create divisions in NATO and Europe.""
Both countries have offered support to Italy, sending doctors, medical equipment and face masks to the country, which was the first in Europe to be hit hard by the outbreak.
Conte was also quoted as saying that Italy had managed all aid it had received ""in total transparency both towards our public opinion and towards our allies"".
""We converse with everyone, but the pillars of our security are NATO and the European Union. And they remain as such,"" Defence Minister Lorenzo Guerini said in a separate interview, to daily la Repubblica. 

He added that Italy had received aid from several countries, including Europe, the United States, China and Russia but that this had not ""changed to the least our traditional frame of international reference.""

917,By Reuters,"<span>May 05, 2020 02:35AM ET</span>","Taiwan rebuffs WHO, says China has no right to represent it","TAIPEI (Reuters) - Only Taiwan's democratically-elected government can represent its people on the world stage, not China, its foreign ministry said on Tuesday, calling on the World Health Organization (WHO) to ""cast off"" China's control during the coronavirus pandemic.
Taiwan's exclusion from WHO, due to China's objections which considers the island one of its provinces, has infuriated Taipei, which says this has created a dangerous gap in the global fight against the coronavirus.
Taiwan has been lobbying to attend, as an observer, this month's meeting of the WHO's decision-making body, the World Health Assembly (WHA), although government and diplomatic sources say China will block the move.
Steven Solomon, the WHO's principal legal officer, said on Monday that the WHO recognised the People's Republic of China as the ""one legitimate representative of China"", in keeping with U.N. policy since 1971, and that the question of Taiwan's attendance was one for the WHO's 194 member states.
Speaking in Taipei, Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the 1971 decision, under which Beijing assumed the U.N. China seat from Taipei, only resolved the issue of who represented China, not the issue of Taiwan, and did not grant China the power to represent Taiwan internationally.
""Only the democratically-elected Taiwanese government can represent Taiwan's 23 million people in the international community,"" she told reporters.
The WHO should ""cast off the Chinese government's control"", and let Taiwan fully participate in fighting the virus, Ou said.
""Do not let China's improper political interference become an obstacle to impeding the world's united fight against the virus.""
Taiwan attended the World Health Assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations warmed.
But China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, charges she rejects.
The United States has strongly supported Taiwan's participation at the WHA as an observer, another fault line in Washington-Beijing ties that have been already overshadowed by the Trump administration's criticism of how China and the WHO have handled the outbreak.
China says Taiwan is adequately represented by Beijing and that Taiwan can only take part in the WHO under Beijing's ""one China"" policy, in which Taiwan would have to accept that it is part of China, something Tsai's government will not do.

Taiwan has reported far fewer cases of the new coronavirus than many of its neighbours, due to early and effective detection and prevention work.

919,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 07:35PM ET</span>",U.S. should keep Congress informed about nuclear talks with Saudis: GAO,"By Timothy Gardner
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Departments of State and Energy should commit to regular briefings to relevant committees in Congress on talks about nuclear power cooperation with Saudi Arabia, a congressional watchdog said in a report on Monday. 
The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, report said Congress should consider amending the 1954 Atomic Energy Act, or AEA, to require the briefings for the House Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations about negotiations on nuclear power sharing.
Lawmakers concerned about nonproliferation issues associated with nuclear power development had complained they were being kept in the dark about Trump administration talks with Saudi Arabia, many of which were led by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Concern grew after Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS in 2018 that the kingdom did not want to acquire a nuclear bomb, but would do so if its rival Iran did so. 
Riyadh could announce a tender this year for two nuclear power reactors, its first commercial ones. Russia, China, South Korea and France have also been in talks about building reactors there. 
The State Department is required by the AEA to keep Congress ""fully and currently informed"" about the talks. But the GAO found it was ""unclear"" whether the department did so. ""Congressional staff provided us with examples of having to find information on the negotiations from other sources, such as press articles,"" the GAO said.
Some U.S. lawmakers want the United States to insist that Saudi Arabia agree to a so-called gold standard that restricts enrichment and reprocessing, potential pathways to making fissile material for nuclear weapons. The United States struck such an agreement with the United Arab Emirates in 2009. If Saudi Arabia develops nuclear power without the gold standard, the UAE would likely seek to be released from its agreement.
The GAO said Congress should consider whether to amend the AEA to require briefings, perhaps on a quarterly basis, and to specify expectations for the content of the briefings. 
Senators Robert Menendez, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, had asked the GAO last year to review U.S. agency negotiations with Saudi Arabia on nuclear power, partially because they were concerned the Energy Department, not the State Department took the lead. 
The senators said they would explore legislative changes recommended by the GAO. ""Congress must reassert its critical role in reviewing nuclear cooperation agreements to ensure these agreements do not pose an unnecessary risk to the United States"" they said.

(Reuters) - The Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica won the Pulitzer Prize for public service journalism on Monday for revealing one-third of Alaska's villages had no police protection, while the photography staff of Reuters won the breaking news photography award for documenting last year's violent protests in Hong Kong.
The Courier-Journal in Louisville, Kentucky, took home the breaking news honor for its coverage of hundreds of last-minute pardons issued by former Governor Matt Bevin. The prize for investigative reporting went to the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT)' Brian Rosenthal, who uncovered how thousands of New York City's taxi drivers had their lives ruined by predatory lending.
The Pulitzer Prize for Reuters, a unit of  Thomson Reuters  (NYSE:TRI), was the newsroom's eighth since 2008, and fifth in the last three years. For its coverage of the protests, which grew out of concern that China was intent on curtailing Hong Kong's freedoms, Reuters' staff was also a finalist for the international reporting award, which was won by The New York Times.
The Pulitzer Prizes, the most prestigious awards in American journalism, have been handed out since 1917, when newspaper publisher Joseph Pulitzer established them in his will. Monday's announcement had been postponed for two weeks because some journalists on the 18-member Pulitzer board are busy covering the coronavirus pandemic.
In normal years, the prizes are announced at Columbia University in New York. On Monday, Dana Canedy, who administers the Pulitzers, delivered the news from her living room via video, after weeks in which board members hashed out the finalists and winners remotely.
""Ironically, the very first time the Prizes were presented was June 1917 — less than a year before the 1918 outbreak of the Spanish Flu pandemic,"" Canedy said. ""During this season of unprecedented uncertainty, one thing we know for sure is that journalism never stops.""
The Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica series found rampant sexual abuse in rural villages that are largely populated by indigenous people, where law enforcement was effectively nonexistent.
The public service award is generally seen as the most coveted of the 15 journalism categories. The Pulitzers are also awarded in seven book, drama and music categories.
'DEEPLY MEMORABLE'
Many of the winning Reuters photographs depicted the violent clashes between Hong Kong protesters and authorities, including images taken in the midst of skirmishes with tear gas, rubber bullets and hurled bricks.
""Our photographers brilliantly captured the magnitude of the protests in Hong Kong,"" Stephen J. Adler, Reuters editor-in-chief, said in a statement. ""Their images were beautiful, haunting, illuminating and deeply memorable.""
The Seattle Times shared the national reporting prize for its series exposing design flaws in Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co's 737 Max passenger jet that led to two fatal crashes, as well as a contributing lack of government oversight. ProPublica also won in the category for an investigation into the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet following several deadly accidents at sea.
For the first time, the board gave out an ""audio reporting"" prize, which went to the public radio show This American Life as well as reporters for the Los Angeles Times and Vice News for an episode examining the Trump administration's ""Remain in Mexico"" policy that has stranded tens of thousands of asylum seekers on the southern side of the U.S.-Mexico border.
The Washington Post won the explanatory journalism award for a series documenting the many places that have already warmed by 2 degrees Celsius because of climate change, hitting a threshold that experts warn could be catastrophic if reached globally.
The New York Times, which had won a record 127 Pulitzer prizes and citations before this year, received three more on Monday, including the commentary prize for Nikole Hannah-Jones's personal essay launching the newspaper's sweeping 1619 Project, which ""seeks to place the enslavement of Africans at the center of America's story,"" in the words of the Pulitzer board.
The board also issued a special citation to Ida B. Wells, the African American investigative journalist and civil rights activist. Wells, who was born into slavery in Mississippi in 1862, traveled the Deep South chronicling the use of lynching to oppress black Americans.
WHITEHEAD WINS AGAIN
The journalism prizes often go to venerable institutions such as the Times or the Post, but they are also won by local publications whose work does not always gain national attention.
Jeffery Gerritt, editor at the small newspaper Palestine Herald-Press in Palestine, Texas, won the editorial writing prize for columns detailing how pre-trial inmates died in jail without adequate health care.
Among the awards for letters, music and drama, Colson Whitehead won the fiction prize for the novel ""The Nickel Boys,"" chronicling the horrors of an abusive reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida. He won the same award for his previous book, ""The Underground Railroad.""
The music award went to ""The Central Park Five,"" an opera by Anthony Davis about the five African American and Latino teenagers who were wrongly convicted in the 1989-90 New York ""Central Park jogger"" rape case.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's state premiers will agree on measures to further ease coronavirus restrictions in a teleconference with Chancellor Angela Merkel scheduled for Wednesday, two people familiar with the preparations told Reuters on Monday.
The state premiers are expected to give the green light for large shops to reopen, probably from May 11, the sources said.
Smaller shops are already back to business in Europe's largest economy as long as they respect social distancing rules to slow the spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.
German states are also set to allow the Bundesliga soccer league to resume matches, probably from May 15, under strict conditions without fans in stadiums, the sources said.
At the same time, state premiers will allow outdoor sports for non-professionals and children, the sources added.
The states will also agree to reopen schools for all grades step-by-step, though most children will only be allowed to go to class in rotating shifts, not on daily basis, the sources said.
Officials are also aware that ""something needs to be done"" to gradually reopen day nurseries and kindergartens for as many toddlers as possible to help working parents, one source said.
Germany took a further step on the long road back to post-coronavirus normality on Monday, with museums and hairdressers reopening under strict conditions, churches opening their doors for worshippers, and more car factories resuming work.
But more than a month after Germany suspended all but essential social and commercial life to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, politicians are at odds over how far and how fast to move.
There is mounting pressure from business groups and some regional governments who are anxious to move faster on restarting economic life. Merkel has warned that reopening too swiftly risks triggering a second wave of infections.

Germany has been more successful than other large European countries in slowing the virus' spread - it estimates that every 100 carriers of the virus now infects only 74 others on average, well below the 100 mark where new restrictions must be imposed.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson will review the measures that have all but shuttered Britain's economy on May 7 to judge whether any can be eased, a decision which he says will be guided by the government's desire to protect public health.
Britain has been locked down for six weeks, and Johnson is under pressure from some in his governing Conservative Party to start to ease some of the measures, allowing people to return to reopened businesses and for some children to go back to school. 
But so far, the prime minister, who says he fought for his life in intensive care after contracting COVID-19, has been cautious over offering any promises on the lockdown, signalling he wants to bring Labour and other opposition parties on board.
""Our priority is protecting the public's health and saving lives,"" Starmer said in a statement before a meeting with Johnson later this week. ""That is why we supported the lockdown and again support the restrictions staying in place at this time.""
He also outlined seven ""core principles"" that should be considered by the government, including keeping people safe at work, at school or in other public services, increasing mass testing and ensuring supplies of protective equipment.
Starmer has criticised Johnson for being slow on introducing the lockdown, which began on March 23, slow on increasing testing and on providing protective equipment, but has also wanted to be constructive at a time of crisis.

""We want to support the government to get this right and that is why we need a national consensus on what happens next,"" he said in the statement.

The Syrian army said in a statement that Israel hit military barracks in al Safirah in the eastern Aleppo countryside. Earlier, state television had said a research centre was targeted. 
A regional intelligence source said Israel was stepping up raids in Syria at a time when world attention and the region, including Syria, were distracted by the coronavirus pandemic.
An Israeli army spokeswoman declined to comment on the report.
Western intelligence sources say Iranian-backed militias have long been entrenched in Aleppo province where they have bases and a command centre, part of a growing presence across government-controlled Syria.
Israeli helicopters fired several rockets from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on targets inside southern Syria known to be a base for Lebanon's Hezbollah militia, Syria and intelligence sources said.
The Syrian government does not say Iranian bases are targeted when it announces details of Israeli raids.
Major blasts in an ammunition depot near Homs city on the same day were also believed to be from an Israeli strike, a war monitor and intelligence sources said.
Israel has acknowledged in recent years it has conducted many raids inside Syria since the start of the civil war in 2011 where it sees Iran's presence as a strategic threat. 
Israeli defence minister Naftali Bennett told Israeli media last week that Israel would step up its campaign against Iran in Syria.

The new leader of the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo (CODECO), Ngabu Ngawi Olivier, called on the army to enact a ceasefire to allow talks with the government, a potential breakthrough for President Felix Tshisekedi who has promised to bring an end to decades of unrest in the region.
Olivier did not give a date when CODECO would halt violence.
In recent weeks intense fighting in Djugu Territory in northern Ituri province has forced thousands of people from their homes, complicating the country's response to the coronavirus pandemic, and an Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 2,200 people.
""We are a peaceful sect and war does not benefit us,"" Olivier told Reuters by telephone. 
""We took up arms to protect ourselves against attacks by the (army) and other religious communities on our followers. But now I think it is no longer important to continue killing civilians or attacking the army.""
Last week the army said an operation to uproot CODECO, which is drawn from the Lendu ethnic group, was gaining ground following the killing of its leader Justin Ngondjolu in late March.
Jean-Bosco Lalo, civil society coordinator of Ituri province, said the ceasefire was unexpected but a welcome opportunity to bring peace to the area.
""It is a first since the massacres began and we pray to God that it will be a success,"" Lalo said. ""It remains to be seen whether he will be understood by all the militiamen.""
Founded in 1978 as an agricultural cooperative, researchers say CODECO produced mystical potions that fighters believed protected them during previous conflicts in the area. 
Little is known about the secretive group which took up arms itself in recent years and which local rights groups accuse of killing hundreds of civilians.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Monday picked a new head of the federal police following a Supreme Court decision to block his effort to appoint a family friend - a tactical retreat a day after he and supporters threatened the court in anti-democratic protests.
The new appointment showed Bolsonaro moving quickly to install a trusted appointee to the top law enforcement role as mounting investigations and his lax handling of the COVID-19 pandemic erode his popularity and feed talk of impeachment.
The government's official gazette said Bolsonaro had tapped as federal police chief, Rolando Alexandre de Souza, who had worked as a close aide to his original choice, Alexandre Ramagem, at Brazil's intelligence agency Abin. 
Bolsonaro dismissed as ""gossip"" accusations by former Justice Minister Sergio Moro that the president had tried to interfere in sensitive investigations by naming Ramagem, a friend of his sons, as top cop.
Moro, a popular figure in Brazil's anti-corruption efforts who locked up scores of business leaders and politicians as a judge, testified to prosecutors and police on Saturday as part of an investigation authorized by the Supreme Court.
The former minister's evidence against Bolsonaro included recordings of conversations with the president, a person with knowledge of his deposition told Reuters.
Moro told investigators that three army generals in Bolsonaro's cabinet, two of them active duty officers and the other retired, witnessed the president's pressure on the federal police and could confirm his accounts, said the source, requesting anonymity to speak freely.
On Monday, Brazil's top prosecutor asked the Supreme Court for authorization to question the three military cabinet ministers in the investigation of alleged interference by the president in the federal police.
Moro could not be reached immediately for comment.
Moro's resignation and allegations 10 days ago set off the most serious political crisis Bolsonaro has faced in office, compounded by criticism for playing down a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 7,000 people in Brazil.
A record low 27% of Brazilians consider the government ""good"" or ""great,"" while those considering it ""bad"" or ""awful"" jumped 7 percentage points in a week to 49%, showed a telephone survey by pollster Ipespe commissioned by XP (NASDAQ:XP) Investimentos.
Another survey published over the weekend, run by pollster IDEIA Big Data via mobile app, showed the government's approval rating fell 8 percentage points in a week to 22% as disapproval shot up to a record 47%.
Those polls, conducted from Tuesday to Thursday, suggested that the impact of the crisis may have grown over the course of last week, after a Monday telephone poll by veteran pollster Datafolha showed Bolsonaro's support holding firm.
The far-right president came under fire again on Sunday for attacking Congress and the Supreme Court in a speech to hundreds of supporters who were calling for military rule in Brazil and an end to coronavirus quarantine measures.
Bolsonaro said at the rally outside the presidential palace that he had Brazil's armed forces behind him and he was losing patience with ""interference"" in his agenda.
Yet, the Defense Ministry cast doubt on Bolsonaro's claim in a rare statement on Monday. The government body said the armed forces were on the side of democracy, the separation of powers and of Brazil's constitution.
The statement also denounced attacks on journalists, after at least three photographers were assaulted during the Sunday rally.
Former allies in Congress have joined a growing chorus in Brasilia calling for a debate on impeachment of Bolsonaro, a move with the support of about half of Brazilians, according to the most recent Datafolha survey.

Last week's XP poll surveyed 1,000 people, with a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points up or down. The IDEIA survey polled 1,609 people, with a margin of error of 4 percentage points in either direction.

The arrest of ex-Security Minister Genaro Garcia Luna in Dallas late last year sent shockwaves across Mexico, where he had spearheaded a militarized assault on powerful drug gangs beginning under former President Felipe Calderon in 2006.
Garcia Luna was subsequently indicted on charges of accepting millions of dollars in bribes from the Sinaloa Cartel, the gang once led by drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. 
Speaking at his regular morning news conference, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador called for a wide-ranging inquiry, suggesting that such an investigation could uncover wrongdoing by more than just one official.
""The U.S. government, now that it has begun an investigation, should delve deeper and also investigate officials"" with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Lopez Obrador said.
The investigation should cover ""all those who intervened during this period, because without a doubt, there was cooperation,"" the president added.
Lopez Obrador suggested that an inquiry could uncover ""criminal association"" among officials from both governments.
His call was prompted by a question about comments by former U.S. Ambassador to Mexico Roberta Jacobson to Mexican magazine Proceso published at the weekend in which she suggested both governments knew about possible corruption by Garcia Luna.
""The information we obtained - in the State Department - was drawn from U.S. officials, but it came from Mexicans, they were the ones who received and had most information about Garcia Luna's corruption,"" Proceso quoted her as saying.
Jacobson afterwards clarified on Twitter that she had never seen any ""corroborated"" evidence of Garcia Luna's involvement in drug trafficking and that ""in an environment of many rumors, one is always cautious about working with officials.""
A former FBI official in Mexico and an ex-CIA official both worked at a security company run by Garcia Luna until 2018.

Earlier this year, a U.S. judge signaled that the drug corruption trial of the former minister will likely be prolonged due to its ""complex"" nature.

MONTREAL (Reuters) - The province of Quebec, worst hit in Canada by the coronavirus, began gradually reopening its economy on Monday but pushed back plans for a restart in the city of Montreal, citing health concerns.
Quebec is allowing stores with an outside entrance for customers to serve shoppers, but that excludes Montreal, Canada's second-largest city.
It is joining some other provinces, like Manitoba, in taking steps to reopen the economy.
Although Quebec makes up 24% of the Canadian population, it accounts for 54% of the country's coronavirus cases and 60% of the deaths. Canada has so far reported 59,844 positive diagnoses and 3,766 deaths from the respiratory illness.
Most Quebec cases have occurred in seniors' residences and among the elderly, and Premier Francois Legault says the time is right to gradually lift restrictions. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged caution as provincial governments balance the needs of the economy and public health.
""We still need to be extremely careful, not just for our seniors but for everyone around us,"" he told reporters.
The planned reopening of Montreal's non-essential stores was delayed to May 18 from May 11 because there were too few hospital beds to cope with a possible surge in new cases, Quebec' premier said.
""The situation is under control in the rest of Quebec,"" Legault told a briefing.
Store owners in the city of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, about 40 km (25 miles) southeast of Montreal, saw a rebound in demand from shoppers, who were directed by staff to handwashing and sanitizing stations.
Julie Gregoire said staff at her furniture store donned plastic visors when greeting about 80 customers, a higher number than usual.
""It's very busy this morning,"" she said by phone.
While high schools and colleges will remain shut, elementary schools will reopen on May 11 for most of the province, and May 19 in Montreal.
Quebec’s English-language school boards, which serve a minority of students in the predominantly French-speaking province, have clashed with Legault's government over concerns that it is too early to go back to class.
Legault told reporters that school boards must comply with government plans, although attendance is optional.
Trudeau appeared uncertain when asked by public broadcaster Radio Canada whether he would allow his children to go back to school if he lived in Quebec.

Both countries pledged to improve ties after the fall of veteran Islamist ruler Omar al-Bashir in an uprising a year ago.
The Sudanese foreign ministry said it had chosen Noureldin Sati, a veteran diplomat, as ambassador in Washington and that U.S. authorities had approved his nomination. 
A State Department representative declined to provide any insight on plans to appoint its own ambassador to Sudan and said it did not have specific information on the timing for that, but called the December decision to exchange ambassadors ""a historic step.""
Both countries had for almost a quarter of century appointed only charge d'affaires, a diplomatic rank under an ambassador, to run their embassies in Washington and Khartoum.
In December, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the two countries would exchange ambassadors. The U.S. ambassador would be nominated by President Donald Trump and needs to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
The U.S. government added Sudan to its list of state sponsors of terrorism in 1993 over allegations that Bashir’s Islamist government was supporting Islamist militant groups, leaving Sudan ineligible for badly needed debt relief and financing from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Last year, a senior State Department official said the United States might remove Sudan from the list but the U.S. Congress needed to ratify such a move.
The State Department representative declined to comment on internal U.S. government deliberations on where the talks are about Sudan being removed from the list but added that the two countries remain engaged in active discussions.
""Compensation for the victims of terrorism remains a priority for the U.S. government. The United States and Sudan continue to engage regarding certain terrorism-related claims,"" the spokesperson said.

The ranking Republicans on seven House committees sent a letter to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, asking for information and accusing China of providing funds to U.S. universities in an effort to spread Communist party propaganda and restrict research into COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus.
Trump, facing a more difficult re-election campaign as the coronavirus has claimed tens of thousands of American lives and ravaged the economy, has been ramping up his criticism of Beijing, as have many of his fellow Republicans in Congress.
Officials said Trump's administration is considering retaliatory measures over the COVID-19 outbreak, which was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Washington and Beijing have traded increasingly bitter recriminations over the origin of the virus and the response to it.
The letter released on Monday was led by Representative Jim Jordan, the top Republican on the House Oversight committee, and also signed by the top Republicans on the Education, Armed Services, Homeland Security, Science, Intelligence and Foreign Affairs committees.
China sends more students to study in the United States than any other country - nearly 370,000 in 2018, one third of the total pool of international students. They are an important source of revenue for U.S. colleges and universities.
U.S. higher education also gets millions of dollars from China every year via gifts and contracts.
China hawks in the U.S. Congress have long questioned whether Chinese students, professors, and researchers in the United States could pose a security threat.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will investigate a report that a company owned by the son of a top official sold overpriced ventilators to the government during the coronavirus crisis, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday.
Mexicanos Contra la Corrupcion y la Impunidad (MCCI), a civil anti-corruption group, said a state arm of Mexico's social security institute (IMSS) bought the devices from Cyber Robotic Solutions, a firm owned by Leon Manuel Bartlett, son of Manuel Bartlett, head of national electricity company CFE.
In the May 1 report, the group said IMSS purchased 20 ventilators last month for 1.55 million pesos each, or nearly double the sum paid by the government for some other ventilators in separate contracts around the same time.
The younger Bartlett denied the allegations in a letter on Twitter, saying the contracting process was transparent, featured reasonable prices and that other ventilators had been sold to the public authorities for more.
CFE chief Bartlett was last year himself the subject of an ethics probe when critics alleged he had failed to make public the full extent of his wealth in official declarations, or ties to companies that represented a potential conflict of interest.
The government-led probe into Bartlett, a close ally of the president, exonerated him of any wrongdoing. 
Lopez Obrador has put rooting out corruption at the heart of his administration. Critics accuse him of failing to apply the same standards to his allies as he does to adversaries.
When asked at a regular news conference about the case involving Bartlett's son, he initially mocked MCCI, referring to the group as ""Mexicans in favor of corruption"" rather than ""against corruption"" as its name in Spanish denotes.
He then reiterated his commitment to eradicating corruption before launching an attack against media that criticize him.
""In this case, the Public Administration Ministry has to do its job, do its investigation and if it shows that this person is responsible, he will have to be sanctioned just like the official who gave this contract,"" Lopez Obrador said.

931,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 02:41PM ET</span>",Postal workers raise alarm over hasty Polish mail vote,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's postal workers are growing increasingly concerned as the country prepares for its first presidential election by mail on Sunday, arguing they are not equipped to carry out the vote safely and effectively amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Unresolved issues include how to deliver ballots to damaged or missing postal boxes, ensuring ballots go to the right people and protecting oneself when interacting with voters under quarantine, postal workers and their union leaders said.
With just days to go, the ruling nationalists are trying to persuade sceptics in parliament to clear legislation that would allow postal voting, something that's normally only allowed in rare circumstances, such as when a voter cannot make it to a polling booth.
While a parliamentary vote on the issue is set for Wednesday, one of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party's main allies, Accord, has threatened to block the legislation, meaning the postal vote might be scrapped altogether.
One 32-year-old postal worker in central Warsaw said he was worried last-minute planning could lead to problems on election day and that postal workers could be held liable for anything that goes wrong, like undelivered or damaged ballots.
""There's almost no communication,” he told Reuters, asking not to be identified as postal workers were told last month not to speak to the press. 
""I am of course worried that I could infect someone,"" he said.
Draft legislation being debated by parliament says details of how ballots should be delivered and picked up would be outlined by appropriate cabinet ministers. 
Election monitors, opposition candidates and EU officials have criticized the plans, saying the decision to change the electoral code allowing for the mail vote was rushed and could prevent the vote from being free and fair.
Union leaders added that many postal workers were concerned they hadn't been informed how long the virus could survive on a ballot and whether that posed a risk to themselves, voters, or officials who count votes.
""This unpredictable chaos means people are worried, they are scared and they don't know what this election will look like,"" Dorota Gardias, the head of the Trade Unions' Forum, an umbrella organisation for several labour unions in Poland, told Reuters. 
Poland has confirmed 14,006 cases of coronavirus and 698 deaths. 
A spokeswoman for Poczta Polska, the state-owned postal service, denied that postal workers had not been sufficiently informed about the preparations for the elections.
She added that postal workers would be offered extra pay to work during the elections.
For many postal workers, whose starting salary is usually the minimum wage of 2,600 zlotys ($620) a month before tax, the additional money could convince them to set aside any concerns. 
The amount has not yet been announced, but some postal workers said they expected it could be the equivalent of a month's salary. 
""If I didn't get additional money, then I would probably go on sick leave,"" the postal worker from Warsaw told Reuters, saying he would likely put the extra cash in savings.
With these incentives in mind, Poczta Polska is still hoping to be ready for the May 10 vote, even though PiS has admitted it might need to be delayed by a week or two. 
""This is the safest solution, the one that most adequately protects the life and health of Poles,"" the head of Poczta Polska, Tomasz Zdzikot, told right-wing magazine Sieci in a recent article.

932,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>","Russia's ventilators: plentiful, but often old and sometimes broken","By Maria Tsvetkova, Polina Nikolskaya and Gleb Stolyarov
MOSCOW (Reuters) - As new cases of the coronavirus accelerate in Russia, by one measure it is relatively well placed to cope with the pandemic.
Russia has around 27 ventilators per 100,000 citizens, according to the government, considerably more than the 18.8 per 100,000 in the United States, according to the John Hopkins University.
But those numbers do not paint the whole picture.
Many ventilators in central regional or district hospitals, regarded as the core of the health system outside big cities, were made in the 1990s, data provided to Reuters by Headway Group, an analytics firm that tracks government tenders, show.
Such hospitals are often only equipped with five or six ventilators on average, it said. That estimate was based on data the company had compiled up to the beginning of 2019.
Older models lack the functionality of newer ones, including screens that give a full picture of a patient's breathing process, two Russian doctors said.
One of them, an emergency room doctor who regularly operates ventilators, complained that these machines cannot ventilate a patient's lungs for as long as new ones.
There were 145,268 confirmed coronavirus cases reported in Russia by Monday morning, with a record daily number confirmed on Sunday and a similar increase on Monday.
The overall death toll was 1,356, a significantly lower percentage than in many other countries. [nR4N2BV00P]
    More than half of all deaths and cases have been in Moscow, where the best medical resources are concentrated.
""In Moscow many (hospitals) may follow the best Western standards and in some regions little has changed since the 1990s or the late Soviet times,"" Alexander Baunov, senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center think-tank, wrote on Twitter on May 3.
But as the spread of the virus through the rest of the world's biggest country by territory accelerates, the quality and number of ventilators will be increasingly important to keep the mortality rate down, several government officials say.
Four of eight regional governors who took part in a video conference with President Vladimir Putin on April 17 told him they did not have enough artificial lung ventilators. 
    Putin was personally involved, on a daily and sometimes hourly basis, with trying to solve ventilator shortages in the regions, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state TV in April. 
    ""Factories are working three shifts,"" said Peskov. ""But they're not coping with the number of orders.""
    Putin told the same meeting of regional governors that he was aware of difficulties sourcing equipment, including ventilators, and said the federal government was helping them with funds worth at least 86 billion roubles ($1.15 billion).
    At least 17.7 billion roubles of that money had been earmarked for ventilators and other purchases, he said. 
    Eleven days later, Putin said Russia had successfully ramped up ventilator production. Only 60-70 a month were being made at the start of the year, Putin said, but that figure was over 800 in April and would be 2,500 in May.
Shortages persisted, however, he added.
On March 30, Putin said the quality as well as the quantity of ventilators was vital, and ordered a nationwide inventory which is underway.
Tatyana Revva, a doctor in the southern Volgograd region, released a video online in late March in which she complained about the ventilator situation in the hospital where she worked. 
    ""We are not ready, we don't have anything,"" said Revva. ""We have two ventilators and a third one which is broken, and the two that work are currently being used by sick patients.""
Oleg Kumeiko, head doctor at her hospital, told reporters and police that Revva's accusations were ""fake news"" and that there were no shortages of anything.
Anastasia Vasilyeva, head of Russia's Doctor's Alliance trade union, which is in touch with Revva, said the broken ventilator she referred to was repaired in April after she spoke out.
FOREIGN PURCHASES MADE
    With demand high, stocks of Russian-made ventilators are running low, three commercial sources and a hospital told Reuters. They are the primary source of new supply despite being regarded by some Russian medical professionals as inferior to foreign ones. 
    Those made abroad, meanwhile, are scarce as governments rush to snap up large quantities, and manufacturers say they cannot immediately supply everyone. [nL8N2BB93Q]
    At least one organisation in Russia did manage to purchase ventilators from overseas in recent weeks, however, though it did not need them in the end.
    Medtekhnika, a state-run unit that supplies medical equipment for Kremlin clinics that treat the country's political elite including Putin, bought three foreign artificial lung ventilators in March that can be used to help coronavirus patients, documents seen by Reuters show.
Sergei Savostyanov, a Communist lawmaker in the Moscow city parliament who sits on its healthcare commission, said the Kremlin unit's ventilator purchases were part of an entrenched two-tier health system which favoured the elite.
    ""I consider it wrong for officials and other lawmakers to be treated in specialised clinics separate from the health system which they created with their own decisions for the general population,"" Savostyanov told Reuters.
    The Kremlin did not reply to a request for comment.
    The March 19 purchase of one German and two U.S. ventilators was confirmed by the unit head, who said he wanted the equipment just in case there was demand related to the coronavirus in the clinics it supplies.
    They included a German Lowenstein Medical VENTIlogic LS for 1.2 million roubles ($15,700), and two U.S.-made models, a  Medtronic  (NYSE:MDT) Puritan Bennett and an NPB-560, costing 950,000 roubles ($12,400) each, the government's database for state purchases shows.
    The purchase does not breach international sanctions against Russia because they do not cover medical equipment.
Nadezhda Borodina, a representative for Lowenstein Medical, based in Germany's Rheinland Pfalz, said sales were handled by an exclusive distributor called Terapevt. Haidar Gufranov, the head of Terapevt, said his firm did not sell the ventilator to Medtekhnika.
Reuters was unable to independently establish the specifics of the deal.
Olga Kalinina, a representative for Medtronic, which is based in Minnesota, declined to discuss the U.S. machines purchase, saying the company's policy was not to comment on deliveries and orders. She did not name a possible distributor.
    Oleg Nesterov, Medtekhnika's head, told Reuters that the three ventilators were stored in his office. He said he bought them from a distributor rather than from the manufacturers directly but could not recall its name.
   ""We bought these when it (coronavirus) all started for our institutions, but unfortunately they didn't need them,"" he said.
Given that it turned out that the ventilators were not wanted by the Kremlin clinics, he said they would be sold at a profit and that there was ""considerable demand"". 

    ""We held them back for ourselves, for our institutions in the event of force majeure circumstances. If they'd been needed urgently we would have given priority to our own (Kremlin) clinics.""

SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - Three Indian soldiers were killed in a gunbattle with militants in the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir on Monday, a day after a similar incident in which five were killed. 
Juniad Khan, a senior paramilitary force officer, told Reuters that militants attacked the men from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) in North Kashmir. 
“Three CRPF men were killed. Two died on the spot and one on way to hospital, and another is critically injured,” he said.
On Sunday, five Indian soldiers, including a high-ranking army officer, were killed in a forest area of North Kashmir during an operation against a group of militants, two of whom were later killed. 
Muslim-majority Kashmir has for decades been a hotbed of hostility between nuclear arch-rivals India and Pakistan, each of whom claim the territory in full but rule in part. 
India accuses Pakistan of funding the militant groups that fiercely resist its rule, a claim Islamabad denies. 
Over the last month, New Delhi has launched a major offensive against the militants, killing 22 of them since the region was locked down to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.
According to official data, 20 Indian soldiers have been killed during the same period, the country's biggest loss since a militant suicide attack killed 40 paramilitary police in February 2019. 
Before the lockdown, local people, who predominently support the separatist movement in Kashmir, would often attack troops as they formed cordons during operations against militant groups. 
India issued new operating procedures to officials in Kashmir last month, including banning public funerals of militants which often attract thousands of mourners.
The bodies of the militants killed over the last two days have not been handed back to their families, a police official said. A second official said that Indian police have also traced over 2,000 social media accounts that he said indulged in unlawful activities.
Two freelance journalists – Gouhar Geelani and Masrat Zehra - were detained last month under anti-terrorism laws over social media posts, to the alarm of international rights groups.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba's President Miguel Diaz-Canel on Monday called a gun assault last week on its embassy in Washington a ""terrorist attack"", while U.S. court papers said the suspected gunman was a psychotic Cuban emigre who heard voices.
There were no injuries in the attack last Thursday, but gunshots riddled the facade and some penetrated the building. Police arrested Alexander Alazo, 42, at around 2 a.m. after he fired an AK-47-style semi-automatic rifle 32 times at the embassy, according a memorandum filed on Sunday in support of pretrial detention. 
Alazo told investigators he would have shot the ambassador if he had come out because he was ""the enemy"". Voices in his head had told him to protect his family from what he believed were Cuban organized crime groups affiliated with the Cuban government that he claimed were following them and wanted to harm them.
He admitted he had been prescribed antipsychotic medication in March but did not fully comply with the prescription, a fact U.S. state prosecutors argued ""strongly weighs against his release"" before trial.
""I must denounce the terrorist attack ... and demand from the United States government a thorough and swift investigation, harsh sanctions and security measures and guarantees for our diplomatic missions,"" Diaz-Canel told a virtual summit of the non-aligned movement early on Monday.
Last week, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez said a dozen diplomats and workers had been in the embassy at the time of the attack, which was recorded on surveillance video.
Rodriguez said hostility toward Cuba by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump fomented violence. The U.S. State Department did not immediately reply to request for comment.
Trump has unraveled a U.S.-Cuban detente carried out by his predecessor Barack Obama.
Before attacking the embassy, Alazo first tried unsuccessfully to set fire in the rain to a gasoline-soaked Cuban flag, on which were scribbled the words ""Stop Lying to People. Respect. Trump 2020. USA, Land and Family"", according to court papers.
Alazo said he had emigrated first to Mexico in 2003 and then to Texas in 2007 claiming political asylum. In 2014 he returned to Cuba to preach at a church, he said, adding he left after being threatened by Cuban organized crime groups.
Convinced he was being followed, he traveled in 2018 to Germany and other countries to avoid being caught, according to the investigators' interview with his wife, a traveling nurse.

She told authorities the family would live in hotels because he was too paranoid to live at their home. It was only in March 2020 that he had received a diagnosis of a delusional disorder.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's health ministry said on Monday that the number of confirmed coronavirus cases had exceeded 20,000. 
The world's top copper producer has 20,643 confirmed cases, 980 more than the previous day, and 10 new deaths, taking the total number of fatalities to 270, said Paula Daza, the health ministry subsecretary. 
Chile, one of South America's most developed countries, has won praise for its handling of the coronavirus outbreak, conducting more than 200,000 tests, shutting down schools and businesses soon after the first case was confirmed at the start of March and operating rolling quarantines.
Its straight-talking health minister Jaime Manalich, a kidney specialist who once ran one of Chile's top hospitals, has clashed with local mayors and ministers about the timing of quarantines and closures. 
He also courted controversy by pressing ahead with the introduction of some of the world's first “release certificates” for recovered patients, despite World Health Organisation guidance that there was no evidence to suggest COVID sufferers develop lasting immunity. 
On Thursday he qualified the plan, saying the certificates would not speak to immunity.
Chile's daily numbers of confirmed cases leapt into four figures last week after officials started testing people without symptoms who had been in contact with sufferers in high-risk areas like nursing homes and prisons. 
Manalich said on Thursday that the number of new cases was less important than the fact that the number of hospitalizations and deaths had plateaued. 
He insisted however that did not mean that he or his colleagues would be “dropping our guard”. 
“To be honest, cases of this infection are now moving to this country’s more vulnerable areas where social distancing, people staying at home, complying with quarantines, access to health, all becomes more difficult,” he said. 
Public health experts have warned that with the arrival of the winter flu season in the Southern Hemisphere, which routinely puts public hospitals under pressure, some of Latin America's highest pollution rates in cities in Chile's south could exacerbate COVID-19 death rates.
Economists widely predict a sharp contraction of Chile´s gross domestic product in 2020 and double-digit unemployment by year´s end, and the government has announced a rescue package worth 5% of GDP.

However the mines minister for the world's top copper producer said the country's production of the red metal was likely to dip by just 1% by year's end.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria began easing restrictions on Monday in its capital Abuja and in largest city Lagos, heralding the reopening of Africa's biggest economy after more than four weeks of lockdowns imposed to contain the new coronavirus.
The government has said a 24-hour, stay-at-home order in place since March 30 in Abuja and the states of Lagos and Ogun - with exceptions only for food shopping and health-related trips - will be lifted gradually over a six-week period.
These densely populated regions will now come into line with the rest of the country in which slightly looser restrictions introduced last week by President Muhammadu Buhari include an overnight curfew, mandatory face masks in public and a ban on non-essential interstate travel.
On Monday, the usually frenetic streets of the coastal megacity Lagos, largely empty during the lockdown, were busy again with cars, buses and motorised tricycle taxis. 
Despite rules banning groups of more than 20 people and stipulating that individuals remain two metres (6.6 feet) apart, large groups of people often gathered by the road waiting for public transport. Social distancing rules were largely ignored. 
Distinctive yellow minivans used as buses were full, with some passengers struggling to find space to enter vehicles.
However, in a crucial difference to pre-lockdown life, most people on the streets of Lagos wore face masks. 
In the capital Abuja, in central Nigeria, many businesses were still closed. 
""I don't have money in my pocket. I was coming to work, telling my wife to pray for me to work and bring something so that we could eat, but... there's no hope of working today,"" said father-of-three Easy Darlington, who could not reopen his printing business in a shopping mall that remains shut. 
Businesses have been allowed to reopen provided they have decontaminated their offices, can enable social distancing and offer hand sanitizer and hand washing. 
However, schools and places of worship remain closed, restaurants can operate only on a takeaway basis, and all cultural events have been cancelled. 
Nigeria has confirmed 2,558 infections of the new coronavirus and 87 deaths since recording its first case at the end of February, a much lower toll than those seen in COVID-19 hotspots in Europe and the United States. 
But the number of confirmed cases has surged in recent days, roughly doubling from 1,273 on April 27. 
Experts have not reached a consensus on why Nigeria's case tally has been so relatively low, though many point to a low testing rate. The centre for disease control said only 17,566 samples have been tested in a country of 200 million people. 
The decision to begin a phased lifting of the lockdown despite the recent sharp rise in cases was criticised by some medical experts including the Nigerian Medical Association.
The NMA president, Francis Faduyile, said on Friday the move was ""very premature"" and risked driving up the rate of infections, which he called a ""frightening scenario"". 
AFRICAN 'REALITIES'
Nigeria and other African governments have sought to balance curbs to avert an outbreak that could overwhelm hospitals with efforts to mitigate the impact on workers in a continent where 85% are employed in the precarious informal sector. 
""While the initial reaction (in Nigeria) was a wholesale transfer of containment measures designed in and for substantially richer economies, the government is now adapting its approach to domestic realities,"" said Malte Liewerscheidt, vice president of Teneo Intelligence. 
Rwanda, Namibia and Zimbabwe also began loosening their lockdowns on Monday. 
In Rwanda, which enforced a strict nationwide clampdown, businesses have reopened and travel between provinces is permitted again. Similarly, shops were allowed to reopen and curbs lifted on domestic travel in Namibia, where wearing face masks in public is now mandatory. 
In Zimbabwe's capital Harare, queues formed outside money transfer agencies as residents collected remittances. Money sent from overseas is an important source of income in the southern African country, which is in the grip of its worst economic crisis in a decade.
But informal markets, which provide income to more than 80% of Zimbabweans, are still not allowed to operate except for the biggest fresh vegetable market in Harare.
The decision to ease restrictions follows similar steps taken in other nations in the region. South Africa on Friday relaxed one of the world's strictest COVID-19 lockdowns and Ghana in West Africa last month lifted a three-week lockdown in its two main cities. 
But some African countries have gone against the trend. Kenya, which imposed a daily 7 p.m.-5 a.m. nationwide curfew on March 25, is yet to relax the overnight lockdown.
On Monday, residents of Mathare, a slum in the capital city Nairobi, said police killed a 36-year-old man who was found outside during the curfew. They marched with the body to a Nairobi police station to protest over the killing.
A police spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

LONDON (Reuters) - Protesters blocked construction sites along the route of a planned high-speed rail link on Monday, aiming to stop swathes of British woodlands being felled for a project that has also faced criticism over spiralling costs.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed the scheme, known as HS2, in February after protracted wrangling within his Conservative party over whether to proceed with the plan to improve connections between London and northern England.
""This tree is threatened by HS2 as are thousands up and down the country, but we can stop this,"" said Larch Maxey, one of several protesters who scaled a tree near an HS2 site outside London's Euston station, in a video posted on social media.
Activists blocked at least 20 vehicle entrances to various sprawling HS2 sites in the counties of Warwickshire, Buckinghamshire and in the Colne Valley west of London, as well as at Euston, organisers said.
The protesters said they were observing social distancing measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and were wearing protective masks.
Although protesters have been occupying clearings and treehouses for years, organisers said they had staged the action in London to draw national attention to the prospect that 108 woodlands will be damaged or destroyed.
HS2 said the project would create thousands of jobs and contracts for small British businesses, and described the protests as dangerous, costly and unacceptable.
""This is an important investment in the UK's future as we recover from the pandemic,"" said an HS2 spokesperson. ""We'd urge all green groups to help us in getting people out of their cars, off planes and onto low-carbon, high speed rail.""
A review was carried out last year into whether HS2 should go ahead, after its predicted cost rose to a reported 106 billion pounds ($130 billion), almost double the bill five years ago.
HS2 and its critics dispute a wide range of issues, from the potential economic impacts to whether it can help achieve Britain's target to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050.
Supporters say HS2 would give Britain the kind of fast rail services enjoyed by some European countries and help spread economic opportunities outside the capital. 
James Brown, a Paralympic gold medallist and environmental activist, described HS2 as a ""colossal white elephant.""

""It must be stopped and we just divert its funds to supporting the NHS,"" Brown said, referring to the National Health Service.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Businesses reopening in Bangkok on Monday after weeks of near lockdown were taking intense precautions to prevent new outbreaks of the coronavirus.
One restaurant placed home-made plastic barriers between tables to ensure customers maintained distance. 
A hair salon could be mistaken for a medical ward, with stylists wearing goggles and plastic face shields and scrubs-style protective gowns.
For the foreseeable future, such scenes will be normal in the city where business is just getting going again now that new coronavirus cases have sharply reduced.
At the Hanji restaurant, which serves Taiwanese-style hot pot dishes, plastic screens had been set up between tables in line with government orders to keep customers two metres apart.
""It's kind of weird walking in and there's plastic everywhere,"" said Soranan, 30, an office worker.
But he understood the importance of safety.
""So, it might be weird in the beginning but take some time, I think people will get used to it and it will feel normal one day,"" he said. 
The restaurant's Thai co-owner, Ittinun Trairatanobhas, said he and the staff built the barriers from plastic sheets and tubing. 
""We follow all the rules that the government handed out and the Bangkok city gave out ... Whether it could prevent COVID-19, we cannot really tell,"" Ittinun said.
Elsewhere in Bangkok, a hair stylist at the Zahara Salon worked in protective goggles, a cloth mask and a plastic face shield as well as a gown and plastic hair cap.
""It's so nice being back at work, but now we feel as though we are doctors with what we have to wear,"" said stylist Ponpimon Meantaggi, 34.
Thailand in January was the first country outside China to report a case of the new coronavirus that since swept the globe, infecting 3.5 million and killing 460,000. 

The Southeast Asian country has so far managed to hold its own cases down to 2,987, with a total of 54 deaths, but officials warn that reopening should be done carefully to avoid a new outbreak.

Assange is wanted by U.S. authorities to stand trial for conspiring to hack government computers and espionage. His extradition case began in February for a week before being adjourned until May 18 for another three weeks of arguments.
Last week, Judge Vanessa Baraitser said it would not be possible for it to recommence this month because of strict restrictions on gatherings to curb the spread of COVID-19.
At a hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Monday - which journalists listening to remotely were unable to follow live - it was agreed that September would be the most convenient date for the hearings to resume, although an exact date and an appropriate venue was yet to be decided, a spokesman said.
Assange was not able to attend Monday's hearing via medialink because his lawyers said he was not well enough to appear.
The 48-year-old, an Australian citizen, says he could spend decades in prison if convicted, and calls the case against him political and a threat to free speech. The United States says he put the lives of informants in danger by publishing secret diplomatic cables.
Last week, Assange's partner, lawyer Stella Moris, said his life was at severe risk from COVID-19 in London's Belmarsh Prison where he is currently being held.

Assange was dragged from the Ecuador embassy in London last April after spending seven years there in a bid to avoid being sent to the United States, during which time he had two children with Moris.

It said U.S. Navy surface ships had not operated in the Barents since the mid-1980s, and that Russia's defence ministry had been notified on May 1 ""in an effort to avoid misperceptions, reduce risk, and prevent inadvertent escalation"". 
Russia's Northern Fleet, which includes both nuclear-powered ships and submarines, is based near Murmansk in the waters of the Kola Bay, a fjord which feeds into the Barents Sea.

""It's complicated but we have to move on,"" 48-year-old Caldeira told Reuters while wearing a mask and a plastic face shield to cut the hair of her second customer of the day.
After a six-week lockdown when people were urged to stay indoors, and most non-essential services were shut, a three-phase plan began on Monday to open up different sectors every 15 days, starting with hairdressers, small neighbourhood shops, car dealerships and bookshops.
But businesses must follow strict safety and capacity restrictions. 
At hairdressers, for instance, staff members must wear protective equipment, hand sanitizer must be available and customers are only allowed in with an appointment.
The use of masks is now obligatory in enclosed public spaces like supermarkets and on public transport, with rule-breakers risking fines of up to 350 euros. Remote working is still recommended where possible, and gatherings must be limited to 10 people. 
Due to the tough rules still in place, businesses are gearing up for the challenges ahead. 
'NEED TO WORK TO EAT'
""Economically speaking, it was very difficult,"" said 33-year-old Bruna Pegado, an hairdresser also working at Caldeira's salon. ""Recovery will be slow because with the rules not all customers will come back at the beginning.""
Portugal has so far reported 25,525 cases of the coronavirus and 1,063 deaths, a significantly lower toll compared to other countries, including hard-hit neighbouring Spain. 
If the spread continues to slow, bigger stores, restaurants, museums and coffee shops will reopen on May 18 but at reduced capacity.
Kantigal Maganlal, 69, was also reopened his small drug store on Monday and said he missed his loyal customers the most.
""It is so good (to be back) but there is always a concern about the situation we are going through,"" he said. 
The outbreak is set to leave long-lasting scars on the country's once-bailed out, tourism-dependent economy, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting Portugal's gross domestic product to contract by 8% this year.
Around one in five workers in Portugal has been laid off since the pandemic, with unemployment rocketing to 380,832 people, or 6.4% - and just 10,000 below its peak during the global financial crisis in 2008. 

""Recovery is going to be complicated - either the state helps or I don't know how it will be,"" said shopkeeper Angelina Correia, 58, as she cleaned up her clothing store before opening it to the public. ""We need to work to eat.""

With Darth Vader and Stormtrooper outfits made from rubber mats and old plastic, the youth leaders catch the attention of villagers on the outskirts of Manila, who are then reminded to stay indoors.
""We tell off residents who still go outdoors without the proper quarantine passes needed and also those who do not wear face masks. We make sure the government guidelines are properly followed,"" Muriel Baldago, an elected official dressed in a Stormtrooper costume, told Reuters. 
His get-up is greeeted with smiles and offers villagers a little distraction from outbreak, he added.

ROME/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Italy was among a slew of countries easing lockdown restrictions on Monday to resurrect their economies, but officials cautioned against moving too swiftly as new coronavirus cases passed 3.5 million globally and deaths neared a quarter of a million. 
Italy, among the world's hardest-hit countries, started to relax the longest lockdown in Europe, allowing about 4.5 million people to return to work after nearly two months at home. Construction work can resume and relatives can reunite.
""I woke up at 5.30 a.m. I was so excited,"" said Maria Antonietta Galluzzo, a grandmother taking her three-year-old grandson for a walk in Rome's Villa Borghese park, the first time they had seen each other in eight weeks.
""He has grown by this much,"" she said, holding up three horizontal fingers.
Spain, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Malaysia, Israel, Tunisia and Lebanon were also among countries easing some restrictions, variously reopening factories, construction sites, parks, hairdressers and libraries. In the United States, around half of states partially reopened their economies over the weekend. 
The easing comes as the daily rate of new COVID-19 cases worldwide has been sitting in a 2%-3% range over the past week, down from a peak of around 13% in mid-March.
Global cases have risen to around 3.52 million, according to a Reuters tally based on government data. However, cases may cause only mild symptoms and not everyone with symptoms is tested, while most countries only record hospital deaths. 
""We still have to be sceptical about the numbers we get,"" said Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra Hospital. ""We could easily have a second or a third wave because a lot of places aren't immune.""
PHASED REOPENING 
Countries are only gradually reopening due to such fears and warnings from officials not to lower their guard.
In the United States, even as warm weather led sunseekers to flock to green spaces in Manhattan, an epidemic epicentre, President Donald Trump warned the national death toll - now at almost 68,000 - could rise to 100,000.
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said his country, where the novel coronavirus has killed almost 29,000 people and over a thousand new cases are reported daily, was still in the ""full throes of the pandemic"".
Friends in the country are still barred from meeting up, most shops must stay shut until May 18, and schools, cinemas and theatres remain closed indefinitely.
""It is good to be back, but the world has totally changed,"" said Gianluca Martucci, pulling up the shutters on the small warehouse of a catering business in the backstreets of Rome. 
""The government has been very wise so far, but I worry that we might be starting up a little too soon ... I don't know if the country could survive a second wave.""
Israel, after weeks of strict closures, has also started to relax curbs in a phased manner. Schools for children in grades 1-3, aged six to nine, have reopened, following the opening of some stores in late April. 
MASK, GLOVES, DISTANCE
People around the world are adjusting to a new normal.
A continuous hum of cars, buses and motorbikes pointed to an increase in early morning commuting in Rome, but traffic was noticeably lighter than before the virus struck and those out appeared to be following the guidelines on social distancing.
In Beirut, restaurants began to reopen but were removing chairs and tables in compliance with government rules that they do not fill beyond 30% of their capacity. 
""This is a great step,"" said Ralph Malak, a bar owner. ""It's very good for the staff to start to get motivated again, to come back to work, and for the economy to start moving.""
Hairdressers were allowed to partially reopen, with barbers operating on certain days and women's salons on others.
Iran, which has reported more than 6,000 deaths, is due to reopen mosques in 132 cities on Monday. Worshippers must maintain social distancing, wear masks and gloves and not stay for more than half an hour, the ISNA news agency reported.
WAR OF WORDS ON VIRUS
While stringent measures to curb the outbreak have often been broadly backed by the public, governments are counting the economic price.
Factory activity was ravaged across the world in April, business surveys showed, and the outlook looked bleak as shutdowns froze global production and slashed demand. As a result, the global economy is expected to suffer its steepest contraction on record this year.
""This past week saw the amazing coincidence of the publication of the deepest quarterly economic decline in the Western world in almost 100 years and the conclusion to the strongest monthly equity rally in more than 30 years,"" said Erik Nielsen, chief economist at UniCredit.
Escalating tensions between the United States and China over the origin of the pandemic drove down stock markets and oil prices on Monday as investors feared a new trade war.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday there was ""a significant amount of evidence"" that the virus emerged from a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan. He did not provide evidence or dispute an earlier U.S. intelligence conclusion that the virus was not man-made.

An editorial in China's Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People’s Daily, said he was ""bluffing"" and called on Washington to present its evidence.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany took a further step on the long road back to post-coronavirus normality on Monday, with museums and hairdressers reopening under strict conditions, churches opening their doors for worshippers, and more car factories resuming work.
But more than a month after Germany suspended all but essential social and commercial life to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, politicians in charge of Europe's largest economy are at odds over how far and how fast to move.
There is mounting pressure from business groups and some regional governments who are anxious to move faster on restarting economic life. Chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that reopening too swiftly risks triggering a second wave of infections, but many regions are already going alone.
The reopening of some border crossings with France, which has scrapped quarantine requirements for EU citizens, lent further impetus to calls for accelerated reopening. In the east, Poland has reopened frontiers for some cross-border commuters.
Germany has been more successful than other large European countries in slowing the virus' spread - it estimates that every 100 carriers of the virus now infects only 74 others on average, well below the 100 mark where new restrictions must be imposed.
But Merkel fears that complacency and a race to reopen between different regions could undo the successes achieved so far.
A study by the University of Bonn looking at an outbreak in the Rhineland town of Heinsberg, Germany's largest cluster of the disease, estimated that some 1.8 million Germans may already have had the disease - 10 times the official count, in an indication of how rapidly it could spread if left unchecked.
In North Rhine-Westphalia, the Netherlands-sized western state that is Germany's most populous, family minister Joachim Stamp said he would reopen kindergartens in the state unilaterally if no nationwide ruling comes in a meeting planned with Merkel for Wednesday.
In eastern Germany, where there have been fewer infections, the state of Saxony-Anhalt went further, becoming the first state to revoke a rule prohibiting meetings of more than two people: gatherings of up to five are now permitted.
The central state of Lower Saxony also announced plans to reopen restaurants from next Monday, pre-empting the nationwide decision due to be taken on Wednesday.
Pressure from industry groups was particularly strong, with the travel sector saying restrictions were set to cost it over 10 billion euros ($10.93 billion) up to mid-June and retailers saying continuing shop closures are costing them 1.15 billion euros a day.
The latest steps towards reopening come with restrictions: even if restaurants stay closed, social distancing requirements will change practices even where daily life resumes.

So barbers will be able to cut hair, but procedures involving close facial contact, such as beard or moustache trimming, are out.

The country of 11.5 million people, among the worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, has until now only permitted food shops and pharmacies to operate throughout the crisis, and more recently home-improvement and garden centres.
On Monday, 150,000-300,000 people were expected to resume work in businesses that have no contact with consumers, such as manufacturers, although remote working is still encouraged. 
All adults and older children taking public transport were obliged to wear a mask from Monday, on pain of a 250-euro($273.30) fine. Shops selling fabric and sewing supplies were also allowed to open to allow the public to make their own masks. Some supermarkets also began selling surgical masks.
The public may also now expand their range of leisure activities beyond walking, jogging and cycling to include sports where physical distancing is possible - such as tennis, golf or kayaking.
The government has outlined a phased removal of restrictions. Next week, all shops will be allowed to open and the week afterwards schools will start to receive some pupils.
Belgium has confirmed 50,267 COVID-19 cases and 7,924 deaths from the highly contagious respiratory disease. But the rate of increase of new cases, hospital admissions and deaths has fallen steadily since peaks in early April.

951,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 07:45AM ET</span>",German study suggests infections are 10 times the number of confirmed cases,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - More than 10 times as many people in Germany have likely been infected with the coronavirus than the number of confirmed cases, researchers from the University of Bonn have concluded from a field trial in one of the worst hit towns.
The preliminary study results, which have yet to be peer reviewed for publication in a scientific journal, serve as a reminder of the dangers of infection by unidentified carriers of the virus, some of whom show no symptoms, the researchers said.
The readings come as Germany took further steps on Monday to ease restrictions, with museums, hairdressers, churches and more car factories reopening under strict conditions.
About 1.8 million people living in Germany must have been infected, more than 10 times the number of about 160,000 confirmed cases so far, the team led by medical researchers Hendrik Streeck and Gunther Hartmann concluded.
""The results can help to further improve the models to calculate how the virus spreads. So far the underlying data has been relatively weak,"" Hartmann said in a statement. 
The team analysed blood and nasal swabs from a random sample of 919 people living in a town in the municipality of Heinsberg on the Dutch border, which had among the highest death tolls in Germany.
To arrive at their estimate, the researchers put the town's number of known deaths from COVID-19 relative to the larger estimate of local people with a prior infection - as indicated by antibody blood test readings - and applied the rate of 0.37% to country-wide deaths.
They also found that about one in five of those infected showed no symptoms.

953,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 07:17AM ET</span>",Special Report: How Turkey’s courts turned on Erdogan's foes,"By Reuters Staff
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - It took 16 judges to convict Kurdish politicians Gultan Kisanak and Sebahat Tuncel of belonging to a terrorist organization last year.
Their trial in Diyarbakir, the biggest city in Turkey's largely Kurdish southeast, was concluded in just a dozen sessions, but during that time the three-judge panel was in constant flux. The women, who maintain their innocence, were brought to court only once - to hear the ""guilty"" verdict.
Their lawyer, Cihan Aydin, said mounting a proper defence was all but impossible because he never knew who was going to be sitting in judgment. The judges, several of them young and inexperienced, were switched without explanation.
""The chief judge was changed four times as well,"" said Aydin, a human rights lawyer and chair of the local bar association. ""At every hearing there was a new group of judges, and every time we had to start the defence from the beginning.""
The tumult turned the proceedings on their head. ""It was impossible for the judges to read the thousands of pages in the case file, so each time we had to summarise and explain what was in the indictment,"" Aydin said. ""It became our job to teach the judges.""
The court declined to comment about the case.
Terrorist charges like the ones used to convict the two women have become commonplace in Turkey, especially since a failed attempt by parts of the military to overthrow President Tayyip Erdogan in 2016. Mass arrests followed.
Also increasingly common is the practice of switching judges during a trial, more than a dozen lawyers and other legal sources told Reuters. Turkish officials say such changes are merely routine, for health or administrative reasons. Lawyers interviewed by Reuters say they are convinced it's a way for the government to exert control over the courts.
""The constant reshuffling of judges is a simple but very useful mechanism. For every time the government gets involved like this in the judiciary, there are hundreds more cases where the judges learn their lesson"" not to act against perceived government interests, said Gareth Jenkins, a political analyst based in Istanbul.
Neither Erdogan's office nor the justice ministry responded to detailed questions for this article by the time of publication. Mehmet Yilmaz, deputy chairman of the Council of Judges and Prosecutors, the state-body that appoints law officials, said Turkey's legal system is ""not behind any country in the world.""
The judiciary has been used as an instrument to advance political agendas in Turkey for decades. Under Erdogan, his opponents say, it has been deployed as a political cudgel and hollowed out to an unprecedented degree.
Under his purge, thousands of judges and prosecutors have been sacked, by the government's own count. They have been replaced by inexperienced newcomers, ill-equipped to handle the dramatic spike in workload from coup-related prosecutions. At least 45% of Turkey's roughly 21,000 judges and prosecutors now have three years of experience or less, Reuters calculated from Ministry of Justice data.
""We aren't claiming that the judiciary was independent from governments before,"" said Zeynel Emre, a lawmaker from the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP). ""However, a period like this where the government wields the judiciary like a sword on politics and especially the opposition is unprecedented.""
At the time of their arrest in late 2016, Kisanak and Tuncel were prominent figures in the Kurdish minority's decades-long campaign for social, economic and political equality. Kisanak, 58, a former journalist, had recently been elected Diyarbakir's mayor. Tuncel, 44, was a lawmaker in parliament, representing an Istanbul constituency. They were jailed for 14 and 15 years, respectively, for spreading terrorist propaganda and belonging to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is banned in Turkey and branded a terrorist organization by the U.S. and EU. They denied the charges.
Istanbul Bar Association chairman Mehmet Durakoglu said that by using the judiciary as a tool against its opponents, Erdogan's government ""has achieved what it couldn't do by political means"" at the ballot box. The Turkish government counters that its legal system is as advanced as any Western country and that threats against its national security require strict anti-terrorism laws.
Yilmaz, from the state Council of Judges and Prosecutors, acknowledged ""we have been experiencing problems like an increase in work. Our workload is considerably above the global average.""
CHALLENGES
Erdogan has towered over Turkish politics for nearly two decades, first as prime minister, from 2003 to 2014, and since then as president.
There have been challenges to his rule. In 2013, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest policies they deemed authoritarian. The trigger was a government plan to build on a small park in downtown Istanbul. Two years later, peace talks broke down between the government and the militant PKK, which for decades had been waging a violent separatist campaign. In July 2016 came the coup attempt.
On each occasion, the authorities responded with a crackdown.
The pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), the second-biggest opposition party in Turkey's parliament, says thousands of its members and supporters have been detained or jailed since the collapse of peace talks between Turkish authorities and the PKK. Among them is the party's former co-leader, Selahattin Demirtas, who has been held since 2016 on terrorism charges that he denies.
Lawyers defending HDP supporters have also faced prosecution. In 2017, Aydin, the chairman of the Diyarbakir lawyers' bar, was fined for disrupting court proceedings. The complaint stemmed from 2012, when Aydin and other defence lawyers walked out of a mass trial of Kurdish activists accused of belonging to the PKK. Aydin and his colleagues were protesting the court's decision to dismiss their clients from the chamber. The case against Aydin was only brought up five years later.
The practice of keeping watch over lawyers and activists ""is also part of the same trend, the same mentality, keeping track of everyone and making sure there is a file ready against everyone, just in case,"" said Aydin. ""If you start talking too much, if you criticise the government too much, if you take on high profile cases, or in my case, if you become a famous lawyer.""
Prosecutions have extended to academics. Around four dozen academics were convicted of spreading terrorist propaganda for signing a petition in 2016 that called for an end to the conflict with Kurdish militants and criticised the Turkish military's campaign in the Kurdish southeast. They were sentenced to up to three years in jail.
Turkey's Constitutional Court, which oversees laws, overturned the verdicts last year, ruling the prosecutions violated academics' right to freedom of expression. A few days later, responding to criticism of its decision by some politicians and media, the court issued a statement saying the ruling ""does not mean that the Constitutional Court shares the same opinions or supports these opinions.""
Yonca Demir, an academic at Istanbul Bilgi University was among the more than 2,000 signatories to the petition that sparked the mass arrest. She called her trial a sham.
""Whatever you say in court has no impact whatsoever on the judges. From the indictment to the rulings, everything was a copy-paste,"" Demir said. ""Yes, everyone has political views, but they should stick to the law. Instead, they show their ideologies in court.""
POST COUP
Erdogan blamed U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen for orchestrating the failed 2016 coup and set about purging his supporters from public office. Gulen denies any involvement.
Nearly four years later, more than 91,000 people have been jailed and over 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs over alleged links to Gulen. Charges include using the services of a bank founded by Gulen's followers and communicating through an encrypted messaging app that Ankara says was used by Gulen's network.
The purge has hollowed out Turkey's justice system even as the caseload has exploded. By last November, 3,926 judges and prosecutors had been sacked from their posts, Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul told parliament. More than 500 are in jail. The expulsions have resulted in a shortage of experienced judges and prosecutors, the president of Turkey's Supreme Court of Appeals, Ismail Rustu Cirit, told Reuters.
The purges have added to the workload of Turkey's judicial system. More than half a million people have been investigated since the coup attempt. As of late 2019, around 30,000 were still awaiting trial as the courts try to process the vast number of coup-related cases. Some suspects have been jailed for months without an indictment or a trial date.
Speaking last year at a ceremony to honour the police, Erdogan said that authorities had still not fully rooted out Gulen's followers and Turkey could not and would not let up in its crackdown. Erdogan's lawyer, Huseyin Aydin, told Reuters the coup trials were ""the fairest proceedings in modern Turkish history.""
The laws were applied to the letter, said Aydin, who isn't related to the human-rights attorney. ""When we look at the general Turkish judicial traditions, these are cases that have most accurately obeyed the principles of law,"" Aydin said. ""Our judiciary is passing the test with flying colours.""
Not all Turkey's lawyers agree. In August, 51 of the country's 81 bar associations, including those of its three largest cities of Ankara, Istanbul and Izmir, boycotted a judges' ceremony at Erdogan's presidential palace. The choice of venue, they said, signalled a lack of separation of powers and violated their code of ethics. The Ankara bar association said Turkey's judicial system had descended into chaos with lawyers jailed, the defence muzzled and confidence in judges and prosecutors destroyed.
New waves of arrests continue, most recently over online criticism of the government's response to the global coronavirus outbreak. The Interior Ministry said last week that 402 people had been detained for ""baseless and provocative posts"" about the pandemic. 
The Young Ones
Acknowledging his ministry's struggles with personnel, Justice Minister Gul told parliament last year that Turkey was aiming to increase the number of judges and prosecutors.
Figures from Turkey's Board of Judges and Prosecutors show at least 9,323 new judges and prosecutors have been recruited since the coup attempt. That means that at least 45% of Turkey's roughly 21,000 judges and prosecutors have three years of experience or less.
Hakki Koylu, chairman of the Justice Commission in Turkey's parliament and a lawmaker for Erdogan's AK Party, acknowledged to Reuters that some judges and prosecutors ""have been appointed without adequate training.""
""Unfortunately, it all happens quite haphazardly,"" Koylu said. ""We see some of the rulings they make. Now we can only hope that the upper courts correct these rulings"" upon appeal.
But the Supreme Court of Appeals, the highest appeals court, has been hollowed out too.
Cirit, the court's president, told Reuters the appointment of judges with less than five years experience to the Supreme Court of Appeals ""poses risks not only for the reasonable duration of proceedings, but also for the right to a fair trial.""
New judges often lack experience, a dozen lawyers and current and former judges said.
""I became a judge in a criminal court at the age of 48,"" said Koksal Sengun, who retired in 2013. Now, after the widespread dismissals and new appointments, Sengun said, the average age of judges in some provinces has fallen to 25. He didn't say what data his observation about the average age was based on.
""In my opinion, the minimum age for criminal court should be 40. Maybe even higher,"" Sengun said. ""You have to climb the stairs one by one. In the current system, they are appointed so early."" That lack of training leaves newcomers with too little of the emotional and mental toughness needed in the job, he argued. ""These judges have three or five years experience, sitting at the top of a court that hands down the heaviest sentences. These kids come under such pressure, and get crushed. You can't expect much from such a young judge.""
The impact of such inexperience goes beyond criminal cases. Yesim, a commercial lawyer practicing in Istanbul, described chaotic proceedings in one case. She spoke on condition that her full name not be used.
The case, she said, was ""very simple,"" a dispute over a small debt involving two companies. The judge had no trouble making the ruling. Then, to Yesim's surprise, he sought a favor. ""The judge, who seemed younger than 25, asked me, 'Ms. Lawyer, can you help me with writing the verdict? I am not sure about the style.' I couldn't help but laugh, but we wrote the ruling together,"" she said.
Turkey shows no sign of changing course. After the attempted coup, the country cancelled a European Union training program for Turkish judicial officials and opted to train its judges and prosecutors itself. The European Commission wrote in its annual 2019 report that large scale recruitments of new judges and prosecutors are ""concerning."" Turkey countered that the EU's criticisms were unfair and disproportionate.

Lawyer Veysel Ok has defended several journalists against accusations they are part of Gulen's network. He was awarded last year's international Thomas Dehler Medal, named for the German lawyer who defended Jewish citizens against Nazi persecution, in recognition of his work in defence of freedom of speech and the rule of law. Ok said young judges are being promoted because of their political connections, with little life experience, let alone professional experience.
""This is, by itself, an injustice,"" Ok said. ""In the past, we used to research the judges when they were appointed to a case we were representing, and we would adjust our defence according to past rulings they'd handed down and their political views."" Times have changed, he joked darkly. ""Now we don't have to, because we know they are all pro-government.""

Abe will consider lifting the state of emergency without waiting for its May 31 expiration if expert advisors decide that is possible based on detailed analysis of regional infection trends, he said at a meeting of the government's coronavirus task force.
He said his advisors said that Japan had not seen the explosive surge in infections seen in some countries overseas, but the number of new infection cases had not fallen enough and there were regions where the medical system was facing strains.
""Based on that view, I will extend the state of emergency that was announced on April 7 until May 31,"" Abe said, adding that it would remain nationwide.
For the 13 prefectures including Tokyo and Osaka that have been hardest hit, a target of reducing person-to-person contacts by 80% would remain in place, Abe said. 
Japan will move gradually to a framework that will combine prevention of the spread of infections with maintaining social and economic activities, he added.

Even though Japan has not seen a huge outbreak compared with some global hotspots, the coronavirus has infected 15,913 people and killed 542 in the country, according to public broadcaster NHK.

Key decisions regarding the election must be made this week. By Thursday, the Senate - the upper house of parliament where the opposition has a majority - will vote on the legislation that would allow for a postal ballot.
""A week ahead of the election Poles do not know when the election is held. It is the opposition and the Senate who are responsible for this,"" Sasin said.
If the Senate rejects the postal ballot bill, it will go back to the lower house of parliament, where some lawmakers in PiS's junior coalition partner oppose holding the vote during a pandemic.
The junior partner of the alliance has proposed extending the term of President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, by two years and holding the election in 2022 without him participating.
The opposition wants the government to announce a state of emergency which would mean the May election would be cancelled. 
Critics say PiS is insisting on the election being held this month due to the high support for Duda in the polls.
According to the most recent poll by Ipsos for the OKO.press portal, Duda would win the vote in the first round with 63% backing. If the election was held after the pandemic, Duda would get 42% of votes, the poll showed.
The growing pressure to delay the election has prompted PiS to look for other options. The Onet news website said on Monday that Duda may resign from his office, which would enable PiS to delay the election until mid-July.

PiS is also considering holding the election on May 23 both by postal ballot and in the usual way, the Rzeczpospolita daily said.

957,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Netanyahu fate at stake as coalition deal challenged in top court,"JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's top court on Monday heard challenges to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's bid to secure a governing coalition, with opposition figures arguing a deal on a new unity administration would unlawfully shield him in a corruption trial. 
The Supreme Court's 11-justice panel convened for a second day after hearing separate petitions on Sunday against Netanyahu's authority to form a government given his indictment on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust.
Rulings are expected by Thursday. Should the court find against Netanyahu on either front, it would likely trigger a snap election - the fourth since April 2019 - as the country grapples with the coronavirus crisis and its economic fallout. 
Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz signed an agreement last month to form a unity government under which they would take turns leading Israel after their three, inconclusive ballot runs. They cited the coronavirus crisis in forming the pact.
In power for more than a decade and currently head of a caretaker government, right-wing Netanyahu would serve as prime minister of a new administration for 18 months before handing the reins to centrist Gantz, according to the unity deal.
Netanyahu, 70, would then assume the role of ""substitute prime minister"", which some analysts say would exempt him from a law that requires cabinet-level ministers to resign from public office if they are indicted on criminal charges. 
Netanyahu's trial is due to open on May 24. He has denied any wrongdoing and accused political rivals of a ""witch-hunt"".
The coalition deal also grants Netanyahu influence over important judicial appointments, which critics argue gives the premier undue sway over the outcome of his own proceedings. 
The pact has support from a majority in parliament. But several groups, including opposition parties and democracy watchdogs, petitioned the Supreme Court to nullify the deal, arguing in part that it shields Netanyahu from legal penalties. 
Some analysts have said the court, though cast by Netanyahu loyalists as liberal and interventionist, was unlikely to strike down the deal or bar Netanyahu from forming a government. 

Responding to the petitions, Israel's Attorney-General Avichai Mandelblit said that while certain aspects of the deal ""raise major difficulties"", there were no grounds to disqualify it.

From early morning, police carried out inspections on buses and in metro stations to make sure passengers were wearing the mandatory surgical masks and in shops to check whether social distancing rules were being respected.
Greeks no longer need a form stating a valid reason - such as shopping for food or medicine, or taking physical exercise - for permission to leave their homes.
Traffic volumes increased on the streets of Athens and other large cities, and queues formed outside electrical appliance shops, which were also allowed to open for the first time since Greece imposed its tough blanket lockdown in mid-March.
Greece, a country of 11 million people, has so far registered 2,626 cases of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 144 deaths, far fewer than in many other European countries.
But Greece, which only emerged in 2018 from a debt crisis that wiped out a quarter of its economic output, is desperate to let businesses reopen and fears the coronavirus pandemic will ravage this year's tourism revenues, a pillar of its economy.
Local television channels showed hairdressers and their clients wearing surgical masks in Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki. Hair salons operate only on appointments. 
Small retail stores including florists and booksellers, opticians and spa services are among other businesses allowed to reopen on Monday.
The working hours of the shops allowed to reopen are likely to be extended due to high pent-up demand.

Schools, restaurants and bars are expected to reopen later this month. Hotels will start to open from June 1.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Monday said it will reopen schools in stages starting from May 13, as the daily number of domestic cases of the new coronavirus has fallen close to zero over recent days.
But health authorities urged vigilance once some 5.5 million elementary, middle and high school students gather in classrooms and they are conducting mock drills and preparing guidelines in the event of any upsurge in infection.
Widespread testing, intensive contact tracing and tracking apps have enabled South Korea to limit the spread of the virus without the extensive lockdowns seen in other countries.
But the beginning of the spring semester has been postponed four times since March during an intensive social distancing campaign, which has obliged schools to hold online classes. 
""We're now preparing for the opening of schools while managing the daily risks of the disease,"" Education Minister Yoo Eun-hae said told a televised briefing. 
""If a student turns out to be infected with the virus, health authorities will take the necessary action and the school will switch to online classes."" 
High school seniors preparing for a highly competitive annual college entrance exam, which has been postponed by two weeks to Dec. 3, are allowed to attend classes from May 13.
Younger students will resume school in stages between May 20 and June 1, Yoo said. 
Students and teachers will have to wear a mask except for during mealtimes, wipe their desks and maintain distance as they move around.
Schools will also be required to carry out regular disinfection and temperature checks and rearrange seating. 
The announcement came a day after the government relaxed the distancing rules from May 6, enabling some public facilities such as museums and libraries to reopen in stages.
Surveys commissioned by the education ministry showed a majority of parents and teachers supported the idea of a phased reopening of the schools within two weeks of the end of the intensive social distancing. 
After suffering the first major coronavirus outbreak outside China, South Korea has succeeded in lowering the daily rate of infections to around 10 or less, mostly imported. 
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported eight new cases on Monday, all overseas travellers, taking the national tally to 10,801, with 252 deaths. 
""We don't believe the there is a high possibility of mass outbreaks in schools after the school reopen, but we can't rule it out,"" KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong told a separate briefing.

Maulen Ashimbayev, 49, a political strategist who has held several senior positions in the oil-rich Central Asian nation, replaces Dariga Nazarbayeva, the eldest daughter of Kazakhstan's powerful 79-year-old former president, Nursultan Nazarbayev.
Tokayev's office announced Dariga Nazarbayeva's surprise departure on Saturday but gave no reason. Her father, who steered Kazakhstan to independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, retains sweeping powers as head of the Security Council and leader of the ruling Nur Otan party.
It was not immediately clear whether Ashimbayev's promotion marked any diminution in the power and influence of Nazarbayev and his family in the former Soviet republic, where political decision-making is often shrouded in secrecy.
The powers of parliament are quite limited in Kazakhstan, which has a presidential system of government.

Dauren Abayev, previously minister of information and social accord, has replaced Ashimbayev as the president's first deputy chief of staff, Tokayev's office said.

SYDNEY/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand and Australia are discussing the potential creation of a ""travel bubble"" between the two countries, even as Australia on Monday reported its highest number of coronavirus cases in two weeks.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she has accepted an invite from Australian Premier Scott Morrison to take part in a meeting of Australia's emergency coronavirus cabinet on Tuesday, stoking anticipation of a travel deal.
The neighbouring countries have claimed success in substantially slowing the progress of the coronavirus epidemic to a level well below the United States, Britain and Europe.
Still, Ardern warned that more health measures needed to be put in place before trans-Tasman travel could restart.
""I wouldn't say it would be in the very, very near short term,"" Ardern said at a news conference in Wellington.
""Don't expect this to happen in a couple of weeks time. We need to make sure we are locking in the gains all New Zealanders have helped us achieve and make sure we have health precautions in place."" 
Australia has recorded around 6,800 infections and 96 deaths, and New Zealand 1,137 cases and 20 fatalities. Both have a COVID-19 mortality rate of just 1% and have maintained low single digit rises in new cases for weeks, successes they attribute to social distancing regulations and widespread testing.
""Both our countries' strong record of fighting the virus has placed us in the enviable position of being able to plan the next stage in our economic rebuild and to include trans-Tasman travel and engagement in our strategy,"" Ardern said.
A New Zealand rugby league team arrived in Australia on Sunday to self-isolate for two weeks before joining Australia's tournament later this month, after receiving special permission.
The leaders will discuss ongoing measures to prevent the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 infections as they start to ease restrictions that have shut businesses and hobbled their economies. 
Australia on Monday reported 27 cases, including a seven-year-old boy, in its biggest daily jump in two weeks. That could rise as more states report throughout the day. New Zealand recorded no new cases on Monday for the first time since March 16.
New Zealand does not have a contact tracing app like the one launched by Australia last week to find and inform people who have been in contact with confirmed infected people.
About 4.5 million Australians have downloaded the CovidSafe app so far, well short of Morrison's previously announced target of 40% of the country's estimated 16 million smartphone owners.
Morrison has made wider adoption of the app a prerequisite to further ease strict social distancing regulations in Australia.
SCHOOLS DEBATE
The rise in Australia's death toll was largely due to an outbreak at a meat processing plant in the state of Victoria.
The infection of the seven-year-old boy in New South Wales (NSW) state, which closed his Sydney school, has drawn attention to the contentious question of whether children should attend school during the outbreak. 
The federal government has said schools should stay open since children are low-risk carriers of the virus, while some state governments have urged parents to keep children at home.
NSW will reopen schools on a staggered basis from next week, while Victoria has asked parents to keep children at home until the middle of the year.
The states and territories are also moving at different speeds to lift movement restrictions: NSW has allowed people to make house visits in groups of up to two, while Victoria is retaining its stay-home order until at least May 11.
""This is a struggle and ... it's not easy to live this way, but none of us can assume, just because we're frustrated, that this is over,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Monday. ""This is far from over. We have to stay the course.""

962,By Reuters,"<span>May 04, 2020 03:20AM ET</span>",North Korea defectors criticised over speculation Kim was ill or dead,"SEOUL (Reuters) - A former senior North Korean diplomat apologised on Monday after saying leader Kim Jong Un was likely so ill he could not stand, days before he emerged in state media chain smoking and walking briskly at an event attended by hundreds of officials.
Kim disappeared from state media for weeks, sparking a flurry of speculation about his health and whereabouts, and worry about prospects for the nuclear-armed state in the event of an unexpected succession.
But on Saturday, North Korean media published photographs of Kim at a ribbon-cutting ceremony for the inauguration of a fertiliser plant. 
His re-emergence came as a blow to the credibility of some high-profile defectors from the North who had speculated that Kim was suffering from a grave illness or could even be dead.
One of the defectors, Thae Yong Ho, was North Korea's deputy ambassador to Britain, where he managed secret funds for Kim. Thae fled to South Korea in 2016 and was one of a pair of defectors elected to parliament last month.
""I am aware that one of the reasons why many of you voted for me as a lawmaker is with the expectations of an accurate analysis and projections on North Korean issues,"" Thae said in a statement. ""I feel the blame and heavy responsibility.""
""Whatever the reasons, I apologise to everyone.""
The other prominent defector elected to parliament, Ji Seong-ho, had said in a media interview he was 99% certain that Kim had died after cardiovascular surgery and an official announcement would come as soon as Saturday.
Ji, who was invited to attend U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union address in 2018, could not be reached on Monday. 
Ji told Reuters on Friday he had received information about Kim's death from a source he could not disclose. He added he ran for office to bring attention to human rights abuse in the North.
South Korea's ruling Democratic Party criticised the pair for carelessness that it said could do more serious than just misinforming the public. 
One party member said they should be excluded from the intelligence and defence committees.
Daily NK, a South Korean news outlet run by North Korean defectors, reported in April that Kim was recovering from a cardiovascular procedure, sparking international speculation about his health.

Security Council arms embargo on Tehran, an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman said on Monday. 
""Iran is not seeking to exit the 2015 nuclear deal with six powers ... America's move is illegitimate and our reaction will be proportionate,"" Abbas Mousavi said in a televised weekly news conference.
The United States said on Thursday it was ""hopeful"" the U.N. Security Council would extend the arms embargo on Iran before it expires in October. 
President Donald Trump’s administration has been taking a harder line with the United Nations over its desire to extend and strengthen the embargo on Iran.
Washington has threatened to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran as leverage to get backing from the 15-member Security Council on extending the U.N. arms embargo on Tehran.
""The United States is not a member of the nuclear deal anymore ... Iran's reaction to America's illegal measures will be firm,"" Mousavi said.
Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Tehran that have crippled its economy.
Under the deal, Iran agreed to halt its sensitive nuclear work in exchange for sanctions relief. 
Iran, which denies its nuclear program is aimed at building a bomb, has gradually rolled back its commitments under the accord since the United States quit. It argues that Washington’s actions justify such a course.

Security forces intervened after ""riots and chaos"" broke out and seized several people who would face legal measures, the statement carried on state media said.
Representatives of the Egyptian embassy in Kuwait went to the shelter and reassured workers that repatriation flights would begin this week, the statement said. The Egyptian embassy also apologized for the riots, it added.
Several Gulf governments are trying to arrange flights for foreigners stranded or affected by job losses due to the coronavirus pandemic as well as those whose residencies have expired and will not be renewed.
Kuwait agreed last month to allow expatriates violating its residency laws to leave the country without paying fines or air tickets, with women and children due to leave first.
Local newspaper Al Qabas said some 28,000 foreigners out of estimated 160,000 without valid residencies have registered for repatriation and were being held in 34 shelters across the country. It said this included some 6,500 Egyptians, 6,300 Indians and 6,000 Bangladeshis.
Millions of expatriates, many from Asia, make up the bulk of the Gulf Arab region's labour force. 
Initially coronavirus cases in the region were linked to travel but Gulf Arab states have seen an increase in infections among low-income migrant workers living in overcrowded accommodation. 
Kuwait has among the lowest infection counts in the region at some 4,980 cases with 38 deaths. The total for the six Gulf Arab states has surpassed 67,600 with 380 deaths.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan has ""not yet"" received an invitation to a meeting this month of the World Health Organization's (WHO) decision-making body, the World Health Assembly, but will strive take part, the government said on Monday.
Taiwan's exclusion from WHO membership, due to objections from China, which considers the island one of its provinces, has infuriated Taipei, which says its exclusion has created a glaring gap in the global fight against the coronavirus.
The United States has supported Taiwan's participation at the assembly as an observer, adding to tension with China over its handling of the new coronavirus.
Taiwan attended the assembly as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations warmed, but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist. She rejects that.
The WHO said last week the assembly will take place virtually from May 18.
Taiwan foreign ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said the government had ""not yet received an invitation from WHO"" and was ""still awaiting"" it so a delegation could attend as an observer and share the island's experience in fighting the outbreak.
Taiwan has reported far fewer cases of the new coronavirus than many of its neighbours, due to early and effective detection and prevention work.
""Although the current situation we are facing is still very difficult, the government will never give up, and will join with allies and countries with similar ideals to continue to strive until the last moment,"" Ou said, referring to efforts to take part in the meeting.
The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The government and diplomatic sources have said Taiwan's chances of taking part are very slim because of China's position.
The health ministers of Taiwan and the United States discussed Taiwan's bid to join the assembly last week.
China says Taiwan can only take part in the WHO under Beijing's ""one China"" policy, in which Taiwan would have to accept that it is part of China, something Tsai's government will not do.
In a statement on Saturday, China's mission in Geneva, where the WHO is based, expressed strong opposition to the Taiwan-U.S. call last week.
""The Taiwan region is part of China. The Taiwan region's participation in international bodies, including the activities of the WHO, must be handled in accordance with the 'one China' principle,"" it said.
Beijing has repeatedly condemned Washington for seeking to ""politicise"" the issue of Taiwan's participation at the WHO, and both China and the WHO say Taiwan has been provided with the help and information it needs during the coronavirus pandemic.

Taiwan says it has only received limited information and that the WHO ignored its initial enquiries about the outbreak.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand has loosened restrictions on some businesses after progress in containing the coronavirus, bringing life back to the streets, including the hawker-food heaven of Bangkok's Chinatown.
Thailand was the first country outside China to record a case of the coronavirus, back in January, but its daily tally of new cases has fallen to single digits for the past week, with a total of 2,969 confirmed infections and 54 deaths, as of Sunday.
The government has welcomed the progress with a relaxation of some lockdown rules, allowing food stalls and restaurants outside shopping malls to reopen, and allowing shops to sell alcohol for drinking at home.
""My stall has been closed for 40 days, because no one's been here. I've lost 70% of my income,"" said Taweesak Tabthong the owner of a famous Chinatown shark fin restaurant, who was happy to see a queue of customers outside.
Up to Sunday, restaurants and street stalls were only allowed to sell food for takeaway or delivery.
Customers are now allowed to eat in again but are meant to observe social distancing, with tables spaced apart.
Wannika Naphon, happy to be getting out for a meal for the first time in weeks, said she was confident businesses would be careful with distancing.
""I'm sure Yaowarat will return to normal with a lot of tourists soon,"" she said, referring to the street by which Bangkok's Chinatown is known.
Under the relaxed rules, outdoor markets, small shops, parks and outdoor sports facilities, barbers and pet groomers can reopen.
But a nighttime curfew, from 10 p.m., will remain until the end of the month so it will be some time before Bangkok's famous night life even begins to get back to normal.

BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro attacked Congress and the courts in a speech to hundreds of supporters on Sunday as the number of coronavirus cases blew past 100,000 in Brazil, underlining the former army captain's increasing isolation as he downplays the impacts of the pandemic.
The right-wing Bolsonaro has drawn criticism from across the political spectrum for dismissing the threat of the virus in Brazil, which has registered 101,147 confirmed cases and 7,025 deaths, according to the most recent data from the Health Ministry.
On Sunday, dozens of public figures signed an open letter to the Brazilian government calling on officials to protect the nation's indigenous people, who often live in remote locations with limited access to healthcare.
At the same time, Bolsonaro faces the most serious political crisis of his mandate, after his justice minister, Sergio Moro, quit last week and accused the president of firing the federal police chief in a bid to appoint a personal ally to the post and meddle in sensitive investigations.
Brazil's Supreme Court blocked Bolsonaro's pick for a new chief on Wednesday, enraging the president. 
On Saturday, Moro, among Brazil's most popular public figures due to his tough stance on corruption, presented testimony regarding possible obstruction of justice by Bolsonaro. Hours before, the president called Moro ""Judas"" on Twitter, referring to the apostle who betrayed Jesus.
As Bolsonaro's relationship with legislators and the courts has cooled, he has become increasingly dependent on a cadre of advisers in his government who are active or former military. 
As in an April rally also attended by Bolsonaro, demonstrators called on Sunday for the closing of the Supreme Court and Congress, and a return to authoritarian measures used during Brazil's 1964-1985 military government.
""We have the armed forces at the people's side: the side of order, democracy, liberty,"" Bolsonaro said in a speech transmitted live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
""Enough interference. We're not allowing any more interference. Our patience is over.""
CORONAVIRUS HOT SPOT
Bolsonaro did not call for a military takeover at the rally in Brasilia, and such an occurrence is widely considered unlikely in Brazil, where Congress, the courts, the press and civil society wield significant power. 
But political leaders have called Bolsonaro's participation in anti-democratic rallies irresponsible, especially as he has spoken approvingly of the nation's former military dictatorship, which was responsible for hundreds of extrajudicial executions.
Bolsonaro's attendance also drew criticism as the nation is a major coronavirus hot spot. 
Bolsonaro, who did not wear a mask on Sunday, has dismissed the coronavirus as a ""little flu,"" saying the economic fallout of quarantining measures would be deadlier than the virus itself.
The open letter on Sunday, which warned that loggers and ranchers could introduce the virus to indigenous communities in a development tantamount to ""genocide,"" was signed by celebrities ranging from U.S. television personality Oprah Winfrey to Brazilian supermodel Gisele Bundchen.
The government has banned people from entering indigenous reserves during the pandemic. It has also cut down, however, on law enforcement against illegal loggers and miners in remote regions as a safety measure. 
At the Sunday rally, at least three photographers were attacked by demonstrators, according to a Reuters witness - an increasingly routine occurrence in Brazil, where Bolsonaro routinely calls the work of major newspapers ""fake news.""

The Reuters witness saw one photographer from Sao Paulo newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo pulled off a ladder and repeatedly kicked in the ribs.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal downgraded its state of emergency to a category of ""calamity"" on Sunday, as spring sunshine drew people outdoors and the rate of new coronavirus cases reached its lowest since the beginning of the outbreak.
""It's like being freed from prison,"" enthused Rodrigo Garcia, 40, on a walk to Lisbon's River Tagus with his wife, two sons and dog. ""We've gone out here and there, but with the end of the state of emergency we feel much freer.""
After a six-week state of emergency when people were urged to stay indoors except for brief exercise, and most non-essential services were shut, a three-phase reopening plan begins from Monday..
But the temptation of 30 degree Celsius (86 Fahrenheit) temperatures and Mother's Day had some taking to beaches and parks before then with newfound confidence. On Lisbon's waterfront, runners and cyclists hopped out of each other's way on Sunday morning.
Beaches remain closed other than for water sports and exercise, but under the lesser state of calamity spending time in parks is no longer strictly forbidden.
POLICE WATCHING
Still, police officers were out in force on Sunday urging people not to linger and to maintain social distancing.
""A state of calamity still means you should stay home as much as you can,"" officer Sofia Gordinho told Reuters, between speaking to groups picnicking in Lisbon's Campo Martires da Patria park about the new measures. 
""If people want to sit in the sun for a bit, that's okay, but we are asking them to move on so others can come without it getting crowded.""
Spared the huge tolls in neighbouring Spain and some other Western European nations, Portugal reported 25,282 cases of the new coronavirus on Sunday, just 0.4% more than the day before, and 1,043 deaths - in a population of 10 million people.
A new fund reimbursing microbusinesses for 80% of up to 5,000 euros ($5,490) of expenses on personal protective equipment and cleaning costs would be made available from May 11, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said on Sunday.
Vending machines selling masks, hand gel and gloves were installed in Lisbon and Porto subways, which will reopen most lines on Monday but at two thirds capacity.

As small neighbourhood shops open, masks will be obligatory in enclosed public spaces like supermarkets and on public transport from Monday onwards, with rule-breakers incurring fines of up to 350 euros.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - The chief of Colombia's armed forces vowed on Sunday to get to the bottom of an ongoing scandal over spying on journalists, politicians and judges by what he described as rogue elements within the country's army.
In an interview with Reuters, General Luis Fernando Navarro said he was committed to finding and punishing those responsible for any hacking, which came to light in a January report by magazine Semana.
The defense ministry on Friday announced the ouster of 11 unnamed military officials and the resignation of a general related to the scandal. 
There have been repeated hacking scandals involving the Colombian military in recent years, including accusations negotiators at peace talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels were spied on. 
Previous investigations have not yet led to convictions.
""Colombia's intelligence system is under total and absolute control,"" Navarro said in a phone interview. Changes had been made to command structures and strict security protocols were implemented after the scandal came to light, he said.
Illegal spying is not an institutional policy but reflects the individual actions of a few officials who have not just lost their jobs but could face jail time, Navarro said.
Semana published more details on Friday including the names of some alleged victims. It said more than 130 people, among them foreign and domestic journalists, had been hacked and information about their contacts, families and addresses collected.
Semana said it had dozens of documents connected to the case and some of the units involved had received funding and equipment from a foreign intelligence agency. 
Navarro would not confirm the alleged illegal use of foreign resources, saying only he was confident Colombia would continue receiving help to fight drug trafficking and armed groups.
""The investigations have to move forward and find those responsible,"" he said.
""Our cooperation has to continue to be strong, we need it to combat transnational organized crime and we guarantee to our strategic allies that we are investigating, making decisions and any person who has gone outside the law will have to answer for it.""
The United States has long been Colombia's principal ally in the battle against guerrillas and drug trafficking gangs and intelligence has been key to attacks on rebel leadership and cocaine confiscations.
One of the alleged hacking victims is a former secretary of the presidency who worked closely with President Ivan Duque.

Duque and his defense minister have rejected the alleged spying and said illegal conduct within the military will not be tolerated.

The 20-year-old was among almost 400 survivors pulled from the water, starving, emaciated and traumatized after the boat failed to reach Malaysia and spent weeks adrift before returning to Bangladesh in mid-April. 
Hundreds more refugees are stranded on at least two other trawlers, rights groups say, as Southeast Asian governments tighten borders to keep out the new coronavirus, threatening a repeat of a 2015 boat crisis when hundreds of people died.
The United Nations has implored authorities to let the boats land, but anti-refugee sentiment is surging in Malaysia and governments say borders are sealed to keep out the coronavirus.
In interviews with Reuters, seven survivors from the rescued boat recalled two harrowing months. 
Estimates of the number of people who died on the boat ranged from several dozen to more than 100 - nobody kept count - but their accounts were consistent.
The survivors described hundreds of men, women, and children crammed on the boat, unable to move, squatting in rain and scorching sun until, as food and water ran out, they began to die of starvation, thirst, and beatings, their bodies tossed overboard. Some wept as they spoke. 
""I thought I would not come back home alive,"" said Uddin. ""I missed my family, especially my parents.""
The group Fortify Rights said in a statement last week the operators of the boat ""held their victims in conditions similar to slavery for the purposes of exploitation"". 
Reuters was unable to identify or contact the crew for comment.
Amnesty International urged governments to protect stranded Rohingya and allow them to land. It estimated 800 more people were at sea. Several dozen people from one boat landed on the south coast of Bangladesh on Saturday.
Malaysia defends its policy of turning boats away. Authorities have acted lawfully to defend the country’s sovereignty and are ready to do so again, its minister for internal affairs said in a statement on Thursday.
More than a million Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority from Myanmar, live in camps in southern Bangladesh after fleeing from largely Buddhist Myanmar’s Rakhine State.
Most fled an army crackdown in 2017 that the United Nations says was carried out with genocidal intent. Myanmar denies genocide and says it was responding to insurgent attacks.
'BETTER OFF IN MALAYSIA'
Although the Rohingya people trace their ancestry in Rakhine back centuries, Myanmar says they are illegal immigrants from South Asia.
For years, Rohingya from Myanmar and Bangladesh have fled by boat for Thailand and Malaysia when the seas are calm between October and April. Hundreds died in 2015 after a crackdown in Thailand led smugglers to abandon their human cargo at sea.
In Bangladesh, Uddin made a little money driving motorized tuk-tuks but said refugees were becoming more confined. 
The government restricts internet and cell phone access and has begun putting up barbed-wire fences around the camps, citing security. Uddin said it began to feel like prison.
""I thought going to Malaysia by whatever way would at least save me. Many have made it to Malaysia and are better off.”
He said he and several friends met a man in a shanty town who took them by boat to a trawler where hundreds of people were already crowded on board - men on the lower deck, women on the top. Many of the young women were due to be married in Malaysia.
Another refugee, Enamul Hasan, also 20, said an uncle in Malaysia urged him to go there. “I wanted to go to Malaysia to end my family's poverty,” he said.
Six of the seven survivors Reuters interviewed said they had gone willingly. The seventh, aged 16, said he was taken by unknown men against his will.
The misery began as soon as they set out.
""We ate almost nothing,"" said Uddin. ""Little kids would cry for water.""
WEEPING AND PRAYING
After a week the boat arrived off Malaysia, where it waited for several days before the crew said they could not disembark and would have to return to Bangladesh.
They crossed back over the Bay of Bengal. 
""We faced storms three times,” said Uddin.
He said he was made to serve as an enforcer for the crew and beat anyone who stepped out of line. “If I didn’t want to beat them, I myself would be beaten,” he said. 
Meanwhile, some desperate passengers began to drink sea water. 
""By the wonderful grace of God, the water would seem sweet,” said Hasan. 
""Many jumped into the water ... everyone was saying that it was much better to die in the water than dying in the ship.”
At night, the passengers held one another, weeping and praying.
Eventually the boat stopped again, off Myanmar, survivors said, but again it could not dock.
""People kept dying and would be thrown overboard,” said Hasan. ""I began to wonder when I would die.""
The refugees eventually forced the captain to take them back to Bangladesh where, one night, they made landfall.
A coastguard official there at the time said they were a shocking sight: ""Many of them were stick-thin, some unable to stand.”
Muriel Boursier, head of mission for Doctors Without Borders in Bangladesh, who met survivors later, said many could not walk. Some grieved for lost relatives, staring blankly.
Some survivors were taken to hospital but most went to a quarantine camp, unaware of the coronavirus that had taken hold during their voyage.
""It's difficult to understand that no state is able to open its doors,"" Boursier said.
Uddin said his parents hardly recognised him but he was thankful to be back, though he had little hope for his future.

""It's better to die here than to die at sea,"" he said.

The European Union has asked Greece to move migrants most at risk of contracting the coronavirus from overcrowded camps on its Mediterranean islands.
Athens had opposed moving them all to the mainland, citing the absence of cases in the camps while the coronavirus was spreading elsewhere in the country.
""Authorities are getting ready to transfer a group of about 395 migrants seen as vulnerable later today to the mainland via ship,"" a police official, who declined to be named, said.
The group will leave the Moria camp on the eastern Aegean island, which is close to Turkey.
Greece has been the main gateway into the EU for people fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond. More than a million people reached its shores from Turkey in 2015-16.
At least 110,000 people are living in migrant facilities - 40,000 of them in overcrowded camps on five islands.
""The goal is to transfer about 2,400 from island camps to mainland Greece,"" a Migration Ministry official said.
Greece, which adopted lockdown measures to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus on March 23, has had 2,626 confirmed cases since its first in late February.
The death toll has been 144, significantly lower than other countries such as Italy, Spain, France and Britain.

No coronavirus cases have so far been recorded in Greek island camps. But aid groups have urged Athens to evacuate the camps, warning that the risk of the fast-moving coronavirus spreading amid squalid conditions is high.

President Nicolas Maduro frequently accuses political adversaries of attempting to overthrow his administration with the support of the United States, which has vowed to force him from office through sanctions that have crippled the OPEC nation's oil exports. 
Critics of the ruling Socialist Party often dismiss such accusations as stunts used as an excuse to detain opponents of the government.
The group landed early on Sunday on the coast of La Guaira, about 20 miles (32 km) from the capital Caracas, Interior Minister Nestor Reverol said in a televised address.
""They tried to carry out an invasion by sea, a group of terrorist mercenaries from Colombia, in order to commit terrorist acts in the country, murdering leaders of the revolutionary government,"" he said.
Socialist Party leader Diosdado Cabello said eight people were killed and two were detained.
""We have deactivated an attempted incursion of our territory, thanks to intelligence efforts,"" Cabello told reporters.
Maduro has overseen a six-year economic crisis that has left many citizens unable to obtain basic food and medicine and forced nearly five million people to emigrate.
The United States and more than fifty other countries disavowed Maduro after his disputed 2018 election, which they say was rigged, and instead have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the nation's legitimate interim leader. 

But Maduro retains the backing of the country's armed forces as well as countries including China and Russia, which have harshly criticized the U.S. sanctions.

North and South Korea on Saturday exchanged gunfire around a rural guard post, raising tension a day after North Korean state media showed Kim visiting a factory, the first report of him making a public appearance since April 11.
South Korea responded to shots fired from across the DMZ but no casualties were reported. 
""We think those are accidental. South Koreans did return fire. So far as we can tell, there was no loss of life on either side,"" Pompeo said on ABC This Week.
Pompeo declined to discuss whether he knows whether Kim has been gravely ill over the last few weeks - which ratcheted up speculation as Kim missed a celebration of his late grandfather - but said based on video footage of him from state television at a recent event, ""It looks like Chairman Kim is alive and well.""

""We know there have been other extended periods of timewhere Chairman Kim's been out of public view as well, so it's not unprecedented,"" Pompeo said.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Sanctions-hit Syrian tycoon Rami Makhlouf said on Sunday that security forces were arresting employees at his companies ""in an inhumane way"" amid pressure on him to step down from his business empire and pay millions of dollars in tax.
Makhlouf, a cousin of President Bashar al-Assad and widely considered part of the president’s inner circle, has a business empire that ranges from telecoms and real estate to construction and oil trading. He played a big role in financing Assad's war effort, Western officials have said.
""Today pressures began in an unacceptable ways and the security forces, in an inhumane way, are arresting our employees,"" Makhlouf said in a video in an unprecedented attack on the powerful security forces by one of the country's most influential figures.
""Mr President (Assad), the security forces have started attacking people's freedoms. These are your loyal supporters... The situation is dangerous and by God, if we continue, the situation of the country will be very difficult,"" Makhlouf said.
The security forces did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Makhlouf said in the video he had been asked to step down from his companies, including Syriatel, the main mobile operator and main source of revenue for the sanctions-hit government.
""I have been asked today to step down from my companies and take instructions while I close my eyes. Authority is not given to put pressure on people to give in,"" he said.
""Did anyone expect the security forces would pounce on Rami Makhlouf's companies who were their biggest supporters and their patron during the war?""
He said he would not bow to pressure to hand over his wealth.
The billionaire has been under U.S. sanctions since 2008 for what Washington calls public corruption and it has since toughened measures against top businessmen who are close to him. 
The European Union has also slapped sanctions on Makhlouf since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, accusing him of bankrolling Assad.
Makhlouf became a hated figure to many pro-democracy protesters who rose up against corruption and the authoritarian rule of Assad in March 2011.
Makhlouf, who belongs to Assad's Alawite minority sect that holds political power in Syria, owes his fortune to Assad and was seen by many Syrian businessmen and others as a front man for the president and other members of the ruling family.
The tycoon was rumoured in private business circles last year to have fallen out of favour with Assad. But until a first video he released on Thursday, he had kept out of the spotlight.
In Thursday's video, Makhlouf lashed out at his critics who accuse him of monopolising sectors of the economy through political patronage, saying his businesses and a charity arm had provided thousands of jobs for Syrians.
He said he would appeal to Assad to allow Syriatel to reschedule payment of taxes. He said the government's demand for 130 billion Syrian pounds ($300 million) was ""unjust"" but that he would comply.
Makhlouf said in Sunday's video that he would not bow to pressure to hand over his wealth to powerful rivals, whom he did not name.

""This is an attack on private property. What I already have is something I cannot give up,"" he said defiantly.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgaria plans to lift a ban on people travelling outside their local communities next week as it begins easing coronavirus restrictions, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said on Sunday.
Checkpoints controlling intercity travel would be most probably removed on Wednesday when Bulgaria marks St George’s Day, Borissov said.
The travel restriction had been important, he said, adding that citizens should remain disciplined in the coming weeks.
""I really rely on discipline,"" he said. ""We have to get used to living with this virus, it won't be over in a year or two,"" Borissov told a news conference.
Bulgaria has so far confirmed 1,611 cases of the illness and 72 deaths.
In mid-March, the country closed all schools, bars, restaurants, hotels, cultural and sports centres and gyms, as well as shops, apart from food and drug stores. It also prohibited socialising in public spaces and introduced obligatory quarantine for most people entering the country.
Borissov said more restrictions would be lifted in the coming days. Outdoor bars and restaurants will be opened following inspections by regional health inspectorates and the food safety agency.
Athletes will be allowed to conduct individual training.
""Individual outdoor sports activities are allowed as of tomorrow but not competitions,"" Borissov said. ""Swimming pools will also be opened, subject to all safety measures - disinfectants in the changing rooms, (keeping) a safe distance.
Bulgaria, a Balkan country with a population of nearly 7 million, declared a state of emergency until May 13 to confront the spread of coronavirus. Borissov said that a draft bill regarding lifting the state of emergency will be prepared on Monday.

Bulgaria, one of the poorest but also least indebted EU members, maintains tight fiscal discipline. But the government expects coronavirus lockdown measures around the globe will shrink the economy by 3% this year, and increase its fiscal gap to 3% of economic output.

The brief statement said Gon Coulibaly left on Saturday but gave no details about his state of health.
A source close to Gon Coulibaly, who had heart surgery in 2012, said the prime minister had missed a scheduled check-up in France in April because he was busy coordinating Ivory Coast's coronavirus response. 
""His intense activity these last weeks had an impact on his health, but it is nothing very serious. He is doing well,"" the source said, adding that Gon Coulibaly would return to Ivory Coast in a few days.
Defence Minister Hamed Bakayoko, who recovered from the coronavirus last month, will serve as interim prime minister in Gon Coulibaly’s absence, the presidency's statement said.
Gon Coulibaly self-isolated in late March because of possible exposure to the coronavirus but did not test positive.
President Alassane Ouattara designated Gon Coulibaly in March as the ruling RHDP party's candidate for the presidential election after saying he would not himself seek a third term.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea will further relax social distancing rules from May 6, allowing a phased re-opening of businesses, as the nation has largely managed to bring the coronavirus outbreak under control, Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said on Sunday.
Widespread testing, intensive contact tracing and tracking apps have enabled South Korea to limit the spread of the virus rather than rely on the lengthy lockdowns seen elsewhere. 
The government ""will allow businesses to resume at facilities in phases that had remained closed up until now, and also allow gatherings and events to take place assuming they follow disinfection guidelines,"" the prime minister told a televised meeting of government officials.
Further easing of rules means public facilities such as parks, libraries as well as schools could reopen in phases, although the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended citizens to continue to exercise some caution in everyday life.
The new guidelines from the government advise everyone to stay home for three to four days if they feel unwell, stay arms-apart with others in public spaces, and wash hands frequently. 
Seoul extended its social distancing policy until May 5 even as it managed to bring down daily infection cases of more than 900 in late February to around 10 per day in the past week.
The national tally is at 10,793 as of midnight Saturday, with 250 deaths.

With mosques closed and religious gatherings banned since mid-March as the outbreak spread in the Middle East's worst-hit country, ordinary Iranians have turned to drive-ins for ceremonies during the holy Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
State TV and videos on social media showed people in their cars watching a religious ceremony on a big screen in a Tehran car park.

The ministry said on Saturday that the trajectory of infections has started a ""gradual"" downward trend in Iran. On Sunday the health ministry said the country's coronavirus death toll had risen to 6,203 and the total number of diagnosed cases had reached 97,424.
Iran has already lifted a ban on inter-city trips and malls, with large shopping centres resuming activities despite warnings by some health officials of a new wave of infections. 
School and university closures were maintained and cultural and sports gatherings are also still banned, though Rouhani said the plan is for some schools to reopen soon.

HERAT, Afghanistan (Reuters) - Afghan officials on Sunday launched a hunt to retrieve bodies of Afghan migrants from a river in a western province after reports that Iranian border guards tortured and threw Afghans into the river to prevent their entry into Iran.
Afghanistan's foreign ministry in a statement on Saturday said an inquiry had been launched and a senior official in the presidential palace in Kabul said initial assessments suggested at least 70 Afghans who were trying to enter Iran from bordering Herat province were beaten and pushed into the Harirud river.
The Harirud river basin is shared by Afghanistan, Iran and Turkmenistan.
Doctors at Herat District Hospital said they had received the bodies of Afghan migrants, some of whom had drowned.
""So far, 5 bodies have been transferred to the hospital, of these bodies, its clear that 4 died due to drowning,"" said Aref Jalali, head of Herat District Hospital.
The Iranian consulate in Herat denied the allegations of torture and subsequent drowning of dozens of Afghan migrant workers by border police.
""Iranian border guards have not arrested any Afghan citizens,"" the consulate said in a statement on Saturday. Iranian embassy officials in the Afghan capital Kabul were not immediately available for a comment.
Noor Mohammad said he was one of 57 Afghan citizens who were caught by Iranian border guards on Saturday when they were trying to cross into Iran in search of work from Gulran District of Herat. 
""After being tortured, the Iranian soldiers threw all of us in the Harirud river,"" Mohammad told Reuters.
Shir Agha, who said he also survived the violence, said at least 23 of the 57 people thrown by Iranian soldiers into the river were dead.
""Iranian soldiers warned us that if we do not throw ourselves into the water, we will be shot,"" said Agha.
Local Afghan officials that it was not the first time that Afghans had been tortured and killed by Iranian police guarding the 920 kms (520 miles) long border.
Herat's governor Sayed Wahid Qatali in a tweet to Iranian officials said, ""Our people are not just some names you threw into the river. One day we will settle accounts.""
The incident could trigger a diplomatic crisis between Iran and Afghanistan at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has seen a mass exodus of Afghan migrants from Iran with many testing positive for COVID-19. 
Up to 2,000 Afghans daily cross the border from Iran, a global coronavirus hotspot, into Herat.
As of Sunday, at least 541 infected people are from Herat province, which recorded 13 deaths, with the majority of positive cases found among Afghan returnees from Iran, said Rafiq Shirzad, a health ministry spokesman in Herat.

In a video posted on Twitter by Kensington Palace, the residence and office of Kate and her husband Prince William, the mother-of-three could be seen chatting via video-link with a woman who had given birth the night before, a midwife, and various others.
""As organisations you're playing such a vital role, giving key information, you're hugely trusted by the public in general, and therefore the information that you provide is a lifeline to many people at this time,"" Kate told professionals from not-for-profit mental health organisations on a group call.
The video was issued to mark Britain's Maternal Mental Health Awareness Week.
In a separate snippet, Kate could be seen chatting with a new mother on her hospital bed, congratulating her on the birth of her son and acknowledging the strangeness of having the conversation via video-link due to social distancing measures.
""This is definitely a first,"" she said, laughing along with the new mother.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un did not undergo surgery during his almost three week absence from public life, South Korean news outlet Yonhap said citing a senior government official, as the two Koreas exchanged gunfire around the border on Sunday.
The South Korean official declined to provide reasons for believing that Kim did not undergo surgery, but said speculative reports that he may have had surgery, citing some differences in his leg movements, is not true, Yonhap reported.
Earlier on Sunday, North and South Korea exchanged gunfire around the South's guard post, raising tension a day after North Korean state media showed Kim visiting a factory, the first report of him making a public appearance since April 11. 
Multiple gunshots were fired from North Korea at 7:41 a.m. local time towards a guard post in South Korea that borders the North, the South's Joint (NASDAQ:JYNT) Chiefs of Staffs (JCS) said in a statement.
South Korea responded by firing two shots towards North Korea, no injuries were reported.
After weeks of intense speculation about Kim's health and whereabouts, which included one report he had undergone cardiovascular surgery, North Korea's official media published photographs and a report on Saturday that Kim had attended the completion of a fertiliser plant.
Kim was seen in photographs smiling and talking to aides at the ribbon-cutting ceremony and touring the plant. State TV footage showed Kim’s leg movements appearing stiff and jerky.
The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be verified.
The exchange of gunshots on Sunday was the latest confrontation between the rival Koreas that technically remain at war.
In a lengthy briefing held later on Sunday, an official at South Korea's JCS said the gunshots did not seem a planned provocation, as the area where it ocurred was farmland, but declined to provide a clear conclusion about the incident.
""In absence of vision (for the target) and in the fog, would there be an accurate provocation?"" the official said. 
'MESSAGE KIM STILL CONTROLS MILITARY'
Choi Kang, vice president of the Asan Institute for Policy Studies, said he believed the timing of the 'grey area' provocation shows it could have been planned to show that Kim was still in charge of the North Korean military.
""Yesterday, Kim was trying to show he is perfectly healthy, and today, Kim is trying to mute all kinds of speculation that he may not have full control over the military,” Choi said. 
""Rather than going all the way by firing missiles and supervising a missile launch, Kim could be reminding us, 'yes I’m healthy and I’m still in power'.” 
Ewha University international affairs professor Leif-Eric Easley in Seoul said the shooting incident could be aimed at boosting morale in the North Korean military.
""The Kim regime may be looking to raise morale of its frontline troops and to regain any negotiating leverage lost during the rumor-filled weeks of the leader's absence,"" said Easley.

""South Korea and the United States should not take lightly such North Korean violations of existing military agreements.""

A ruling against Netanyahu would likely trigger a snap election, the fourth since April 2019, as the country grapples with the coronavirus crisis and its economic fallout. 
Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz signed an agreement last month to form a unity government under which they would take turns leading Israel after three elections that neither of them won.
In power for more than a decade and currently head of a caretaker government, right-wing Netanyahu will serve as prime minister of a new administration for 18 months before handing the reins to centrist Gantz, according to the unity deal.
But several groups, including opposition parties and democracy watchdogs, have petitioned the country's highest court to nullify the deal and bar Netanyahu from leading the government, citing the criminal proceedings against him.
Responding to the petition, Israel's Attorney General Avichai Mandelblit said there was no sufficient legal ground to disqualify Netanyahu.
Some Israeli analysts have said the court, cast by Netanyahu loyalists as liberal and interventionist, was unlikely to bar the premier from heading a new government. A ruling is expected to be announced by Thursday. 
Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, was indicted in January on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. He denies any wrongdoing in all three cases against him and has said that he is a victim of a political witch-hunt.
Netanyahu's trial is due to start on May 24.
Israeli law says a prime minister under indictment is not obligated to step down until a final conviction.
Netanyahu is suspected of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts from businessmen, which prosecutors said included cigars and champagne, and of promoting regulatory favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website and Israel's best-selling newspaper.

If convicted, he could face up to 10 years in prison on bribery charges and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.

A rally on May 1 demanding, among other things, a lockdown at the Indonesia Weda Bay Industrial Park (IWIP) during the coronavirus pandemic, turned violent with demonstrators destroying company property and looting food, North Maluku police spokesman Adib Rojikan said.
Eight people had been named suspects for their involvement in the violence and four others were being questioned, Rojikan said by telephone.
The demands by workers included rejecting lay-offs and getting a full salary during the proposed lockdown, as well as blocking parliamentary deliberation in Jakarta of a bill that calls for a steep cut in severance compensation, said Rojikan. 
IWIP said in a statement that the two workers' unions at the industrial park were not behind the rally and accused five unversity students of provoking some 800 workers to join the rally and conduct ""anarchic action"".
Some of its offices, several vehicles and heavy machinery were damaged during the violence, IWIP said.
IWIP said police had pledged to provide security at the park for its operation, but did not specify whether the incident would disrupt production.
Early stage production only started at the Weda Bay Nickel Project last Thursday, with total annual capacity of 30,000 tonnes.

""This decision is meant to decongest our quarantine facilities to protect our people by preventing the further spread of COVID-19 and also ensure that our overseas Filipino workers are well taken care of when they arrive from abroad"", the task force said in a statement. 
The Philippines introduced curbs on immigration, travel, commerce and public gatherings in mid-March, days after the first case of domestic transmission. Entry to the country is closed to all except repatriated Filipinos.
Around 20,000 repatriated Filipinos are undergoing mandatory quarantine in the capital, the task force said. 
The temporary ban on incoming air travel covers nine international airports, including in the capital Manila. Cargo, sweeper, medical, utility and maintenance flights are exempted from the order, the aviation authority said. 
Philippine airlines had already extended domestic and international passenger flights suspensions to mid-May.
The Philippines has reported 8,928 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and 603 deaths.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's state of Victoria saw its highest increase in new coronavirus cases in weeks on Sunday and New South Wales state struggled with a cluster of infections at an aged care facility, as parts of the country began easing distancing rules. 
Thirteen new cases were recorded in Victoria on Sunday, health officials said, with six of the cases related to an infections cluster at a meat processing facility in Melbourne.
""What I'm worried about is the unknown unknowns,"" Victoria's Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said at a televised briefing, urging more people to get tested.
""We want to make sure that if we have cases that are positive in the community we can identify those individuals... this is how we are going to defeat the virus.""
In New South Wales there were four new cases, two of which were recorded at the Newmarch aged care facility in Sydney, where more than 60 people have been infected and 14 have died.
Australia and neighbouring New Zealand, which have closed borders and imposed lockdowns and tight social restrictions, have been hailed for containing COVID-19 outbreaks, but the measures are set to push both economies into recession.
Australia's success in suppressing the virus has led to some states and territories allowing for more outdoor activities and public gatherings earlier than planned.
Many national parks have reopened in the state of Queensland and people were allowed to go on small picnics, while the Northern (NASDAQ:NTRS) Territory has started lifting restrictions with the aim of ending them by June.
New South Wales has allowed visiting the homes of friends or neighbours, but in groups no larger than two, and form next weekend, for the first time in six weeks, real estate agents will be allowed to hold traditional property inspections and on-site auctions. 
The easing, however, has been gradual and varied across Australia, a country of a loose federal system. 
Victoria, the second most populous state, was set to keep its strict rules at least until a state of emergency expires on May 11. Mikakos said that possible relaxation of rules after that date will depend on the number of daily infections.
Over the past week Australia recorded an average of only 13 new cases a day, according to the health ministry, with the daily rate of infections well below 1%, a fraction of what has been seen in many other countries. 
There were 6,783 confirmed cases and 94 deaths in Australia as of late Saturday, according to health officials. Neighbouring New Zealand saw two new cases on Sunday, bringing the total to 1,136. Twenty people have died so far. 
The Australian government, which is to meet on Friday to discuss relaxing social distancing rules on federal level, has hoped that its voluntary coronavirus tracing app, introduced last week, would help guide it when making the decisions.
As of Saturday, four million Australians downloaded the COVIDSafe app, the health ministry said. This is about 16% of the country's population of 25 million and well below the government's initial target of 40%. 
Despite the government's assurances that the app would not trace location and that the collected data will be accessed only by health officials with the users' consent, people remained worried about the app's security. 

""As we all know, it is very important that as many people as possible download the app,"" Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd said on Saturday at a televised briefing.

Bolsonaro and Brazil's Foreign Ministry had given Venezuela until Saturday to remove its diplomats in the latest chapter of worsening relations between the ideologically opposed neighbors.
Justice Luis Roberto Barroso took up an injunction request from a Workers Party lawmaker that argued the expulsion could violate Brazil's Constitution, international agreements on human rights and the Vienna Convention on diplomatic relations.
Bolsonaro said in a Twitter post that he had decided on the
""compulsory withdrawal of Venezuelan diplomatic corps"" and he criticized the injunction sought by lawmaker Paulo Pimenta.
""This lawmaker is a staunch defender of the Chavez/Maduro regime,"" he tweeted, in reference to Venezuela's late leftist leader Hugo Chavez and his successor President Nicolas Maduro.
Barroso said the immediate ejection of the diplomats in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic countered humanitarian principles. The consular personnel are based in the cities of Brasilia, Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Belem and Boa Vista.
Brazil withdrew the remainder of its diplomats from Caracas on April 17 and the Bolsonaro government had expected Venezuela to do the same by May 2, citing a verbal agreement on a reciprocal move to close each countries' missions, Brazilian officials said.
But Venezuela's leftist government said in a statement on Thursday that there had been no such negotiation and that its diplomats would stay put. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza accused Brazil in a Twitter post of violating international law by forcing its diplomatic personnel to leave.
Along with more than 50 other countries, Brazil does not recognize the legitimacy of Maduro and has called for democratic elections in Venezuela.
The Bolsonaro government sees opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful leader of a democratic transition in Venezuela and has formally recognized his envoy, Maria Tereza Belandria, as Venezuela's ambassador in Brasilia.

Belandria, however, lives and works out of a Brasilia hotel because the Venezuelan Embassy is still controlled by Maduro representatives. The embassy has not had an ambassador since 2016.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday welcomed the reemergence of North Korea's Kim Jong Un after weeks of speculation about his health, but prospects for the U.S. efforts to persuade Pyongyang to denuclearize appear as bleak as ever.
On Saturday, North Korean media said Kim cut a ribbon at a ceremony on Friday to mark the completion of a fertilizer plant. 
It had not reported on Kim's whereabouts since he presided over a meeting on April 11, provoking speculation that he was seriously ill and raising concerns about instability in his nuclear-armed country that could affect other North Asian countries and the United States.
Kim was seen in photographs smiling and talking to aides at the ceremony and also touring the plant. The authenticity of the photos could not be verified.
A U.S. government source familiar with intelligence reporting said Washington strongly believes Kim is alive, but has not been able to confirm the photos were taken on Friday, or explain why he had not been seen for weeks. 
Trump, who met Kim three times in 2018 and 2019 in unprecedented but unsuccessful personal attempts to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons, tweeted on Saturday: ""I, for one, am glad to see he is back, and well!""
Trump has continued to refer to Kim as a friend, but the mystery of the past three weeks has served to emphasize the limits of that relationship and his lack of progress in persuading North Korea to give up a weapons program that now threatens the United States.
The lack of a clear successor for Kim has raised fears about the security of the program in the event of political turmoil in North Korea, which borders U.S. strategic rival China and U.S. allies South Korea and Japan.
On Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was monitoring the situation closely and that the U.S. focus remained on ""making sure that country doesn’t have nuclear weapons.""North Korea has shown no willingness to abandon weapons it sees as vital for defense of the nation and the Kim dynasty.
""I would think we are back to where we were,"" said Joseph Yun, who was a U.S. North Korea envoy under former President Barack Obama and at the start of the Trump administration.
""U.S.-North Korea talks going nowhere; Kim Jong Un pushing the envelope, say through short-range missile tests; Trump hoping that nothing much happens at least through the November elections.""
Since U.S.-North Korea talks stalled last year, Kim has personally presided over numerous short-range missile tests, but has resisted a return to long-range missile and nuclear testing suspended since 2017.
Analysts say the scare over Kim's health emphasized the need for thorough contingency planning, something complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.
""I doubt we’ll ever have much clarity on what Kim did over the past couple of weeks and the anxiety it caused sparked some real questions about how prepared we are prepared to deal with this kind of circumstance,” said Jenny Town of 38 North, a Washington-based North Korea analysis project.
""No one seemed particularly prepared to respond in case of a North Korean crisis given the current political conditions. That is something that should be addressed.” 
A U.S. response to such a crisis has been complicated by a souring of relations with China - the country which has most influence with Pyongyang - with Trump accusing Beijing of mishandling the coronavirus outbreak and speaking of the need for compensation for the enormous economic and human toll.
In 2017, when ties were less strained, then U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington had been talking to China about how to secure North Korea’s nuclear weapons in the event of a collapse of the government there.
He said Washington had given Beijing assurances that if U.S. forces ever had to cross into North Korea, they would not stay there and would return across the border into South Korea.
In spite of Kim's reappearance, questions remain over the health of a leader, who, although only in his mid-30s, is significantly overweight and a heavy smoker. 
State TV footage showed Kim's leg movements appearing stiff and jerky and one of images showed a green golf cart in the background, similar to one he used in 2014 after a lengthy public absence. 
Specialist North Korea website NK News also spotted a dark colored mark on Kim’s arm in video footage, which was not there on April 11. It quoted medical professionals as saying it could be related to a cardiovascular procedure - possibly a stent placement.
Speculation about Kim's health has been rife after he missed the birthday celebrations of late state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15. 
A South Korean news outlet specializing in North Korea reported that Kim was recovering after a cardiovascular procedure.
In images of the factory visit, Kim was seen accompanied by his younger sister Kim Yo Jong, who has been talked about by experts as a possible successor, although no woman has ever ruled North Korea.
The choice of venue for Kim's reemergence was concerning for U.S. denuclearization aims.
While it appeared to be a signal to domestic audiences he is watching out for their well-being, nuclear analysts believe the plant could be part of covert uranium enrichment efforts for North Korea's nuclear program.

A report last month by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California said there was strong evidence of the plant's involvement in uranium extraction.

Macron's government has faced criticism for flip-flopping messages on whether, when and where citizens should wear masks, for failing to replenish the stock of masks before the crisis and for carrying out far fewer tests than neighbouring Germany.
Le Pen in particular has relentlessly criticised the government, saying ministers had lied about ""absolutely everything"".
But she has so far failed to convince a majority of the public she would do a better job than Macron. Some 41% thought she would do worse, while 39% thought she would do neither better nor worse, according to the Ifop poll.
None of the public figures tested in the poll were thought to be able to do a better job than Macron by a majority of the French.
Twenty percent thought former president Nicolas Sarkozy would handle the crisis better, 15% thought left-wing firebrand Jean-Luc Melenchon would, and only 8% thought former Socialist leader Francois Hollande would do a better job.
Trust in Macron's government remained low, however, with 39% of the French saying they trusted his government to face the coronavirus crisis efficiently, stable from a week ago but down from 55% in March.
In a sign economic measures were better received, some 47% of French people said they trusted the government to do the right thing for struggling companies, up 1 point from a week ago but down from 57% in March. 

The poll was taken after Prime Minister Edouard Philippe unveiled his plan to gradually unwind from May 11 a lockdown imposed since March 17.

Beatriz Giron, director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons which advocates for inmates' rights, said 46 bodies had been identified after the incident on Friday at the Los Llanos penitentiary. The South American country's prisons are infamous for extreme levels of violence and poor conditions. 
The country's prisons minister, Iris Varela, told local newspaper Ultimas Noticias on Friday that the incident resulted from an escape attempt and that the prison director had been shot and wounded. She did not give a death toll, and Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
Maria Beatriz Martinez, an opposition lawmaker from Portuguesa, said the riot followed came after a ban on inmates' family members bringing them food during visitation, which is common in Venezuelan prisons. The visitation restrictions are part of the country's effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in its overcrowded prisons.

Such restrictions have prompted riots in prisons in several countries, including Italy. In Argentina, prisoners rioted last month demanding some inmates be freed due to fears of infection.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Dozens of Rohingya believed to be from one of several boats stuck at sea landed on the coast of southern Bangladesh on Saturday, an official said, as concerns grew over hundreds stranded for weeks on trawlers because of coronavirus restrictions.
“A small boat carrying 43 people came to shore today,” the government official said, declining to be named because they were not authorized to speak to media. 
Some of the arrivals were sent to Bhasan Char, a remote island off the coast where authorities previously planned to house Rohingya, the official said.
Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project monitoring group, said the group that landed on Saturday had likely come on a small boat from one the larger vessels still at sea, believed to be carrying hundreds of people.
Hundreds of Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority from Myanmar, are stranded on at least two trawlers between Bangladesh and Malaysia, rights groups say, as Southeast Asian governments tighten borders to keep out the new coronavirus.
Another boat, carrying hundreds of Rohingya who were starving and emaciated after weeks at sea, landed in Bangladesh in mid-April. Survivors said several dozen died on board.
The United Nations has urged authorities to let the boats land, but anti-refugee sentiment is surging in Malaysia and governments say borders are sealed to keep out the coronavirus.
For years, Rohingya from Myanmar and Bangladesh have fled by boat for Thailand and Malaysia when the seas are calm between October and April. Hundreds died in 2015 after a crackdown in Thailand led smugglers to abandon their human cargo at sea.

LONDON (Reuters) - Boris Johnson and his fiancée Carrie Symonds have named their newborn son Wilfred Lawrie Nicholas, partly as a tribute to two of the intensive care doctors who they said had saved the British leader's life as he battled COVID-19 complications.
Symonds announced the name on Saturday on Instagram beside a picture of her and the boy, who already has thick hair resembling the blond thatch of his father.
Symonds, 32, said Wilfred, who was born on Wednesday, was named after Johnson's grandfather, while Lawrie came from her grandfather.
The choice of Nicholas, Symonds said, was a nod to Nick Price and Nick Hart - two doctors who the couple have praised for saving Johnson's life at St Thomas' hospital last month.
""I couldn't be happier,"" Symonds said, adding her thanks to the maternity staff of University College London Hospital. ""My heart is full.""
Johnson, 55, returned to work on Monday after recuperating from COVID-19, which had left him gravely ill in intensive care at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak. He thanked the doctors at St Thomas' hospital whom, he said, had ""saved my life, no question"".
""We are honoured and humbled to have been recognised in this way,"" said Price, director of infection at Guy's and St Thomas' hospital, and Hart, director of respiratory and critical care. ""We wish the new family every health and happiness.""
Symonds, a former public relations executive, also had symptoms of the virus but recovered more swiftly. She had said in February that the baby was due in early summer.
Johnson, who was present at the birth, will take a short period of paternity leave later in the year.
BABY IN DOWNING STREET
Symonds and Johnson have been living together in Downing Street since he became prime minister in July. They announced in February they were expecting their first child and that they were engaged to be married.
Once dubbed ""Bonking Boris"" by Britain's tabloid media, Johnson has had a complicated private life.
He was once sacked from the Conservative Party's policy team while in opposition for lying about an extra-marital affair. He has been divorced twice and refuses to say how many children he has fathered.
In 2013, when Johnson was mayor of London, appeal court judges ruled that the public had the right to know he had an extra-marital affair with a woman who gave birth to his daughter.
Johnson's previous marriage was to Marina Wheeler, a lawyer. They had four children together but announced in September 2018 that they had separated. They divorced earlier this year.
Few British leaders have had babies while in office.
David Cameron's wife Samantha gave birth to their daughter, Florence, in 2010, and Tony Blair's wife Cherie gave birth to their son, Leo, in 2006.

Before that, Frances, the wife of John Russell, a 19th-Century Whig and Liberal politician, gave birth to two children in 1848 and 1849 while he was in office.

KABUL (Reuters) - Representatives of U.S. forces in Afghanistan and Taliban insurgents engaged in a rare public spat on Saturday, venting on social media about the stalling Afghan peace process.
After lengthy talks behind closed doors, the Taliban and United States signed an agreement in February for reduced violence and a move towards talks with the Afghan government, but attacks by the group have increased since then.
Sonny Leggett, spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan, used Twitter to address his Taliban counterpart on Saturday, saying U.S. forces wanted the peace process to move forward, but would respond if the militant group continued to increase attacks.
""Attacks generate attacks, while restraint produces restraint. If the violence cannot be reduced - then yes, there will be responses,"" Leggett, said on Twitter, tagging and addressing Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid.
Mujahid responded that the path to a resolution lies in the implementation of the Doha agreement.
""Do not harm the current environment with pointless & provocative statements,"" Muhajid tweeted to Leggett, adding, ""we are committed to our end, honor your own obligations."" 
The Taliban say the United States has not pushed the Afghan government to implement a prisoner exchange mentioned in the agreement, which stipulated the exchange of 6,000 prisoners - 5,000 members of the insurgent group and 1,000 of the Afghan forces. 
Leggett conceded there has been a reduction of violence against cities and against coalition forces. 
""But we spoke of ALL sides reducing violence by as much as 80% to pave the way for peace talks,"" Leggett added, referring to increased attacks on Afghan forces.
The Taliban have mounted more than 4,500 attacks since signing a deal with the United States, according to data seen by Reuters. The provinces hardest hit are ones with the most COVID-19 infections, which are spreading rapidly across the war-torn country.

""We're standing up for justice, not only for our son, but for all our dear friends in Pakistan so they can live in a society free of violence and terrorism,"" Pearl's father Judea said in an emotional video message posted on Twitter.
Their lawyer Faisal Siddiqi told Reuters he had filed the petition on their behalf. A court official said it had yet to be admitted for further proceedings.
""A bare perusal of the entire record would reveal that there was a plethora of incriminating evidence, both forensic as well as oral, which proved that murder was committed and that all the accused persons aided and abetted the murder,"" the appeal petition said. 
Islamist militant Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a Briton of Pakistani origin who was sentenced to death in 2002 for masterminding Pearl's murder, had his sentence commuted last month and three of his aides who had been sentenced to life in prison were acquitted for lack of evidence by a high court in the southern port city of Karachi.
Pakistani authorities however ordered the four to be kept in detention for three months.
The United States denounced the high court ruling, with the top U.S. diplomat for south Asia saying it was ""an affront to victims of terrorism everywhere"".

The country of 5.5 million people has reported 1,407 cases of the virus, although daily new infections have been less than 10 for the past week.
""The chance that all shops outside of shopping malls will be open from May 6 are dramatically rising,"" Matovic said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Saturday, after only four new infections were recorded for the previous day.
Slovakia has reported 24 deaths from COVID-19, giving it one of the lowest rates per capita in Europe.
It has already started easing some restrictions. Smaller stores, outdoor markets and takeaway restaurants have been allowed to reopen in the first step of a four-stage plan to restart the economy.
Stage two is expected to start on May 6 and includes opening hairdressers and taxi services. It will also allow religious services and weddings with a limited number of guests.
All will be subject to strict hygiene rules.
A team of public health experts will meet on Monday to consider the reopening of more shops, Matovic said on Thursday. 
Authorities will still monitor for any resurgence in infections. 
More than two-fifths of infected patients have recovered since the first detections of the new virus were reported in Slovakia in March. The country was one of the quickest to close borders and implement measures to contain the spread.
The economy, though, has been hard hit by a lockdown of many activities and the central bank on Wednesday predicted the economy would shrink by between 5.8% and 13.5% this year.

In an interview with Italy's Radio Sportiva, Montagliani, who is seen as a close ally of FIFA president Gianni Infantino, said the move would fit in with the 2022 World Cup being played in Qatar in November and December.
The head of world soccer's governing body himself has said that football will be totally different when it restarts and that the current stoppage could be a good chance to overhaul the overloaded calendar which is due to run until 2024.
""We have the opportunity because the World Cup in Qatar in 2022 will be played in November/December and that could be the idea,"" said Montagliani, who is president of the CONCACAF confederation.
""Here in the Americas, the season is already played according to the calendar year, perhaps it is a solution that could also be used in Europe and Africa, it is a possibility to be discussed at national and continental level,"" he said. 
""It is not an idea to be discarded, it can be a solution in view of the next two years and this winter World Cup"".
A number of European leagues, including Italy, Germany and England, still hope to finish their seasons but doing so could force the start of the 2020-21 campaign to be pushed back. UEFA also wants to finish the Champions League and Europa League.
""We had already started thinking about how to set a new calendar from 2024, now with this crisis we need immediate answers,"" added Montagliani.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and rival Abdullah Abdullah are close to resolving a standoff over last year's disputed presidential election that has threatened a U.S.-brokered peace process, both sides said on Saturday.
The feud culminated in both men declaring themselves president at parallel inauguration ceremonies in March.
A draft deal had been finalised that included proposals that Abdullah lead a high council for peace talks and have a half-share in government appointments, Fraidoon Khwazoon, a spokesman for Abdullah, said.
""In principle an agreement is reached but there are a few things that need to be finalised. We believe they are not big obstacles and will be solved,"" Khwazoon said.
The dispute has sparked fears among many, including the United States, that the split was undermining momentum in peace talks with Islamist Taliban insurgents.
Ghani's spokesman, Sediq Sediqi, had said on Twitter late on Friday that there had been progress in resolving the dispute.
""Progress has been made in the ongoing negotiations and discussions on important political issues and matters to resolve them politically,"" Sediqi said.
Both sides have been under international pressure to strike a deal. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Afghanistan in March for a one-day visit to try to broker an arrangement even as most travel was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic.
""We have told both sides to firm up a deal this week. If not, then aid could be hit badly in this time,"" a senior Western diplomat said on Saturday.
Spokesmen for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul and for Ghani declined to comment. A spokesman for Abdullah said donors had emphasised they should solve the issue but they had not been given a deadline to come to a resolution.
Pompeo had announced a $1 billion reduction in aid and threatened to slash the same amount next year to try to force Abdullah and Ghani to end their feud.
After nearly 20 years of fighting the Taliban, the United States is looking for a way to extricate itself and to achieve peace between the U.S.-backed government and the militant group.
The United States and the Taliban signed a pact on Feb. 29 that was designed to pave the way for peace talks between the militant group and the Afghan government.

But formal talks have not started because of the political feud, as well as an escalation in violence by the Taliban since the deal was reached and disagreements over a prisoner swap.

MADRID (Reuters) - Joggers, cyclists and surfers across Spain emerged from their homes early on Saturday, with adults allowed out for exercise for the first time in seven weeks as the government began easing tough coronavirus restrictions.
In Barcelona, runners and cyclists crowded paths near the beach, while surfers and paddle-boarders were out enjoying the waves.
Mar Visser, 45, who lost her job as an events organiser, was jogging along the path in Castelldefels, a town near Barcelona. 
""I have been longing for this. It beats running in my house or doing yoga or Pilates inside,"" she said. 
In Madrid, cyclists and skateboarders streamed along the city's wide boulevards, ducking under police tape set up to prevent people congregating in common areas. 
Hit by one of the world's worst COVID-19 outbreaks, Spain imposed a strict lockdown in March, confining most of the population to their homes for all but essential trips.
Sports and recreational walks were banned as authorities scrambled to stop the disease from spreading and sought to ease the burden on the stricken healthcare system. 
Charlotte Fraser-Prynne, 41, a British government affairs consultant, was among the first to savour the new freedom to exercise - out for a run at 6 a.m. near Madrid's Retiro Park.
While the park remained closed, hundreds of people were running on the pavement around it.
""I have been looking forward to this for weeks. I was joking with my friends that I would be the first out in Madrid. I am very happy to be out after six weeks of yoga videos,"" she said.
Prime Minster Pedro Sánchez called on people to follow guidelines on social distancing and to act with caution. 
""Today we take a new step in the measures to ease the confinement but we must do it with prudence and responsibility. The virus is still there,"" he tweeted.
As the rate of infection has fallen and hospitals have regained their footing, Sanchez's government has shifted its focus towards reopening the country in a phased way and reviving a badly battered economy.
Last weekend, children under 14 were allowed out for an hour a day of supervised activity. 
Madrid resident Susana Piego, 52, was out cycling in the city center on Saturday, welcoming the newfound freedom.
""The easing out plan is good,"" she said. ""We have to go little by little, like the WHO says, so that there is not another spike,” she said.
The World Health Organization said on Friday that countries must lift lockdowns gradually, while being ready to restore restrictions if the virus jumps back.
'NEW NORMALITY'
Sanchez announced a four-phase plan this week to return the country to what he termed ""the new normality"" by the end of June.
To avoid overcrowding as people get outside, the government has implemented a shift system, allocating different time slots to different age groups. 
Businesses that operate by appointment, such as hairdressers, will be allowed to open from Monday. Bars and restaurants will remain closed for at least another week.
Spain has recorded a coronavirus death toll of 25,100, according to health ministry data on Saturday, and more than 216,582 cases. 

The lockdown has hammered the economy and the government expects gross domestic product (GDP) to contract 9.2% in 2020.

1006,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",The art of re-emergence: North Korea leader Kim appears after long gap,"By Jack Kim and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - When North Korea broke a three-week silence on leader Kim Jong Un's public activity on Saturday, it offered no clue where he has been during a period of intense global speculation about his health and whereabouts, or why he was hidden from the public for so long. 
Instead, state media simply showed him surrounded by aides and appearing confident at a gleaming fertiliser factory that is believed by outside experts to be part of a secret nuclear-weapons programme.
While much remains a mystery about Kim's condition, the abrupt re-emergence of the relaxed and smiling leader was clear choreography of key messages from the secretive government: Kim is the supreme leader in full control of a drive to improve the impoverished country's food security and economy, amid tough international sanctions and the threat of the new coronavirus.
CENTRE OF WORLD NEWS
The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper devoted three of its six pages on Saturday to touting Kim's leadership, crediting him for what it called prosperity and self-reliance.
Reuters could not verify the accuracy of official accounts or the authenticity of pictures from the event.
The sprawling complex is the result of Kim's vision to build a modern factory that will support agricultural production and make progress in automating its chemical industry, Pak Pong Ju, a party elder and a loyal aide to Kim, said at the ribbon-cutting where Kim reappeared.
North Korea is under sanctions over its nuclear-weapons and missile programmes, leaving the country chronically struggling with food shortages, aggravated by bad weather and mismanagement.
Kim's appearance at the Sunchon fertiliser plant, which official media said occurred on Friday, was an example of ""field guidance"" - a key part of Kim's public persona, where he presides over an event at a major industrial or social project, or at other times at military drills involving strategic weapons such as ballistic missiles or tactical warfare.
His second public visit this year to the site 50 km (30 miles) north of the capital Pyongyang included a sizeable audience of officials from the army, the ruling Workers' Party and the local community. Many wore face masks in an apparent precaution against the coronavirus.
""Agricultural production is a top priority, which has a direct impact on the lives of the people,"" Koh Yu-hwan, the president of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a South Korean government think-tank, said. 
Koh said Kim's sudden return was ""a strategy to be in the centre of world news without resorting to nuclear or missile tests.""
THE ENTOURAGE
The makeup of Kim's entourage featured familiar faces at such events, including two at the forefront of the North's years-long drive to improve economic conditions: former premier Pak Pong Ju, who is Kim's deputy at the State Affairs Commission, and Pak's successor as premier, Kim Jae Ryong.
The pair had accompanied Kim on his last major field guidance, the March groundbreaking of the General Hospital in Pyongyang. 
To Kim Jong Un's immediate right on the podium was his sister, Kim Yo Jong, a vice director of the party's Central Committee and unofficially her brother's chief of staff. 
SECRET PROJECT
The phosphate fertiliser factory in Sunchon, under construction since June 2017, has received much attention from North Korea's leaders, with multiple visits by Kim Jae Ryong and Pak. 
International observers say the plant is part of the North's clandestine pursuit of uranium extraction for use in nuclear weapons, as the mineral can be a byproduct of making phosphate fertiliser. 
There is strong evidence the factory is involved in uranium extraction, said a report this month by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies, based in California, in line with Kim's policy of pursuing economic and military strength.

The North is motivated to use the plant because it is cost-effective and can easily conceal uranium enrichment, which Pyongyang has long sought to hide, the report said. Uranium enrichment offers an alternative to plutonium processing as a fuel for nuclear weapons.

France, the former colonial power, has 5,100 troops in Mali and the wider Sahel region, but security has progressively worsened since it intervened in 2013 to stop a jihadist advance to the Malian capital, Bamako.

1008,By Reuters,"<span>May 02, 2020 04:00AM ET</span>","After rumours about health, North Korea state media report Kim Jong Un appearance","By Heekyong Yang and Jack Kim
SEOUL (Reuters) - After weeks of intense speculation about the health of Kim Jong Un, state news agency KCNA said on Saturday the North Korean leader attended the completion of a fertilisers plant north of Pyongyang, the first report of his appearance since April 11.
Reuters could not independently verify the KCNA report. 
KCNA said Kim cut a ribbon at the ceremony on Friday and those attending the event ""burst into thunderous cheers of 'hurrah!' for the Supreme Leader...""
Kim was seen in photographs smiling and talking to aides at the ribbon-cutting ceremony and also touring the plant. The authenticity of the photos, published on the website of the official Rodong Sinmun newspaper, could not be verified.
Many in the large crowd of people, described as officials of the army, the ruling party and the community who worked on the project, were wearing face masks and standing some distance from the podium where Kim and his aides took part in the ceremony.
North Korea has not reported any cases of the coronavirus and has said it has been taking tough measures to prevent an outbreak. One reason for Kim's absence has been the suggestion he may have been taking precautions against coronavirus.
Kim was accompanied by senior North Korean officials, including his younger sister Kim Yo Jong and top aides vice-chairman Pak Pong Ju of the State Affairs Commission and cabinet premier Kim Jae Ryong, and KCNA said. 
Asked about the KCNA report on Kim, U.S. President Donald Trump said: ""I'd rather not comment on it yet.""
""We'll have something to say about it at the appropriate time,"" he told reporters at the White House.
KIM'S MOVEMENTS APPEAR STIFF, JERKY
Speculation about Kim's health has been rife after he missed the birth anniversary celebrations of state founder Kim Il Sung on April 15. The day is a major holiday in North Korea and Kim as leader usually pays a visit to the mausoleum where his grandfather lies in state.
He last made a public appearance on April 11 attending a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party politburo. 
Following his absence from the anniversary, a South Korean news outlet specialising on the North reported that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure. A flurry of other unconfirmed reports about his condition and his whereabouts followed.
Officials in South Korea and the United States expressed scepticism about the reports.
State TV footage on Saturday showed Kim's leg movements appearing stiff and jerky and one of the images showed a green golf cart in the background, similar to one he used in 2014 after a lengthy public absence. 
""Preparing desks and chairs on the stage seemed a bit rare for such an outdoor occasion,"" Nam Seong-wook, a professor of North Korean studies at Korea University, said of the ceremony. 
""Kim might have some physical conditions that prevent him from standing too long and he needs to be seated after standing up for awhile.""
Nam said if Kim is unable to stand for long periods that maybe the reason he did not attend the anniversary event in April at the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where he would have had to stand for at least about an hour.
SPECULATION OVER KIM'S WHEREABOUTS
The city of Sunchon where the fertiliser factory was built is about 50 kms (30 miles) north of Pyongyang in the western region, away from Wonsan, the eastern coastal resort where South Korean and U.S. officials have said Kim may have been staying.
Satellite images showing a train usually used by Kim near the Wonsan resort, as well as boats often used by Kim and his entourage, suggested he may be staying there. 
Officials in South Korea and the United States have said Kim may be there to avoid exposure to the coronavirus, and have expressed scepticism about media reports that he had some kind of serious illness.
The former top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Daniel Russel, said the pieces of the puzzle of Kim’s disappearance would take time to assemble.
His reappearance showed that authoritative information about the well-being and whereabouts of a North Korean leader were very closely guarded, and rumours about him needed to be regarded with considerable scepticism, Russel said.
The rumours had, however, served to focus attention on North Korea's succession plan, which “in a monarchical and cult-like dictatorship is filled with risk, and the absence of a designated adult heir compounds that risk many times over,"" Russel said. 
Earlier, a source familiar with U.S. intelligence analyses and reporting said that U.S. agencies believed that Kim Jong Un was not ill and remained very much in power.
""We think he's still in charge,"" the source said on condition of anonymity.
The source could not immediately confirm the KCNA report.
The State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
POSSIBLE CORONAVIRUS PRECAUTIONS
South Korean Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees engagement with Pyongyang, said it was plausible Kim was absent as a precaution over the coronavirus pandemic, in view of the stringent steps taken to head off an outbreak in the country.
Harry Kazianis, senior director of Korean studies at the Center for the National Interest think-tank in Washington, said this still could be the case.
""The most likely explanation for Kim's absence is with North Korea declaring the coronavirus pandemic an existential threat ... he most likely was taking steps to ensure his health or may have been impacted in some way personally by the virus,"" Kazianis said after the KCNA report.
Kim's reported appearance at a fertiliser plant is the latest signal to domestic audiences that he is watching out for their economic and food wellbeing, but nuclear analysts believe it is likely a part of the North's covert uranium enrichment efforts.
There is strong evidence of the Sunchon phosphate fertiliser plant's involvement in uranium extraction, pointing to its dual-use, a recent report by James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey, California.
Negotiations aimed at dismantling North Korea’s nuclear and missile programmes stalled late in 2019.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India has mandated that all public and private sector employees use a government-backed Bluetooth tracing app and maintain social distancing in offices as New Delhi begins easing some of its lockdown measures in lower-risk areas. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government on Friday said India - the country with the largest number of people in lockdown - would extends its nationwide control measures for another two weeks from Monday to battle the spread of the coronavirus that causes the COVID-19 illness, but allow ""considerable relaxations"" in lower-risk districts. 
As part of its efforts to fight the deadly virus, India last month launched the app Aarogya Setu - meaning Health Bridge - a Bluetooth and GPS-based system developed by the country's National Informatics Centre. The app alerts users who may have come in contact with people later found to be positive for COVID-19 or deemed to be at high risk. 
""Use of Aarogya Setu shall be made mandatory for all employees, both private and public,"" India's Ministry of Home Affairs said in a notification late on Friday. 
It will the responsibility of the heads of companies and organizations ""to ensure 100% coverage of this app among the employees,"" the ministry said. 
Officials at India's technology ministry and a lawyer who framed the privacy policy for Aarogya Setu told Reuters the app needs to be on at least 200 million phones for it to be effective in the country of 1.3 billion people. 
The app has been downloaded around 50 million times on Android phones, which dominate India's smartphone user base of 500 million, according to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Play Store data. 
The app's compulsory use is raising concerns among privacy advocates, who say it is unclear how the data will be used and who stress that India lacks privacy laws to govern the app. 
""Such a move should be backed by a dedicated law which provides strong data protection cover and is under the oversight of an independent body,"" said Udbhav Tiwari, Public Policy Advisor for internet company Mozilla. 
New Delhi has said the app will not infringe on privacy as all data is collected anonymously. 
The app can help authorities identify virus hotspots and better-target health efforts, the tech ministry told Reuters in late April, adding that information on the app is used ""only for administering necessary medical interventions"". 
On Friday, the government said that offices re-opening will also have to implement measures like gaps between shifts and staggered lunch breaks to contain spread of the coronavirus that has infected 3.3 million worldwide and caused more than 230,000 deaths. 

India has reported over 37,000 cases and 1,218 deaths from the virus.

The ministry did not name any of the people dismissed or the general. The country's attorney general opened the investigation in January after local news magazine Semana published the allegations. 
There have been repeated hacking scandals involving the military in recent years, including accusations officials spied on negotiators at talks with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels, which eventually led to a 2016 peace accord.

The investigations are continuing, Trujillo said.

The National Guard report said soldiers fired at a group of armed prisoners as they tried to break out of the main entrance of the Los Llanos jail in central Portuguesa state. One officer with a megaphone then negotiated with the prisoners and they agreed to withdraw, it said.
The report said the military assumed there were more deaths inside the prison, and lawmaker Maria Martinez told Reuters that over 40 people were known to have died.
Martinez, who lives in the nearby state capital of Guanare, said the riot resulted from prison authorities banning prisoners' relatives from bringing them food, as is customary in Venezuelan jails.
Venezuela's prisons minister, Iris Varela, in an interview with a local newspaper, confirmed there had been an incident at the jail and the prison's director had been shot and wounded, but she did not give more details or a death toll.
The Information Ministry did not respond to a request to comment.

Protesters gathered on the Labor Day holiday in Santiago's central square, many shouting and displaying signs that railed against abuse of workers and a sharp rise in layoffs in the South American nation.
Calls to protest on social media warned those who attended the rally to ""use gloves, masks and alcohol gel,"" but police said demonstrators had failed to adhere to a nationwide rule against gatherings of more than 50 people. 
The Carabineros police force said on Twitter that one of the protesters detained had been diagnosed with COVID-19 and was meant to be in isolation for another week.
Police officers clad in plastic-screened helmets and olive uniforms herded protesters into police vehicles, while water cannons mounted on trucks nearby dispersed others.
Santiago is under partial quarantine, but scattered, small protests against the government of center-right President Sebastian Pinera have persisted in areas not under lockdown.

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albania will enlarge its area of green zones and let taxis travel between cities from Monday, and allow shopping centres to open and cars to travel without permits from May 11, according to a plan published by Prime Minister Edi Rama on Friday. 
While still enforcing an afternoon-to-dawn curfew, Albania has eased its restrictions this week, letting many retailers open except for bars and restaurants, though they may offer deliveries. Some people wore masks, others did not.
Barbers, hairdressers and dentists will be able to start work on May 11. From May 19, bars and restaurants will open but can serve only in their outdoor spaces, not inside closed doors, respecting distancing until 5:30 p.m. when the nightly curfew starts.
Life in Tirana, the capital, and elsewhere appeared almost normal this week except for the shut-down bars, which usually teem with patrons, as Albania has more bar-cafes per person, at 645, than any country in the world, according to a 2018 tally.
The ban on cultural and artistic events will not be lifted and gatherings of more than five people will not be allowed, the plan said. Gatherings of five people are already happening.
Under the plan, repatriation flights for Albanians trapped abroad and wishing to return home will be more frequent, and the returnees would quarantine at home for two weeks, instead of in hotels at their own expense as under the current practice.
""This plan will change if the dynamic of the epidemic will get worse,"" Rama warned in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) message.
Albania has reported 782 cases of the new coronavirus, including nine in last 24 hours. It said 31 people have died and 488 have recovered. There were 263 people actively sick with the COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus, the Health Ministry said. 
Only seven out of 33 patients in hospital are in intensive care units, the ministry added.
The easing comes after infections are low and the World Bank said Albania's economy is headed for a recession, shrinking by 5% or 6.9% depending on the time that most activities resume.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is banning the sale of military-grade assault weapons in the aftermath of the country's deadliest mass shooting two weeks ago, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday.
""These weapons were designed for one purpose and one purpose only: to kill the largest number of people in the shortest amount of time,"" Trudeau said at a daily media briefing in Ottawa. ""There is no use and no place for such weapons in Canada.""
Trudeau has previously said a ban was in the works even before the most recent mass shooting almost two weeks ago, in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, where a gunman armed with weapons that included an assault rifle killed 22 people.
A source told Reuters on Thursday that the ban would be announced soon and would include several variations of assault-style weapons.
When he announced the measure, Trudeau also cited the 1989 Ecole Polytechnique shooting in Montreal, where a man killed 14 women and himself due to radical anti-feminist sentiments.
Families and friends of gun violence victims ""deserve more than thoughts and prayers,"" Trudeau said. 
The ban - which includes buying, selling, transporting, importing or using the designated weapons - will become effective immediately by changing government regulations, Trudeau said.
Current owners of the weapons have two years to dispose of them, and Trudeau said the government will later bring in legislation to provide ""fair compensation.""
Trudeau's Liberal party campaigned in October's federal election on a promise to bring in stricter gun control.
Although the debate around guns is less heated in Canada than in the United States, many Indigenous communities use guns as part of traditional hunting practices.
Trudeau acknowledged this, but said that ""you don't need an AR-15 to bring down a deer.""
Andrew Scheer, leader of the Conservative Party and the official opposition, slammed the ban as ineffective and said it punished law-abiding citizens.
""The vast majority of gun crimes are committed with illegally obtained firearms,"" Scheer said in a statement. ""Nothing the Trudeau Liberals announced today addresses this problem.""

Canadian pollster Angus Reid released a survey on Friday which found that 78% of Canadians support a ban on military-grade assault weapons.

Mexico's Libre Abordo and a related firm, Schlager Business Group, last year signed a contract with President Nicolas Maduro's administration to exchange millions of barrels of Venezuelan oil for corn and water trucks. 
The deal, which is the nation's first oil-for-food pact after the United States sanctioned crisis-stricken Venezuela's state-run oil company PDVSA in early 2019, is being investigated by the U.S. Treasury and the State Department.
The Mexican firms have so far received over 24 million barrels of Venezuelan crude and fuel, according to internal PDVSA documents. Last month they completed the first delivery of 290 water trucks and parts for those trucks, according to Libre Abordo and vessel tracking data from Refinitiv Eikon.
The second delivery arrived in Venezuela's La Guaira port on Thursday on the Hong-Kong flagged bulk carrier Chipolbrok Sun. It is expected to discharge 20 water containers and 222 trucks, Libre Abordo told Reuters in a written statement on Friday. 
The vessel set sail on March 24 from the Dongjiakou port in China, according to the Eikon data.

HAVANA (Reuters) - With Communist-run Cuba on lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic, Havana's Revolution Square (NYSE:SQ) was eerily empty and gray on Friday for International Workers Day, bereft of the usual parade of thousands of flag-toting Cubans.
Encouraged by authorities to celebrate May Day in their homes, some Cubans sung along to the national anthem when it was played on state television early in the morning, while others strung the Cuban flag from their balconies and windows.
Ulises Guilarte, of the Cuban Workers' Confederation, said on the TV broadcast that the day was dedicated to the ""army of white coats"" - Cuba's doctors - tackling the coronavirus pandemic at home and abroad.
Cuba, which has one of the highest rates of doctors per capita worldwide and has engaged in medical diplomacy and service exports for decades, has sent brigades of doctors to more than 20 countries worldwide to help.
""We hold the most firm conviction that united, we will conquer,"" Guilarte said, using an old revolutionary slogan. 
""#MyHomeIsMySquare, celebrating the first of May,"" President Miguel Diaz-Canel wrote on Twitter, posting a photo of him with his arm around his wife in front of a Cuban flag, both wearing white face masks embroidered with the word 'Cuba.'
It was an altogether more subdued affair than the rallies in which millions of Cubans nationwide have participated each year since late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro's 1959 leftist revolution. Even the weather was downcast.
Cuba has only skipped the largest parade through Revolution Square a handful of times, such as during an economic depression following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
""Unfortunately the coronavirus has kept us at home but we were not about to ignore (May Day),"" said Havana resident Alejandra Varo Carrillo, who waved the Cuban flag from her rooftop.
Since the island nation registered its first cases of the coronavirus in March, it has closed borders to travelers, and suspended schools, public transport, and group activities.
While many sectors of the economy continue, authorities have asked residents to otherwise only leave their homes for essential tasks like shopping for food.
With less than 1,600 cases confirmed and 64 deaths, Cuba's leaders have said their approach appears to be working, but have warned the peak of the outbreak is still ahead.

1021,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",Taliban step up attacks on Afghan forces since signing U.S. deal: data,"By Hamid Shalizi, Abdul Qadir Sediqi and Rupam Jain
KABUL/MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Taliban have mounted more than 4,500 attacks in Afghanistan, marking a sharp escalation in violence, in the 45 days since signing a deal with the United States that paves the way for a U.S. troop drawdown, according to data seen by Reuters.
Two sets of data, one from a Western military source and one from an independent body, both show attacks by the hardline Islamist group up by more than 70 percent between March 1 and April 15 compared to the same period a year ago. 
Separately, Afghan government data indicates that more than 900 Afghan local and national forces were killed during that same period, up from about 520 a year earlier.
Meanwhile, Taliban casualties fell to 610 in the period, down from roughly 1,660 a year ago, as U.S. and Afghan forces have reduced the number of offensive attacks and air strikes following the U.S.-Taliban accord. 
Senior western, Afghan and independent officials tracking the ground situation say that the increase in attacks shows the insurgent group's wilful disregard of a pledge to reduce violence made as part of the accord signed in late February.
The violence in the war-damaged nation has coincided with the rapid spread of the coronavirus infection.
The four provinces that have reported the highest number of cases of the infection have also been the ones hit by the most by Taliban violence in recent weeks, according to the two data sets and at least three senior Afghan and western officials.
As of May 1, Afghanistan has reported over 2,335 coronavirus cases and 68 deaths, but international observers believe numbers could be much higher, give the lack of testing.
""Taliban fighters are not hitting large government centres or cities, they are focusing on villages in Herat, Kabul, Kandahar and Balkh provinces that have reported the highest number of coronavirus cases,"" said a senior Western security official on condition of anonymity.
""A MATTER OF TIME""
Western security officials, diplomats and international observers said the Taliban's strategy to slowly erode government control of rural areas and then position themselves to besiege cities during the pandemic could derail the peace deal.
""They are slowly encircling all of Afghanistan's major cities,"" said Jonathan Schroden, an expert with the Center for Naval Analyses who has provided assessments on the security situation in Afghanistan to the U.S. military and Congress.
""So it's either a matter of time before they get a deal satisfactory to them or they put those major cities under siege.""
Two Taliban spokesman said the group was not responsible for a majority of the attacks in recent weeks. They accused the United States of jeopardising the peace agreement by supporting Afghan security forces and not releasing 5,000 Taliban prisoners as part of a prisoner swap stipulated under the accord.
The Taliban say the group's attacks between the start of March and April 15 fell 54.7% compared to a year ago to 537.
The group said its attacks were not ""as intense"" compared to the previous year and Afghan security forces members killed fell 54.2% to 935 while the number wounded fell 55.9% to 742.
The Defence Ministry said army troops were in ""active defence mode"" and using the air force to stop Taliban advances.
On Friday, clashes between Taliban fighters and Afghan forces intensified in northern Balkh and southern Logar province as warring sides fought to control checkpoints. Dozens of Afghan securitymen and Taliban fighters were killed.
Last month, General Scott Miller, commander of U.S. forces and the NATO-led non-combat Resolute Support mission in Afghanistan, travelled to Qatar amid the pandemic to meet Taliban political leaders.
Security officials said Miller issued a ""stern warning"" to stop operations against Afghan forces and adhere to pledges under the accord aimed at ending nearly two decades of war. 
Some of the attacks included four cases in which Taliban fighters allegedly used insiders to poison food eaten by Afghan forces at checkpoints in the north. Those checkpoints were now manned by Taliban fighters, Western security officials said.
Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said he was aware of recent insider attacks in which several Afghan force members were poisoned to death, but denied the group was responsible and said recent violence at checkpoints involved Afghan forces attacking civilians.

He added, however, that the Taliban did not deny using infiltrators or causing insider attacks as part of its war strategy.

ROME (Reuters) - Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte apologised on Friday to millions of struggling Italians who have yet to receive long-promised financial aid meant to help them get through the coronavirus crisis.
Italy has introduced some of the world's toughest lockdown measures in an effort to halt the epidemic, which has killed almost 28,000 people in the country so far. It has shuttered businesses around the country and leaving many people without any regular income. 
The government has launched various schemes aimed at supporting struggling families and companies, but weeks after some measures were unveiled the funds have yet to arrive in people's bank accounts.
""There have been, and still are, some delays in the sums being disbursed,"" Conte wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), acknowledging that funding mechanisms were proving ""complicated"".
""I apologise on behalf of the government and I assure you that we will continue to press for payments and funding to be completed as soon as possible,"" he added.
One of the biggest problems has emerged with a 3.3 billion euro ($3.6 billion) fund earmarked for employees furloughed by small companies after the lockdown came into force in March.
The government predicted 2.3 million people would sign up for it and said it would pay out on all claims by the end of April. However, Reuters reported on Wednesday that as of April 27, just 29,000 workers had received cash.
Furloughed workers at medium-sized and large firms are covered by a separate programme for temporary layoffs. Some 7.7 million employees have been placed on the scheme and while only 2.7 million had received payouts by mid-week, the government said the rest of the money was in the pipeline.
Officials said excessive bureaucracy was partly to blame for the problems, but they also noted that some regions had proved much more efficient at processing claims than others.
Authorities are due to start rolling back the coronavirus restrictions from Monday, with factories and production lines reopening. Conte said this would enable four million people to go back to work and start reviving the stalled economy.
However, political opponents and business leaders have said the rollback is too timid. Shops are expected to reopen only after May 18 and bars, restaurants and hairdressers are due to remain shuttered until June.
Conte said strict safety protocols were needed to prevent a resurgence of the virus, but added he was listening carefully to what ordinary Italians were telling him.

""I will not pretend that I have not heard your advice, your pressure, your anger, your anguish. They do not fall into a void,"" he said.

The Treasury Department said in a statement that Amir Dianat has supported Quds Force smuggling operations for years, including efforts aimed at shipping weapons including missiles and at smuggling shipments from Iran to Yemen.
The sanctions freeze any U.S.-held assets of Dianat or his company Taif Mining Services, which the U.S. Treasury Department alleged was a front company for the Quds Force, and generally bar Americans from dealing with them.
In addition to the Treasury Department's blacklisting of Dianat, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia filed criminal charges against him and one of his business associates for violations of sanctions and money laundering laws.
The office also filed a related action alleging that $12 million is subject to forfeiture as funds involved in the crimes and as assets of a foreign terrorist organization, the Treasury Department said.
""The Iranian regime and its supporters continue to prioritize the funding of international terrorist organizations over the health and well-being of the Iranian people,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement. 

Tensions between Washington and Tehran have spiked since Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.

The partnership will strengthen primary health care in 10 African countries by scaling up financing to ensure essential supply chains, including of personal protective equipment and diagnostics, the two bodies said.
The EIB, the long-term lending institution of the European Union, said the tie-up would help governments in low and middle-income countries to finance and secure access to essential medical supplies and protective equipment through centralised procurement.
While the bank has said it plans a 1.4 billion euro response to address the health, social and economic impact of COVID-19 in Africa, it gave no details on how much funding it would put behind the WHO partnership.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the tie-up would ""contribute to a more effective response to COVID-19 and other pressing health challenges.""

NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India said on Friday it would extend its nationwide coronavirus lockdown for another two weeks after May 4, but would allow ""considerable relaxations"" in lower-risk districts marked as green and orange zones.
Some activities will remain prohibited throughout the country, regardless of the zone, the ministry of home affairs said in a statement.
Those include travel by air, rail and metro and inter-state movement of people by road; and schools and colleges, hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, cinema halls and places of worship will remain closed.
There will be no restriction on movement of goods between states and on the manufacturing and distribution of essential items, the ministry said. 
Authorities are trying to chart a path out of the world's biggest lockdown, which they credit with preventing an exponential surge in infections and which Prime Minister Narendra Modi imposed on March 25.
Authorities have mapped the country into red, orange and green zones, depending on the severity of the outbreak. Health Secretary Preeti Sudan detailed the plan in a letter to regional officials that was seen by Reuters.
The biggest and most economically-important cities, including New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai and Ahmedabad, would all be classed as red zones, infection hotspots, and kept under strict lockdown.
To qualify as a green zone, eligible for quicker lifting of restrictions, an area would have had to report no new infections for three weeks. The classifications would be ""dynamic"" and updated at least weekly as conditions change, Sudan wrote.
India has reported more than 35,000 cases and 1,147 confirmed deaths from the virus. The true extent of infection may be higher in a country where millions of people do not have access to sufficient healthcare. 
The shutdown has pummelled India's economy, depriving millions of day labourers of income and stranding rural migrants in cities where they can no longer afford rent or food.

The government issued an order on Friday to provide special trains for stranded migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists and students to return home.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia on Friday detained hundreds of refugees and migrant workers for illegally living in the country, rights groups said, at a time of movement and travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
There has been growing public anger in recent days over the presence of migrant foreigners with some in Malaysia accusing them of spreading the coronavirus and being a burden on government resources.
Malaysia has around 2 million registered foreign workers but authorities estimate many more are living in the Southeast Asian country without proper documents. Malaysia does not formally recognise refugees, regarding them as illegal migrants. 
The arrests followed immigration raids in a neighbourhood in capital Kuala Lumpur where thousands of migrant workers and refugees live, according to human rights groups and photos shared on social media.
Human Rights Watch and the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network said over 700 migrants were taken into custody including young children. Rohingya refugees from Myanmar were among those detained, other rights groups said.
Malaysian police and the immigration department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said a ""small number of asylum seekers"" had been detained and it had informed by authorities that refugees and asylum-seekers were being held for the purpose of identity verification.
A Malaysian official who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity said the foreign workers, mostly from South Asia, were detained because they did not have the necessary permits and that more raids would be conducted in the coming days. 
Rachel Tan, programme officer at the Asia Pacific Refugee Rights Network, said the arrests were a ""criminalisation of a people who toil in difficult and dangerous work conditions"". 
The neighbourhood where the raids took place was close to an area with three buildings that had been placed under strict lockdowns last month after a surge in coronavirus cases there. 
Around 9,000 people live in the buildings, most of whom are foreign nationals, and 235 of them have tested positive for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, the government has said. 
Malaysia has reported a total of 6,071 coronavirus cases and 103 deaths, and its prime minister said on Friday that most businesses will reopen from Monday following six-week long curbs that have caused a damaging economic slowdown.
Photos shared on social media showed dozens of migrant workers lined up in close quarters as authorities watched from the sidewalk. Some officials were seen wearing full protective equipment, while the migrant workers only had masks on. 
Other photos seen by Reuters showed dozens of migrants packed in trucks that typically carry illegal foreign nationals to immigration detention centres, which are known to be cramped and unhygienic. 
""This is not at all humane,"" rights advocate Tan said. ""Even innocent children and babies were being dragged onto the trucks like cattle.""

Migrant workers have been a particularly vulnerable community during the pandemic. In neighbouring Singapore, thousands of infections have been linked to migrant worker dormitories.

1028,By Reuters,"<span>May 01, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Maya villages in Guatemala spurn U.S. deportees as infections spike,"By Sofia Menchu
QUETZALTENANGO, Guatemala (Reuters) - Guatemala's indigenous Maya towns are spurning returned migrants, threatening some with burning their homes or lynching as fear spreads about more than 100 deportees from the United States who tested positive for the new coronavirus.
In one city in the Guatemalan highlands, home to a large indigenous population, residents tried to burn down a migrant shelter. In some villages, locals are rebuffing the recently returned and threatening relatives of the deportees with expulsion from their homes. 
To date, Guatemalan health officials have said that nearly one fifth of the 585 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Central American country can be traced to people deported from the United States, most of them on two flights in a single day. 
That has fueled an angry backlash against migrants as they make their way home.
Carlos Cumes, an 19-year-old whose American dream ended a few weeks ago with his deportation, saw his luck sour again when he returned to the village of Santa Catarina Palopo, hoping to reunite with his family. The village, on the shore of the volcanic Lake Atitlan, is a center for the Kaqchikel Maya whose women wear traditional blue and purple dress.
Walking the final leg to his parents' home, Cumes was confronted by an angry group of locals who had seen televised footage of him being transported toward the village in an ambulance earlier in the day.
He was showered with insults and accused of bringing the disease with him, despite having undergone four days of medical observations in the capital and carrying a document from the health ministry pronouncing him symptom-free of coronavirus. 
But none of that allayed the mob's worst fears.
""They threatened to set my family on fire,"" said Cumes. ""I was really afraid and I could only think about leaving the village so that I wouldn't cause any more trouble."" 
""If I had stayed, they would have burnt my house down and who knows what else,"" Cumes said in a telephone interview from Guatemala City, where he is observing a mandatory 15-day period of isolation.
Some of his own relatives, he said, also turned their back on him.
Biting poverty has made Guatemala one of the main sources of migrants to the United States in recent years, along with neighboring El Salvador and Honduras. 
The confirmation by President Alejandro Giammattei that 103 Guatemalans deported from the United States on three flights since late March have tested positive for the virus has fostered popular anxiety and the volatile mood in the impoverished highlands, home to many migrants.
Mob justice is not uncommon in the mostly indigenous region and although Guatemala suspended the flights from the United States in response to the infections, deportations from Mexico continue apace, stoking residents' fears.
The U.S. Immigration and Enforcement Agency (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) has said deportees were screened before the flights for elevated temperatures and symptoms associated with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Yet migrants returned by the United States to Colombia, Mexico, Haiti and Jamaica have also tested positive for the virus in recent weeks, raising broader concerns over the deportation program. 
Steady pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump could see the U.S. flights to Guatemala restored, after U.S. authorities agreed to start testing some deportees for the virus. The United States has sent three ""humanitarian"" flights carrying children since Guatemala imposed its ban.
While until recently Guatemalans looked favorably on migrants, due in part to the vital remittances they provide to many families, fear of them has grown dramatically in just a short time.
""Only a few months ago, most people were very happy (with migrants) because they came bringing remittance checks, but now they treat them like criminals,"" Giammattei said in a national broadcast on April 19.
'MAKE THEM LEAVE!'
This month, in the highland capital of Quetzaltenango, a couple of buses carrying 80 migrants deported from Mexico had barely arrived at a make-shift shelter when a rumor began circulating that some sick migrants had fled the shelter and were at large in the community.
Upset residents descended upon the shelter demanding that the deportees be taken away, and the local governor rushed to the scene in an effort to ease the tension. 
He publicly confirmed all the deportees had been accounted for and none were on the loose.
The crowd, nonetheless, continued to shout: ""Make them leave!""
""'Mr. Governor, think about our kids,'"" Governor Julio Queme recalled the residents pleading, speaking to Reuters in a later interview. He said some of the outraged locals were brandishing sticks.
Still others threatened to burn down the shelter, and only dispersed after Queme warned they could be detained for violating Guatemala's curfew, which starts at 6:00 p.m.
But the worry remains among many that returned migrants will infect more locals unless aggressive measures are taken. 
""It's scary if any migrants were to escape (the shelter) or if the people who work there were to get infected and go back to their homes and infect everyone else,"" said Roberto Gomez, a 60-year-old local who says he rarely leaves home due to the risk of contracting the coronavirus.
In another nearby, mostly Maya town called Paxtoca, local officials have prohibited the entry of deported migrants, after a neighboring village last month saw two deportees returned from the United States who later tested positive for coronavirus.
""This decision was made to protect the health of all our neighbors,"" said Paxtoca Mayor Santiago Perez.
Prior to the pandemic, many deported Guatemalans could expect to be welcomed back home by balloon-toting family members at an air force base in the capital where most would arrive.
Today, that scene is a distant memory.
""I don't know if I should go back to my village or not,"" said Cumes, who celebrated his birthday on Friday and added that he has faithfully complied with his mandatory isolation.

""I'm really scared,"" he said. ""I'm confused and I don't know what to do.""

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain closed a giant temporary hospital in Madrid that had become a symbol of its fight against the coronavirus pandemic on Friday and people prepared to emerge from their homes for walks in the street after seven weeks of strict lockdown.
The developments showed that Spain was pulling out of the crisis that has now claimed the lives of 24,824 people. The death toll rose by 281 overnight, according to the health ministry, a small rise from the previous day but still one of the lowest daily tolls in weeks.
But the economic cost was adding up. Economy Minister Nadia Calvino on Friday announced a forecast of a record fall in Spain's gross domestic product (GDP) of 9.2% in 2020 - greater than during the country's Great Recession of 2008-2013.
Spain has been one the countries worst hit by the pandemic that spread across the globe from China since December.
However, the pandemic's decline in Spain has drastically reduced the number of people admitted to hospitals - 732 new patients, according to the latest data - and authorities on Friday closed down the temporary facility set up at Madrid's Ifema exhibition centre.
""I thank the whole centre, from the cleaning staff to the top, they have been loving, kind to us, a human warmth,"" said 73-old Patrocinio Gonzalez Dorado, as she left the compound wearing a protective mask decorated with paper lips.
""We haven't had family here and they have served as family and support,"" said Gonzalez, who had been there since April 7.
The hospital, with 1,350 beds, was Spain's largest during the outbreak and a symbol of the nation's struggle. It treated about 4,000 patients, and will remain equipped and ready to reopen in the event of a new outbreak.
Another patient leaving the centre in a wheelchair was applauded by health personnel while a singer sang the ""Nessun Dorma"" aria from the opera ""Turandot"".
However, dozens of health workers staged a protest when Madrid regional president Isabel Díaz Ayuso came to officially close the facility, demanding more tests and better protective equipment. Data shows that 41,239 health workers have tested positive for COVID-19 so far.
Unable to protest in the streets in the traditional Labour Day rallies were Spanish trade unions, prevented from gathering for the first time since the right to demonstrate was legalised in Spain in 1978.
Adapting to the restrictions, the unions called for virtual rallies on social media, demanding labour rights as potentially the worst economic crisis in Spanish history and a huge surge of unemployment loomed.
Economy Minister Calvino forecast a record fall in GDP of 9.2% in 2020 but said a projected recovery in 2021 with a 6.8% increase was expected. Unemployment for 2020 was forecast to rise to 19%, easing to 17.2% in 2021. 
SPANISH STROLL 
On Saturday Spaniards will be able to go out for the first time since March 15 to walk or play individual sports, putting an end to one of the strictest confinements in all of Europe.
Children were able to go out for the first time in six weeks on previous Sunday, with families gathering in parks and seaside walks.
To avoid overcrowding, the government has implemented a shift system for going out to the street by age groups.
From Saturday, people will be allowed to take short walks and play sports from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. Between midday and 7 p.m. will be reserved for young children, with the remaining slots set aside for elderly and vulnerable people.
The outings are part of a phase-out plan that from Monday will also allow some businesses to reopen and more relief measures for some small islands of the Canaries and Balearic archipelagos.
Meticulous hygiene and social distancing will still be of paramount importance.

Beaches and hotels lie empty in a tourism sector that is one of the biggest contributors to the economy. Another driver, construction and real estate, is at a standstill after only just recovering from the 2008 financial crisis.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron warned on Friday that the end of the national lockdown on May 11 would only be a first step as France looks to pull out of the crisis created by the outbreak of the coronavirus.
Traditional Labour Day protests that usually see thousands of demonstrators on streets were cancelled this year due to the virus outbreak that has killed 24,000 people across France. 
""May 11 will not be the passage to normal life. There will be a recovery that will need to be reorganised,"" Macron said in a speech at the presidential palace after a meeting with horticulturists. ""There will be several phases and May 11 will be one of them."" 
Unions organised online activities for labour day, asked people to bang pans and put out banners on their balconies to mark the day. Police disbanded a small protest in central Paris. 
It was in stark contrast to this time last year when tens of thousands of labour union and ""yellow vest"" protesters were on the streets across France demonstrating against Macron's policies.
The protests were marred after dozens of masked and hooded anarchists clashed with riot police.
Macron, in a message on his Twitter account, lauded the traditional parades and French workers, urging unity and solidarity during these tough times.
But highlighting the rocky path ahead, union officials and far-right opposition leader Marine Le Pen were quick to underscore their concerns amid the crisis.
""Even if today we are confined, our demands are not,"" Yves Veyrier, head of the Force Ouvriere union, told France Inter radio.
Le Pen pressed ahead with her party's annual May 1 tradition of honouring mediaeval heroine Joan of Arc by laying a wreath at the golden statue of the 15th century warrior in central Paris, despite the lockdown.
""I've never said I had doubts about the confinement. I just said that complete confinement was the solution when we failed to prevent the epidemic,"" Le Pen, wearing a mask, told reporters.
""A successful end to the lockdown is with tests for everybody, masks for everybody and I am opposed to schools opening before September."" 
From May 11, schools will gradually reopen and businesses will be free to resume operations after the country's 67 million population has been in confinement since mid-March.
The government has said it is prepared to slow or delay the unwinding of the lockdown if the virus infection rate spikes markedly higher, with administrative departments divided into 'red' and 'green' zones.
Opposition lawmakers and some experts have questioned the practicalities of schools reopening, the broad use of public transport and the tough measures that will continue to impact areas less affected by the virus.

Question marks have also been raised about the government's ability to reach its target of 700,000 COVID-19 tests by May 11, their implementation and the possible isolation of people who tested positive for the illness.

""We found that her investigation has no balance and was biased,"" government spokesman Zaw Htay told a press conference on Friday.
Yanghee Lee, special rapporteur for human rights in Myanmar, said in her final statement on Wednesday the army was engaged in activities against rebels that may amount to “war crimes and crimes against humanity” in Rakhine and Chin states.
She said the basis for her conclusion was that the armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, have ramped up attacks against civilians in recent weeks with air and artillery strikes.
Dozens have died and tens of thousands been displaced in the region in recent weeks.
Two military spokesmen did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment, but the army has denied targeting civilians.
Addressing the media on Friday, Zaw Htay said that troops from the Arakan Army, an insurgent group that wants greater autonomy for the western region, dress as civilians when they carry out attacks.
""When the military responds with counter-attacks to those who pretend as civilians, there is collateral damage,"" he said. ""There is no intention. From the military side, they have done the necessary investigations.""
The Arakan Army did not immediately publish a statement in response.
Zaw Htay also said the group was responsible for attacking a World Health Organization vehicle in late April, killing the driver. The Arakan Army has blamed that attack on the army.

The government has formed an investigative committee to probe the incident.

LONDON (Reuters) - London's High Court on Friday threw out part of a claim brought by Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, against a tabloid newspaper for breaching her privacy.
Meghan, wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers over articles its Mail on Sunday newspaper printed in February last year which included parts of a letter she had sent to her father, Thomas Markle.
At a hearing last week, the paper's lawyer argued that allegations it had acted dishonestly and had stoked the family rift should be removed from the case along with references to other articles about the royal which Meghan says were false.
""I agree that all three categories of allegation should be struck out of the Particulars of Claim,"" judge Mark Warby said in his ruling.
Lawyers for the duchess say the publication of her letter by the paper was a misuse of private information and breached her copyright. They are seeking aggravated damages.
As part of the claim, they had accused the Mail and other tabloids of harassing, humiliating and manipulating Thomas Markle, and contributing towards a fallout between him and his daughter. The two have not spoken since her glitzy wedding to Harry in May 2018.
The paper rejected the allegation it had acted dishonestly or maliciously by publishing extracts of the letter she sent her father in August 2018 and said it was ""remarkable"" the claim about the treatment of Markle had been made without the duchess having contacted him to see if he agreed.
""Today’s ruling makes very clear that the core elements of this case do not change and will continue to move forward,"" said a spokesman for Schillings, Meghan's law firm.
He added: ""The Duchess’ rights were violated; the legal boundaries around privacy were crossed. As part of this process, the extremes to which The Mail on Sunday used distortive, manipulative, and dishonest tactics to target The Duchess of Sussex have been put on full display."" 
Meghan and Harry are now living in the Los Angeles area having stepped down from their royal roles at the end of March.

German police on Thursday raided mosque associations alleged to be close to Hezbollah and banned all the group’s activity on its soil after designating it a terrorist organisation, a much-anticipated step long urged by Israel and the United States.
“It appears that certain countries in Europe are adopting their stances without considering the realities in the West Asia region and by paying regard only to the objectives of the propaganda machine of the Zionist regime and the confused U.S. regime,” Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Musavi said in a statement late on Thursday.
He criticised the German government for accusing Hezbollah “of promoting armed struggle with terrorist means.” He said the group was “an official and legitimate” member of the Lebanese government and parliament and a force of “political stability.”
According to the German Interior Ministry, the ban means that Hezbollah symbols cannot be shown at gatherings and in publications or in the media and Hezbollah assets can be seized. Because it is a foreign organisation, it is not possible to ban and dissolve it, the ministry said in a statement.
Israel, which with the United States had been pushing Germany to ban the group, praised the move. Israel urged other European Union countries to take similar action.
The EU classifies Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group, but not its political wing. Britain introduced legislation in February of last year, before it left the EU, that classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.

The army said in a statement released on state television there were civilian losses without elaborating on details.
The U.K. based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Israeli strikes on a military base run by Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah, which lies on the Homs-Palmyra road, caused the series of blasts.
The war monitor echoed reports by residents of the area that the sounds of the explosions were heard across Homs city.
The attack follows overnight strikes by Israeli helicopters from the Israeli occupied Golan Heights on Iranian bases in southern Syria, according to the monitor and intelligence sources.
Syria announced after midnight Israel had attacked, but did not elaborate on the targets in Quneitra province. It rarely says Iranian bases are hit [L8N2CIC2A].
Israel in recent years has launched hundreds of attacks on Iranian-backed militias and their bases in Syria, where they have a large presence across the country.
Israel was stepping up its raids in Syria at a time when world attention and the region, including Syria, was distracted with tackling the new coronavirus, a regional intelligence source said.

(Reuters) - The winking airport slot machines that tell visitors they have arrived in Nevada's Sin City are turned off and wrapped in police tape; the famed Las Vegas Strip is so empty a group of bicyclists zooms down the middle on a Friday night.
Shutting down the businesses that make Las Vegas a multibillion-dollar gambling and entertainment hub has dealt a crushing blow to the state and idled tens of thousands of workers. 
But with a dozen members dead and others sickened, the powerful union representing Las Vegas' bartenders and casino employees, Culinary Workers, is not pushing for a fast-reopening. 
Instead the union, which is influential with Democratic politicians who lead the swing state, is negotiating hard for safety measures and paid leave for workers sidelined by the virus. 
""If I go back too early, I won't be able to be alive to work,"" said Olee Stewart, 59, a cook at Harrah's Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, who is a member of the union. ""When it's safe for everyone, I think we should go back.""
The high-stakes negotiations between the 60,000-member Culinary Workers Local 226 and Nevada's storied casinos echo talks taking place across the United States, as businesses, politicians and workers scramble to find a safe way to save lives without further destroying the U.S. economy.
The Culinary Workers union is asking casinos to pay employees who are idled by the pandemic and provide six months' worth of health coverage to those who are laid off, according to a list of eight negotiating points seen by Reuters.
The union is also asking for paid sick leave and quarantine time to those who are ill or exposed to the virus. It wants enhanced cleaning for the casinos and training for employees who will have to use harsh chemical cleaners to sanitize gaming areas, guest rooms, kitchens and other areas.
""It's a very, very tough situation for these workers,"" said Geoconda Arguello-Kline, secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers local. ""They have fears of losing a family member, the fear of getting sick and over that you have to be worried about getting your bills paid."" 
Arguello-Kline stopped short of threatening employee walkouts that could disrupt reopening plans. 
The discussions in Las Vegas will likely leave the gambling hub - as with many parts of the country - a different place than before the virus hit, with Plexiglass separating dealers and players, and waiters possibly donning masks in restaurants. 
MEATPACKERS AND AUTOWORKERS
The tension between companies' need to reopen shuttered plants and union concerns about safety are also playing out in other industries.
President Donald Trump this week ordered meat-processing plants to stay open to protect food supplies, despite concerns about coronavirus outbreaks, drawing a backlash from unions that said at-risk workers required more protection.
 Ford Motor Co  (N:F) on Thursday outlined safety measures to restart U.S. plants, following similar efforts by General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) to convince leaders of the United Auto Workers union to send members back to work.
Public health experts say it is far too soon to allow the kinds of mass gatherings that happen in a place like Las Vegas, where tourists jam casinos, restaurants and even the sidewalks. But the economic devastation wrought by public health orders closing businesses and forcing residents to shelter at home is also a powerful incentive to loosen the orders.
In Nevada, nearly 350,000 people have filed for unemployment benefits since the shutdowns began - a quarter of the state's workforce, said Stephen Miller, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 
The shutdowns and slow return of tourism after the casinos reopen could lead to losses of 20% of the Las Vegas metropolitan area's gross domestic product, or more than $20 billion, Miller said.
Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak has said casinos will likely not be allowed to welcome guests until the third or fourth phase of reopenings - which could be months away. 
CASINOS PAYING WORKERS
One unionized company, Wynn Resorts (O:WYNN), has agreed to its union's request to pay workers while the casinos are closed, the company confirmed. 
A non-union company, billionaire Sheldon Adelson's  Las Vegas Sands  Corp (N:LVS), is also paying idled workers, spending $65 million per month in wages and other fixed costs at the Venetian and the Palazzo, spokesman Ron Reese said.
But most others are not.
MGM Resorts International (N:MGM), which owns several unionized Las Vegas casino resorts including the MGM Grand and the Bellagio, paid workers for the first two weeks of the shutdown and has offered grants to employees to help pay for rent, groceries and utilities, the company said. In financial documents filed last week with federal regulators, the company said it was effectively generating no revenue from its properties and would cut planned capital expenditures in half. 
Sahara Las Vegas, another unionized property, is paying for employees' healthcare premiums during the shutdown and has set up a fund to help those experiencing hardship, General Manager Paul Hobson said.
Once the casinos do reopen, they may look very different. The Venetian is considering installing Plexiglass barriers to separate guests from clerks helping them check in to the hotel, Reese said. Likely plans also include spacing out chairs on the pool deck, limiting traffic in elevators and making hand sanitizer widely available, he said.
 Caesars Entertainment Corp  (O:CZR), which owns Caesars Palace, Harrah's and the Flamingo, would not comment on union negotiations, but said it would follow the lead of state officials about when to reopen. 
But Paula Larson-Schusster, a dealer and United Auto Workers member at the Flamingo, said plans to install Plexiglass barriers between dealers and players may not be enough.
Players will still have to shove their chips beneath the Plexiglass to play - and they are really dirty, she said.

""I've had people pick their nose and scratch their private parts and then they pick up the chips,"" she said. ""I've had people shoot NyQuil on the table because they've got the flu but since they're in Vegas they're going to play.""

Britain has been on lockdown since March 23 but on Thursday Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the country was now past the peak of the pandemic and promised to set out a plan next week on how it might start gradually easing restrictions to allow a return to normal life.
A survey by Ipsos Mori showed that more than 60% would be uncomfortable returning to bars and restaurants, using public transport or going to a large gathering such as a sporting event.
Over 40% would still be reluctant to go to the shops or send their children to school and over 30% would be worried about going to work or meeting friends.
The survey data found that the vast majority of Britons were complying with the lockdown not because they had been ordered to by the government but because they do not want to catch or spread the virus.
""This is very worrying indeed, and our research has shown the same, that people in the UK are particularly anxious about this and are reluctant to go out,"" David Spiegelhalter, a statistician at Cambridge University, told BBC Radio.
He said it was sensible for the old and vulnerable to protect themselves but that the risks were significantly lower for younger people.
""Many people are definitely over anxious about their chance of both getting the virus and the harm they might come to if they do get it,"" Spiegelhalter said. 
""As a rough rule of thumb if you get the virus your chance of dying is roughly about the same as you would have had this year anyway, and if you're not worried about dying this year you shouldn't be so worried about getting the virus.""
He said the government needed to educate the public, and classify the population into different risk categories.

""We do need to have some sort of campaign to encourage people who are very low risk to actually get out and start living again when we're able to,"" he said.

Police arrested the activists, including Democratic Party founder Martin Lee, 81, and millionaire publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, 71, on 18 April, in the biggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement since the outbreak of mass protests last year. 
Foreign governments and human rights groups condemned the arrests, with Britain's Foreign Office saying at the time that the right to peaceful protest was ""fundamental to Hong Kong's way of life"" and authorities should avoid ""actions that inflame tensions"". 
In its strongest response to the criticism so far, the Hong Kong government said the remarks by the United States, Britain and the European Parliament were ""totally unfounded and amounted to a serious intervention in Hong Kong's affairs"". 
""The allegation by some that those arrests amounted to an attack on Hong Kong's freedoms ... is absurd and can hardly stand the test of any law-abiding jurisdiction,"" a spokesman for the government said. 
Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" style of governance that grants it broad freedoms, including the right to protest and an independent judiciary, not seen in the mainland.
Critics say Beijing is increasingly encroaching on those freedoms, which the central government rejects.
The 15 activists were arrested on charges of organising and participating in anti-government protests last year that crippled parts of the city and posed the gravest popular challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus and measures adopted to curb its spread have seen a relative lull in protests this year, although smaller demonstrations have emerged in the past week amid renewed concerns over Beijing's tightening grip on the city. 
Fuelling those worries, questions have been raised in recent weeks over the role of Beijing's institutions overseeing the city's affairs - the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office and Liaison Office. 

The government said criticism over remarks by the offices ""only illustrates an ignorance of the constitutional order"" of Hong Kong.

LAGOS (Reuters) - With her school shut because of the coronavirus, Tolu Alagba kneels as she copies down class notes from a communal village chalkboard, the closest thing to online lessons on an island with no electricity, a boat ride from Nigeria's megacity Lagos. 
Like much of the world, Nigeria ordered schools shut in late March to curb the spread of the coronavirus. But while children in many countries have shifted to online lessons, that is all but impossible in most of Nigeria, where fewer than 8 percent of households have access to the internet.
In Tolu's small fishing community, a retired teacher has volunteered to teach around 20 children three times a week in sessions lasting two hours. Children unable to attend in person can copy out the notes by hand, posted on the chalkboard mounted in a communal veranda.
""I'm happy, a teacher brings us together to learn a few things,"" said Tolu, 13.
The pandemic, and the global shutdown of schools, is deepening educational disparities between rich and poor, both between countries and within them, said Ydo Yao, regional director in West Africa of UN education agency UNESCO. 
Wealthier Nigerian families have access to the internet, and schools in affluent areas offer some form of distance learning.
Kesiena Onoge, in the Ogudu suburb of Lagos, spends 5,000 naira ($14) each week on internet and electricity - a large sum in a country where most people live on less than $2 a day. It enables her to go online for up to two hours a day with her six-year-old daughter, Naomi. 
But even here, and despite the expense, the materials are far from what pupils in rich countries might expect. 
""Network generally is bad and slow, and then uploading or attaching the assignment is tough,"" said Onoge.
Nigeria has recorded more than 1,700 cases of the new coronavirus, resulting in 51 deaths. Although the president has announced a gradual and phased end to a lockdown in Lagos from Monday, no plans have been announced to reopen schools.
With online learning off limits to most children, authorities are hoping educational programming on older media such as television and radio can help.
Nigeria's states will provide lessons on radio and TV, on subjects ranging from English and maths to economics and chemistry, according to a tweet from the government on Thursday listing a timetable of programmes.
Nigeria has experience of searching for alternative ways to educate children. In the northeast, an insurgency by Boko Haram Islamist militants has kept some 10 million children aged 6-11 from attending school. Local broadcasters have been showing educational programmes on TV there for years.
""We need to multiply offline solutions,"" said Yao.
On her island, surrounded by children playing and laughing, Tolu says she is grateful for the makeshift classes that have replaced her school. ""I am happy about the lessons.""

Hairstylists will need to wear both a mask and a protective shield and manicurists and pedicurists must also wear gloves, Health Minister Adam Vojtech told a news conference. Their customers must keep two metres apart.
""When it comes to barbers and hairdressers, it is essential that operators have double respiratory protection,"" Vojtech said. ""So, in addition to the mask, there is also a protective shield.""
The central European nation of 10.7 million is cautiously opening up its economy amid signs the outbreak has come under control. Schools, shops and restaurants were shut down and a lockdown imposed in March.
The Czech Republic has reported a total of 7,689 cases and 237 deaths. On Thursday, it recorded 103 new cases, the first time since April 21 that daily new infections climbed above 100. Active cases have steadily declined.
The government said on Thursday it would allow the opening of cultural and sport events with up to 100 people as part of a next phase of relaxing restrictions, to start on May 11. That will also include shopping malls and larger shops.
At theatres, audience members must leave every other row empty and couples can sit together at cinemas but must be separated by a seat from others.
""It will not be possible to consume or sell any food, including drinks,"" Vojtech said, adding that masks need to stay on during the film. ""That means no popcorn.""
At restaurants with outdoor areas, customers not dining together must sit 1.5 metres apart but can remove their masks while eating and drinking. 
The government is hoping a system of tracing and testing contacts of infected people, newly boosted by an army of testers, mobile apps and location data from phones and payment card transactions, will be enough to contain any flare-ups without re-introducing blanket restrictions.

Stores of up to 2,500 square metres reopened Monday, and restaurants, pubs and hotels should open their doors on May 25 in the next reopening stage.

The protesters waved flags, chanted slogans and held banners reading ""No sacrifice for the bosses"". 
Movement restrictions, imposed in March as part of a nationwide lockdown, will be gradually eased in the coming months, starting on Monday. Some retail businesses, including hair salons and bookshops, will also open on Monday.
Most businesses have been hurt by the lockdown. The conservative government has promised to protect jobs in a country that has only just emerged from a decade-long debt crisis that wiped out a quarter of its economic output.

During holidays, some 100,000 visitors a day would traipse round the quaint stone-paved streets of Gubei Water Town, 110 kilometres (68 miles) northeast of Beijing. Its marketing manager reckoned on getting just a tenth of that number this year.
""People have concerns about the virus and are unwilling to travel long distances,"" said Guo Baorong. For a start, there will be no international tourists this time, he said, noting foreigners would normally make up around 15% of visitors.
About 70% of China's tourist attractions had reopened as of Thursday, according to China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, but all sites have had to cap visitors to 30% of designed capacity.
More sites, including the Forbidden City in Beijing, were set to reopen Friday.
Staff at the entrance to Gubei Water Town checked visitors' temperatures and health tracking codes. And inside, lines on the ground directed tourists to stand one meter apart and stores used ropes to keep crowds from forming. Like everywhere in China since the lockdowns were imposed to stem the epidemic, everyone wore masks.
Still, in places where tourists squeezed together as the streets narrowed, staff shouted at them to spread out.
Some tourists enjoyed the smaller crowds.
Xiao Chen, a 24-year-old student wearing traditional Chinese garb known as ""Hanfu"" came to Gubei to take pictures around ancient architecture.
""It's good to come out of the city. There was barely anyone in Gubei Water Town yesterday, and even today, it's not crowded,"" she said.

""We were not expecting that many people to come in,"" said Guo.

Four South Korean trekkers and three Nepali guides were hit by an avalanche an altitude of about 3,250 metres (10,662 feet)near the village Hinku, 150 km (90 miles) northwest of Kathmandu, on Jan. 17.
""Our rescuers dug two bodies out from the snow,"" army spokesman Bigyan Dev Pandey told Reuters. A helicopter has been despatched to bring the bodies from the remote area, he said.
Rescuers found the bodies of three South Koreans earlier this week, while those of two other guides were recovered in March and April.
The Himalayan region is popular with adventure tourists as it leads to the base camp of Mount Annapurna, the world's tenth highest mountain at 8,091 metres (26,545 feet), and is known for its spectacular beauty. 
Each year thousands of trekkers and climbers visit Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest, and where adventure tourism is a big source of income.
Nepal closed all climbing and trekking activities in the Himalayas in March as part of measures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he was confident the coronavirus may have originated in a Chinese virology lab, but declined to describe the evidence, ratcheting up tensions with Beijing over the origins of the deadly outbreak.
Trump did not mince words at a White House event on Thursday, when asked if he had seen evidence that gave him a ""high degree of confidence"" the virus came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
""Yes, yes I have,"" he said, declining to give specifics. ""I can't tell you that. I'm not allowed to tell you that.""
The Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology has dismissed the allegations, and other U.S. officials have downplayed their likelihood. Most experts believe the virus originated in a market selling wildlife in Wuhan and jumped from animals to people.
Trump has shown increasing frustration with China in recent weeks over the pandemic, which has cost tens of thousands of lives in the United States alone, sparked an economic contraction and threatened his chances of re-election in November.
The Republican president said previously his administration was trying to determine whether the coronavirus emanated from the Wuhan lab, following media reports it may have been artificially synthesized at a China state-backed laboratory or perhaps escaped from such a facility.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday it was not known whether the virus came from the lab.
""We don’t know if it came from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. We don’t know if it emanated from the wet market or yet some other place. We don’t know those answers,"" Pompeo said in an interview with Newsradio 1040. 
The spread of the coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, has contributed to a deepening rift between the Trump administration and China. Beijing has suggested the U.S. military might have brought the virus to China and Trump has said China failed to alert the world to the risks in a timely and transparent fashion.
Trump also said on Thursday it was possible that China either could not stop the spread of the coronavirus or let it spread. He declined to say whether he held Chinese President Xi Jinping responsible for what he feels is misinformation about the emergence of the coronavirus.
Trump said of China's efforts to get to the bottom of how the virus emerged: ""At least they seem to be trying to be somewhat transparent with us.""
""But we're going to find out. You'll be learning in the not-too-distant future. But it's a terrible thing that happened - whether they made a mistake or whether it started off as a mistake and then they made another one. Or did somebody do something on purpose?"" he said.

Trump told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that he was looking at different options in terms of consequences for Beijing over the virus. ""I can do a lot,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday ruled against a Trump administration attempt to withhold millions of dollars from so-called ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration enforcement.
The decision, by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago, upheld a pair of lower court rulings that blocked the administration from placing immigration-related conditions on law enforcement grants.
President Donald Trump, who faces reelection on Nov. 3, has made immigration a central theme of his presidency and 2020 campaign. He frequently criticizes Democrat-controlled ""sanctuary"" jurisdictions for policies that he says protect criminal immigrants.
The decision follows Trump's remarks on Wednesday that suggested he might restrict coronavirus aid to states and cities with ""sanctuary"" policies.
""If you're going to get aid to the cities and states for the kind of numbers you're talking about - billions of dollars - I don't think you should have sanctuary cities,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.
The appeals court said the ruling would be applied nationwide, although one judge on a three-judge panel that considered the matter said he would have narrowed the scope to the city of Chicago, which brought the lawsuit.

Federal appeals courts have issued divergent rulings over Trump's attempts to restrict funding to ""sanctuary"" cities, setting up a possible appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Israeli helicopters fired several rockets from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights on targets inside southern Syria, Syrian state media reported on Friday, the latest in what intelligence sources say is an increase of strikes against Iranian-backed militias. 
Opposition sources in the area said several militia posts near Quneitra were targeted in the attack, which reports said caused only material damage. 
There was no immediate comment from the Israeli army. 
Bases and convoys run by Lebanon's Iranian-backed Hezbollah militia, which has a strong presence in the Syrian Golan Heights, have been hit by Israel in recent years. 
Israel was stepping up its raids in Syria at a time when world attention and the region, including Syria, was distracted with tackling coronavirus, a regional intelligence source said. 
Two weeks ago, an Israeli drone attack targeted a car carrying forces from Hezbollah in southern Syria along the border with Lebanon without causing casualties. 
A few days later, Israel struck central Syria near the ancient city of Palmyra, in what regional intelligence sources said were Iranian-backed outposts and a command centre. 
Israel has acknowledged in recent years it had conducted many raids inside Syria since the start of the civil war in 2011. 
After Syria announced last Monday it had intercepted airstrikes by Israel near the capital Damascus, Israeli defence minister Naftali Bennett told Israeli media that Israel would step up its campaign against Iran in Syria. [L5N2CF05P]
Bennett appeared to confirm Israel was behind that airstrike on what Western intelligence sources said were Iranian bases.
""We have moved from blocking Iran’s entrenchment in Syria to forcing it out of there, and we will not stop,” Bennett said in a statement.
""We will not allow more strategic threats to grow just across our borders without taking action, We will continue to take the fight to the enemy’s territory,” Bennett said.
The Syrian army later said Monday's strike killed three Syrian civilians and injured several others from shrapnel that hit their homes.
Israel says Iran's military presence in Syria, where its militias are fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar al Assad's forces, is a strategic threat and claims Tehran seeks a permanent presence along its northern borders.
The threat of direct confrontation between arch-enemies Israel and Iran has long simmered in Syria, with Israel regarding Iran as its biggest threat.
Assad has said Iranian forces are welcome to stay in Syria after years of military victories in which Iran and Russian have played a key role in bringing back most of the country back under his control.

1051,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Most of U.S. House urges more diplomacy at U.N. to renew Iran arms embargo: sources,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nearly 90% of U.S. House of Representatives members have signed a letter urging the Trump administration to increase its diplomatic action at the United Nations to renew an arms embargo on Iran, congressional sources said on Thursday.
In a rare show of bipartisanship, at least 382 of the 429 members of the Democratic-controlled House - Democrats and Republicans - have signed the letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to work with U.S. allies and partners to extend the embargo, as well as U.N. travel restrictions on Iranians involved with arms proliferation.
""The U.N. arms embargo is set to expire in October, and we are concerned that the ban's expiration will lead to more states buying and selling weapons to and from Iran,"" said the letter, seen by Reuters and led by Representatives Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Mike McCaul, the committee's top Republican.
""We urge you to work with allies and like-minded partners, including through a new United Nations Security Council resolution, to extend these provisions in order to prevent Iran from buying and selling weapons, while also working to increase accountability for violations of the existing embargo,"" the letter said.
Congressional aides said signatures were still being collected, and the letter had not yet been sent to the State Department.
President Donald Trump's administration has been taking a harder line with the United Nations over its desire to extend and strengthen the embargo, threatening to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran as leverage to get backing from the 15-member Security Council. Diplomats said that tactic would lead to a tough, messy battle.
Washington has shared its strategy with Britain, France and Germany, which are council members and parties to the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that prevents Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief.
Brian Hook, the U.S. special representative for Iran, told a news conference on Thursday that the United States was ""hopeful"" the Security Council would extend the arms embargo. He also suggested that Washington did not plan to move ahead quickly with its push for the arms embargo extension.
Trump withdrew the United States from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, promising he would make a much better one than the pact agreed on by his predecessor, Democratic President Barack Obama.
That new and better deal has not yet materialized.
Trump's administration has pursued a ""maximum pressure"" campaign seeking to limit Tehran's weapons programs and influence across the Middle East, breaking with allies that have urged that sanctions be eased and economic aid allowed to help deal with the coronavirus pandemic.
""Maybe this can be the beginning of that better deal,"" a congressional aide said.

Authors of the letter hoped it would be a return to bipartisanship on U.S. dealings with Iran, after years of steep divisions between the two parties beginning with Obama's work on the landmark nuclear pact.

1052,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>",Trump says he could bring back fired ex-national security adviser Flynn,"By Jeff Mason
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would consider bringing his fired former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a key figure in the probe into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, back into his administration.
The president's comments, the latest in a string of remarks about Flynn, go beyond prior suggestions by Trump that the retired general could be in line for a presidential pardon. 
""I would certainly consider it, yeah. I think he's a fine man,"" Trump told reporters, without specifying which role he might give to Flynn. 
Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements in a charge brought by then-Special Counsel Robert Mueller. He is now insisting he did not lie and wants to back out of the plea.
Internal FBI documents turned over by the Justice Department on Wednesday showed FBI officials debated whether and when to warn Flynn that he could face criminal charges as they prepared for a January 2017 interview with him in the Russia probe.
Trump blamed Flynn's predicament on ""dirty cops"" and said the documents show Flynn was a victim.
""He's in the process of being exonerated. If you look at those notes from yesterday, that was total exoneration,"" Trump said.
Flynn left his White House position after only 24 days when he was found to have misled Vice President Mike Pence about his discussions with Russia's then-ambassador to the United States Sergei Kislyak. Trump said in 2017 that he fired Flynn because he had lied to Pence and the FBI.
Pence said during a trip to Indiana on Thursday that Flynn's actions may have been unintentional.
""I'm deeply troubled by the revelations of what appeared to have been investigative abuse by officials in the Justice Department. And we're going to continue to look into that very carefully,"" Pence said.

""My respect for General Flynn personally for his service to the country is undiminished. And I am inclined more than ever to believe that what he communicated to me back during the transition leading to our inauguration, that was unintentional and not - and that he was not attempting to misrepresent facts,"" he said.

Per capita deaths for people in Britain who had black Caribbean heritage were three times that for British citizens who are white, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said.
Per capita deaths among other black groups were double that of the population overall, while those of Indian descent also suffered more fatalities than average, the IFS said.
Taking into account the fact that most minority groups are much younger on average than the white British population, per capita death rates across almost all minority groups looked disproportionately high, it said in a report.
Part of the extra death rate could be explained by ethnic minorities' higher likelihood to live in London or other cities hit hard by the virus, but geography was not the only factor. 
""There is unlikely to be a single explanation here and different factors may be more important for different groups,"" Ross Warwick, a research economist at the IFS said.
""For instance, while Black Africans are particularly likely to be employed in key worker roles which might put them at risk, older Bangladeshis appear vulnerable on the basis of underlying health conditions.""
Data from the United States has shown African Americans are more likely to die from COVID-19, highlighting longstanding disparities in health and inequalities in access to medical care there.
The IFS said people from ethnic minorities in Britain were more likely to be hit financially by the coronavirus shutdown.
""Bangladeshi men are four times as likely as white British men to have jobs in shutdown industries, with Pakistani men nearly three times as likely,"" Lucinda Platt, a London School of Economics professor who sits on an IFS inequalities panel, said.

Household savings were lower than average among people of black African, black Caribbean or Bangladeshi descent. Those of Indian heritage and the largely foreign-born 'other white' group did not seem to be facing extra economic risks, the IFS added.

    Peru's supreme court accepted an appeal and ruled to revoke Fujimori's 15-month jail sentence, according to her lawyer, Giulliana Loza.
Fujimori will be released with ""restricted freedom,"" meaning she cannot leave Lima without prior authorization and must appear every 30 days at a judicial registry office, Loza said. 
Fujimori, the daughter of imprisoned former President Alberto Fujimori, has not been officially charged. Prosecutors accused her of taking money from Brazilian firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] to finance a presidential campaign while pretending it came from other sources.
In January, a judge ordered Fujumori's detention as prosecutors continued their investigation. She had previously spent 13 months in jail. 
    Fujimori could be released after Friday, which is a public holiday, Loza told radio channel RPP. 
    ""We hope to carry out the corresponding procedures post-holiday [Friday], complying with all the security protocols, especially bearing in mind that Keiko is within the vulnerable group for COVID-19,"" Loza said, referring to the spread of coronavirus within Peru's prisons. 

    The court also ruled to release from prison Susana Villaran, 70, the former mayor of the Peruvian capital Lima, who had been jailed over allegations of bribes from construction companies Odebrecht and OAS.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Democratic U.S. presidential nominee Joe Biden for the first time on Friday is set to personally address a former Senate aide's accusation that he sexually assaulted her in 1993 - a claim that his campaign has denied.
Biden is scheduled to be interviewed about the matter on the MSNBC program ""Morning Joe,"" the cable TV network said on Twitter on Thursday. Biden's campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the interview. His campaign has said the incident never occurred but he has remained silent about it.
Earlier on Wednesday, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrat in Congress, gave a forceful defense of Biden, highlighting the former vice president's long history of supporting policies to stop the abuse of women.
The interview plan comes after some fellow Democrats urged Biden, 77, to directly respond to the accusation. 
A California woman named Tara Reade, who worked as a staff assistant in Biden's U.S. Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993, has accused Biden in media interviews of pinning her against a wall in 1993, reaching under her skirt and pushing his fingers inside her.
Biden is set to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, 73, in the Nov. 3 U.S. election. Trump has been accused by more than a dozen women of sexual assault and misconduct over the years, allegations he and his aides have denied.
""I think he should respond,"" Trump said of Biden at a media briefing on Thursday. ""It could be false accusations. I know all about false accusations.""
Pelosi, who formally endorsed Biden for president on Monday, noted that staffers who ran Biden's Senate office have said they had no recollection of a sexual assault complaint.
""I have complete respect for the whole #MeToo movement,"" Pelosi said at a news conference. ""There is also due process and the fact that Joe Biden is Joe Biden.""
""He is the personification of hope and optimism and authenticity for our country - a person of great values,"" Pelosi added. 
Reuters has not been able to independently confirm Reade's accusation and also was unable to reach Reade or a representative for her for comment.
Several news outlets that have published Reade's account, including the  New York Times  (NYSE:NYT) and the Washington Post, have interviewed a friend who said Reade told her about the alleged assault at the time. Another friend told the Times that Reade told her in 2008 about a previous traumatic incident involving Biden. Reade's brother also confirmed parts of Reade's account to The Intercept and the Post.
On Monday, the Business Insider news website published an interview with a former neighbor who said Reade told her in the mid-1990s that Biden had put his fingers inside her.
Reade, 56, told media interviewers she complained at the time about sexual harassment, though not sexual assault, to three of Biden's Senate aides. The Biden campaign released a statement from one, Marianne Baker, who said she never received any report of inappropriate behavior in nearly 20 years of working for Biden.
The Post and Times interviewed the other two aides, both of whom told the newspapers they had no recollection of Reade's complaint.
Reade was one of eight women who last year came forward to say Biden had hugged, kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable, though none accused him of sexual assault. Reade publicly accused him of the assault on a podcast in March.
Some prominent Democratic women have stepped forward to defend Biden. Others have asked him to address the accusation.

""It can't appear that she's being ignored just because it's an inconvenient truth for certain people in the Democratic Party,"" said Nina Turner, who was national campaign co-chair for the presidential campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the race and endorsed Biden.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States is ""hopeful"" the U.N. Security Council will extend an arms embargo on Iran before it expires in October, a top U.S. State Department envoy said on Thursday, despite a key Russian official signaling that Moscow opposed such a move.
Brian Hook, the U.S. Special Representative for Iran, said the United States had drafted a Security Council resolution on the issue, which would need nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France to pass. 
Some diplomats say the United States would likely struggle to get Iranian allies Russia and China to allow an arms embargo extension. But Hook repeatedly disagreed during a news conference, saying: ""We are hopeful.""
""Russia and China have great equities in a peaceful and stable Middle East, and Iran's sectarian violence and its export of weapons is the principal driver of instability in the Middle East today,"" Hook said.
He also suggested that Washington did not plan to move ahead quickly with its push for the arms embargo extension.
""Our focus is on engaging in thoughtful and measured diplomacy with all the relevant parties to successfully negotiate a renewal of the U.N. arms embargo,"" he said. ""We're going to focus on that in the months ahead.""
Russia's Ambassador to International Organizations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, told Russia's Kommersant newspaper on Tuesday that Moscow was opposed to such a move. 
""They are well aware of our negative attitude towards this step and allegedly are working on a fall-back option,"" said Ulyanov, whose previous job was head of the nonproliferation and arms controls department at Russia's foreign ministry.
The fall-back option is for Washington to trigger a return of all U.N. sanctions on Iran if it fails to get the Security Council to extend the arms embargo - a strategy confirmed by a U.S. official on Monday. Diplomats said Washington faces a messy battle if it carries out that threat.
Washington has shared the strategy and an arms embargo draft with Britain, France and Germany, the U.S. official confirmed. Diplomats said the draft resolution has not been shared with the remaining 11 council members, including Russia and China.
The United States believes it could trigger a so-called snapback of all U.N. sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, using a process outlined in a the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that prevents Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief.
""Their reasoning is ludicrous,"" said Ulyanov.
It is a move likely to be challenged, diplomats said, because U.S. President Donald Trump quit the nuclear agreement in 2018 and described the accord from Barack Obama's presidency as ""the worst deal ever.""
Hook declined to elaborate on what other efforts Washington would deploy if the United States failed in its bid to get the arms embargo extended by the Security Council. 

""The arms embargo must be renewed and we will exercise all diplomatic options to accomplish that,"" he said.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has long promised to clamp down on firearms, citing a spike in gun crime.
Officials said the new measures - which will apply to about 125,000 weapons - had been in the works for months and were not directly prompted by a shooting rampage in Atlantic Canada earlier this month. [nL2N2CG2I9]
A gunman armed with weapons that included an assault rifle killed 22 people in Nova Scotia. Police said nine of the victims died in fires the man had set, while the rest were shot
The new ban will further tighten gun controls that are already stricter than those in the United States. The source, who requested anonymity given the sensitivity of the situation, said the announcement could come as soon as Friday.
""We have long been committed to strengthening gun control in this country, including banning military style-assault weapons,"" Trudeau told reporters on Thursday.
""There is no need in Canada for guns designed to kill the largest amount of people in the shortest amount of time,"" he added, saying an announcement would be made in the coming days.
The news was first reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. A spokeswoman for Public Safety Minister Bill Blair - who has overall responsibility for gun control - declined to comment. 
Among the weapons that will be outlawed are the AR-15, used by a gunman to kill 26 adults and children in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre in the United States, and the M4, M14 and M16 assault rifles.
Other weapons on the list include the Ruger Mini-14 rifle, used in a 1989 Montreal mass shooting in which 14 women were killed, as well as carbines such as the CZ Scorpion, Beretta CX4 Storm and Swiss Arms Classic Green.

The applause has become an emotional weekly ritual in Britain since it first took place on March 26, but Johnson had not been seen publicly taking part since before he was taken to hospital with a bad case of COVID-19 on April 5.
The 55-year-old prime minister spent three nights in intensive care, then convalesced for two weeks at his country residence and returned to work on Monday. 
He appeared on the doorstep of his Downing Street office, clapping and paying tribute to Moore, a World War Two veteran who has become a national hero after raising millions for the National Health Service (NHS) by walking in his garden.
""Tonight I proudly clapped outside 10 Downing Street for our fantastic NHS and carers. Thank you all for everything you are doing,"" Johnson said on Twitter shortly after the applause. 
His fiancee, Carrie Symonds, who gave birth to the couple's son on Wednesday in an NHS hospital, also paid tribute to key workers.
""Clapping again for our tremendous carers tonight and wishing hero Captain Tom Moore a very happy birthday,"" she wrote on Twitter.
""I also have another wonderful reason to thank the NHS this week too.""

He did not specify how many had been killed in the attack, which not immediately claimed by any group. Militants loyal to Islamic State are active in the strategic border region.
Egypt has been fighting Islamist insurgents who have killed hundreds of police and soldiers in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula since the ousting of Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 following mass protests against his rule.
Militants have also carried out attacks elsewhere in the country.
An Egyptian policeman and seven suspected militants were killed on April 14 in an exchange of gunfire after the ministry of interior received information about potential Easter attacks against Coptic Christians, the ministry said, adding that three other policemen had also been wounded.
The military and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in 2018, focusing on the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya.

1060,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",Many Trump nominations already were stalled. The pandemic has made it worse,"By Patricia Zengerle
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - By now, David Tryon had expected to be a two-year veteran at the Small Business Administration, an agency at the heart of the U.S. government's coronavirus relief effort as it disburses more than $650 billion in loans for struggling small companies.
But the Ohio attorney, nominated by President Donald Trump in October 2017 as the SBA's chief counsel for advocacy, has remained in limbo awaiting a Senate confirmation vote. In the meantime, the position - intended to advance the concerns of small businesses to the White House, Congress, federal courts and states - has remained without a Senate-confirmed occupant.
""There's so much discussion about how do we help small businesses survive in this environment,"" Tryon said in an interview. ""And this is exactly what the office of advocacy should be doing now."" 
The pandemic has worsened an extensive backlog in the Senate's consideration of Trump's nominees for a long list of top administration positions. Senators left Washington in March amid broad stay-at-home policies imposed in most of the country intended to slow the spread of the virus. They are not due to return until next week. 
The problem of important positions remaining unfilled can in part be blamed on partisan stalemates over nominees in the Senate, which is controlled by Trump's fellow Republicans. 
But Trump also has failed to send the Senate nominees for 166 of the 750 key administration positions requiring confirmation, far more than the 79 others who have been nominated but not yet confirmed, according to a tracker from the Washington Post and non-partisan Partnership for Public Service.
Many high-level executive branch posts have remained without a Senate-confirmed occupant, including homeland security secretary for a year and director of national intelligence since August.
Tryon said the position to which he was nominated is crucial as millions of small businesses - which employ more than half of private-sector U.S. workers - struggle to stay afloat, many shuttered as Americans stay home to avoid spreading the virus.
""This is so important for our economy right now, so important for all the people throughout the country that have been hoping to again be employed,"" Tryon added.
RULES CHANGED
There has been dysfunction surrounding nominations since Trump took office in 2017. [nL2N2C3303]
Republicans have accused Democrats of obstructing confirmation of nominees by insisting they be subject to hours of debate rather than quickly approved by voice vote. Democrats previously accused Republicans of obstructing confirmation of nominees made by Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama.
Republicans hold 53 seats in the 100-member Senate. Both parties have changed the chamber's rules in recent years to make it easier to confirm nominees.
Democrats, seeking to exert what limited power a minority party has in the Senate, have said many positions are too important to rush confirmation without a full vetting of a nominee. They also have said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Trump have not made executive branch appointments a priority.
McConnell, who blocked Senate consideration of an Obama Supreme Court nominee in 2016 so Trump could fill the vacancy, has made confirmation of conservative judicial nominees a top priority. The Senate has confirmed 193 federal judges nominated by Trump for lifetime appointments, moving the courts decidedly to the right.
Trump has touted his judicial appointments as he campaigns for re-election on Nov. 3. McConnell has called the Senate back to Washington on May 4 despite the city's stay-at-home order, promising to confirm more Trump-nominated judges.
Tryon, 61, was contacted about the SBA position in June 2017, and began wrapping up his 31-year law firm career after he was nominated that October. The Senate Small Business Committee held his confirmation hearing in February 2018 and sent his nomination to the full Senate in March 2018 on a 14-5 vote, with five Democrats voting no. The full Senate, however, has never held a confirmation vote.
Tryon said he believes he ultimately will be confirmed.

""President Trump has reaffirmed his commitment to me and his strong commitment to help small businesses,"" Tryon said. ""I expect that the Senate will recognize the critical importance of this confirmation for the recovery of small businesses that are facing unprecedented pressure today because of COVID-19,"" the respiratory illness caused by the virus.

DETROIT/LANSING, Mich. (Reuters) - Hundreds of protesters gathered at Michigan's state Capitol in Lansing on Thursday to protest Governor Gretchen Whitmer's request to extend the state of emergency to combat COVID-19, an appeal Republican lawmakers there have opposed. 
The protest appeared to be the largest in the state since April 15, when supporters and allies of President Donald Trump organized thousands of people for ""Operation Gridlock,"" jamming the streets of Lansing with their cars to call out what they said was the overreach of Whitmer's strict stay-at-home order.
That was one of the country's first major anti-lockdown rallies, and helped sparked a wave of similar events nationwide.
The slow reopening of state economies around the country has taken on political overtones, as Republican politicians and individuals affiliated with Trump's re-election promoted protests in electoral battleground states, such as Michigan.
Many people at Thursday's protest, including militia group members carrying firearms and people with pro-Trump signs, appeared to be ignoring state social-distancing guidelines as they clustered together within 6 feet of each other. Few people wore masks. 
""Governor Whitmer, and our state legislature, it's over with. Open this state,"" Mike Detmer, a Republican U.S. congressional candidate running for the state's 8th district spot held by Democrat Elissa Slotkin, told the crowd. ""Let's get businesses back open again. Let's make sure there are jobs to go back to."" 
Other speakers at the ""American Patriot Rally,"" which had different organizers than the mid-April protest, questioned the deadliness of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus. They also said Whitmer's stay-at-home order violated constitutional rights, and urged people to open their businesses on May 1 in disregard of her order. 
As the event began around 9 a.m. under steady rainfall, some protesters chanted ""USA"" and ""lock her up,"" referring to Whitmer, a Democrat, but alluding to a refrain often chanted at 2016 Trump rallies directed at Hillary Clinton.
'FREEDOM OF SPEECH'
State authorities have warned that protesters could be ticketed for violating social-distancing rules. The mayor of Lansing, Andy Schor, said in a statement on Wednesday that he was ""disappointed"" protesters would put themselves and others at risk, but recognized that Whitmer's order still allowed people to ""exercise their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.""
Whitmer has acknowledged that her order was the strictest in the country. Protesters, many from more rural, Trump-leaning parts of Michigan, have argued it has crippled the economy statewide even as the majority of deaths from the virus are centered on the southeastern Detroit metro area.
Many states, including Georgia, Oklahoma, Alaska, South Carolina and Ohio, have already moved to restart parts of their economies following weeks of mandatory lockdowns that have thrown nearly one in six American workers out of their jobs.
Organizers of the mid-April protest in Michigan took credit when Whitmer later in April rolled back some of the most controversial elements of her order, such as bans on people traveling to their other properties.
State legislative approval of Whitmer's state of emergency declaration, which gives her special executive powers, is set to expire after Thursday. 
She has asked for a 28-day extension, though Republican lawmakers in control of the statehouse who want to see a faster economic opening have signaled they could reject her request.
Regardless, Whitmer's stay-at-home order is set to continue through May 15, though she has said she could loosen restrictions as health experts determine new cases of COVID-19 are being successfully controlled.
On Wednesday, she said the construction industry could get back to work starting May 7. 

Public health authorities warn that increasing human interactions now without appropriate safety measures may spark a fresh surge of infections.

VILNIUS (Reuters) - A cargo airplane took off from Vilnius airport on Thursday, while just a few hundred meters away people watched a movie from their cars at a makeshift drive-in cinema on the airport tarmac.
Occupants of the some 160 vehicles were under strict instruction to keep their windows shut to prevent any spread of the novel coronavirus - but were delighted at a chance to watch Oscar-winning South Korean film Parasite on the cinema's opening night.
Some 3.8 million people flew through Vilnius airport last year, but all scheduled passenger flights ceased a month ago, as Lithuania went into lockdown to fight the virus.
Restaurants, concert halls and cinemas remain closed and Lithuanians are encouraged to stay at home. If they do go out they must wear a mask and cannot be in a group larger than two, if mixing with non-family members.
The government however this week allowed open-air cafes to reopen and some events, such as the drive-in cinema, to go ahead as the infection rate slowed. 
""Screening films at the airport was always my dream, but we've only got the opportunity now. The tarmac is too busy during normal operations"", said Algirdas Ramaska, who organised the cinema which runs for four weeks.
""The response was amazing, we are sold out for the next couple of days. People are very tired after staying at home for so long and they want to get out"".
The annual international film festival in Vilnius, due to take place in March, was cancelled due to the lockdown, and Ramaska says he hopes to keep the festival team employed by showing movies purchased for the event.
""It's really an amazing experience, watching a movie here - I have never been inside the airport in my car, only in a plane"", Egle Ribaciauskaite, 34, said.
At the screening, people were told to stay in their cars at all times and to drive outside of the airport if a toilet break was needed.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - One body has been recovered and five people are missing after a Canadian military helicopter crashed in the Mediterranean Sea (NYSE:SE) off the coast of Greece on Wednesday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday. 
The HMCS Fredericton, participating in NATO's Operation Reassurance meant to bolster security in Central and Eastern Europe, lost contact with a CH-148 Cyclone helicopter on Wednesday during a training exercise. 
""They are all heroes,"" Trudeau said in a news conference.
""The cause of this accident is unknown at this time,"" Defense Minister Harjit Sajjan said, adding that the aircraft's data and voice recorders have been recovered.
General Jonathan Vance, Chief of the Defence Staff, said that search efforts continued and that there was a ""very sizable debris field"" in an area of the Ionian Sea where the aircraft crashed.
Vance said the body that was recovered was that of Abbigail Cowbrough. Tanya Cowbrough, the mother of Abbigail, commented on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB): ""Nothing can replace her.""
""I am broken and gutted,"" Shane Cowbrough, Abbigail's father, wrote on Facebook. ""There are no words. You made me forever proud. I will love you always, and miss you in every moment. You are the bright light in my life taken far too soon.""
It would be the country's single deadliest military tragedy in 13 years if search efforts do not locate any survivors. In July 2007, six soldiers were killed together by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan.
After the crash, Canada's military put its Cyclone helicopters on an ""operational pause"", Vance said, until a ""fleet-wide"" problem can be ruled out. The Cyclone is made by  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT)'s Sikorsky unit. 
""I don't have concerns about the helicopter,"" Vance said. ""It's performed terrifically. It's got 9,000 hours on the fleet.""
Approximately 2,100 Canadian Armed Forces members are deployed around the world, and some 915 people are part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's Operation Assurance.

GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (Reuters) - Ecuadorean journalist Augusto Iturburu's could not visit him in the hospital during his two-week battle with coronavirus, and was unable to give him a traditional burial as the disease ravaged the country's largest city of Guayaquil.
The Iturburu family instead held a virtual ceremony this week to honor Augusto, thanks to an online service created in response to a pandemic that has overwhelmed the country's health services and at times left bodies in the streets for hours. 
""No member of our family could enter the cemetery to say goodbye to him,"" said Iturburu's brother Nelson in a telephone interview. ""So I thought it would be nice to participate in this memorial, so that everyone can remember my brother Augusto.""
Ecuadorean media company GK this week launched the service called ""Voices of Memory,"" which creates websites using photos of those who died and messages from friends and family, who will be able to visit the sites for several weeks.
The service is open to anyone in the country, said Maria Sol Borja, who is in charge of the project. But it has been principally used by families in Guayaquil, where the vast majority of cases and deaths have taken place.
Ecuador as of Thursday had reported 24,934 coronavirus infections and 900 deaths. Another 1,453 are suspected to have died of COVID-19.
But in the province of Guayas, where Guayaquil is located, the total number of deaths from all causes reached 13,000 in March and April, compared with around 4,000 in the same period in 2019, according to official data. 
The government in mid-March banned mass gatherings including religious ceremonies and vigils. Funeral homes are only authorized to transport bodies from morgues to cemeteries.
Families complain that they cannot obtain the remains of deceased relatives, and in some cases say they have received misidentified bodies. [L2N2CD08S]
Other simply receive a box of ashes from health authorities and feel they needed some type of farewell ceremony.
""We are processing all that is happening, it is new, it scares us, we do not understand it,"" said Gabriela Valarezo, 30, a graphic designer who lost her father-in-law to coronavirus. ""Losing someone and not being able to be near them is very hard.""

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo's president on Thursday sought to solve a political crisis by asking a nominee of the second biggest party to form a new government, but the effort to set up a new administration is likely to be challenged in the country's highest court.
President Hashim Thaci said he was giving the task to Avdullah Hoti, who served as finance minister between 2014 and 2017 and deputy prime minister in the government of caretaker Prime Minister Albin Kurti.
Thaci's move follows the dismissal of Kurti's government after less than two months in office, following disagreements with its main partner, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), over its handling of the coronavirus pandemic and the removal of trade tariffs on Serbian goods.
Hoti's Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK) came second in parliamentary elections in October and formed an uneasy coalition with Kurti's Vetevendosje party that was marred by disputes.
""No one can pretend that with non-democratic methods they can take, keep or occupy the power,"" Thaci told a news conference outside his office.
Thaci's comments were directed at Kurti, who wants to hold a snap parliamentary election once the pandemic is over. 
Kurti has also said he will go to the constitutional court to challenge the formation of a new government if parliament holds a vote to elect one. Such a vote may happen on Saturday.
Kurti has accused Thaci of being one of the masterminds behind the dismissal of his government in order to pursue the partition of Kosovo.
    According to Kurti, Thaci and Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic have agreed to a land swap under a plan for Serbia to recognize Kosovo, a move that would help Belgrade join the European Union. Thaci has denied the accusations.
One of the main disagreements between Vetevendosje and LDK was whether a tariff of 100% on goods produced in Balkan rival Serbia should be abolished.
Kosovo introduced the tariff in November 2018, saying it would be abolished once Belgrade recognized Kosovo.
The move halted talks on normalizing ties between Belgrade and Pristina and angered the European Union and the United States, which backed Kosovo's declaration of independence from Serbia in 2008 after the wars that tore apart the former Yugoslavia.
Kurti removed the tariffs but introduced reciprocity measures in a move criticized by Washington.
Hoti has said he will remove all tariff barriers with Serbia once the government is elected.

The group included Lech Walesa, who helped overthrow communism as head of the Solidarity trade union movement. Former European Council president and Polish prime minister Donald Tusk and some opposition presidential candidates have already said they would not take part in the May poll.
The ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party has sought to go ahead with the election amidst the ongoing coronavirus pandemic by proposing changes to the electoral code allowing for the vote to take place exclusively by post.
Critics, including human rights groups and election observers, say the legislative changes, which have still yet to be approved by parliament, have been rushed through and could stop the elections from being free or fair. 
""The procedure of voting by post in this form and time, as is proposed by the ruling party, are pseudo-elections. We will not take part,"" the leaders said in a joint statement.
""The Constitution allows for a state of emergency which would allow for moving the election term while maintaining political stability.""
Opinion polls show fewer than 30% of Poles are likely to cast ballots if the vote is held on May 10 as scheduled.
The head of the Supreme Court, a chamber of which could judge on the validity of the election, ended a six-year term on Thursday, opening the way for PiS to pick a supporter of its contested judiciary overhaul to replace her.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors on Thursday announced drug trafficking charges against a former chief of the Honduran National Police, the latest in a string of U.S. drug cases against officials of the Central American country.
Prosecutors said that Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, also known as ""El Tigre,"" oversaw the multi-ton shipments of cocaine bound for the United States on behalf of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez and his brother, former Congressman Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, who was found guilty of U.S. drug trafficking charges last year.
Bonilla, 60, was charged with conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and with carrying machine guns and destructive devices as part of the conspiracy in a criminal complaint filed in federal court in Manhattan on Wednesday. The charges carry a maximum sentence of life in prison.
""I am not a villain, I am a former officer of the National Police with the rank of general, who served my country and served society,"" Bonilla, who is not in U.S. custody, told a Honduran television network in response to the charges. He said he could defend himself ""anywhere"" against the accusations, which he said were false.
Bonilla has held multiple official positions, including chief of the Honduran National Police from about 2012 to 2013. Prosecutors said that Bonilla took bribes to allow drug shipments to pass through Honduras undisturbed, and passed information about law enforcement activities to drug traffickers.
Prosecutors said that Tony Hernandez told a witness now cooperating with U.S. authorities that Bonilla was ""very violent"" and was trusted with ""special assignments, including murders."" Bonilla took part in the 2011 murderer of a rival drug trafficker at the request of Tony Hernandez and others, and later claimed to investigate that murder, prosecutors said.
Multiple Honduran officials have been charged in the United States with drug-related offenses. Several have pleaded guilty and been sentenced to prison.
President Juan Orlando Hernandez has not been charged with a crime, but U.S. prosecutors and witnesses at Tony Hernandez's trial have implicated him in drug trafficking and taking bribes. One witness said he took $1 million from Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
The president has denied the allegations, representing himself as tough on drugs and responsible for breaking up the six most powerful cartels in Honduras and extraditing numerous traffickers to the United States.
Tony Hernandez is scheduled to be sentenced in June.

Poland was one of the first European Union states to close borders due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus. It also imposed a mandatory two-week lockdown for those who enter its territory from abroad. 
""The growth of new coronavirus cases is relatively low and stable. We haven't won with the epidemic, but we increasingly have it under more control,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said in a post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.

1074,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 30, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>","Exclusive: India, Pakistan nuclear procurement networks larger than thought, study shows","By Alasdair Pal
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Hundreds of foreign companies are actively procuring components for India and Pakistan’s nuclear programmes, taking advantage of gaps in the global regulation of the industry, according to a report by a U.S.-based research group.
Using open-source data, the nonprofit Centre For Advance Defense Studies (C4ADS) report provides one of the most comprehensive overviews of networks supplying the rivals, in a region regarded as one of the world’s most dangerous nuclear flashpoints. 
“India and Pakistan are taking advantage of gaps in global non-proliferation regimes and export controls to get what they need,” said Jack Margolin, a C4ADS analyst and co-author of the report.
It is seldom possible to determine whether individual transactions are illegal by using publicly available data, Margolin said, and the report does not suggest that companies mentioned broke national or international laws or regulations. 
But past reports by the think tank, whose financial backers include the Carnegie Corporation and the Wyss Foundation, have often led to action by law enforcement agencies.
Spokesmen from the offices of India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan did not respond to requests for comment. Pakistan's military, which plays a major role in decision-making for the nuclear weapons programme, also declined to comment. 
To identify companies involved, C4ADS analysed more than 125 million records of public trade and tender data and documents, and then checked them against already-identified entities listed by export control authorities in the United States and Japan. 
Pakistan, which is subject to strict international export controls on its programme, has 113 suspected foreign suppliers listed by the United States and Japan. But the C4ADS report found an additional 46, many in shipment hubs like Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
“In Pakistan's case, they have a lot more stringent controls, and they get around these by using transnational networks… and exploiting opaque jurisdictions,” Margolin said. 
The father of Pakistan's atomic bomb, AQ Khan, admitted in 2004 to selling nuclear technology to North Korea, Iran and Libya. He was pardoned a day later by Pakistani authorities, which have refused requests from international investigators to question him. 
India has a waiver that allows it to buy nuclear technology from international markets. The Indian government allows inspections of some nuclear facilities by the International Atomic Energy Agency, but not all of them. 
Neither India or Pakistan have signed the international Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, adhered to by most nuclear powers. Consequently, they are not obliged to submit to IAEA oversight over all of their facilities. 
C4ADS identified 222 companies that did business with the nuclear facilities in India that had no IAEA oversight. Of these, 86 companies did business with more than one such nuclear facility in India. 
“It's evidence that more needs to be done, and that there needs to be a more sophisticated approach taken to India,” Margolin said. “Just because the product is not explicitly bound for a military facility, that doesn't mean that the due diligence process ends there.” 
India and Pakistan have gone to war three times - twice over the disputed Kashmir region - since they won independence from British colonial rule in 1947.
Having for years secretly developed nuclear weapons capability, the two declared themselves nuclear powers following tit-for-tat atomic tests in 1998.
A few years later, in 2002, the two foes almost went to war for a fourth time, following an attack by Pakistan-based militants on the parliament in New Delhi. And a year ago, a suicide attack by a Pakistan-based militant group in a part of Kashmir controlled by India sparked another flare up in tensions.

Both countries are estimated to have around 150 useable nuclear warheads apiece, according to the Federation of American Scientists, a nonprofit group tracking stockpiles of nuclear weapons.

The plan also includes an increase in bicycle parking spaces and training to get people back in the saddle.
France will gradually ease its lockdown on May 11 after nearly two months of measures to curb the pandemic.

The ""bicycle repair boost"" programme will provide up to 50 euros for repairs by sponsored mechanics. The plan will also support a programme which allows employers to cover up to 400 euros of travel costs of staff who commute by bike.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in announcing a deal to form a unity government, has said cabinet discussions will start on July 1 on extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and annexing the area's Jordan Valley outright.
Palestinians have expressed outrage at Israel's plans to cement its hold further on land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, territory they are seeking for a state.
Implementing such plans ""represents a new war crime added to the Israeli record full of brutal crimes against the Palestinian people"", the Arab foreign ministers said in a statement after their emergency meeting, which was held online because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Arab League secretary general Ahmed Aboul Gheit accused Israel of ""taking advantage of the global preoccupation with confronting the coronavirus epidemic to impose a new reality on the ground"".
""This step, if taken, would eliminate the possibility of embodying an independent, sovereign, geographically connected and viable Palestinian state. This step, if completed, would end the two-state solution,"" Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Maliki said during the meeting.
Netanyahu said on April 26 that the United states would give Israel the nod within two months to move ahead with de facto annexation of parts of the occupied lands. 
The Arab countries urged Washington to abide by U.N. resolutions and ""withhold support for plans and maps of the Israeli occupation government woven under the cover of the so-called American-Israeli deal of the century,"" the statement said.
Palestinians have flatly rejected the U.S. peace proposal announced by President Donald Trump in January, partly because it awards Israel most of what it has sought during decades of conflict, including nearly all the occupied land on which it has built settlements.

The financial crisis is seen as the biggest threat to Lebanon's stability since the 1975-90 civil war. Mounting hardship is fuelling a new wave of unrest with a protester killed during rioting in Tripoli this week.
""We will use this (plan)... to apply for an IMF programme in light of which there will be negotiations,"" Diab told reporters after a cabinet session. 
""If we get (IMF support), and God willing we will, it will help us to pass through this difficult economic phase which could be three, four or five years,"" he said.
""The amount (the IMF will give) is up to negotiations.""
The IMF is widely seen as Lebanon's only way to secure desperately-needed financing. Foreign governments that have supported Lebanon in the past have said it must implement long-delayed reforms before it gets any support this time. 
The crisis is rooted in decades of state waste, corruption and bad governance that landed Lebanon with one of the world's biggest public debt burdens. Lebanon defaulted on its sovereign debt last month for the first time.
Its currency has shed more than half its value and savers have been largely shut out of their deposits since October, when countrywide protests erupted against ruling politicians. 
Consumer goods prices in the import-dependent country have shot up by 50% since then.
The finalised reform plan was not immediately available.
Diab said the plan would also be used to launch negotiations via its financial adviser Lazard (NYSE:LAZ) to restructure the sovereign debt. It would take six to nine months to be clear how much $31 billion of Eurobonds could be reduced, he said.
An official source said the plan did not deal with the value of the Lebanese pound, still pegged at a rate of 1,507.5 to the dollar, even as it has slumped below 4,000 on a parallel market.
Diab said the exchange rate was a matter for the central bank, not the government. 
He also said the plan did not require approval by parliament.

Drafts of the plan have set out vast losses in the financial system, including projections of tens of billions of dollars of losses at the central bank and in the banking system.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Facing growing public discontent, the Serbian government has decided to ease coronavirus lockdown measures this weekend despite warnings by doctors. 
Serbia has so far reported 8,724 coronavirus cases and 173 deaths. The number of people unhappy with strict preventative measures introduced by the government of President Aleksandar Vucic is increasing, and many have joined opposition protests from their balconies.
On Thursday the government reversed its decision to lock the entire country down during the coming May Day weekend and instead introduced a curfew from 6 p.m. on Thursday until 5 p.m. on Saturday despite calls by doctors not to relax restrictions. 
Serbia's chief epidemiologist, Predrag Kon, a member of the government's crisis team, said the decision was a compromise. ""I do not feel good about it,"" he told state-run RTS TV. He said a three-day lockdown would have been a better and safer decision to prevent the disease spreading. 
On Wednesday, Serbia reported 227 new coronavirus cases and 5 deaths. Neighbouring Bosnia reported a rise in cases on Wednesday after the government began easing restrictions.
The number of patients in the KBC Zvezdara hospital in Belgrade, which has been turned into a COVID-19 clinic, halved compared to a few weeks ago to 200 on Thursday, Doctor Vesna Dopudja told Reuters. 
""Considering what we have been through we are a bit afraid of easing the measures,"" she said.
The government had adopted a policy of gradual easing, under which restaurants and cafes open from next week, public transport in Belgrade resumes on May 8, while kindergartens will open on May 11. Hairdressers were allowed to go back to work this week, but with new safety measure. 
Mladen Ivanusa, a representative of the World Health Organisation, warned that caution was necessary. 
""The first wave of epidemics is not over yet, and it is always possible to see a worsening of the situation,"" Ivanusa told Reuters. 
He said people will have to change their habits to prevent the virus spreading, despite the easing of government measures. 
""Normality we are going back to now (as governments ease measures), is not the normality we are used to,"" Ivanusa said. 

For the first time since March 17, when it recorded its first coronavirus case, Montenegro, a small Balkan state of only 630,000 people, reported no new cases.

President Cyril Ramaphosa expressed his deep condolences at the passing of Goldberg, one of the most prominent white activists in South Africa's long struggle against racial repression. 
""This is...a moment for all of us to appreciate Denis Goldberg's brave dedication to our struggle and his lifelong activism in the interest of – and in the physical presence of - poor and vulnerable communities around our country,"" Ramaphosa said in a statement on Thursday.
He died on Wednesday after suffering from lung cancer for years. 
Goldberg, whose family had Lithuanian Jewish origins, was born in Cape Town in 1933.
A communist, he joined the African National Congress' (ANC) armed wing in 1961 to oppose the apartheid regime. He was arrested in 1963 at a clandestine meeting in a Johannesburg suburb and stood trial with several others, including Mandela and Walter Sisulu, in what became know as the Rivonia Trial.
He was convicted on sabotage charges and sentenced to life imprisonment after the judge declined to impose the death sentence. 
Being white, Goldberg was not sent to the notorious Robben Island prison along with black political prisoners like Mandela, in keeping with the apartheid regime's philosophy that the country's different races should not mix. 
Instead, he was jailed in the capital Pretoria, where he spent most of the time in solitary confinement.
He was released in 1985 after 22 years in prison after agreeing with the government not to take part in political violence. He continued his role in the anti-apartheid struggle from exile in London.
Apartheid ended with Mandela's victory in the country's first free elections in 1994, but Goldberg did not return to live there until 2002 due to family reasons.
In more recent years, Goldberg criticised failures by the now-ruling ANC to lift enough South Africans out of poverty. He was especially critical of former President Jacob Zuma, who faces several inquiries over corruption allegations during and before his time in office.
""He dedicated his life to achieving the better life we enjoy today and his revolutionary contribution reinforced the non-racial character of our struggle and of our democratic dispensation,"" Ramaphosa said.

The lockdowns and limits to people's movements, imposed by governments around the world in a bid to thwart the spread of the virus, have led to increased demand for delivery drivers.
Earlier this month, the Spanish National Police identified and arrested seven people dressed as food delivery drivers in Alicante and Valencia, said Interpol.
It added that those involved in the Spanish case were caught delivering cocaine and marijuana by bicycle, motorcycle and car, with some of the drugs concealed inside home delivery backpacks.
In Ireland, police recovered 8 kg (17 lbs) of cocaine as well as two handguns hidden in pizza boxes, added Interpol.
Interpol said delivery riders may be complicit or unwitting links in drug transportation and that, in some cases brought to its attention, suspects were sometimes falsely disguised as food delivery drivers. 
Senior anti-narcotics officials have also told Reuters that Latin American drug lords have sent bumper shipments of cocaine to Europe in recent weeks, including one in a cargo of squid, even though the coronavirus epidemic has stifled legitimate transatlantic trade.

LONDON (Reuters) - British World War Two veteran Captain Tom Moore, who has become a national hero after raising millions for the health service, celebrated his 100th birthday on Thursday with a promotion, military flypasts and a message from the prime minister.
Earlier this month, Moore began a fundraising mission for charities that help front-line National Health Service staff battling the COVID-19 crisis by completing laps of his garden with the help of a walking frame, initially setting out to raise just 1,000 pounds.
As he celebrated his centenary, the amount he raised topped 30 million pounds ($37.4 million), the Guinness World Record for the most money raised by an individual through a walk.
He has also become the oldest person to notch up a number one single in Britain's main music chart, featuring on a cover version of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"", with his endeavours winning the hearts and admiration of the public.
To celebrate his birthday, Moore was appointed the first Honorary Colonel of the Army Foundation College, based near the town where he grew up, a position that came with the approval of Queen Elizabeth, the defence ministry said. 
He has also been re-presented with his World War Two Defence Medal which he had lost.
Historic World War Two aircraft carried out a flypast above ""Colonel"" Moore's home in Bedfordshire, central England, early on Thursday, with a second fly over by modern Royal Air Force helicopters due later. 
Moore, who said he was still ""Captain Tom"", said he was honoured by his promotion and all the kind messages he had received.
SERVED IN SOUTHEAST ASIA
""If people choose to call me colonel, well thank you very much,"" he told BBC TV with a chuckle. The veteran, who served in southeast Asia during the war, waved at the World War Two fighter planes as they flew over his home.
Since Monday, Britain's  Royal Mail  (LON:RMG) has added a special postmark to all stamped post with a congratulatory message to Moore, while more than 125,000 birthday cards have been sent to him by well-wishers, so many that a nearby school has had to open and display them.
""I never, ever anticipated ever in my life anything like this, it really is amazing. I must say ... thank you very much to everyone, wherever you are,"" Moore said.
His exploits earlier this month have been heralded by politicians and royalty alike. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who returned to work on Monday after recovering from COVID-19 himself, recorded a special message for Moore. 
""I know I speak for the whole country when I say we wish you a very happy 100th birthday. Your heroic efforts have lifted the spirits of an entire nation,"" Johnson said.
He said Moore was a ""point of light in all our lives"".
The royal family have also sent messages of congratulations, including a card from the queen.

""I was most interested to hear of your recent fundraising efforts for NHS Charities Together at this difficult time,"" said the 93-year-old monarch, who traditionally writes to centenarians on their birthday. ""I send my congratulations and best wishes to you on such a special occasion.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has been forced to cancel public events to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two in Europe but Berliners need no ceremonies to remember their downfall - the scars of war are all around them.
Facades in the centre are disfigured by bullet holes and shell damage, a reminder that Hitler's Third Reich ended in devastating defeat, not the liberation it is hailed as today.
Thanks to the coronavirus, Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier will mark the May 8 ""Day of Liberation"" by laying wreaths at the Memorial to the Victims of War and Dictatorship, home to the tomb of the unknown soldier. 
This replaces a previously planned larger ceremony including foreign diplomats and young people plus a range of events including an art installation documenting the last days of the war and tracing the path to democracy, which will now go online.
Nazism, the Holocaust and the devastation of war still shape German identity and politics.
""Today you can say we were freed from the Nazi dictatorship but most Germans were defeated. They were perpetrators, not victims of Nazism,"" said Bjoern Weigel, curator of the ""75th Anniversary of the End of the War"" art project.
""You have to look at this differentiation to avoid a myth (of victimhood) taking hold,"" he said.
The Battle of Berlin, in which Red Army tanks, artillery and infantry fought their way forward street by street in April and May 1945, reduced the Nazi capital to rubble.
It was one of the war's bloodiest battles. Including assaults to encircle Berlin from Seelow and Halbe, more than a quarter of a million people died, say historians, although estimates vary and bodies are found every year.
SURRENDER
Germans fought on even after Hitler committed suicide on April 30 and the Berlin garrison surrendered on May 2. It took until May 8 for German generals to capitulate.
""In 1945, not all Germans felt happy. For many it was a catastrophe,"" said Joerg Morré, director of the German-Russian museum at Karlshorst where the unconditional surrender was signed.
Vivid reminders of the battle still disfigure Berlin buildings, offering evidence of fierce fighting.
Traces of the battle range from obscene graffiti scrawled on walls inside the Reichstag by victorious Red Army soldiers to damaged facades of city museums, bunkers and bridges.
""People living here are aware of this but they don't see it as being particularly relevant,"" said tour guide Nick Jackson.
Locals should be allowed to reinvent their city, he said.
""Rebuilding and moving forward is a natural process that I don't think is malicious,"" he said, adding younger Germans like to see May 8 as a celebration of liberation and democracy.
In the last decade or so, some Germans have focused more on their own suffering during the war and prominent members of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), Germany's third biggest parliamentary party, want to rewrite the history books.
As the rise of the right raises questions about Germans' view of the past, it is even more important to stress the responsibilities linked to democracy on May 8, said Weigel.

""You can see the link between the Nazi era and now. What these people wanted when they voted Hitler in was not what they got,"" he said.

The images from the neighbouring slums of Mooiplaas and Spruit, on the outskirts of the capital Pretoria, show the extent of need that South Africa's economic lockdown has generated among many who even before the pandemic were living a hand-to-mouth existence.
Africa's most industrialised nation has recorded 5,350 cases and 103 deaths from the virus.
About 90 percent of the inhabitants of these informal settlements are foreigners or undocumented migrants from other southern African nations like Zimbabwe, Yusuf Abramjee, a spokesman for the charity coalition said by telephone.
They do not qualify for food aid from a government busy attending to its own large numbers of impoverished citizens. 
The footage shot on Wednesday and reviewed by Reuters shows a dirt track flanked by bush, large patches of which are burnt or covered in rubbish, and iron-roof shanty towns. In places the queue looks orderly; in others, it disintegrates into a crowd.
""That just shows you the levels of desperation that we have,"" said Abramjee. ""I've not seen anything on this scale, not these levels of poverty and hunger in South Africa. It's heartbreaking,"" he said, adding the queue was 4 km (2.5 miles) at one stage.
In total, the charity delivered 8,000 food parcels to an estimated 12,000 families, he said.

South Africa has spent five weeks under restrictions requiring most of the population of about 58 million to stay at home, apart from essential trips.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A mother checking on her ex-husband's sexual habits to protect their asthmatic child; a retiree frustrated with a neighbour who talks loudly on late-night conference calls; a woman angry with a family downstairs for hosting large play dates.
These are all client requests made to a Swiss private detective since the country imposed coronavirus confinement measures six weeks ago.
Christian Sideris, founder of Seeclop, a six-man detective agency in Geneva, has refused all but one of them, urging his callers to seek other solutions in extraordinary times, but the requests reveal the mounting frustration of living together.
""We have a lot of these types of cases because people are confined and on top of each other all day,"" he said, describing some callers as ""desperate"".
Normally, Sideris gets beyween two and four requests a year for such cases. Since lockdown began, he has had two a week.
He accepted the asthmatic child case since, after a week of trailing the father, it showed he had multiple girlfriends and visitors despite COVID-19 restrictions, a potentially important part of the custody dispute.
""In normal times, you would never have a judge who asks about his different mistresses or whether he stays far enough away in the grocery queue but these are not normal times,"" said Sideris, one of Geneva's 468 registered agents.
The Swiss are known for complaining about their neighbours, often using rules designed to keep the noise down. These are rigorously enforced in Geneva, where 16th Century protestant reformer John Calvin banned instrumental music when he was in charge.
Today, Geneva's Public Health and Tranquility Law regulates the hours for practising a musical instrument and home DIY, with fines of up to 10,000 Swiss francs ($10,000). Running a bath after 9 p.m. is banned.
As the coronavirus crisis drags on, police said noise complaints in Geneva had more than doubled this month to 1,233, including about kids on scooters indoors and late-night home improvements.
One resident complained to police about a neighbourhood choir intended to cheer people up.
""We were disappointed and sad,"" said resident Audrey Lecomte. The choir got off with a warning and responded by reducing the show's length and placing chalk markers to encourage spectators to social-distance.

The police are back, but only to watch, and one grumpy neighbour said the music still went on for ""too long"".

Police also conducted early morning raids on mosque associations in cities across Germany which officials believe are close to the heavily armed Shi'ite Islamist group.
""The activities of Hezbollah violate criminal law and the organization opposes the concept of international understanding,"" said the interior ministry in a statement.
The move means that Hezbollah symbols are banned at gatherings and in publications or in the media and Hezbollah assets can be confiscated, said the ministry, adding as it is a foreign organisation, it is not possible to ban and dissolve it.
Security officials believe up to 1,050 people in Germany are part of what they describe as Hezbollah's extremist wing.
Israel, which with the United States had been pushing Germany to ban the group, praised the move.
""It is a very important decision and a valuable and significant step in the global fight against terrorism,"" said Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz. 
""I call on other European countries as well as the European Union to do the same. All the parts of Hezbollah, including the social, political and military wings are terror organizations and they should be treated as such,"" he added.
DAWN RAIDS
Previously, Berlin had distinguished between Hezbollah's political arm and its military units, which have fought alongside President Bashar al-Assad's army in Syria.
Hezbollah is also a significant backer of the government of Lebanese Prime Minister Hassan Diab, which took office in January.
The EU classifies Hezbollah's military wing as a terrorist group, but not its political wing. Britain introduced legislation in February of last year that classified Hezbollah as a terrorist organisation.
The American Jewish Committee also hailed it as a landmark decision.
""This is a welcome, much-anticipated, and significant German decision,” said AJC head David Harris.
As a legacy of the Holocaust, Germany feels a special responsibility towards protecting Israel. 
Germany's interior ministry said Hezbollah calls for the violent elimination of the State of Israel and questions the right of the State of Israel to exist. 
""The organization is therefore fundamentally against the concept of international understanding, regardless of whether it presents itself as a political, social or military structure,"" it said.
In dawn raids, police searched mosque associations in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia, Bremen and Berlin which they believe are close to Hezbollah and the private residences of the leaders of each association. 

The associations under investigation are suspected of forming part of Hezbollah due to their financial support and propaganda for the terrorist organization, said the interior ministry.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - A Singaporean man who broke his coronavirus quarantine with 30 minutes remaining to buy prata flatbread worth a few dollars was fined $1,000, the latest in a string of tough punishments for those who breach the city-state's COVID-19 containment rules.
The tiny island nation, known for its no-nonsense law enforcement and widespread surveillance, has one of the highest coronavirus caseloads in Asia due to mass outbreaks in cramped migrant worker dormitories. 
But it has won international praise for its strict quarantine and contact tracing regime that have limited infections in the wider community.
In mid-March, 22-year-old financial adviser Tay Chun Hsien was ordered not to leave his home after he was suspected of being a contact of a coronavirus patient, court documents show.
But just 30 minutes before the order was due to expire he headed to a nearby food court where, according to local media, he ate roti prata, an Indian-inspired flatbread popular in Southeast Asia. 
As he was eating, an officer monitoring his quarantine called his mobile phone to check if he was at home but Tay said he had left to buy food because he was hungry, according to the case records.
""At this critical stage in the nation's fight against COVID-19, everyone has a part to play. Persons who are subject to Home Quarantine Orders and other measures...must comply,"" said deputy public prosecutor Norman Yew, adding that Tay had returned home quickly and presented low risk of transmission.
Tay, who was fined S$1,500 ($1,063.00) this week, did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Under the Infectious Diseases Act, punishments for such breaches can be fines of up to S$10,000 or imprisonment of up to six months, or both. 
Tougher punishment was doled out to Alan Tham Xiang Sheng, a 33-year-old businessman, who broke an order to stay home to eat bah kut teh - a pork rib soup common to Singapore and Malaysia. 
Tham was given the order to stay home for 14 days in mid-March when he returned from Myanmar, one of a number of countries subject to travel restrictions at the time to curb imported infections. 
The night he returned home, Tham went by bus to a local food court to eat the soup and posted pictures on social media, case records show.
""Lives are at stake. A clear deterrent message must be sent to those who would put the health and safety of others at risk for the sake of their convenience or whims and fancies,"" the public prosecutors said.
Tham, who was sentenced to six weeks in jail, could not be reached for comment.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - A large crowd of Venezuelan migrants held up traffic on a Bogota highway on Wednesday, demanding to be allowed to leave Colombia and return to Venezuela, as Colombia's coronavirus lockdown has crippled their ability to earn to living.
Some 500 migrants and a dozen buses were stranded near the toll booths that mark the northern border of Bogota, the Colombian capital, as migration authorities limited transport amid passage restrictions at the border. 
There has been a mass movement of thousands of Venezuelans back to their economically devastated country since Colombia imposed a nationwide lockdown last month.
Venezuela has said 600 people are allowed to cross the border each day, to allow for testing and organizing of quarantines. Colombia's migration agency says Venezuela limits entrances to 300 per day.
""There are children here and we have no food to give them, we have no water, no resources, nor anywhere to stay. We are living on the street,"" Jesus Bolivar, 34, a Venezuelan doctor who has been in Colombia for over a year, told Reuters Wednesday morning. 
A migration agency spokesman said on Wednesday evening an agreement had been reached to allow some buses to head to the border on Thursday and others on Friday.
Special procedures have been put in place for Venezuelans wanting to return home, the agency said in a statement, as it called for migrants to coordinate travel with local authorities.
Crossings ""are subject to the daily availability Venezuela has to receive its citizens,"" the agency said.
Buses that have begun transport without authorization will be halted until there is space at the border, the statement said. Passengers will be subject to sanctions that could prevent their re-entry to Colombia or block them from certain visas.
Colombia's lockdown, now in its sixth week, has decimated the informal economy in which many migrants work, plunging them deeper into poverty and triggering a reversal in migration flows.
About 1.8 million Venezuelan migrants live in Colombia. Around 14,000 have now returned home. 
Weary from travel, the migrants - including the elderly, some with diabetes and pregnant women - worried over the delays. 
""We're in a bad way,"" said Dubraska Dubian, 26, who was trying to return to Venezuela with her husband and their three daughters. 
""How are we going to manage until Friday? We can't even wash our hands. We're sleeping in the buses, we don't have food,"" Dubian said. ""They have to let us leave."" 

Bolivar, the Venezuelan doctor, agreed: ""What we want is to travel, to go back to our country.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's Supreme Court chief Malgorzata Gersdorf ends a six-year term on Thursday, opening way for the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government to pick a supporter of its contested judiciary overhaul to replace her.
Since PiS came to power in 2015, the 67-year-old lawyer had emerged as a figurehead for opponents of its reform efforts, which the European Union has said subvert democratic checks and balances.
Earlier this month, Gersdorf had sought to comply with a European Court of Justice ruling that directed Poland to suspend a Supreme Court panel created to discipline judges.
A spokesman for the panel, which Brussels says was set up by PiS in breach of EU law, said the ruling by the EU's top court did not undermine the functioning of the panel. Gersdorf insisted its activities should be suspended until a final ECJ ruling is issued.
""I have never kept secret my views on actions, which sought to undermine the constitutional infrastructure of the judiciary,"" Gersdorf said in a statement on Tuesday issued ahead of her retirement.
""Unfortunately, I have not been able to stop this process. I have not succeeded in preventing the destruction of the rule of law.""
PiS says it inherited a court system run by a self-serving elite and seeped in communist-era power structures that prevented it from functioning efficiently and fairly. Critics at home and abroad say, however, its reforms amount to an authoritarian power grab.
Gersdorf has previously defied efforts by the PiS government to force her into early retirement. In 2018, she continued to work even after the government passed legislation lowering judges' retirement age. The EU had said the retirement rules were unacceptable.
On Wednesday, the EU's executive started a new legal case against the nationalist Polish government for muzzling judges in the bloc's largest ex-communist country. 
In setting out her departure, Gersdorf has refused to convene an assembly of Supreme Court judges that would nominate candidates for her replacement, saying the novel coronavirus pandemic made it too dangerous to do so.
Poland's President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, has said he would pick an acting Supreme Court chief who could then call the assembly to allow for a nomination. 
Gersdorf, who is the most senior of Supreme Court presidents, has argued she should be replaced by the longest-serving of her five peers until an assembly can meet safely. But Duda rejected that.
""A Supreme Court judge can become acting president only if designated by the president, as stated by legislation,"" Duda said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) discussion on Wednesday, according to the state PAP news agency.

Around a third of Supreme Court judges were nominated under PiS rule, meaning the assembly is likely to propose at least one candidate for chief who would be acceptable to Duda.

Rivals Fianna Fail and Fine Gael struck an initial agreement two weeks ago to govern together for the first time but need the support of at least one smaller party or eight independent lawmakers to control the fractured parliament. 
The deal followed weeks of negotiations after a general election in February, which resulted in a hung parliament. 
The centre-right parties favour a coalition with the Green Party, which has 12 seats, and have been answering questions from the Greens over their initial framework deal that they hope will lead to formal negotiations between the three groups.
Some Green Party members are unsure about joining such a government, sceptical that the two larger parties will pursue ambitious enough environmental policies.
Asked if a new government would be in place by June 8, Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin told Ireland's Virgin Media television station: ""I'm not so sure yet at this stage."" 
""It's not in my gift but I do think there will come a time when people will have to get off the fence and say 'we want to go into government' and they'll negotiate, because this cannot go on indefinitely,"" he said in an interview with the station.

Acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Fine Gael has imposed a series of restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus but no new legislation can be passed until a new government is formed and selects the remaining members of the upper house of parliament.

Lebanon is in the throes of a deep economic crisis that has seen its currency lose more than half its value since October, soaring inflation, and spiraling unemployment.
In the northern city of Tripoli protesters lobbed fireworks and stones at soldiers who pushed them back with rubber bullets. In the southern city of Sidon demonstrators set a central bank building ablaze with petrol bombs for a second night. 
The latest wave of unrest comes after a plunge in the value of the pound currency last week that has threatened to further hike prices in the import-dependent country.
Banks that have locked savers out of their U.S. dollar accounts in a bid to preserve scarce hard currency have been primary targets in recent days, with bank fronts burned and ATMs smashed in several cities.

The unrest comes as Beirut is on the verge of finalizing an economic rescue plan that will form the basis of negotiations with foreign bondholders after defaulting on its debt last month in a bid to preserve cash for vital imports.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Aid groups working with the United Nations want the Security Council to urgently allow an Iraq border crossing into Syria to be used again for deliveries to help combat the coronavirus pandemic, according to a draft World Health Organization memo seen by the 15-member U.N. Security Council.
But an updated version of the memo, dated Tuesday, removed the direct appeal for the Al Yarubiyah crossing to be reopened nearly four months after its use for U.N. operations was shut down by opposition from Russia and China. The WHO did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The move risks further stoking criticism - which has been led by U.S. President Donald Trump - that the Geneva-based U.N. agency allows itself to be influenced by some countries. 
Earlier this month, Trump halted U.S. funding for the WHO while Washington reviews the agency's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and accused the WHO of being ""China-centric,"" an assertion the organization denies.
""The WHO should stand firm and not cave in to pressure from big powers. This is about saving lives, not avoiding criticism,"" Louis Charbonneau, U.N. director at Human Rights Watch, said of the changes to the memo. ""The council needs to immediately reauthorize Al Yarubiyah."" 
During a Security Council meeting on the humanitarian situation in Syria on Wednesday, several members called for the body to help scale up cross-border aid operations into Syria. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft said all options should be explored, including the use of Al Yarubiyah. 
But Russia's U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, warned: ""We strongly urge our colleagues not to waste their time on looking for a way to advocate, explicitly or implicitly, to get Al Yarubiyah back."" 
Syria has reported 43 cases - including one in the northeast - of the novel coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19, and three deaths. The updated WHO memo said the coronavirus impact in Syria could be ""truly catastrophic."" 
'TERRORISM WORSE THAN VIRUS'
The Security Council annually authorized the delivery of aid through the Iraq crossing for the past six years, but dropped its approval in January in the face of opposition from Syrian ally Russia, backed by China.
""United Nations partners ... propose the re-opening of Yarubiyah crossing as a matter of urgency. This would have significant impact on the COVID-19 response in NES (northeast Syria),"" the draft WHO memo said. 
The updated memo said instead that ""new options are needed"" to replace aid that was delivered through Iraq, adding that shipments across conflict lines in the country could not be adequately expanded to meet the needs in northeast Syria. 
Western diplomats have said the closure of the Iraq crossing cuts off 40 percent of medical aid to northeastern Syria.
""Gaps in medical supplies in northeast Syria are widening. At a time when we should be urgently scaling up to prepare for COVID-19, those gaps should be narrowing,"" U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the council on Wednesday.
A crackdown by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to civil war. Millions of people have fled Syria and millions more are displaced within the country. Security Council approval is needed for U.N. cross-border deliveries because the Syrian government did not consent.
Syria's U.N. ambassador, Bashar Ja'afari, told the council that terrorism was ""more dangerous"" than COVID-19 in Syria.

Libyan National Army (LNA) spokesman Ahmed Mismari said in a television broadcast that the ceasefire came at the request of the international community and ""friendly countries"". 
Both the LNA and the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) have already said twice this year that they would stop fighting, but there was a sharp escalation in warfare last month. 
Libya has been split since 2014 between the GNA in Tripoli and some other areas of the northwest, and a parallel administration based in Benghazi in the east. 
LNA commander Khalifa Haftar launched a war a year ago to capture Tripoli, but pro-GNA forces have this month taken back several areas with Turkish military support, particularly through drones that have targeted eastern supply lines.
The LNA, which is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Egypt, has for weeks been shelling the capital in a campaign of bombardment that has drawn repeated rebukes from the United Nations. 
Hospitals in parts of Tripoli held by the GNA have repeatedly been hit by shelling in recent weeks, despite the threat to Libya posed by the coronavirus. 
Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday the LNA had last year targeted a biscuit factory, killing eight civilians in an attack it called ""apparently unlawful"". The LNA has not commented on that report. 
There was no immediate GNA response to the LNA's declaration of a ceasefire, but Mismari said the eastern-based forces would reserve the right to respond to attacks. Ramadan, Islam's holy fasting month, began last week. 
It comes at a moment of political uncertainty in the eastern camp, with Haftar declaring on Monday that the army would take power and ripping up a 2015 political agreement that has been the basis for all international peacemaking efforts. 
Egypt and Russia, two of the LNA's main supporters, have declined either to endorse or reject the move, with Haftar having yet to spell out how the new government would operate or what relation it would have to the eastern-based parliament. 
Haftar is already widely regarded as controlling eastern Libya despite the nominal governance of a civilian administration. 
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday that ""we do not approve of the statement that now field marshal Haftar will alone decide how the Libyan people will live,"" but tempered his remarks with criticism of the GNA. 
Egypt, which sees Haftar as a bulwark against their common enemy the Muslim Brotherhood, stressed the necessity of a political solution to Libya's conflict. 
The UAE has not yet made any official comment on Haftar's seizure of power.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanians took to the streets after a ban was lifted on driving and many businesses reopened in a rapid return to normality after the authorities relaxed a tough forty-day curfew to stem the spread of coronavirus.
A car driving ban for most of the country's 10 million inhabitants was imposed shortly after King Abdullah enacted an emergency law in the middle of last month that gave the government sweeping powers that curb civil and political rights and deploy the army in cities.
The government, which announced the move on Monday, said it could revert back to limiting movement by foot from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. for people to shop under stay at home orders before a night curfew if people did not observe social distancing rules.
""Continuing to ease measures depends on the degree of compliance and in the event people and businesses don't abide, we will unfortunately go back to closures and tough measures,"" cabinet minister and government spokesman Amjad Adailah said.
The curfew brought the army to main squares of the capital for the first time on this scale since martial law decades ago, paralyzing daily life, business activity and leaving many daily wage earners struggling without pay.
The government of Prime Minister Omar al Razzaz won praise for quick moves that were some of the world's strictest measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, but the economic impact has deepened, with growing criticism by business lobbies and fears of social unrest.
The closure of firms and the disruption of tourism, a main source of foreign currency, has choked the aid dependant economy with officials warning this year of the first contraction in growth since 1990 and a record public debt that will exceed 100% of GDP.
Public buses and taxis were also allowed to resume on Wednesday in the phased reopening of thousands of businesses and industries since last week and now extended to beauty parlors, cosmetics to dentists and garments and malls.
Medical officials, who say with only 451 confirmed cases and only eight deaths the country can risk more steps to open the economy, warned, however, cases could spike again if people did not take heed of safeguards.
""There is an impression by some that the disease has ended and any recklessness or steering away from preventive measures will lead to the return of the disease and in a worse way,"" said Health Minister Saad Jaber said. 
The government has not indicated when civil servants in most government agencies will be allowed to go back to work nor timing of the resumption of schools and universities.
The country's airport remains closed to passenger traffic and land borders crossings with neighbors Syria, Israel, Iraq and Saudi Arabia only open for commercial traffic.

The lockdown, one of the toughest in Europe, has halted public life since March 14 and nearly paralysed the economy.
In Madrid, workers were painting ""keep your distance"" signs on to zebra crossings in the capital in preparation for restrictions to be gradually removed. 
The country's overall death toll from the virus rose by 453 to 24,275, the health ministry said, adding that the additional cases were from the previous days in the region of Galicia. 
The number of diagnosed cases rose by 2,144 from Tuesday to 212,917, the world's second-highest tally after the United States, the ministry said. 
""The evolution we are seeing is still very favourable and is in line with what we expected,"" health emergency coordinator Fernando Simon told a news briefing on Wednesday.
He said the so-called 'R' rate – the average number of infections that one person with the virus causes - stood at below 1, signalling a downward trend, in almost all areas of the country. 
The daily number of deaths has decreased sharply from the high of 950 seen in early April.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced late on Tuesday a four-phase plan to lift the lockdown that would culminate in a return to normality by the end of June.
FOREIGN TOURISM 
But Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told a news conference on Wednesday ""the period of easing measures would take more discipline than lockdown"" itself. 
Implementation will vary from province to province depending on factors such as how the rate of infection evolves, the number of intensive care beds available locally and compliance with distancing rules. These targets are yet to be announced.
Health Minister Salvador Illa said the rules on visiting friends and family would be provided in the coming days.
The Hotel Business Association of Madrid on Wednesday expressed its ""serious concern"" over the plan, as well as its ""disbelief"" that the government was contemplating reopening hotels ""when the arrival of clients is impossible"" because of closed borders and suspended flights. 
The government's plan does not specify when Spain will be able to reopen its tourism industry, which is worth 12% of Gross Domestic Product.
""Foreign tourism is the hardest part to manage. We look at what has happened to those ahead of us (in Asia); when they started cross-border mobility there were outbreaks of imported cases,"" said a government official who declined to be named. 
""We also want to take the decision at (European) Community level, especially in view of the Schengen area,"" he added. 
Data released on Wednesday showed Spanish retail sales fell 14.1% in March from a year earlier on a calendar-adjusted basis, after rising 1.8% in February.
Most stores closed during the second half of last month as part of the lockdown and have remained shut in April.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro on Wednesday withdrew the name of a family friend he had picked to run the federal police, after a Supreme Court justice blocked an appointment that opponents said would allow him inappropriate influence over law enforcement.
His decision to drop Alexandre Ramagem, who was director of the Brazilian intelligence agency Abin, was published in the government's official gazette.
The suspension of the appointment by Justice Alexandre de Moraes earlier on Wednesday came after the top court authorized an investigation into allegations by Bolsonaro's former justice minister that the president had abused his power by swapping the police chief.
Moraes wrote that he granted the injunction, which can still be appealed, because there were relevant signs that Ramagem, who was set to take office on Wednesday afternoon, could be compromised by his close relationship with Bolsonaro's family.
Ramagem, who joined the federal police in 2005 and has run the intelligence agency since July, had the fewest years of service of any officer tapped to lead the force.
He took charge of Bolsonaro's security in 2018 after the soon-to-be president was stabbed on the campaign trail and grew close to the president's sons, who have been accused of taking part in embezzlement and misinformation schemes, which they deny.
Bolsonaro's shakeup of the federal police has spurred a political crisis in Brazil, distracting from the battle against an accelerating coronavirus outbreak in the country, whose official death toll climbed past 5,000 on Tuesday, passing that of China.

1103,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 04:29PM ET</span>","Pompeo says no sight of North Korea's Kim, real risk of famine in country","By David Brunnstrom
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has caught no sight of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and is watching reports about his health, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday, adding there was a real risk of famine in the country amid the coronavirus outbreak.
North Korean media has not reported on Kim's whereabouts since he presided over a meeting on April 11, provoking speculation about his health and raising concerns about instability in the nuclear-armed country that could affect other North Asian countries and the United States.
""We haven't seen him. We don't have any information to report today, we're watching it closely,"" Pompeo told Fox (NASDAQ:FOX) News after being asked about conflicting reports about Kim's health.
Pompeo said the United States was also monitoring the situation more broadly in North Korea, which borders China, given the risk presented by the coronavirus.
""There is a real risk that there will be a famine, a food shortage, inside of North Korea too,"" he added. ""We're watching each of those things closely, as they have a real impact on our mission set, which to ultimately denuclearize North Korea.""
Officials in South Korea and the United States have said Kim may be staying at North Korea's coastal resort of Wonsan to avoid exposure to the new coronavirus, and have expressed skepticism about media reports that he had some kind of serious illness. 
They caution, however, that Kim's health and location are closely guarded secrets and reliable information is difficult to obtain from secretive North Korea.
On Saturday, a U.S.-based North Korea monitoring project, 38 North, said satellite images showed what was believed to be Kim’s personal train parked at a station reserved for his use in Wonsan on April 21 and 23.
New images taken on Wednesday showed a train in the same position, but it was unclear whether it had been there since last week, 38 North said.
On Tuesday, another North Korea-monitoring website, NK PRO, reported that commercial satellite imagery showed boats often used by Kim had moved in patterns suggesting he or his entourage may be in the Wonsan area.
38 North said that in its new images, the train did not appear to be prepared for departure as the engine could no longer be seen parked alongside its south end.
It said the train’s presence did not prove Kim's presence, but the station was reserved for the exclusive use of the Kim family, ""lending weight to the multiple reports that Kim has been staying in the Wonsan area.""
Pompeo told a later State Department news conference the United States would continue to focus on North Korean denuclearization, ""no matter what transpires there.""
President Donald Trump met Kim three times in 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States. While talks have stalled, Trump has continued to hail Kim as a friend.
Pompeo did not elaborate on the risk of famine in North Korea, but a North Korean economic delegation was due in Beijing this week to discuss food supplies and trade issues as the coronavirus outbreak has severely disrupted the country's food supply, two people with direct knowledge of the situation told Reuters.

Impoverished and isolated North Korea is prone to food shortages. As many as 1.1 million people died during the famines of the 1990s, according to South Korean estimates.

1104,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 04:29PM ET</span>",Brazil to deploy troops to protect Amazon as deforestation surges,"By Eduardo Simões and Jake Spring
SAO PAULO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil plans to deploy its armed forces to fight deforestation and fires in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) jungle, Vice President Hamilton Mourão said on Wednesday, in an effort protect the world's largest rainforest where destruction has surged since last year.
Mourão said the country would invoke the same measure that deployed troops to fight forest fires last year, a so-called Guarantee of Law and Order (GLO) decree to be signed by President Jair Bolsonaro.
Amazon deforestation soared to an 11-year high last year, as fires tore through the rainforest, provoking international outcry that Brazil was not doing enough to protect the biome.
Destruction has continued to climb this year. From January to March, deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon rose 51% from a year ago, according to preliminary satellite data.
Mourão said the government would establish permanent bases in the Amazon this year for military personnel, federal and state police, environmental agencies and other security forces. 
""We already have a plan practically finished for an initiative against deforestation and to prevent fires that start in July and August,"" Mourão said.
Mourão did not give details on the timing of the decree. 
""If a new GLO is necessary, the armed forces are ready to go again,"" Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo said earlier on Wednesday.
The plans to deploy the military come amid signs that the government is rolling back routine environmental enforcement due to the new coronavirus outbreak.
An official at environmental agency Ibama, the government's main enforcer of environmental laws, told Reuters in March that it would not be able to send as many agents into the field to stop environmental crimes because of health risks.
Environmental advocates worry that will lead destruction to spike further in the rainforest, although Ibama said the cutbacks would be in areas other than the Amazon.
Marcio Astrini, executive secretary for Brazilian advocacy group Climate Observatory, said that the military's presence will undoubtedly help curb deforestation in the short term, but can't replace long-term efforts via environmental agencies like Ibama, which are being weakened by Bolsonaro's administration.
Astrini said the government is ""schizophrenic,"" with Bolsonaro's pro-development policies to blame for causing the very destruction that the military is being sent in to stop.
""Sending the military to the Amazon is like medicating a disease of the government's own creation,"" Astrini said. 

""It's a medication that has a short-term effect, it will resolve the problem now. ... It won't cure the disease. The disease that exists in the Amazon today is Bolsonaro.""

1105,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 29, 2020 10:11AM ET</span>",Satellite images of luxury boats further suggest North Korea's Kim at favoured villa: experts,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - Satellite imagery showing recent movements of luxury boats often used by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his entourage near Wonsan provide further indications he has been at the coastal resort, according to experts who monitor the reclusive regime. 
Speculation about Kim's health and location erupted after his unprecedented absence from April 15 celebrations to mark the birthday of his late grandfather and North Korea's founder, Kim Il Sung.
On Tuesday, North Korea-monitoring website NK PRO reported commercial satellite imagery showed boats often used by Kim had made movements in patterns that suggested he or his entourage may be in the Wonsan area. 
That followed a report last week by a U.S.-based North Korea monitoring project, 38 North, which reported satellite images showed what was believed to be Kim’s personal train was parked at a station reserved for his use at the villa in Wonsan. 
Officials in South Korea and the United States say it is plausible Kim may be staying there, possibly to avoid exposure to the new coronavirus, and have expressed scepticism of media reports he had some kind of serious illness.
They caution, however, that Kim's health and location are closely guarded secrets and reliable information is difficult to obtain in North Korea. 
The last time official media in North Korea reported on Kim's whereabouts was when he presided over a meeting on April 11, but there have been near-daily reports of him sending letters and diplomatic messages.
Kim's seaside compound in Wonsan, on the country's east coast, is dotted with guest villas and serviced by a private beach, basketball court, and private train station, according to experts and satellite imagery. An airstrip was bulldozed last year to build a horse riding track, while a boathouse nearby shelters Kim’s Princess 95 luxury yacht, valued at around $7 million in 2013.
""It’s one of his favourite houses,"" said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the U.S.-based Stimson Center, who has compared Kim's affinity for Wonsan to U.S. President Donald Trump's favoured resort, Mar-a-Lago in Florida.
Madden said Kim is believed to have about 13 significant compounds around the country, though he appears to only regularly use about half of them.
""All of them are set up to serve as the leader’s headquarters, so they are all equipped for him to run the country,"" he said.
Wonsan is one of the larger and better appointed compounds, but it also has a useful location that allows Kim to easily travel to other areas along the coast, or return quickly to Pyongyang in his private train or along a special highway designated for use only by the Kim family or top officials, Madden said.
FAVOURED SPOT
Wonsan also holds symbolic power for the Kim dynasty: It was there Kim Il Sung, who helped found North Korea at the end of Japanese colonial rule in 1945, first landed with Soviet troops to take over the country.
Wonsan is believed by some experts to be Kim Jong Un's birthplace, partly because he spent his early years at the family's palace there, although official history has never confirmed where he was born.
The Japanese chef Kenji Fujimoto, who worked for the Kims and visited Wonsan, recounted in his memoirs how a young Kim Jong Un described rollerblading, playing basketball, riding jet skis and playing in the pool at the compound. 
Later, photos showed Kim sipping drinks there with American basketball player Dennis Rodman when the star visited North Korea in 2013. 
The Wonsan area has also become emblematic of Kim's strategy for survival based on a combination of economic development, tourism, and nuclear weapons. He is rebuilding the city of 360,000 people and wants to turn it into a billion-dollar tourist hotspot. 
In recent months, the project has been repeatedly delayed, undermined in part by international sanctions imposed over the North's nuclear and missile programmes, which have restricted its ability to seek foreign investment.

Wonsan has also been the scene of some of Kim's renewed military drills and missile tests, which he resumed amid increasing frustration with a lack of progress in denuclearisation talks with the United States and South Korea.

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's fiancée, Carrie Symonds, gave birth to a healthy baby boy at a London hospital on Wednesday, slightly earlier than had been expected.
Symonds, 32, had said previously that their baby was due to ""hatch"" in the early summer. It was not clear if Johnson, 55, would take paternity leave given the government is facing the worst health crisis since the 1918 influenza outbreak.
""The Prime Minister and Ms Symonds are thrilled to announce the birth of a healthy baby boy at a London hospital earlier this morning,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Both mother and baby are doing very well.
""The PM and Ms Symonds would like to thank the fantastic NHS maternity team.""
There was no announcement of a name.
The new arrival tops a tumultuous month for Johnson; he returned to work on Monday after recuperating from COVID-19, which had left him gravely ill in intensive care at the peak of the coronavirus outbreak.
Symonds, a former public relations executive, also had symptoms of the virus but recovered more swiftly.
BABY IN DOWNING STREET
Few British leaders have had babies while in office, although it has become more common among recent occupants of Downing Street. 
David Cameron's wife, Samantha, gave birth to their daughter, Florence, in 2010 and Tony Blair's wife Cherie gave birth to their son, Leo, in 2006.
Before that, Frances, the wife of John Russell, a 19th-Century Whig and Liberal politician, gave birth to two children in 1848 and 1849 while he was in office.
""Great to hear Downing Street is getting a new resident,"" said Johnson's finance minister, Rishi Sunak.
Opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said: ""Wonderful news. Many congratulations to Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds.""
Symonds and Johnson have been living together in Downing Street since he became prime minister in July. They announced in February that they were expecting their first child and that they were engaged to be married.
'INCREDIBLY BLESSED'
Johnson, once dubbed ""Bonking Boris"" by Britain's riotous tabloid media, has a complicated private life.
He was once sacked from the Conservative Party's policy team while in opposition for lying about an extra-marital affair. He has been divorced twice and refuses to say how many children he has fathered.
In 2013, when Johnson was mayor of London, appeal court judges ruled that the public had the right to know he had an extra-marital affair with a woman who gave birth to his daughter.
Johnson's previous marriage was to Marina Wheeler, a lawyer. They had four children together but announced in September 2018 that they had separated. They divorced earlier this year.
Symonds announced her engagement to Johnson in February.
""Many of you already know, but for my friends that still don't, we got engaged at the end of last year... and we've got a baby hatching early summer,"" she said.

""Feel incredibly blessed.""

In a normal year, locals would celebrate the day by flocking to beaches and other public spaces for barbecues, and to soak up the sun. 
The government has begun to ease some curbs to contain its coronavirus epidemic, but it reimposed mandatory curfews for the back-to-back Memorial Day and Independence Day holidays on Tuesday and Wednesday to reduce the risk of contagion.
So while the four jets performed aerobatic manoeuvres before flying on to other cities in a display also honouring front-line hospital staff, families looked on from balconies.
Doctors and nurses, many wearing face masks, gathered on the rooftop of Tel Aviv's Wolfson Medical Center and waved Israeli flags.
""We wish for you and all the citizens of Israel robust and vigorous health and a happy Independence Day,"" one of the squadron pilots said in a message to health workers. 
Celebrations for the 72nd anniversary of Israel's 1948 independence kicked off late on Tuesday with fireworks in some cities. But many jurisdictions forwent their usual spectacles to save money in an economic crisis caused by the pandemic.
Israel has reported almost 16,000 coronavirus cases and more than 200 deaths. 
Infection rates have ebbed in recent weeks, and authorities have begun easing restrictions by allowing some businesses to reopen, with an eye towards letting children return to school.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong court on Wednesday rejected an appeal by pro-democracy activist Edward Leung against a six-year jail term for his part in demonstrations in the Chinese-ruled city in 2016 that turned violent. 
Leung, 28, one of the leaders of a movement advocating independence from China, was jailed for rioting and was handed the harshest sentence to a pro-democracy leader since Britain returned Hong Kong to Beijing in 1997.
The appeal court judges said in their judgement the law must ensure that public order and peace are preserved and not threatened by the use of violence.
""If public order is not preserved, the freedom and rights of citizens will be lost,"" they said. 
In his appeal, Leung's lawyer argued his sentence was disproportionate to his offence, citing other, more violent protesters receiving lighter sentences. 
The ruling comes as the financial hub is gearing up for demonstrations over the next few months after a relative lull this year as the new coronavirus and social distancing restrictions aimed at curbing its spread saw many protesters stay indoors. 
Authorities have repeatedly said the city is facing the risk of ""home-grown terrorism"" after several police reports of explosive materials being found.
More than 7,800 protesters have been arrested since opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill escalated in June last year, with 564 of those charged with rioting, which carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.
Although Leung was jailed before the demonstrations erupted last year, many regard him as a ""spiritual leader"" of the movement.

One of his old slogans - ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times"" - is one of the most popular chants of the new generation of protesters.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China announced on Wednesday that its parliament will open a key annual session on May 22, signalling that Beijing sees the country returning to normal after being reduced to a near-standstill for months by the COVID-19 epidemic.
During the gathering of the National People's Congress in the capital, delegates will ratify major legislation, and the government will unveil economic targets, set defence spending projections and make personnel changes. The ruling Communist Party also typically announces signature policy initiatives.
The session was initially scheduled to start on March 5 but was postponed due to COVID-19, which has infected nearly 83,000 people and killed more than 4,600 on the mainland after emerging late last year in the central city of Wuhan.
As the epidemic has subsided, economic and social life gradually returned to normal, making it possible for the congress to convene, the official Xinhua news agency quoted the standing committee of the NPC, the legislature's top decision-making body, as saying.
The committee also appointed Huang Runqiu as the new minister for ecology and environment, a post vacated when predecessor Li Ganjie became deputy Communist Party chief for Shandong province earlier this month, Xinhua reported.
Tang Yijun was also named as the new justice minister to replace Fu Zhenghua, who has reached the retirement age of 65 for ministers. 
The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), an advisory body to parliament, has proposed starting its annual session a day before the parliamentary session opens.
Analysts expect China to roll out additional fiscal stimulus in order to cushion the blow from COVID-19, which has developed in to a worldwide pandemic that some fear will trigger a severe global recession.
China's economy contracted for the first time on record during the January-March period, when the government imposed severe travel and transport restriction to curb the spread of the epidemic.
Parliament is also expected to discuss the anti-government protests in Hong Kong, amid growing speculation that Beijing take steps to strengthen its grip on the city. 
It is unclear how long parliament and its advisory body will meet for this time, and people familiar with the matter have told Reuters that this year's annual sessions could be the shortest in decades due to COVID-19 concerns. Usually more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing from all over China for at least 10 days.

Beijing city announced on Wednesday it will lower its COVID-19 emergency response level effective as of 0000 hours on Thursday and no longer require 14-day quarantine for some people arriving from low-risk areas of the country, removing a logistics hurdle for delegates travelling to the capital for the key political meetings next month.

ROME (Reuters) - Giacomo Dalla Torre, the Grand Master of the Knights of Malta who steered the global Catholic chivalric order and charity to reconciliation with the Vatican after a period of conflict, died on Wednesday.
The Knights said Dalla Torre, 75, had been ill for several months.
He was elected interim leader in 2017 following the abrupt resignation of Matthew Festing, whose final months of governance were marred by a dispute with the Vatican over the running of the group.
The group's Grand Masters usually rule for life and Festing, a Briton, was the first in several centuries to step down. 
The conflict laid bare tensions between a reformist Pope, Francis, and his conservative critics, led by American Cardinal Raymond Burke, the Knights' chaplain.
After the Burke faction lost an internal power struggle, Dalla Torre reconciled the group with the Vatican and began a process of reform.
Dalla Torre was the 80th grand master of the group, whose formal name is Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of St. John of Jerusalem, of Rhodes and of Malta.
It was founded in Jerusalem nearly 1,000 years ago to provide medical aid for pilgrims in the Holy Land. 
It now has a multi-million dollar budget, 13,500 members, 80,000 volunteers and 42,000 medical staff running refugee camps, drug treatment centres, disaster relief programs and clinics around the world.
Since the upheavals that led to Festing's resignation, the order - which is a sovereign entity and has bilateral diplomatic relations with 110 states - has been working on a new constitution.
Reformers, backed by the Vatican, want to revamp its constitution to make its government more transparent and better able to respond to the massive growth it has seen in recent years.
They also want to make it possible for commoners to reach top positions. Under the current monarchical hierarchy, the top Knights are required to have noble lineage. The late Grand Master had the rank of prince and his full name was Giacomo Dalla Torre del Tempio di Sanguinetto.

Under normal conditions, senior members be required to gather in Rome in three months to elect a new grand master but the period likely will be extended because of the coronavirus pandemic, a source in the order said.

German magazine Focus Online cited police as saying a group of five to seven men had attacked passers-by with knives. The magazine also said none of those injured was in a life-threatening condition.
Four people were taken to a clinic in Hanau, near the financial hub of Frankfurt in western Germany, with injuries including stab wounds, said the police in a statement.
One of the suspects who was detained was 23 years old, the other 29 years old, added police.

Then, a 43-year old man with racist views shot dead nine people in shisha bars in Hanau before killing himself and his mother, an attack that shook Germany.

Erdogan's letter arrived on Tuesday with a delivery of Turkish medical gear, including protective suits and masks, to help the NATO ally contain its COVID-19 outbreak. The Palace's office in Ankara released the letter on Wednesday. 
The U.S. Congress has threatened to impose sanctions on Turkey over its purchase of S-400 defence systems from Russia, but the pandemic has delayed the plan to activate the systems as Ankara focuses on battling the disease at home.
""I hope that in the upcoming period, with the spirit of solidarity we have displayed during the pandemic, Congress and the U.S. media will better understand the strategic importance of our relations,"" the Turkish president said in the letter.
He said he hoped that they acted ""in a way that our common fight against our common problems necessitates.""
Turkish-U.S. relations have also been soured in recent years by disagreements over Syria, notably U.S. support for a Kurdish militia there, and the U.S. conviction of a Turkish bank executive.
Earlier this month, Turkish officials said Turkey has held talks with the United States about possibly securing a swap line from the U.S. Federal Reserve and has discussed other funding options to mitigate the pandemic's economic fallout.

The Fed has ramped up swaps lines - in which it accepts other currencies in exchange for dollars - to central banks in several countries to backstop financial markets amid the crisis, but Turkey has not been among the recipients.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A U.S. government commission has criticised India for failing to protect religious minorities and called for sanctions on government officials responsible for violating religious freedoms enshrined in its constitution.
The Indian government rejected the annual report from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom saying it had distorted reality to new levels. 
Since it was re-elected to power last year, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has introduced policies hurtful to the country's 172 million Muslims and allowed a campaign of hate and violence against them, the commission said in its report released late on Tuesday.
It criticised a new citizenship law that parliament enacted last year laying out a path for citizenship for six religious groups from neighbouring countries excluding Muslims. 
""The national and various state governments also allowed nationwide campaigns of harassment and violence against religious minorities to continue with impunity, and engaged in and tolerated hate speech and incitement to violence against them,"" the commission said.
The commission is a bipartisan U.S. government advisory body that monitors religious freedom abroad and makes policy recommendations to the president, the secretary of state, and Congress. But these are not binding.
India should be designated a ""country of particular concern"", the worst category in its survey, because of the sharp downturn in religious freedom in 2019, the commission said. 
Myanmar, China, Iran, Pakistan, Syria, Russia and Vietnam are among the 14 countries in that category.
The commission also urged the U.S. government to ""impose targeted sanctions on Indian government agencies and officials responsible for severe violations of religious freedom by freezing those individuals’ assets and/ or barring their entry into the United States.""
It did not identify any agencies or officials it deemed responsible.
The Indian foreign ministry dismissed the findings of the commission saying it had crossed a new threshold. 
""Its biased and tendentious comments against India are not new. But on this occasion, its misrepresentation has reached new levels,"" ministry spokesman Anurag Srivastava said.
He said some of the members of the commission had dissented from its conclusions. Two of them wrote in their dissenting notes that India, the world's largest democracy, could not be put in the same group as China and North Korea run by authoritarian regimes.
""It has not been able to carry its own commissioners in its endeavour. We regard it as an organisation of particular concern and will treat it accordingly,"" Srivastava said.

Lebanon is grappling with renewed protests following a collapse in its currency, soaring inflation and spiralling unemployment, but its dire financial straits have only been worsened by a shutdown to rein in the coronavirus pandemic.
The growing unrest threatens to tip Lebanon into more serious conflict, even as Beirut looks to pass an economic rescue plan and enter talks with foreign creditors after defaulting on hefty debt obligations last month.
An accumulation of bad financial decisions, inaction and entrenched corruption and cronyism, were the cause of Lebanon's crisis, Al Arabiya quoted David Schenker, the U.S. assistant secretary for Near Eastern affairs, as saying.
""For Lebanon to be in a position to receive assistance from international financial institutions it must prove that it is ready to make difficult choices and decisions to show it is 100% committed to reform,"" it quoted him saying in an interview.
Its subsidiary channel, Al Hadath, also interviewed Schenker, who specified reforms to the power sector, customs, telecommunications and tax collection.
Lebanon's government, formed in January with the support of the powerful Iranian-backed movement Hezbollah, has struggled to make economic reforms demanded by foreign donors. The United States has classified Hezbollah as a terrorist group.

The U.S. official also welcomed a ceasefire announcement by the Saudi-led coalition that has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen for five years. The truce was prompted by the pandemic and as a measure to support U.N. peace efforts.

""What I came away with was a genuine and strong sense that her Majesty was really interested in knowing how we were doing and was heartened to know that we were doing ok,"" Ardern said at a news conference. 
New Zealand was under a strict lockdown that saw offices, schools, malls, restaurants, playgrounds and all other public areas shut for over a month. The lockdown was lifted on Tuesday.
The Pacific country reported two new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, taking the total to 1,126, and 19 deaths, far lesser than many other countries as it successfully contained the virus by locking down its borders and its economy.
New Zealand has been independent of British rule since 1947, but retains the Queen as its constitutional monarch and head of state. She has visited the country as monarch several times.
In a post on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram on Tuesday Ardern said it was a ""treat to speak with Her Majesty"".

People arriving from elsewhere in China will no longer be required to be quarantined for two weeks unless they come from high-risk areas such as Heilongjiang in the north and some parts of Guangdong in the southeast, the sources said, requesting anonymity as the information has not been disclosed publicly. 
Beijing's municipal government did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
Currently, even Chinese citizens who reside in Beijing are not allowed to return home without first quarantining except under special circumstances, and those who refuse to do so or follow official rules to curb the contagion can be punished.
The easing in quarantine rules will not apply for travellers from overseas, the sources said. 
Beijing started in March to quarantine all travellers from overseas, including Chinese citizens, at designated locations for 14 days.
As domestic confirmed cases of the virus decline, restrictions across the country have slowly eased. Beijing has not reported any locally-transmitted cases of the virus since April 15.

State media reported on Wednesday that parliament will start its key annual session on May 22, the latest sign that the country is trying to return to business as normal. The gatherings of the National People's Congress traditionally see more than 5,000 delegates descend on Beijing from all over China for at least 10 days.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - As food stalls around him have closed during the coronavirus outbreak in Singapore, 28-year-old cook Jason Chua has vowed to stay open for the many that now depend on him. 
The tattoo-covered, former boxer has been serving up dozens of free meals for those in need since early April, when the city-state imposed a lockdown aimed at curbing virus cases now among the highest in Asia.
Known as ""Beng Who Cooks"", beng being Singaporean slang for hooligan, Chua said that the pandemic has not been great for business although he is getting by. 
""Yes, we are losing, we are not exactly taking salary for a few months already, but we still do maybe 10 to 25 orders per day for our business side, so that we can still sustain ourselves throughout this period of time,"" said Chua. 
He was inspired to start giving out free meals after a close friend described his experience of buying food for a homeless man. Now (NYSE:DNOW) he's making about 50-60 free meals a day through a foundation, ""Beng Who Cares,"" co-run by his friend Sean Hung. 
Singapore is facing the deepest recession in its 55-year history, compounded by a lockdown due to last until June 1 that has forced many businesses to close. 
Authorities have also warned that unemployment will likely rise due to these strict containment measures and an uncertain economic outlook.

Chua said the foundation refuses to accept donations since they believe it ""isn't right"" for people to give during current times of economic hardship, but there have been a few ""forceful"" donors of cash, oil and rice.

The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress decided to hold this year’s meeting on May 22, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. The government usually uses the meeting to announce its annual growth target, defense spending projections and other key policy decisions then.
The gathering of some 3,000 officials is usually held in March. The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body that usually meets at the same time, was planning to start its annual session on May 21.
Any growth target released at the meeting will be closely watched after the virus outbreak pushed China’s economy into its first contraction in decades last quarter, with GDP shrinking 6.8% from a year ago. China’s economy is expected to expand 1.8% in 2020, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists, which would be the worst performance since 1976.
China’s top leaders have already softened their tone on the importance of reaching specific growth targets this year in the latest Politburo meeting on April 17, saying that the nation is facing “unprecedented” economic difficulty, and signaled that more stimulus is in the works.
The NPC had been expected to deliberate this year on a draft Civil Code, consisting of sections on property, contracts, personality rights, marriage and family, inheritance and torts, based on an agenda released before the epidemic.

1124,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 28, 2020 09:25PM ET</span>",Syria extends night curfew but allows businesses to reopen,"By Suleiman Al-Khalidi
AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian government said on Wednesday it extended a nationwide curfew to stem the spread of coronavirus but had eased a tight lockdown by allowing all businesses and public markets to go back to work.
The government imposed the nationwide curfew just over a month ago after it announced its first official confirmed coronavirus case following weeks of denying claims of a cover-up by medical sources and witnesses who said there were many more cases.
U.N. bodies and humanitarian workers have warned the country, which has now reported 43 confirmed cases and three deaths, is at high risk with a fragile health sector and lack of sufficient resources in the event of a major outbreak.
Under pressure to soften the economic impact on the sanctions-hit country ravaged by a nine-year civil war, the authorities more than a week ago allowed a partial return to work for a wide range of professions and businesses.
The government said the decision will allow once bustling bazaars to fully reopen. The lockdown has hit a merchant class that have traditionally relied on a surge in spending during the fasting month of Ramadan that began last week.
""The ministerial committee agrees to the opening of all popular markets and all commercial industrial enterprises and services firms,"" said the government statement adding that the opening hours were restricted between 8 am to 5 pm.
""All enterprises and shops must stick to public safety and disinfecting their shops,"" the statement said.
In recent weeks, the strict measures have led to panic buying during the day people are allowed to shop before the curfew, leading to shortages and price hikes as the local currency came under renewed pressure against the dollar.
Many daily wage earners have been left struggling without income and deepening poverty among the country's population.
Damascus's moves included restricting movements between provinces and halting military conscription and the call up of reserves to stem the pandemic within the ranks of the army.
The cabinet also decided to begin a phased resumption of work in government ministries that had been closed, with the aim of a full return to work after the end of Ramadan late in May.
The government, however, decided to end the school year for students, who had earlier been expected to return to school after May 2.
The authorities also said it hoped in the coming few days to lift a quarantine of the Sayeda Zainab suburb of Damascus where a major Shi'ite shrine visited by Iranian and Iraqi pilgrims is believed by U.N. officials to have been a main source of the contagion.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Tuesday Washington was 'concerned' over the Southern (NYSE:SO) Transitional Council (STC), a separatist group, declaring self-rule in Yemen's south, warning such actions threatened efforts to revive talks between the Yemeni government and Houthi rebels. 
""Such unilateral actions only exacerbate instability in Yemen,"" Pompeo said in a statement. ""They are especially unhelpful at a time when the country is threatened by COVID-19 and also threaten to complicate the efforts of the UN Special Envoy to revive political negotiations between the government and the Houthi rebels.""
The Saudi-led coalition has announced a unilateral truce prompted by a United Nations plea to focus on the coronavirus pandemic. The Houthis have not accepted it and violence has continued.
Yemen's internationally recognized government warned of ""catastrophic consequences"" after the STC on Sunday declared emergency rule in southern governorates including Aden, interim seat of the government that was ousted from power in the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthi group in late 2014.
""We call on the STC and the Republic of Yemen government to re-engage in the political process provided under the Riyadh Agreement,"" Pompeo said.
On Monday, the Saudi-led coalition engaged in Yemen urged the STC to rescind its move, saying it was an ""escalatory action"" at a time when all parties should focus on confronting the novel coronavirus.
Yemen has been mired in violence that has killed more than 100,000 since the coalition intervened in March 2015 on the side of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government. There has been military stalemate for years and the Houthis hold most big urban centres.
The STC, which is backed by Riyadh's main coalition partner the United Arab Emirates, has long sought self-rule in the south and accuses Hadi's government of mismanagement and corruption, a charge it denies.
While Yemen has reported only one confirmed COVID-19 case, aid groups fear a catastrophe if it spreads among a malnourished population in a country with a shattered health system.

The United Nations is trying to convene virtual talks on the truce, coordinated coronavirus efforts and confidence-building steps to restart talks to end the war.

The shooter, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, also killed pets, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said in an update to their investigation into the killings. The shooting took place over 13 hours on April 18 and 19 in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, before Wortman was shot dead by police.
Over 400 witness have been identified and more than half interviewed, police said, though they are yet to determine a motive.
Wortman evaded capture after police responded to an initial emergency call in Portapique, a rural seaside community of about 100 residents. After hiding in an industrial area overnight, he continued the killing spree the next morning, police confirmed on Tuesday.
The gunman began the rampage after assaulting his girlfriend, who was able to escape him and is a key witness, police said last week.
The police investigation is focused on establishing how Wortman obtained the weapons used in the murders, and whether anyone assisted him or knew of his plans.
The victims included a veteran police officer, a teacher, and a nurse.
""Though the gunman will never stand trial, we still have a duty to complete this investigation by the same standards that we would if he was,"" Nova Scotia RCMP Superintendent Darren Campbell told the briefing in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The mayor of one of the Czech capital's districts said on Tuesday he had been put under police protection due to a threat that a Russian man had been sent to kill him, escalating a row between Prague and Moscow.
Mayor Ondrej Kolar of Prague 6 irked Russia in recent months after his district removed a statue of Soviet World War Two commander Marshal Ivan Konev from a square. 
That prompted criminal investigation by Russian authorities who saw it as an insult. Prague said such investigation of elected representatives was unacceptable. 
""I can really only tell you that I have been given police protection. It was provided to me on the basis of certain realities ... that there is Russian man here whose task is to liquidate me,"" Kolar said in an audio recording played on Prima television.
Kolar's comments followed reports in Czech news outlets - the weekly Respekt and the online daily Denikn.cz - that tied police protection of Kolar and the city of Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib to the arrival of a Russian man carrying a diplomatic passport in early April, seen by security services as a threat, the media said.
Reuters could not verify the media reports, based on unnamed sources.
Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said on Tuesday the country would not allow interference in its politics.
""It is impossible - if true - for some foreign country to take some actions here against our citizens,"" Babis told a televised news conference. 
Both Prague 6 and the city of Prague confirmed on Monday Kolar and Hrib were under police protection.
Kolar said Hrib was also a target as well as mayor Pavel Novotny of another Prague district, Reporyje. 
A spokesman for the Prague city hall declined to comment on the reasons for the protection for Hrib on Monday, citing a police decision.
The city council led by Hrib in February renamed a square outside the Russian embassy in honor of murdered Russian opposition politician Boris Nemtsov. 
The counter-intelligence agency BIS refused to comment on the media reports on Monday. Police declined to comment.
The Czech Foreign Ministry said a Russian diplomat accredited in Prague did return several weeks ago from a business trip and was picked up by colleagues at the airport. 
""It looks like another hoax,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Monday when asked about the Respekt report.

The Russian embassy in Prague protested the Respekt report in a statement on Monday and did not respond to Reuters questions on Tuesday.

Since 2017, infrequent but violent raids on government buildings and villages by militias with suspected links to the Islamic State have intensified in the gas-rich northernmost province of one Africa's poorest nations.
The interior ministry said the 129 killings were the total for the month, and were a retaliation for an attack in Xitaxi in Muidumbe district earlier in April, where insurgents killed 52 villagers.
Little is known about the insurgents, though initial attacks were claimed by a group known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama. More recently, Islamic State has claimed a number of attacks. 
Security officials have struggled to contain the attacks. Since clinching re-election in January President Filipe Nyusi has vowed to dedicate more resources to fighting the insurgency.
 Exxon Mobil  (NYSE:XOM) and Total, among the multi-national oil majors developing the gas projects off the shore of northern Mozambique thought to be worth more than $60 billion, have expressed concern the violence could affect operations. 
Interior minister Amade Miquidade said in a statement that 39 extremists were killed when they attempted to invade Muidumbe village on April 7, with 59 killed in a gun battle in Querimba islands three days later. Thirty-one more were killed in Ibo Island between April 11 and April 13, the statement said.

The Bolivians, touting large, multi-colored suitcases, had pitched tents and spent the night there despite a nationwide, night-time curfew in place since March. Many failed to observe social distance guidelines.
Migrants have been gathering in Chile for several weeks after Bolivia tightened its border shortly after the outbreak hit the region.
Evelyn Matthei, mayor of Providencia, the leafy, upscale neighborhood of Santiago where the migrants have gathered, pleaded with Bolivia to intervene, calling the situation a humanitarian crisis.
""We urgently and desperately ask President Jeanine Anez of Bolivia to please ... allow them to return to their country, because that is what they want,"" Matthei said.
Former Bolivian President Evo Morales, ousted in 2019, criticized the government's response, saying on Twitter the consulate ""remained closed, and was not helping"" the nearly 300 men, women and children gathered there.
Chilean health officials said they worried the growing group of Bolivians could present a health risk. 
Though Providencia is not under quarantine, other parts of Santiago, a city of 6 million, are under lockdown, with rules in place prevent gatherings of more than 50 people. 
Cool, late fall weather has settled on the Southern (NYSE:SO) Hemisphere city, leaving the Bolivians exposed to frigid night-time temperatures. 
Health Undersecretary Paula Daza said Chile's foreign ministry was working with its Bolivian counterpart to find a solution.

Haftar said on Monday his Libyan National Army (LNA) was accepting a ""popular mandate"" to rule over the country, apparently brushing aside the civilian authorities which nominally govern eastern Libya.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Tuesday restrictions on citizens' movements would be lifted and more shops allowed to reopen from May 4 in a gradual easing of a lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.
Greece has so far registered 2,566 coronavirus cases including 138 deaths, much fewer than many other European nations, thanks partly to the swift imposition of its lockdown on March 23.
But the lockdown has paralysed an economy that only emerged in the summer of 2018 from a decade-long debt crisis, dashing expectations for strong growth this year. The government now expects a deep recession of up to 10% of national output.
""This is not the epilogue of our adventure but the continuation. Our emergence from quarantine will be done step by step. No one can rule out the risk of the threat rekindling,"" Mitsotakis said in a televised address.
""A return (to normal life) must not lead to a relapse.""
Although most restrictions on Greeks' free movement will be lifted on May 4, they will not be allowed to leave their wider region of residence, the conservative premier said. 
Some retail stores, including book shops and hair salons, will reopen on May 4 and others later in the month. Schools will open gradually, starting on May 11.
Greece relies heavily on tourism but has seen large-scale booking cancellations because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Its borders remain closed to citizens of non-EU nations including the United States and Britain as well as of Spain and Italy as part of the lockdown measures. The government made no mention on Tuesday of when those restrictions would be lifted. 
Greece says it is critical that the European Union adopt a common position soon on travel and reopening borders within the bloc. [L3N2C900W]
Year-round hotels, restaurants, cafes and shopping malls will reopen on June 1, but distance rules will apply and staff will have to wear masks.

The government said it would provide more details later on how it plans to revive the tourism sector, which employs one in five workers in Greece. Last year tourism revenues totalled 18 billion euros on the back of more than 34 million visitors.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Major powers must suspend economic sanctions against countries including Syria, Iran and Venezuela during the coronarivus pandemic which threatens to worsen hunger and suffering for the poor, an international refugee charity said on Tuesday.
Jan Egeland, a former U.N. aid chief who now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), said that despite sanctions exemptions for medical and food supplies, aid groups still face hurdles to help vulnerable people during the health crisis.
""My main message is that the abject poverty and hunger tsunami that comes in the wake of the pandemic is in many poor places going to be worse I think, I fear, than the virus may be,"" Egeland told a virtual news briefing in Geneva.
After battering China, Western Europe and the United States, infections and deaths from COVID-19 are now rising in Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America and some Asian countries, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.
""What we are asking for is the lifting of economic sanctions on entire peoples, nations really,"" Egeland said, in reference to the largely U.S.- and European Union-led punitive sanctions generally aimed at squeezing trade or freezing assets.
""I am not talking about targeted sanctions against elites, or leaders or military sanctions, or sanctions on atomic energy or whatever,"" he added.
""Sanctions on Iran, Venezuela, Syria and elsewhere may have all sorts of good motives, but it is undeniably making it more difficult for us to work, to serve ordinary people in this age of the coronavirus.""
In Syria, sanctions had stopped the NRC from acquiring software for online children's education programmes, Egeland said, complaining that procedures for humanitarian exemptions were often too slow and bureaucratic.
""All sorts of private companies including banks that we need to help us to do our work in these countries, are risk-adverse, and it makes it difficult for us to work,"" he said.
""Basically the blanket economic sanctions have to have a moratorium, a suspension, a pause - call it the coronavirus pause,"" he said. 
Egeland said he had sent ""strong letters"" to 40 nations and UN agencies that donate to the NRC which deploys nearly 15,800 aid workers helping refugees and internally displaced.

""I urged them to step up international funding and relief and be much more flexible and unbureaucratic and less micro-managing than they have been because we're in the middle of a hurricane and we're trying to manoeuvre,"" he said.

The health workers' nude pictures, with carefully positioned props like books and flowers to conceal their private parts, appear on a website urging politicians to ensure doctors and clinics have enough protective gear.
""I learned how to stitch wounds, why do I now have to learn how to stitch masks?"" reads a placard held by a female doctor with a stethoscope and a red mask in one photo.
With just over 156,000 confirmed cases and an official death toll of 5,900, Germany has withstood the pandemic much better than the United States, Italy, Spain and France.
But just like those countries, it has suffered from a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE).
The naked doctors said that outpatient and general practice care for COVID-19 patients was as important as hospital care, putting them on the frontline in the fight to contain the coronavirus pandemic.
They said their protest was inspired by Alain Colombie, a French doctor who last month posted nude pictures of himself to protest the lack of protective equipment. 
Chancellor Angela Merkel's government wants to provide financial assistance to producers of protective equipment and has ramped up its orders for PPE abroad. A German military plane brought 10 million medical masks from China on Monday.
The Finance Ministry has made available an additional 8 billion euros ($8.7 billion) for medical protection gear to help hospitals and doctors contain the spread of the coronavirus.
German states have made wearing a mask compulsory on public transport and in shops.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A woman who took rat poison this week outside Thailand's finance ministry over the slow rollout of aid during the coronavirus lockdown was promised on Tuesday she would get her money soon. For millions of other Thais, the waiting continues.
Thailand announced last month it would give 15,000 baht ($462.82) to those whose jobs have been affected by the coronavirus outbreak and containment measures, which included orders for malls and other businesses to shut down a month ago.
The relief, worth $7.4 billion in all, has not come fast enough for many Thais, whose everyday struggles have been worsened by sudden lack of income when domestic economic activities came to a halt.
The woman who poisoned herself on Monday was protesting against the long process for an application she had submitted a month ago, accusing the government of disregard for her plight.
She is recovering in hospital and will receive her payment by Wednesday, a finance ministry spokesman said on Tuesday.
Attachak Sattayanurak, a lecturer at Chiang Mai University whose academic research on the urban poor has led him to meet many Thais who applied to the aid programme, said the woman who took the poison symbolised a far bigger problem. 
""The public suicide attempt reflected absolute despair of one small person trying to send a message that the government doesn't take care of ordinary people,"" he said.
Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said in a televised address on Tuesday that he was well aware of the struggles people were facing, particularly those on low incomes.
""We're taking care of people from all sectors, whether farmers, freelancers, formal or informal labourers,"" he said.
Business groups have estimated that 10 million people, or 26% of the country's workforce, will have been out of work if the outbreak drags on a few months, due to restrictions on sectors including retail and construction.
In all, 24 million people applied for the relief aid and as of this week, 7.5 million have received the first of three monthly payments of 5,000 baht ($154.27), Finance Minister Uttama Savanayana said on Tuesday.
A total of 16 million applications were found to meet the criteria, but only 10.6 million of them have been approved, while the rest are still being evaluated, the minister said.
The government on Tuesday lifted the maximum number of workers able to get the benefits to 16 million from 14 million and also pledged help for 10 million farmers separately.
Thailand has pledged measures worth at least 2.4 trillion baht ($74.05 billion), equal to more than 14% of the country's GDP, to help individuals and businesses affected by the pandemic. 
University lecturer Attachak said Thailand needed to act fast.
""The COVID-19 outbreak has made inequality in Thailand more stark ... Those in need must be helped across the board and promptly,"" he said. 
Economists forecast a grim year ahead with the worst contraction since the 1997/98 Asian financial crisis due to a decline in exports and prolonged impact on tourism, a growth engine for Southeast Asia's second-largest economy. 
""All these will be further exacerbated by lockdown measures which disrupt domestic economic activities,"" said Nomura economist Charnon Boonnuch.
The country has so far recorded 2,938 cases of COVID-19 and 54 deaths.

In a statement on Twitter, the ministry said the blast occurred in a crowded area in Afrin's centre. A video shared by the ministry showed black smoke billowing in the air while ambulance and police sirens wailed in the background.
Ankara views the YPG as a terrorist group linked to Kurdish militants on its own soil and has mounted military operations in northern Syria to push it back from the border.
Turkey's military and its Syrian rebel allies seized Afrin, a mainly Kurdish district, from the YPG in March 2018 in a major offensive. 
Tuesday's blast was one of the deadliest to hit a region under the control of Turkish-backed forces. Ankara frequently blames the YPG for the attacks, while the militia says it does not target civilians.

HALLSTATT, Austria (Reuters) - A tiny Austrian lakeside village so picturesque it had to limit throngs of tourists is now longing for visitors to return to its empty lanes.
Hallstatt, population 780, estimates it had a million day-trip visitors last year, before the coronavirus pandemic halted international tourism. Other European hotspots once suffocated by selfie-snapping visitors face a similar fate.
Most tourists came on bus tours stopping for a view that gained renown in Asia thanks to a South Korean TV series filmed there and a partial replica https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-china-austria/made-in-china-an-austrian-village-idUSLNE85301M20120604 of it built in China.
Nestled in the Salzkammergut region of lakes and mountains east of Salzburg, Hallstatt often attracted attention for efforts to restrict the number of buses stopping there and to monetize those short visits, such as by charging 1 euro to use the toilet. 
Now (NYSE:DNOW) it wonders when it will face that challenge again.
""Recently it was too much, and it was perceived as too much and as a curse, and we kept taking measures,"" Hallstatt's Mayor Alexander Scheutz said.
Austria acted early in its coronavirus outbreak to shut restaurants, bars, non-essential shops, museums and other gathering places six weeks ago. That helped flatten the curve of infections, which are increasing at less than 1% daily.
The government said that justified a step-by-step loosening of the lockdown, starting with DIY and garden centres as well as smaller shops, which were allowed to reopen two weeks ago.
Restaurants, cafes and bars are due to reopen on May 15, followed by hotels on May 29. But the borders remain essentially closed in a country heavily reliant on tourism.
""We in Hallstatt of course depend 95% on foreign guests...from Asia, from America, from England and from the surrounding European countries,"" said Markus-Paul Derbl, who owns a restaurant, souvenir shop and other businesses.
""If the borders stay closed it will be very, very difficult to keep business going properly.""
Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has said he hopes the border with Germany - Austria's biggest source of foreign tourists - will reopen soon, but Germany has been cool on the idea. It is unlikely Germans alone could fill the gap for Hallstatt, which had 145,000 overnight stays last year.
""That is rather hopeless perhaps but I do think we have a name and are known, and of course we are glad when guests from Germany come here,"" Mayor Scheutz said.

""If I had to give a prediction (for the summer) it would be a very sad, bad one but I am an optimistic person - the landscape is beautiful, we are a (UNESCO) World Heritage site https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/806, the people are welcoming.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Negotiations between the European Union (EU) and ex-member Britain over new trade arrangements from next year are at an impasse due to disagreements and the coronavirus crisis, according to diplomats and officials in the bloc's hub Brussels.
Halted when the epidemic started, the EU's tortuous Brexit talks with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government were renewed a week ago but have quickly hit snags, the sources said. 
""We are at an impasse,"" said one diplomat following the negotiations aimed at agreeing new trading terms between Britain and the 27 member states of the bloc from 2021 when London's current, status-quo transition period after Brexit ends.
""There are plenty of minor technical details where we could find solutions. But on the fundamental goals each side is trying to achieve - the differences are enormous. Things cannot move without a political push. And it's missing."" 
After last week's talks, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier warned that London had to budge to bridge gaps for a deal to be sealed in the little time available. 
Johnson's spokesman countered on Monday that the London team was ready to keep talking ""but that doesn't make us any more likely to agree to the EU's proposals in areas where they are not taking into account the UK's status as an independent state.""
""Clearly there will need to be political movement on the EU's side to move negotiations forward, particularly on fisheries and level playing field issues in order to help find a balanced solution.""
More negotiations are due to take place by early June. 
EU officials note there is still time for London and Brussels to meet a deadline at the end of that month to agree on extending negotiations beyond the end of the year. 
But Johnson, who had a life-threatening bout of COVID-19 and is under fire at home for his handing of the outbreak - has ruled that out. 
""Maybe we should just believe him when he says he won't extend the transition period,"" said an EU official involved in the negotiations. ""In which case, we are a bit puzzled as to what comes next ... The tight schedule is even more tricky now with coronavirus, there is no space to waste time.""
NO BREAKTHROUGH IN SIGHT
While the bloc says only a relatively modest free trade agreement is possible before the end of the year, it attaches conditions to it - including on rigid guarantees of fair competition - that have been rejected by Britain.
There has been no progress in talks on these so-called level playing field provisions, according to the EU sources, or on guarantees for personal data protection as well as human rights.
While London is seeking agreements on the various areas it finds beneficial, the bloc insists on a single, overarching deal that would cover more ground.
Among a myriad of contentious issues, the bloc refuses Britain's request for continued access to the EU's police and border database, the Schengen Information System.
It says coronavirus restrictions on physical meetings and the strain it has put on governments mean the necessary ratification of any deal by EU states and the European Parliament would require more time than earlier thought. 
From its side, Britain has refused a request by the European Commission for an office in Belfast to allow EU experts to monitor controls on the sensitive Irish border.

""Talks are not advancing and there seems little idea for the time being on how to get a breakthrough,"" said a second EU diplomat.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Defectors from North Korea say many of their relatives and contacts were unaware of the international speculation over leader Kim Jong Un's health or were unwilling to discuss the issue in clandestine calls made from the South.
Two defectors told Reuters their relatives in North Korea did not know that Kim has been missing from public view for almost two weeks, said they didn't want to discuss the issue, or abruptly hung up when the supreme leader was mentioned.
Kim's health is a state secret in insular North Korea and speculation about him or his family can invite swift retribution.
Another defector said some people in the North have nevertheless been privately talking of Kim's whereabouts after he failed to appear at a key state holiday on April 15, but only in very closed circles.
Kim's absence from public ceremonies on the birth anniversary of his grandfather and founder of the country, Kim Il Sung, was unprecedented. That has led to days of speculation in the international community over his health and whether the nuclear-capable state was headed toward instability.
""I talked to my sister and my niece this morning and they had no clue about these reports and rumours about Kim Jong Un's health,"" Lee Soon-hee, 59, told Reuters on Monday. ""When I told them, they were so cautious about discussing it. North Koreans have a very limited knowledge of these things.""
Lee defected to the South in 2009.
South Korean officials say they have not detected any ""unusual movements"" in North Korea, and one foreign resident living in Pyongyang told Reuters that life appeared to be going on as usual.
The South Korean minister in charge of North Korean affairs said on Tuesday fear of catching the coronavirus could have kept Kim away from the April 15 state ceremonies. 
Kim Heung-kwang, who defected to South Korea in 2004 and now runs an academic group that researches North Korea, said he spoke to two contacts in North Korea about the speculation.
One, a government official, said that he had been wondering about Kim Jong Un's lack of public appearances and had noticed an increase in calls from security officials to stay focused on internal policies, Kim Heung-kwang told Reuters.
Another person was not aware of the reports and warned him ""not to be fooled by such lies,"" Kim said. 
Lim Hee-joo, a defector who runs a restaurant in Seoul, said almost no one in North Korea had any idea about Kim Jong Un’s health or whereabouts.
""Not even the people in the central party,"" she said. ""They are so scared that they don’t even think of looking into it or think about it, to begin with, as they fear they might get arrested."" 
North Koreans are keenly aware they could face punishment for discussing the Kim family in any way except to shower them with glowing praise, said Sokeel Park, of Liberty in North Korea, a group that works with defectors.
""That doesn’t mean people don't take that risk, some people do,"" Park said. ""But it's still a super sensitive issue.""

""It's a little like the pope not showing up for Christmas."" he said of Kim's absence from the April 15 celebrations.

Most countries across Latin America have been forced to shutter their economies, dashing hopes for growth and sending forecasts for unemployment spiraling upward. 
The U.N. agency said there should still be plenty of food available in both regional and international reserves but warned hobbled supply chains could complicate access to those stores, especially for the poor.
""Sanitary measures to prevent the spread of the virus have direct consequences on the functioning of food systems,"" the FAO said in the document, which was delivered to the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.
The virus arrived later in Latin America than in Europe or Asia, but the region has already confirmed 150,000 cases of coronavirus and more than 7,200 deaths to date.
According to the FAO, a third of the population of Latin America and the Caribbean already live in a precarious state of ""food insecurity."" 
Those populations are especially vulnerable and countries need to prioritize access to food and aid to the poor as the crisis intensifies, the agency warned in the document.
""It is critical that governments declare food and agriculture as strategic and of national public interest ... so that this health crisis doesn't turn into a food crisis,"" the report said.
The U.N. agency said the global pandemic could hit both supply and demand. It warned many in Latin America would see their purchasing power wiped out, while local farmers might have more trouble accessing labor, farm inputs like fertilizer and capital.
Food prices are also likely to waver, the organization said, as supply chains are disrupted globally, forcing countries to tap new sources of food.
In 2018, the countries with the highest rates of hunger were Haiti (49.3%), Venezuela (21.2% ), Nicaragua (17%), Bolivia (17.1%) and Guatemala (15.2%), the agency said.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte defended himself on Tuesday from widespread criticism of his highly cautious plans for a slow-placed end to Europe's longest coronavirus lockdown.
The government has said strict curbs put in place seven weeks ago to curb the disease would be eased from May 4, when parks, factories and construction sites reopen.
However shops must remain shuttered until May 18, while restaurants, bars and hairdressers will stay closed until June 1 and students won't be back at school before September.
The softly-softly approach has been criticised by businesses, lambasted by the opposition and even questioned by parties within Conte's fragile coalition, worried by the huge economic and social toll.
But the prime minister said he had no regrets.
""If I could turn the clock back, I'd do it all again,"" Conte told La Stampa daily. ""I cannot let myself be swayed by public opinion, even if I understand those feelings very well myself.""
Conte acknowledged the scientific committee advising him was ""rigid"", but said the overriding concern was to prevent a second wave of infections.
""If only one patient ... managed to set off an outbreak and trigger such a contagion that we were forced to close all of Italy, can you imagine what could happen with the 100,000 positive cases that we have at the moment,"" he said.
Italy has been one of the world's hardest-hit countries, registering almost 27,000 deaths and 200,000 cases since the first coronavirus patient was identified on Feb. 21. At present, some 105,813 people still have the disease.
However, the numbers have been falling over the past two weeks and some regional governors have announced they will ease restrictions faster than the government wants.
PAPAL BLESSING
While opposition parties such as the far-right League have repeatedly criticised Conte's handling of the crisis, the ruling coalition has remained largely united. However, voices of discontent emerged on Tuesday.
Nicola Zingaretti, head of the centre-left Democratic Party, said more flexibility might be needed. ""We also need to revisit the June 1 date, which seems a long way off,"" he told Corriere della Sera daily.
Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose small Italia Viva party is in the coalition, said the government plan was a ""political, economic and constitutional error"". 
He told la Repubblica daily that regions with very few cases should reopen more quickly and parliament should be able to modify the rules.
One of the most vocal critics of the prime minister's plan was the Roman Catholic Church, which was angered by a refusal to lift a ban on religious ceremonies, including the Mass. 
Conte has promised to review that decision and he got what appeared to be strong support from Pope Francis, who urged people to obey government instructions.

""In these days in which we are starting to have regulations to come out of quarantine, let us pray to the Lord that he gives his people, all of us, the grace of prudence and obedience ... so that the pandemic does not return,"" the pope said.

Known as ""mahya"", the tradition of stringing up devotional messages in lights from the soaring minarets of Istanbul's Ottoman-era mosques is unique to Turkey and dates back hundreds of years.
The process of hanging the lights is overseen by masters of the art. Working from sketches, they set lightbulbs on cords to spell out the desired message, before rolling them onto ropes draped between the minarets of the mosque using a pulley.
Suspended between the minarets, the lights normally declare religious messages in huge letters, visible from afar and intended to reward and inspire the faithful who have spent the daylight hours fasting.
This year, with Turkey at the peak of coronavirus outbreak at the start of the fasting month of Ramadan, the messages are different.
Kahraman Yildiz, one of the last remaining experts on the art, wears a mask for the first time in his long career as he hangs the lights between two minarets of the 400-year-old New Mosque in Istanbul's Fatih district.
""We were giving nice religious messages during the month of Ramadan. This month, something different happened because of this pandemic,"" he says.
""We are sharing (messages) related to that,"" Kahraman adds, unfurling the string of lights that read: ""Life fits at home"".
He then begins hanging the lights one by one on a rope between the minarets as he and his colleagues carefully abide by social distancing rules in a city which has borne the brunt of Turkey's 112,000 confirmed coronavirus cases.
The lights are lit every evening during Ramadan at the time of the call to prayer that announces the end to the day's fast.
""Mahyas have given beautiful messages with excerpts from verses (of the Koran)... for centuries. But this year for the first time, we have mahyas that we hung up aimed at protecting our health,"" said Burhan Ersoy, General Director of Foundations.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Eva Nabagala hoped she and her young son would be safe from her family when they fled Uganda for a Kenyan refugee camp - but instead, the 28-year-old says she was attacked and raped there as punishment for being a lesbian.
""I have been threatened with death, I have been beaten, I have been harassed sexually, and I have been sexually abused, raped,"" Nabagala told Reuters by phone.
She's one of a group of around 300 gay, lesbian and transgender refugees in Kakuma refugee camp in northwestern Kenya, who say other refugees repeatedly attack them because of their sexual orientation. The group say police and the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, have failed to protect them. 
UNHCR Kenya told Reuters that police investigate reports of violence, assault, or other crimes and UNHCR offers support to survivors.
""Whenever we are informed ... we do our utmost to provide medical, legal and social-economic support and psychosocial counselling to survivors,"" the agency said.
Kenya's national police spokesman Charles Owino said he was unaware of any violence against the group of refugees.
Nabagala said she and her now two-year-old son came to Kenya in 2018 after her family threatened to kill her because she is a lesbian. 
""I ran from my home ... because I wanted to be safe, I wanted protection, but it has turned into something the opposite,"" Nabagala said.
Stephen Sebuuma, another Ugandan refugee in Kakuma, said refugees armed with iron bars, sticks and machetes damaged their houses on three occasions, injuring four adults and two children. 
""Police insult us instead of helping us,"" Sebuuma, 32, told Reuters by phone. 
Pictures Sebuuma and another refugee sent to Reuters from the camp showed holes punched in the walls of homes made of corrugated iron. Kambungu Mubarak, 31, also from Uganda, said the attackers also burnt two houses.
UNHCR Kenya said as soon as they were informed of the attack, they contacted Kenya's Refugee Affairs Secretariat, and sent an ambulance. UNHCR also contacted police, who had started investigations, the agency said. But Sebuuma said the police never helped them. 
""We have written complaints, people have gotten OBs (Occurrence Book reports) from police. So many of them, and police even sometimes chase us, saying 'we are tired of you',"" he said. 
Same-sex relationships are punishable in Kenya by 14 years in jail. It is rarely enforced but discrimination is common. 
Kenya also requires refugees to stay in camps. Some have tried to leave but say life is so hard that they returned. Nabagala left but was raped again in Mombasa, where she had gone seeking shelter, so she came back. 
Another refugee, 23-year-old Winnie Nabaterega, told Reuters by phone that she fled Uganda in 2019 after being raped and becoming pregnant. Her father pressurised her to marry her attacker. Her daughter, now two, lives with her. She is constantly threatened by other refugees, she said. 

""We were told because we were homosexuals ... they would put poison in the water,"" she said.

JAFFA, Israel (Reuters) - Shortly after sunset, Muslims in the ancient Israeli port city of Jaffa filed quietly into an empty parking lot for Ramadan prayers, after the coronavirus outbreak forced mosques to close in Israel and the Palestinian territories.
Muslims typically pack into Jaffa's Ottoman-era shrines for evening worship during the month-long fasting holiday before pouring out into the old city and taking walks along the Mediterranean promenade.
But with mosques off-limits this year due to the pandemic, worshippers are improvising - gathering in large open spaces and praying outside Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque compound, Islam's third-holiest site.
Holding prayer rugs and wearing face masks, dozens of Muslims in Jaffa used parking spaces as social-distancing markers on Sunday night as they congregated for Tarawih prayers, held nightly after the faithful break their fast.
""We want to feel that it is Ramadan, despite the coronavirus pandemic,"" said Tarek Ghazi, who heads an Islamic committee in Jaffa that helped organise the parking lot prayers. Its members come from Israel's 21% Arab minority, most of whom are Muslim.
Committee volunteers donned reflective vests and stood along the lot's perimeter to make sure worshippers kept a safe distance apart, in line with Israeli government orders.
An imam recited verses from the Koran through a loudspeaker as worshippers responded ""amen"".
Israel has reported 208 deaths and 15,589 cases of the coronaries. Palestinian officials have reported two deaths and 342 cases in the occupied West Bank and the Gaze Strip.
In Jerusalem, Muslim faithful have taken to the Old City's back streets to pray as close as they can to the Aqsa mosque compound, where a March ban on prayer was extended for the entire month of Ramadan. 
In a normal year, thousands of Palestinians and foreign pilgrims would gather inside and around the compound's holy shrines, built on the site where Muslims believe the Prophet Mohammad ascended to heaven.
""I am powerless due to this disease,"" Abu Belal Abu Senanah, an Old City resident, said, as he prayed outside the holy esplanade, also revered by Jews as the site of biblical temples.

Jerusalem and other cities across Israel and the Palestinian territories have sites that are sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and all three religions have taken coronavirus precautions.

Hungary has restricted public gatherings and shut down businesses during the novel coronavirus pandemic, like most other countries. It has avoided the massive toll in Italy and Spain, with 2,649 cases as of early Tuesday and 291 deaths in a population of 10 million people.
Consequently, it has built up a supply of protective gear and hospital technology like respirators. With the healthcare system prepared for an increase in the number of cases, a gradual opening is now possible, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said.
The loosening will begin early next month, Orban said on Friday, adding that he expected the economy to recover rapidly from the effects of the pandemic.
Hungary's economic contraction this year is likely to be steeper than the government's projection last month of 3%, Finance Minister Mihaly Varga told Reuters on Friday. Its budget-deficit goal of 3% of gross domestic product is ""not carved in stone"", he added.
Starting next week, smaller retail outlets may open, Magyar Nemzet said, without naming its sources. Over the course of May, a gradual opening of hotels, restaurants and coffee shops may follow.
Everyone entering a business or restaurant must wear face protection of some kind, it said. The gradual opening may include longer opening hours and more kinds of shops allowed to open.
Food stores may have to calculate the safe maximum number of customers in the store at the same time. Stricter health protocols regulating restaurants and other businesses will probably be in place for the whole year.
Austria, which Orban has said is a model for his policies as it is further along the course of the epidemic, announced further easing on restrictions from April 30.

Magyar Nemzet is generally well-informed about government plans and almost always echoes the government's opinions. A government spokesman was not immediately available to comment.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - When Brazilian IT worker Helios and Russian saleswoman Luiza tied the knot in St Petersburg in mid-March, their plan was to emigrate to Texas, where he was due to start a new job in May.
But the coronavirus put paid to that, and now they are honeymooning in her one-bedroom flat in the locked-down city, taking brisk walks with Cherry the dog as their authorised form of daily exercise.
""I came here with one bag, with maybe five or six items of clothing. I was not prepared, but I don't think anyone was,"" said Helios, 34, who was previously based in Warsaw.
""For me it's a lifesaver that I am here because I have my wife, so I am happy.""
Luiza, 29, is happy too, though the fact that her job contract expires at the end of April is a worry. 
Helios says his U.S. job offer is still valid, but a potential start date has not been discussed. The Brazilian's biggest concern, however, is the health of his parents back home in Goiás, west of Brasilia.

""I am trying to call every day, I really miss them,"" he said. ""But now I have a new family with Luiza.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's most populous state said on Tuesday it will relax some restrictions on movement, as beaches reopened amid hopes a policy of widespread medical testing will help sustain a decline in new cases of the coronavirus.
Bondi Beach and two neighbouring beaches in Sydney were reopened to local residents on Tuesday after being closed a month ago due to large crowds breaking social distancing rules.
Australia recorded just one new case of COVID-19 from an unknown source in the past 24 hours, suggesting community transmission had almost stopped, Health Minister Greg Hunt said.
""We are winning but we have not won yet,"" he said.
New South Wales (NSW) state, which is home to nearly half of Australia's roughly 6,700 cases of COVID-19, said it would let up to two adults visit another person's home from Friday, relaxing a stay-at-home policy and ban on non-essential movement.
""For many people, they've been cooped up in their homes for a number of weeks, and with the exception of exercising, medical needs or buying what they need to or going to work, many people have been isolated in their homes,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.
""Two adults will be able to go and visit anybody else in their home on the basis of care, on the basis of reducing socialisation and everybody's mental health.""
Children were allowed to accompany adults on house visits, Berejiklian added.
Australia, which closed its external and internal borders, imposed an early shutdown of businesses, and issued strict social distancing rules, has avoided the high numbers of coronavirus cases and deaths seen in other countries.
Australian states are starting to relax some restrictions as the local rate of new infections slows to barely 1% per day, compared to 25% a month ago. 
The country recorded five new coronavirus fatalities on Tuesday after more residents from an aged care facility in the west of Sydney died from the virus.
There have now been 11 coronavirus deaths at the Anglicare Newmarch House, taking the national death toll to 88.
State governments have set up coronavirus testing centres and want people to undergo tests regardless of whether they have symptoms.
RECESSION LOOMING
Around 2.44 million Australians, or about 10% of the population, had downloaded a government ""contact tracing"" smartphone app to monitor the spread of the illness, less than two days since its launch.
That is short of the government's target to have about half the population with the software, but health minister Hunt said it was a sign people have overcome privacy concerns and ""come together as a single Australian nation, as one single family"".
Australia is expected to plunge into its first recession in 30 years due to the economic hit from the coronavirus, and the government has committed A$320 billion, or about 16% of GDP, in relief funding, the country's biggest emergency package ever.
At a Senate hearing, Australian Treasury secretary Stephen Kennedy said government data showed jobs in the accommodation, food, arts and recreation industries fell by up to a quarter in the three weeks to April 4.
Overall unemployment was expected to roughly double to more than 10% in the three months to end-June, he said.
""Unemployment rose to higher levels in the Great Depression, but it did that over the course of a couple of years. These movements are happening in just a couple of months,"" he told the hearing.
The country's second-largest lender, Westpac Banking Corp (AX:WBC), said in a stock market filing that it will take an impairment charge of A$1.6 billion due to the coronavirus impact. A day earlier, National Australia Bank Ltd (AX:NAB) took an A$807 million charge due to the virus.
Trade Minister Simon Birmingham meanwhile said the government had rebuked the Chinese ambassador to Australia after the envoy said Chinese consumers might boycott Australian products and universities if it supported demands for an international investigation into the origins of the virus.
""We will not deviate from those policy positions under any threat of economic coercion or anything else,"" Birmingham told reporters in Adelaide.

""The least the world can expect is a transparent inquiry into the causes of COVID-19 so that we can understand how best to prevent a repeat episode any time in the future. We would hope that China, like any other country around the world, would see the merits in understanding how the world can be better prepared in the future,"" he added.

A collapse in the Lebanese pound and soaring inflation and unemployment are compounding hardship in Lebanon, which has been in deep financial crisis since October. A shutdown to curb the spread of the new coronavirus has exacerbated economic woes.
Soldiers fired into the air and used tear gas and rubber bullets during the unrest in Tripoli, a security source said.
The man who died was in his 20s, the source said.
In a statement overnight, the army said soldiers were attacked during rioting in Tripoli. A fire-bomb was thrown at one of its vehicles and a hand grenade was hurled at a patrol, lightly wounding two soldiers, it said.
The army blamed the trouble on ""a number of infiltrators"" and called on peaceful protesters to quickly leave the streets.
Several banks were attacked during the protests and at least one was set on fire, a witness said.
Tripoli was the stage for big protests against Lebanon's ruling elite during countrywide demonstrations that erupted last October. 
The banking association declared all banks in Tripoli shut from Tuesday until security is restored, saying banks had been targeted in ""serious attacks and rioting"". 
Lebanon's banks have been a frequent target of protesters during the financial and economic crisis that has led to the collapse in the value of the Lebanese pound and frozen savers out of their deposits.
The long-brewing crisis came to a head last year as capital inflows to Lebanon slowed and protests erupted against its political elite. Since then, the pound has lost more than half its value, fuelling inflation in a country heavily dependent on imports.

A hand-written sign with an Instagram handle encourages kids and adults alike to contribute submissions, with the wall of the bus stop covered in drawings depicting things such as a unicorn, flowers and rainbows, which have come to symbolise positivity and solidarity with Britain's health workers during the outbreak.
Sarah Lamarr, a part time teacher and mother of 4-year-old Rosie, started the gallery when she woke up the day after Britain's coronavirus lockdown began and realised she would be stuck inside indefinitely with only a bland bus stop to look at.
""I just wanted to do something to brighten it up so I didn’t have to look at a grey bus stop for the next however-long,"" she told Reuters.
Lamarr said she felt like the protagonist of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 thriller Rear Window, which stars James Stewart as an injured photographer who watches his neighbours after he is confined to his flat with a broken leg.
""If you have a bus stop near you I would really encourage anyone to do the same because it's just a really lovely thing to have in your community,"" she said.
""If you are stuck in a first floor, second floor flat with no garden with kids, it’s just a great thing to watch out the window.""
One picture of flowers was accompanied with a message saying ""Let's focus on the positive"" while another drawing of a Superman costume said ""Thank You Heroes"" and listed roles which frontline workers are continuing to carry out.
Several locals who saw the artworks on the bus stop in west London, near Turnham Green, said it had improved their mood.
""People definitely need to see these messages and it just adds colour and a bit of fun and a bit of brightness to what otherwise could be a tough day for somebody,"" said Vicky Leviten, a child minder and local resident.

""I think it just lifts the spirits, it’s fabulous.""

IZALCO, El Salvador (Reuters) - Right groups condemned El Salvador's president on Monday for releasing startling photos of hundreds of jailed gang members stripped to underwear and pressed together in formation, part of a punishment for an outbreak of violence.
The images published at the weekend on the Twitter account of President Nayib Bukele's office stood in contrast to social-distancing measures around the world, including an obligatory home quarantine in El Salvador to stop the new coronavirus spreading. 
They were followed by orders from Bukele to place members of gangs, including the notorious MS-13, in sealed, steel box-like cells and permission to use lethal force against gang members on the streets. 
Bukele's latest action follows controversy over his disregard for Supreme Court rulings that he should uphold the constitution and his recent use of the military to intimidate Congress.
Jose Miguel Vivanco, the executive director of Human Rights Watch for the Americas, said El Salvador risked sliding into autocracy without reprobation from global powers.
""We have the duty to make sure that El Salvador does not become another dictatorship,"" Vivanco told Reuters.
""The only way to stop this is to have a strong reaction by the international community,"" Vivanco said, noting a lack of public criticism from the U.S. government or the European Union after recent rights violations.
Bukele has previously shrugged off criticism from human rights group and political opponents, saying it his duty to protect Salvadorans, and describing his predecessors as corrupt.
He enjoys strong poll ratings in the country of 6.5 million people, which has been terrorized by street gangs since shortly after the end of its civil war in 1992.
The government posted the photos showing rows and rows of prisoners sitting tightly packed, with their hands behind their backs, as police officers in riot gear looked on.
Some 12,862 gang members are incarcerated in El Salvador, according to prison authorities.
Amnesty International's director for the Americas, Erika Guevara, said the situation was ""worrisome.""
""We view these photos taken of people deprived of their liberty in the prisons with great concern, they are scenes where people are brought together in prison yards in a humiliating, demeaning manner,"" Guevara said.
Vivanco said Human Rights Watch had already called on the Organization of American States to consider invoking the Inter-American Democratic Charter in El Salvador. 
The charter is invoked when countries in the Americas are considered to have veered from the democratic path. 
'SEALED'
Bukele authorized the use of lethal force by police and military against gang members on Sunday, after dozens of people were murdered in the most violent weekend since he took office last year. 
""We are going to make sure the gang members who committed these killings regret having made this decision for the rest of their lives,"" Bukele told his security cabinet on Monday.
Authorities attribute the spate the killings of civilians and some gang members to the gangs seeking to show their strength. Some arrests have been made but nobody has been tried. 
On a tour of the Izalco maximum security prison with government officials, Reuters witnesses saw workers soldering metal sheets onto prisoners' cell doors. 
The president also ordered members of rival gangs into shared cells in a bid to break up lines of communication between members of the same gangs.
""From now on, all the gang cells in our country will remain sealed. They will no longer be able to see outside the cell,"" Bukele said.
""This will prevent them from using signs to communicate with the hallway. They will be inside, in the dark, with their friends from the other gangs.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - For 15 years, Siti Zabedah Abdul Wahab's family food business has opened for one month a year, selling murtabak, a pan-fried bread stuffed with meat, at Malaysia's popular Ramadan bazaars. 
But this year, Murtabak Mami Murtabak Sultan started taking orders on Whatsapp and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) weeks before the Muslim fasting month began on April 23, as authorities across Southeast Asia called off Ramadan bazaars amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
""This is the first time we are selling online, so we wanted to start early to make sure our customers can find us,"" 38-year-old Siti Zabedah told Reuters. 
Ramadan is traditionally a lucrative time for food vendors in Muslim-majority countries, with more people going out for late-night meals after breaking their fast at sunset. 
But the global virus outbreak, with more than 2.6 million people infected, has led to widespread curbs. 
Malaysian authorities have imposed a partial lockdown until mid-May and called off Ramadan bazaars. They are usually attended by packed crowds and feature hundreds of stalls selling food for iftar, or the fast-breaking meal. 
The movement curbs have forced thousands of street hawkers and vendors to embrace digital platforms, mirroring a shift in neighbouring Indonesia, where roadside businesses enjoy a sizeable online presence.
""In Indonesia, you can order pretty much anything you want on an app,"" said Rosli Sulaiman, president of the Malaysian Malay Hawkers and Small Traders Association.
""Here we have to do a bit more educating as most vendors are used to just being on the street. Going online or dealing with cashless transactions will be something new for them.""
Malaysian hawkers have been badly hit by the curbs, with estimated losses of about 50 million ringgit ($11.5 million) for some 100,000 traders.
To soften the impact, several companies have developed e-bazaar platforms to help Ramadan traders partner with delivery companies and reach more customers online. 
""It’s going to be a steep learning curve but... we have no choice,"" Rosli said. 
Many small food businesses, however, prefer marketing directly to customers on social media as they do not earn enough profit to share with delivery firms. 
Dozens of Ramadan bazaar groups have popped up on Facebook, where sellers can offer cash-on-delivery services to customers closest to them. 
Virtual bazaars have also been set up in Singapore, which cancelled Ramadan markets last month.
The pandemic has heavily impacted observance of Ramadan, traditionally a month when Muslims spend most of their time with families and attend nightly mass prayers at mosques.

Justice Celso de Mello gave the federal police 60 days to carry out the investigation requested by Brazil's chief public prosecutor Augusto Aras following the accusations made by former justice minister Sergio Moro, who resigned on Friday.
Moro said Bolsonaro had pressed him to change the chief of the federal police and accused the president of seeking to interfere in investigations that involved family members, to the point of requesting intelligence files.
Bolsonaro called the accusations unfounded, but they have set off the worst political crisis since he took office in January last year and lost the far-right leader valuable allies.
The investigation comes at a bad moment for Bolsonaro who is facing criticism for downplaying the gravity of the coronavirus epidemic that has killed over 4,500 people in the country and virtually paralyzed Latin America's largest economy.
Based on the results of the police investigation, the public prosecutor will have to decide whether to press charges against the president or his former minister.
An indictment of the president would have to be approved by the lower house of Congress before a trial could move ahead in the Supreme Court. The house is however dominated by Bolsonaro's supporters and it is unlikely to approve an indictment. 
If he is indicted, the president would be suspended and Vice President Hamilton Mourao takes over his position temporarily for up to 180 days. If convicted in a trial, he would lose office.

A poll conducted on Monday showed that a majority of Brazilians believe Moro's accusations are true. Forty six percent believe Bolsonaro should resign, while 50% who think he should not.

The global financial hub reported no new coronavirus infections for a second day on Monday, bringing some relief to a city whose economy has been battered by the disease that came on the heels of crippling anti-government protests.
Looking to ease the way out of a lockdown, Lam said outdoor sports facilities, libraries and museums would also reopen from Monday although they would still be subject to a ban on gatherings of more than four people.
Social distancing restrictions to halt the spread of coronavirus have seen a relative lull in protests in recent weeks, with some democracy activists expressing concern the rules could be used to curb demonstrations, which Lam rejected. 
""When considering whether to continue the restrictions or not, the major consideration is firstly to safeguard public health and to ensure citizens' health, secondly to consider the impact of these measures on the economy and different industries, and thirdly their psychological impact on people,"" Lam said. 
The government said last week that social distancing and travel measures would be extended until at least May 7. A key consideration for Lam will also be whether to ease cross-border travel restrictions with mainland China, where the virus is believed to have originated and is now largely under control. 
Joining cities around the world in the battle to halt the virus, Hong Kong has shut schools and many people work from home, although some have slowly started to return to offices in the past couple of weeks. It's rare to see anyone not wearing a surgical mask in the city. 

Hong Kong has confirmed 1,038 cases and four deaths since the outbreak began in January.

Pollster Datafolha found that 48% oppose impeaching Bolsonaro while 45% of those surveyed want to see him impeached, a difference within the margin of error of the poll.
Sergio Moro, a popular minister because of his record fighting corruption as a federal judge, resigned as justice minister on Friday, accusing the president of attempting to interfere in sensitive police investigations involving family members.
Bolsonaro said the accusations were unfounded.
For 52% of those polled by Datafolha, Moro was telling the truth and only 20% said they believed Bolsonaro's account.
While Brazilians are split on Congress removing the president by impeachment, the number that believe Bolsonaro should resign has risen to 46% from 37% in the previous poll at the beginning of April. Those opposed to his resigning have decreased to 50% from 59%.
A main reason for discontent with Bolsonaro has been his handling of the coronavirus epidemic, whose gravity he has downplayed as the death toll rises in Brazil. The poll found 45% consider his handling bad or terrible against 27% who think he has done a good or excellent job.
The Datafolha poll showed that Bolsonaro has hung on to his core support, with the positive approval rating of his government rising to 33% from 30% in December. Its negative numbers have risen to 38% from 36% four months ago.
Datafolha polled 1,503 people by telephone on Monday. The poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points up or down.

In turn the United States thanked Taiwan for sharing its medical best practices. Taiwan has limited the coronavirus outbreak to just 429 confirmed cases and six deaths.
Taiwan's lack of membership at the WHO, due to China's objections which considers the island merely one of its provinces, has infuriated Taipei, which says its exclusion has created a glaring gap in global fight against coronavirus.
In a teleconference late Monday, Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung thanked U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar ""for the strong support extended by the United States for Taiwan's participation in the WHO"", Taiwan's Health Ministry said in a statement.
""Minister Chen told Secretary Azar that he hopes the U.S. will continue to support for Taiwan's full participation in the World Health Assembly as observer and WHO meetings, mechanisms, and activities,"" the statement added.
The World Health Assembly is the WHO's decision-making body.
Taiwan attended it as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations warmed, but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, charges she rejects.
Taiwan's Health Ministry said that Azar reaffirmed ""the continued and concrete support from the U.S. of expanding Taiwan's participation in the WHO and global health arena"".
The WHO and China both say Taiwan has been given the access to and information it needs from the body during the pandemic, but Taiwan says that has been limited.
Azar, in a tweet, said he had thanked Chen for Taiwan's ""efforts to share their best practices and resources with the U.S."" ""Now, more than ever, global health partnership is crucial and I appreciate Taiwan's contributions.""
Direct, public interactions between ministerial-level officials from Taiwan and the United States are unusual as the two do not have official diplomatic ties. 
The United States, like most countries, only has formal relations with Beijing, though it is Taiwan's strongest backer on the international stage.
Earlier this month Taiwan and the United States discussed how to get ""closer coordination"" between the island and the WHO during the coronavirus outbreak, drawing a rebuke from China for ""political manipulation"" of the epidemic.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new law last month requiring increased support for Taiwan's international role. China threatened unspecified retaliation in response.
Taiwan has been far more successful than many of its neighbours keeping the virus in check thanks to early and stringent steps to control its spread.

Around 400,000 people returned to work after Ardern shifted the country's alert level down a notch, loosening some of the tough movement restrictions that shut down businesses for weeks.
""It’s hard to explain how good this tastes,"" Christopher Bishop, a lawmaker, said on Twitter after posting a picture with a take away coffee cup. 
Long queues of cars snaked up to McDonald's Corp (NYSE:MCD) outlets in Auckland and Wellington from the early hours as people sought a fast food fix.

New Zealand's 5 million residents were subjected to one of the strictest lockdowns in the world in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with Ardern shutting down much of the country from March 26.
Ardern said those measures had paid off. New Zealand has reported just 1,122 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 19 deaths, one of the lowest tallies in the world.
""We can say with confidence that we do not have community transmission in New Zealand. The trick now is to maintain that,"" Ardern told Radio New Zealand on Tuesday.
There was growing debate among officials and academics about the terminology that should be used for New Zealand's status in relation to the coronavirus spread, with some saying ""elimination"" would not allow for recurrent small numbers of cases. They point to the fact that the country reported five new cases and one death yesterday.
""When I talk about elimination it does not mean zero cases, it means zero tolerance for cases,"" Ardern said. ""The idea of COVID being completely gone, that is eradication - so there are important differences there.""
New Zealand is maintaining several social distancing policies despite the step down in the alert level with malls pubs, hairdressers and other public shopping areas to stay shut for at least another two weeks.
Siouxsie Wiles, a microbiologist and associate professor at the University of Auckland, was among those warning the virus could return if lockdown measures were eased too quickly.
""If we turn our backs for a minute, we’ll be on the path to a serious outbreak once again. And we’ve seen this happen overseas,"" Wiles wrote in a column on the online news site The Spinoff.

The act was deliberate, police unions said. Police sources said the 30-year-old driver was arrested at the scene and lived nearby in a working-class area close to where unrest erupted last week.
Psychiatric tests and searches were being carried out before a decision would be taken on whether to hand the investigation to France's anti-terrorism prosecutor, a source close to the investigation said.
""Two police motorcyclists in a serious condition after being deliberately hit in Colombes by an individual who also rammed a police car. Thoughts with our colleagues,"" the Synergie-Officiers union wrote on social media.
The officers had been stationary and conducting routine checks when they were hit by a black BMW. 
Footage published in French media including the website of daily newspaper Le Parisien showed one police motorbike sandwiched between the crumpled bonnets of a police car and the BMW. Debris from a second bike lay strewn on the road.
Interior Minister Christophe Castaner hailed the response of officers who gave first aid to their comrades at the scene. 
One of the two suffered fractures to both legs and a fractured skull and had been placed in an artificial coma, police sources said. The other was also hospitalised.
""My thoughts go out to the two injured policemen who were committed to protecting us,"" Castaner wrote on Twitter.
One source familiar with the investigation said the perpetrator targeted the officers to avenge events in Palestine.
France has suffered major attacks by Islamist militants. Police and soldiers have been targeted on multiple occasions in recent years. 
In October, an information technology assistant at the police headquarters in central Paris went on a knife rampage inside the building, killing four people before he was shot dead. He had converted to Islam a decade earlier.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United States faces a tough, messy battle if it uses a threat to trigger a return of all United Nations sanctions on Iran as leverage to get the 15-member Security Council to extend and strengthen an arms embargo on Tehran, diplomats said.
Washington has shared its strategy, confirmed by a U.S. official speaking on condition of anonymity, with Britain, France and Germany, who are council members and parties to the 2015 deal between Iran and world powers that prevents Tehran from developing nuclear weapons in exchange for sanctions relief.
Under that deal, a U.N. arms embargo on Iran is due to expire in October. A U.S.-drafted resolution to extend the embargo has been given to Britain, France and Germany, the U.S. official confirmed, but U.N. diplomats said it has not been shared with the remaining 11 council members, including Russia and China.
""It will be dead on arrival,"" predicted a Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France to be adopted. Diplomats said the United States would likely struggle to get Russia and China to allow an arms embargo extension.
The Russian and Chinese missions to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia and China are also parties to the Iran nuclear deal. 
If the council does not extend the arms embargo, the next step in the U.S. plan would be to try and trigger a so-called snapback of all U.N. sanctions on Iran, including the arms embargo, using a process outlined in the nuclear deal. 
U.S. President Donald Trump quit the agreement in 2018 and described the accord from Barack Obama's presidency as ""the worst deal ever."" 
""It's very difficult to present yourself as a compliance watcher of a resolution you decided to pull out of,"" said a European diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Either you're in or either you're out.""
However, a State Department legal argument, seen by Reuters late last year, made the case that Washington could still spark a sanctions snapback because it is named as a deal participant in a 2015 U.N. resolution that enshrines the nuclear agreement. 
Some U.N. diplomats said that while legal opinions on whether the United States could do this were split, ultimately it would be up to council members to decide whether to accept a U.S. complaint of ""significant non-performance"" by Iran. 
It is a move likely to be challenged, diplomats said. 
""It's going to be messy from a Security Council standpoint because, regardless of what (Britain, Germany and France) think, Russia and China are not going to sign up to that legal interpretation,"" said a European official, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif dismissed the U.S. plan in a tweet on Monday, telling Washington to ""stop dreaming.""
Iran has breached several central limits of the nuclear deal, including on its stock of enriched uranium, in response to the U.S. withdrawal and Washington's reimposition of unilateral sanctions that have slashed Iran's oil exports. The Europeans are trying to save the deal, but have made little progress. 

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has long been pushing for the Security Council to extend the arms embargo, establish ""inspection and interdiction measures, in ports and on the high seas, to thwart Iran's continuing efforts to circumvent arms restrictions"" and prevent Iran from working on and testing ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons.

Center-left Peronist Fernandez and conservative Sebastian Pinera held a call on Monday, saying the neighboring countries would unite to face what they called the ""dual enemies"" of the coronavirus pandemic and economic recession.
""Beyond any difference, we must unite in these tough times that we are going through with the pandemic,"" the Argentine presidential office reported the two as saying in a statement.
Chile's Foreign Ministry said on Sunday it was ""astonished"" by comments made by Fernandez, who met with Chilean opposition leaders, encouraging them to ""overcome their differences and return to power on behalf of Chileans.""
Chile and Argentina, separated geographically by South America's Andes Mountains, are long-time rivals and have often been at odds politically. Pinera, a billionaire businessman, faced months of protests over inequality late last year.
On the 45-minute call, Fernandez told Pinera it was essential to support integration around Latin American, ""with those two enemies that are common to the entire continent."" He added he hoped to ""embrace all Chileans in a hug.""

""Let's maintain our good relationship, which is essential,"" Pinera replied, according to the Argentine statement.

Haftar, who launched a war a year ago to grab the capital Tripoli and other parts of northwest Libya, was already widely understood to control the parallel administration that rules in the east. 
He did not spell out in his brief televised speech on Monday what form the new power structure would take and the wider political ramifications were not immediately clear. 
Libya has been split since 2014 between areas controlled by the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli and the northwest, and territory held by eastern-based forces in Benghazi. 
""We announce that the general command is answering the will of the people, despite the heavy burden and the many obligations and the size of the responsibility, and we will be subject to the people's wish,"" he said. 
Although the LNA advanced last year into the southern suburbs of Tripoli, and has been bombarding the capital frequently, it lost ground to pro-GNA forces during fighting this month. 
Haftar is supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. The GNA is backed by Turkey. 
Though Haftar had long been the de facto ruler of eastern Libya, power was nominally held by a civilian administration. Benghazi is home to parallel state institutions, as well as the national parliament. 
The GNA falls under a three-man Presidential Council, founded in 2015 in a political agreement aimed at ending the chaos and division that have persisted since the 2011 uprising that ousted Muammar Gaddafi. 
Haftar said last week that the agreement had failed. 
Mohammed Ali Abdallah, an adviser to the GNA said, in a statement: ""Haftar has once more exposed his authoritarian intentions to the world. He no longer seeks to conceal his contempt for a political solution and democracy in Libya.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to work on Monday after recovering from COVID-19 and warned that it was still too dangerous to relax a stringent lockdown wreaking havoc on Britain's economy, for fear of a deadly second outbreak.
Looking healthy again after a life-threatening bout of the coronavirus, Johnson compared the disease to an invisible street criminal whom Britons were wrestling to the floor.
""If we can show the same spirit of unity and determination as we've all shown in the past six weeks then I have absolutely no doubt that we will beat it,"" the 55-year-old said outside his Downing Street home, a month and a day after testing positive.
""I ask you to contain your impatience because I believe we are coming now to the end of the first phase of this conflict and in spite of all the suffering we have so nearly succeeded.""
With unemployment soaring, many companies crippled and a recession looming, Johnson said he understood the concerns of business and would consult with opposition parties pressing for clarity on a pathway out of lockdown. 
But with Britain posting one of the world's highest death tolls - 21,092 hospital deaths and thousands more yet to be quantified in care homes - he stressed it was still a time of maximum risk.
""We simply cannot spell out now how fast or slow or even when those changes will be made, though clearly the government will be saying much more about this in the coming days,"" he said.
""We must also recognise the risk of a second spike, the risk of losing control of that virus and letting the reproduction rate go back over one because that would mean not only a new wave of death and disease but also an economic disaster.""
EMERGENCY CREDIT
The lockdown has left Britain facing possibly the deepest recession in three centuries and the biggest debt splurge since World War Two. Johnson's government, party and scientific advisers are divided over how and when the world's fifth-largest economy should start returning to work, even in limited form.
Finance minister, Rishi Sunak, announced the latest in a series of emergency measures to try and stave off calamity, a programme of small business loans fully backed by the state.
He said the government would stand fully behind commercial loans of up to 50,000 pounds ($62,000) for emergency credit to small firms, which will not be required to meet repayments or pay interest for the next 12 months.
Johnson initially resisted introducing the lockdown but changed course when projections showed a quarter of a million people could die. The government is next due to review social distancing measures on May 7.
Since the lockdown started on March 23, his government has faced criticism from opposition parties and some doctors for initially delaying measures, for limited testing capabilities, and for a lack of protective equipment for health workers.
Johnson's spokesman said the government may not know if a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April had been met on Thursday because of a time lag with data. Health minister Matt Hancock later said the testing system was on course to meet the target.

Johnson's spokesman added that the prime minister would meet opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, who has urged the prime minister to say when and how restrictions might be eased.

1172,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 02:29PM ET</span>",South Korean officials caution against reports North Korean leader Kim ill,"By Hyonhee Shin and Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean officials emphasise they have detected no unusual movements in North Korea and caution against reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may be ill or is being isolated because of coronavirus concerns. 
At a closed-door forum on Sunday, South Korea's Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul, who oversees North Korea engagement, said Seoul had the intelligence capabilities to say with confidence there were no indications of anything unusual. 
Rumours and speculation over Kim Jong Un's health began after he did not appear in public at a key state holiday on April 15. He has since remained out of sight.
Experts have cautioned that Kim has disappeared from state media coverage before, and that gathering accurate information in North Korea is difficult.
South Korean media last week reported that Kim may have undergone cardiovascular surgery, or was in isolation to avoid exposure to the coronavirus.
Unification Minister Kim cast doubt on the report of surgery, arguing that the hospital mentioned did not have the capabilities for such an operation.
Still, Yoon Sang-hyun, chairman of the foreign and unification committee in South Korea's National Assembly, told a gathering of experts on Monday that Kim Jong Un's absence from the public eye suggests ""he has not been working as normally"".
""There has not been any report showing he's making policy decisions as usual since April 11, which leads us to assume that he is either sick or being isolated because of coronavirus concerns,"" Yoon said. 
North Korea has said it has no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, but some international experts have cast doubt on that assertion.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in vowed on Monday to step up cooperation to help North Korea prevent the spread of the coronavirus but made no mention of Kim's health or whereabouts. 
""I will find a path for the most realistic and practical inter-Korean cooperation,"" Moon told a meeting with senior aides on the second anniversary of his first summit with Kim. 
""The COVID-19 crisis could mean a new opportunity for inter-Korean cooperation, and that's the most urgent and pressing task."" 
'ALIVE AND WELL'
North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11.
On Monday, it once again showed no new photos of Kim or reports on his whereabouts.
However, it did say he had sent a message of gratitude to workers building a tourist resort in Wonsan, an area where some South Korean media reports have said Kim may be staying.
Moon Chung-in, a top foreign policy adviser to South Korean President Moon, told U.S. news outlets that the South Korean government's position was ""firm"" - that ""Kim Jong Un is alive and well.""
""He has been staying in the Wonsan area since April 13. No suspicious movements have so far been detected,"" Moon said.
In Washington, a U.S. official appeared to back the South Korean government officials' assessment about Kim, as well as their admonition against speculation. 
""That's good advice. The media should take what they're saying seriously,"" said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
An authoritative source familiar with U.S. intelligence reporting said it was entirely possible Kim had disappeared from public view to avoid exposure to COVID-19 and the sighting of his presidential train in Wonsan did suggest he may be there or have been there recently. 
But the source said that since there was no authoritative backing for such a conclusion, U.S. agencies were also still considering the possibility Kim might be ill, even seriously.
38 North, a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, said on Saturday that satellite images from last week showed a special train that was probably Kim's at Wonsan, lending weight to those reports.
Kim Byung-kee, a former intelligence official and now a member of South Korea's parliamentary intelligence committee, urged caution on speculation and said there was little possibility that Kim was ill and predicted he would make a ""surprise comeback soon."" 
A Unification Ministry spokeswoman said she had nothing to confirm when asked about reports that Kim was in Wonsan.
Last week, China dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un, according to three people familiar with the situation.
Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signalled in terms of Kim's health.
When asked about the Reuters report on the medical team, China's foreign ministry said it had no information to offer on Kim.

Kim, believed to be 36, vanished from state media for more than a month in 2014 and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp.

The deaths were mentioned in a debut quarterly assessment report by AFRICOM on allegations of civilian casualties raised in connection with its operations against Islamist militants in Somalia, Libya and other African countries.
""Regrettably two civilians were killed and three others injured in a February 2019 air strike. ""We are deeply sorry this occurred,"" AFRICOM's commander, U.S. Army General Stephen Townsend, said in the report.
The air strike was carried out in the vicinity of Kunyo Barrow in Somalia's Lower Shabelle region and the report said the intended target - two members of Somali Islamist group al Shabaab - were killed. 
The civilian deaths, it said, occurred as a result of U.S. or al Shabaab munitions that exploded during the air strike. 
It was the second known incident in which AFRICOM has acknowledged killing civilians in Somalia, where rights activists have accused it of long shrouding its operations in secrecy.
The first was an air strike in April 2018 in El Buur in the Galgadud region of central Somalia in which AFRICOM reported it had unintentionally killed two civilians. 
The United States has been conducting air strikes in Somalia for years to help defeat al Shabaab, which seeks to topple Somalia's Western-backed central government and set up its own rule based on a own strict interpretation of Islamic sharia law. 
For nearly two decades al Shabaab has been waging a campaign of bombings and shooting attacks on military and civilian targets including hotels and traffic junctions both in Somalia and neighbouring countries like Kenya.
A regional peacekeeping force, AMISOM, mandated by the African Union, also helps defend the Somali government.
AFRICOM's move to publish quarterly assessment reports on civilian casualty allegations is a welcome step towards transparency, said Seif Magango, Deputy Regional Director for Eastern Africa at rights group Amnesty International.
He added, though, that the United States must follow up with ""accountability and reparation for victims and their families"".

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany's economy minister urged its 16 federal states on Monday to go slowly in lifting coronavirus restrictions to avoid the outbreak spreading further and possibly force them to reintroduce another round of lockdown measures.
Under Germany's decentralised political system, the states have the power to implement and rescind the social distancing measures on which the federal government is relying to limit the contagion of the virus. Chancellor Angela Merkel is resisting pressure from business groups to ease restrictions more rapidly.
Germany has had around 155,000 diagnosed cases of coronavirus, according to official figures published on Monday, but only 5,750 deaths, a far lower proportion of fatalities than Italy, Spain, France and Britain.
""As a person who believes in fact-based decisions, I recommend to all of us to proceed very carefully in order not to be forced into eventually rescinding easing measures,"" Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, one of Merkel's closest allies, told Deutschlandfunk radio on Monday.
Helge Braun, Merkel's chief of staff, wrote in a letter to lawmakers of the ruling coalition seen by Reuters that Germany should be optimistic. He added: ""In the interest of the entire population, to avoid overburdening the health system in the long-term, it's too early to lift social distancing.""
The low death rate in Germany, Europe's largest and most pivotal economy, is attributed in part to it having imposed a strict lockdown earlier than other countries relative to when the first case was detected.
Federal and state governments introduced the first lockdowns during the week beginning March 22, though the details and dates varied from state to state. 
The Robert Koch Institute for Infectious Diseases said on Monday that confirmed cases of COVID-19, the lung disease caused by the new coronavirus, had risen by 1,018 to 155,193. On Sunday cases increased by 1,737 and on Saturday they rose by 2,055.
As the number of new infections has fallen, many businesses such as smaller stores or car dealerships have been allowed to reopen and some students are returning to schools.
NOT SO FAST
But a government spokesman poured cold water on any hopes that Berlin could soon decide on further steps to ease restrictions.
A meeting of Merkel with premiers of the 16 states on Thursday will be too early to evaluate the effects of the current easing of coronavirus restrictions, the spokesman said.
An important date for decisions would be a meeting on May 6, the spokesman said. He pointed to the fact that the effects of looser restrictions will only be visible 10, 12 or even 14 days after their implementation.
Thomas Bareiss, the government's tourism czar, said travel and holiday restrictions would be eased only gradually and that the government wanted to help travel agencies, hotels and other firms by enabling voucher solutions for already booked trips.
The current lockdown has cost Germany's tourism industry about 24 billion euros ($26.04 billion) in March and April alone, according to the sector's industry association, which wants immediate state aid for its smallest firms.
Markus Soeder, the premier of Bavaria, which has imposed some of the strictest social distancing measures, said his state was only taking small steps towards relaxing lockdown in order not to jeopardise early successes in fighting COVID-19.
Soeder told BR radio that 80% of the retail sector had reopened. ""If it works out this week, we can think about a further easing,"" he added.
Braun said authorities needed to take into account that the extent of the coronavirus outbreak varied from region to region.
""This could mean that restrictions in certain regions have to be maintained or tightened up again after a period of easing,"" said Braun.

He added that the federal government would monitor whether measures taken needed to be adjusted and that authorities would need to weigh which measures effectively stop the virus spreading and what social and economic costs they bring.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Residents of a care home in Brussels got the chance to see family members in person for the first time since mid-March on Monday thanks to a raised platform normally used for window cleaning or picking cherries.
Tristan Van den Bosch, a manager at the company that rents out the platforms, said he realised his unused equipment could be put to good use during the coronavirus lockdown when driving past a care home in Antwerp two weeks ago. 
""I saw someone shouting out to his mother two to three flights up and I thought, given that we have a serious fall in business, we can bring that man up to the window with our machines,"" he told Reuters TV.
Van den Bosch put his plan into action for a couple of days this month at a nursing home in Antwerp. On Monday, residents at the Le Cinquantenaire home in Brussels got to benefit from his service.
""Unfortunately, all the residents are confined to their rooms,"" said Laurent Nadin, Brussels director of nursing home company Orpea.
""The joint activities have ended. So today to give some comfort to the residents, we are lifting up their families so they can see them and get a bit of a boost.""
The visitors included Clementine Van Eijcke, 84, who came to see her husband, and Albert Camphyn, 58, who was raised up to his 98-year-old mother.
Separated from the platform operator by a screen, up to two visitors could spend 15 minutes talking with their loved ones behind a window or on a balcony.
""It's very good. We love it. It's really a great way to get close to someone,"" Camphyn said. 

Quite how many more visits Van den Bosch will arrange is not clear. His company Group F picks up the bill for the drivers and was planning to meet later to discuss what to do.

Bosnia declared a nationwide state of emergency on March 17, after the Serb Republic and the Bosniak-Croat Federation, its other autonomous half, separately declared emergencies and introduced measures to limit transmission of the virus.
""The state of emergency will continue until at least May 11,"" the Serb Republic's Prime Minister Radovan Viskovic said.
He said social distancing and other protective measures still needed to be observed.
The Federation on April 24 loosened restrictions intended to stop the spread of the virus by keeping seniors and children from leaving their homes at all, after the top court ruled those restrictions violated the constitution.
The region's civil protection authority also lifted a night-time curfew and abolished obligatory quarantine, but said people would still have to self-isolate for 14 days at their homes.
Bosnia has officially recorded 1,565 cases and 60 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Epidemiologists in both regions said the pace of recoveries has been faster than fresh infections in recent days.
Even before the pandemic, Bosnia's health system was in poor shape. Large numbers of doctors and nurses have sought work in Western Europe, causing fears that the country may soon have too few medical staff to cope.

BUENOS AIRES/SANTIAGO/MEXICO CITY/LA PAZ (Reuters) - Lockdowns around Latin America are helping slow the spread of COVID-19, but are having a darker and less-intended consequence: a spike in calls to helplines suggests a rise in domestic abuse, in a region where almost 20 million women and girls suffer sexual and physical violence each year.
In cities from Buenos Aires to Mexico City, Santiago, São Paulo and La Paz, families and individuals have been confined in their homes in an unprecedented way, often only allowed out for emergencies or to shop for essentials.
Prosecutors, victim support teams, women's movements and the United Nations all say this has caused a rise in domestic violence towards women. They cite increasing numbers of calls to abuse hotlines.
In some countries, like Mexico and Brazil, there has been a rise in formal reports of abuse, while in others, including Chile and Bolivia, there has been a drop in formal complaints. Prosecutors and UN Women said the latter was likely not due to a decline in violence, but because women were less able to seek help or report abuse through normal channels.
""The jump in violence has not surprised us, it is the unleashing of a violence that was already there in people,"" said Eva Giberti, founder of the Victims Against Violence program in Argentina, who helps runs a hotline for women to report abuse. 
""Under normal social circumstances that had been limited to some degree.""
Argentina's emergency 137 line for abuse victims, supported by the justice department, has seen a 67% rise in calls for help in April versus a year earlier, after a nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 20.
UN Women in a report on Wednesday said there was evidence of rising violence against women in Mexico, Brazil, and Colombia, and a doubling in the number of femicides in Argentina during the quarantine, citing a women's observatory in Mar del Plata.
Pre-pandemic, the Argentine government estimates that a woman was killed every 23 hours.
Domestic violence ""seems to be another pandemic,"" said Lucía Vassallo, a film maker whose documentary ""Line 137"" looks at the issue.
'THEY DARE NOT GO OUT'
Rising concern over domestic abuse has been global, with fears victims are being silenced in Italy, calls for help from women rising in Spain, and systems to prevent child abuse in the United States hampered by the lockdown. 
In Latin America, the fear is that violence against women that was already prevalent is being exacerbated further. The region has seen huge marches and strikes by women over the last year against male aggression and abuse.
""In a situation of confinement, what is happening is that women are locked up with their own abusers in situations where they have very limited outlets,"" Maria Noel Baeza, regional director for UN Women, told Reuters.
""Last year we had 3,800 femicides in the region, how many are we going to have this year?""
In Chile, the women's minister said calls to domestic abuse helplines had increased 70% in the first weekend of quarantine. The government has bolstered counseling channels and looked to keep shelters open for women at risk.
Evelyn Matthei, mayor of Santiago's wealthy Providencia district, told Reuters that calls for help to a local office providing legal, psychological and social help had leapt 500% under the lockdown.
Formal reports of domestic violence, however, actually declined 40% in the first half of April in Chile, according to the national prosecutors' office, which the UN and prosecutors said was down to women having their movements restricted.
""This probably has to do with the fact that there is violence within the home but that women cannot go out, they dare not go out,"" said Matthei.

In Brazil's Sao Paulo state, which has been hit hardest by the pandemic and imposed sweeping isolation measures, there was a 45% jump last month in cases of violence against women where police were dispatched, compared to a year earlier, according to thinktank the Brazilian Forum on Public Safety.
In Mexico, complaints to police of domestic violence rose around a quarter in March against a year earlier, official data show.
""Since the lockdown, there's been an increase in reports of domestic violence, many of those psychological violence,"" said Blanca Aquino, director of the Municipal Institute for Women of Veracruz, the Mexican state with the country's highest rate of femicides.
Arussi Unda, from Mexican feminist organization Brujas del Mar, which offers advice to women in abuse cases, said initially many calls to the group had come from neighbors hearing fights in other houses. She said there had been a rise in cases of ""digital violence"" and recently women looking simply to escape.
""Now we get many women asking for advice on how to leave the house and take their children without the partner later wanting to take them away by legal means,"" she said.
In Colombia, daily domestic violence calls to a national women's hotline were up nearly 130% during the first 18 days of the country's quarantine, according to government figures. The lockdown has been extended until May 11.
Marta Dillon, an Argentine journalist and one of the founders of the ""Ni Una Menos"" women's movement, said women around the world were looking to unite to tackle the issue.

""Male violence has increased under the conditions of quarantine, of social isolation... Us feminists have been saying this in Italy, in Turkey, in the United States. We are putting together a document amongst ourselves that will be a manifesto.""

Vallance rejected the suggestion that the government had been reluctant to publish details about who attended the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) meetings because political advisers had been listening in, saying officials were often on the calls but did not direct discussion.
""The usual practice with SAGE is that the names of the scientists who've been involved in the process are published after the emergency is over,"" Vallance said on a conference call with journalists.
""I believe that we should be more prepared to publish names sooner, and intend to do so shortly. So we will be publishing names of those that are happy to have their names published.""
Vallance said that the length of the coronavirus crisis meant that SAGE should review its procedures on transparency and publish the documents they work with more quickly.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most senior aide, Dominic Cummings, is among those who have taken part in the meetings of the scientific panel, the Guardian newspaper reported on Friday, prompting criticism from the opposition. 
Vallance said officials had always been at SAGE meetings, and while the minutes did not record whether advisers from the prime minister's 10 Downing Street office had listened to the briefings, Vallance said that it was common for them to do so.
""We also have officials from Whitehall who listen in to the meetings and can ask questions if they wish to, but they're not part of the general discussion,"" Vallance said.
""In this situation... we've had a lot, a lot of officials attending meetings and listening in. And yes that does include people from Number 10, and yes, occasionally they ask questions.""

The accusation came after the United States last week announced $12.1 million in economic aid to Greenland, a semi-autonomous part of the Kingdom of Denmark, to strengthen ties and boost the country's hunt for mineral resources.
""Now, the United States instead of dialogue and cooperation relies exclusively on the policy of confrontation in the region, hoping thereby to achieve dominance in this part of the world,"" Russian envoy Vladimir Barbin told daily Politiken. 
Barbin referred to a recent statement by the U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, who called Russian activities in the Arctic ""aggressive"" and a challenge to Western peace ambitions.
The Russian embasy in Copenhagen was not immediately able to confirm the comments when contacted by phone.
The Arctic has increasingly come in focus in Washington after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in May last year first criticised Russia's and China's behaviour, and later when President Donald Trump offered to buy Greenland from Denmark.
Russia has ambitious plans to build ports along the so-called Northern Sea Route, which would shorten the distance between China and Europe, and has beefed up its military presence in its Arctic areas.
China has also encouraged enterprises to build infrastructure in the Arctic as part of a Polar Silk Road. A bid by a Chinese construction to help expand three airports in Greenland was effectively blocked by the United States, a close ally of Denmark. 
""There is a sick attitude to large-scale investment projects of other states, as well as the advancement of various conspiracy theories and conjectures regarding economic activities in the Arctic of other states,"" Barbin said.
Greenland is strategically important for the U.S. military and its ballistic missile early-warning system since the shortest route from Europe to North America runs via the Arctic island.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The U.N. human rights office voiced concern on Monday about more than a dozen countries that have declared states of emergency due to the COVID-19 pandemic where police have arrested or detained hundreds of thousands of people and killed others.
""Emergency powers should not be a weapon governments can wield to quash dissent, control the population, and even perpetuate their time in power,"" U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet said in a statement that denounced shootings and detentions without being specific. 
A top official from her office said about 80 countries have declared emergencies due to the new coronavirus, including 15 where the allegations were deemed most troubling. 
They were: Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, El Salvador, Dominican Republic, Peru, Honduras, Jordan, Morocco, Cambodia, Uzbekistan, Iran and Hungary.
However, Georgette Gagnon, director of field operations, added at a virtual briefing in Geneva ""there are probably several dozen more we could have highlighted"". 
""A main concern on exceptional emergency measures is what has been described as a toxic lockdown culture in some countries,"" Gagnon said. ""As the High Commissioner highlighted, police and other security forces are using excessive and sometimes deadly force to enforce lockdowns and curfews.""
Some of those countries have arrested and detained tens of thousands of people for violation of confinement measures linked to the pandemic, with the Philippines topping the list with 120,000 apprehended for curfew violations in the past 30 days. 
In the case of Kenya, Gagnon said that authorities were investigating 20 cases related to deaths linked to police conduct in implementing curfew measures. The country has reported 14 COVID deaths to the World Health Organization.
President Uhuru Kenyatta has apologised for police violence.
In South Africa, the U.N. has received reports of police using rubber bullets, tear gas, water bombs and whips, to enforce social distancing, especially in poor neighborhoods. Thirty-nine complaints including murder, rape, use of fire arms and corruption are being investigated, Gagnon said.
Police have described the use of whips as unacceptable.
In Nigeria, OHCHR has received reports that security forces killed 18 people in relation to COVID enforcement measures.
Nigerian authorities have attributed some deaths to prison violence.
She also raised concerns about police extortion in Africa. 
""Those who cannot pay bribes, poor people, are taken to mandatory quarantine centres although there is no indication that they have come into contact with someone testing positive to COVID.""
Gagnon, asked about China's record during the crisis, said: ""The office has received reports of censorship on and offline, intimidation, arrest and apparent detention of dissenting voices such as doctors, journalists, human rights defenders and members of the CCP (Chinese Communist Party)."" The office was liaising with China on around half of dozen of those cases, she said.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - With ticket sales to Prague's Jewish quarter halted during the coronavirus lockdown, the community is having to tap its reserves to pay for welfare services for Holocaust survivors that tourists usually help fund.
And even though the Czech Republic's cultural attractions are due to reopen next month, with global tourism at a standstill the community is looking at ways to cut spending elsewhere to keep funding the programmes for the elderly. 
The Jewish quarter - dating back 1,000 years - has long been one of Prague's most popular destinations, with historic synagogues and one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in Europe drawing visitors from around the globe.
The ticket revenue and rents from tenants such as restaurants fund meals, medical treatment and nursing care to the several hundred elderly members of Prague's Jewish community, many of them Holocaust survivors, such as 90-year-old Petr Brandejsky.
""I am very grateful for what the community is providing,"" he said in his flat where he receives food deliveries during the lockdown instead of daily lunches at a community centre.
A big chunk of the group's revenue comes from the Jewish Museum. Comprising of several synagogues and the cemetery, it attracted 721,000 visitors in 2018, generating 203 million crowns ($8 million) in admission fees.
Frantisek Banyai, chairman of the Jewish community, said it was critical to keep providing services for the most vulnerable members and that the group may need to look to cut funding to other areas, such as investments and restoration projects.
""The loss of tourist revenue is substantial,"" said Banyai, whose community today numbers around 1,500 compared with 39,000 before the Nazis started deportations in 1941.
""You cannot shut these services, you have to keep providing them.""
But even with cultural venues set to open on May 11, the closed borders and lack of foreign tourists mean the museum's outlook is uncertain, Jewish Museum Director Leo Pavlat said.
""Even after the borders open, we need to take into account the economic downfall caused by the pandemic and it is likely that tourism will be paralysed,"" Pavlat told Reuters, as he walked among the thousands of headstones in the cemetery that is normally full of tourists.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has suspended a spokesman after he suggested in an email exchange that the term ""fascist"" was used too freely, an AfD lawmaker said on Monday.
The suspension of Christian Lueth is likely to deepen a crisis in the AfD triggered by the domestic intelligence agency's decision last month to step up monitoring of a radical wing within its ranks, and suggestions by one of its co-leaders that a split is needed to purge the party of extremists.
""Lueth referred to himself as a 'fascist' in email correspondence with a female (job) applicant,"" an AfD lawmaker said on condition of anonymity, confirming allegations first reported by Die Zeit magazine.
The lawmaker said he had not seen the emails but had been briefed about them by a colleague involved in reviewing the incident for the parliamentary group, which has the final say on whether to fire Lueth.
Lueth did not respond to a request for comment.
The email exchange had centred on Lueth's grandfather Wolfgang, the German navy's most successful submarine captain in World War Two, who was awarded Nazi Germany's highest military honour by Hitler.
""In one of the exchanges, Lueth wrote to the woman: 'If my grandfather was a fascist then I would be a fascist too,'"" the AfD lawmaker said.
The lawmaker said the woman involved in the exchange was a member of the Werte Union, or Values Union, an ultra-conservative grouping in Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative bloc, who had applied for a job with the AfD.
Support for the AfD has fallen by 3-4 percentage points since the BfV intelligence agency last month increased monitoring of an ultra-right-wing faction of the party called Der Fluegel (""The Wing"") - which it designated as an extremist entity that is a threat to democracy.
The decision increased tensions within the party, culminating in a reprimand for co-leader Joerg Meuthen for saying it should split and expel Der Fluegel as the only way to build a broader support base.
The AfD also seems to be losing support over its criticism of social distancing measures introduced by the government to slow the spread of the coronavirus, which have broad support among Germans.
The party says the measures are causing more harm than good because of the heavy toll they are taking on the economy.
It now stands at around 9-10% support in surveys, compared with 13-14% at the start of the year.

During a visit to one of hundreds of textile firms reorienting to produce protective gear, he praised the industry for supporting the relaxation of restrictions and said facemasks would likely be obligatory in certain locations such as schools and public transport.
""We are likely to go down a level (on restrictions), but normality will only come when we have a vaccine in a year, or year-and-a-half,"" Costa said while visiting textile manufacturer Petratex, which is producing more than 100,000 masks a week.
""Until then, reopening will come with conditions - like using hand sanitizer, and masks. This industry initiative to produce them en masse is essential for public safety,"" he said.
Hundreds of firms whose revenues plummeted after the state of emergency was imposed on March 18 are producing near to a million masks per week in Portugal to meet the surge in demand likely to accompany the easing of lockdowns across Europe.
As one of the few EU countries with the capacity for a fully running supply chain, the industry in Portugal hopes that by providing its European customers with the equipment needed to get back to business it can contribute to its own recovery.
""We should be producing millions of PPE per week in the next fortnight,"" said Mario Jorge Machado, president of Portugal's textile association ATP, referring to various types of personal protective equipment. 
""The industry can't survive from masks - Europe's economy restarting is what will save us. But by supplying PPE, we could help with that,"" Machado said.
Health authorities have recommended people wear masks in confined public spaces, and several municipalities have begun distributing them for free.
Portugal has so far reported 24,027 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 928 deaths.
Just under 30 firms have received official accreditation from product testing and certification centre CITEVE to produce masks that meet health and safety requirements, with hundreds more currently having their proposals assessed.
Some are already producing for export - Calvalex, in the country's north, sells 90% of the 200,000 masks it produces per week to Britain, France, Spain, Ireland, Germany and the Netherlands. 

Last Thursday, the government reduced value-added tax on masks and hand gel to the minimum level of 6%.

The lawyers condemned the cleric's comment as harmful to human dignity, but an AKP spokesman said he had simply been speaking up for the values of the Turkish people and accused the lawyers of harbouring a ""fascist mentality"".
On Friday, Ali Erbas, head of Turkey's Directorate of Religious Affairs, said Islam condemns homosexuality because ""it brings illnesses and corrupts generations"", adding that it also causes the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that leads to AIDS.
Homosexuality does not cause HIV but gay men who do not practise safe sex have been among the groups most vulnerable to the virus.
""Come and let's fight together to protect people from such evil,"" Erbas said in his weekly sermon.
Unlike in many other Muslim-majority countries, homosexuality is not a crime in Turkey. But homosexuals face widespread hostility and gay pride parades, which used to attract thousands of people from around the Middle East, have been banned in Istanbul in recent years. 
The Ankara Bar Association said Erbas's comments ""came from ages ago"" and were against human dignity. The Izmir Bar Association said it was concerned the statement could encourage new hate crimes. 
On Monday, government officials took to Twitter to defend Erbas using the top-trending hashtag ""Ali Erbas is not alone"".
""It is the most natural right for people to speak according to the value system they believe in,"" said AKP spokesman Omer Celik on Twitter.
""What is abnormal is demanding the contrary,"" Celik added, accusing the Ankara Bar Association of displaying a ""fascist mentality"" that sought to deprive Erbas of his right to free speech.
Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin, using the same hashtag, said Erbas had voiced the ""divine judgment"". 
On Monday, the Ankara prosecutor's office launched an investigation into the heads of the Ankara Bar Association on suspicion that they may have insulted Turks' religious values, the state Anadolu news agency reported. 
Human rights groups and the European Union have long accused Erdogan and his government of neglecting, and in some cases of rolling back, the rights of religious and ethnic minorities, homosexuals and women.

1190,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 08:00AM ET</span>","To push telework, Japan taking another look at ancient 'seal' custom","TOKYO (Reuters) - With efforts to promote telecommuting lagging despite the coronavirus crisis, Japan is taking another look at an ancient custom that stubbornly remains an analogue anomaly in an otherwise high-tech nation: the need to stamp documents with seals.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has called on citizens to stay at home, aiming for a 70 to 80 percent reduction in contact to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, but the goal has proved elusive.
In particular, many workers have been forced to commute to their offices because of a reliance on hard-copy paperwork for key contracts and proposals, and the need for much of this to be stamped with a traditional ""hanko"" or seal.
On Monday, though, Abe instructed cabinet ministers at a meeting of the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy (CEFP), to overhaul regulations and identify inconvenient and unnecessary steps in administrative procedure such as a traditional seal or face-to-face paper submission - a prelude to scrapping or simplifying them eventually.
Usually a small cylinder carved with the characters for a person or company's name, ""hanko"" or ""inkan"" are pressed on red ink pads and then stamped on documents as needed.
A custom originally imported from China over a thousand years ago, the use of hanko was formalised by Japan's modern government in the mid-1800s, with citizens required to legally register one with their name to use on important papers and documents. 
In business, they can be used on virtually everything, from contracts to applications and even just to show that everybody in an office has seen a particular memo. 
The government this month compiled an economic stimulus package for the coronavirus outbreak which includes subsidies for companies - but applying for many of these will require stamping the forms with a seal or visiting offices in person. 
Comments were not immediately obtainable from hanko maker associations, but many Japanese have expressed their frustration with the custom on social media.
""Just to complete my work, how many thousands of times - no, hundreds of thousands of times - have I had to press my hanko on papers?"" wrote Twitter user ""Mayumi_ma-na."" 
""There are plenty of sectors that no longer rely on these seals! Why can't we just sign things?""

Japan had over 13,400 coronavirus infections, with more than 370 deaths, public broadcaster NHK said on Monday.

The 48-year-old is held at London's Belmarsh Prison where he is fighting a request by the United States to send him to stand trial for conspiring to hack government computers and espionage.
Assange was dragged from the Ecuador embassy in London last year after a seven-year stand-off. He says he could spend decades in prison if convicted, and calls the case against him political and a threat to free speech. The United States says he put the lives of informants in danger by publishing secrets.
In February, hearings took place for a week and the case was adjourned until May 18 for a further three weeks of arguments. However, in the meantime, Britain imposed restrictions to curb the spread of the coronavirus, which have made it difficult to hold normal court proceedings.
Judge Vanessa Baraitser told a hearing held by conference call on Monday that the case could not be argued properly as long as lawyers were unable to appear in person.
""Remote attendance by the parties in this case will not be appropriate. Mr Assange and the lawyers on both sides will need to be physically present in the courtroom,"" she said.
She adjourned the case until May 4 when a new date will be fixed, noting that the Woolwich Crown Court where hearings last took place had availability for a three-week period only in November. Lawyers for both sides agreed to the delay.
Assange's lawyers say the coronavirus lockdown in the prison makes it impossible for them to meet their client. Lawyer Edward Fitzgerald told the judge his legal team had been unable to speak to Assange for a month, bar a few short phone calls.
The judge said it was up to the prison to make such conversations possible.
To highlight the difficulty of holding the case remotely, much of Monday's hearing was inaudible to journalists who dialled in to listen via a conference call, leading to a court clerk having to repeat Fitzgerald's arguments word by word.
Assange and WikiLeaks enraged the U.S. government a decade ago by publishing thousands of secret U.S. documents. Assange's supporters see him as a champion of free speech exposing abuses of power and hypocrisy by Washington.

The U.S. authorities say he is wanted not because he embarrassed them but because he endangered informants, dissidents and rights activists in countries including Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan by illegal actions.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Italy's Roman Catholic Church has reprimanded the government for not allowing the faithful to return to Masses at the start of a gradual staged end to Europe's longest coronavirus lockdown.
Masses have been banned since early March when Italy closed most commercial activities apart from essentials.
A timetable given on Sunday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said funerals could resume from May 4 but must be limited to 15 people and held outdoors if possible.
The timetable for May 4 to June 1 made no mention of Masses.
Italy's bishops, in a strongly-worded statement late on Sunday night, said they could ""not accept seeing the exercise of freedom of religion being compromised"" and accused the government of ""arbitrarily"" excluding Mass from the timetable.
The statement implied that the bishops felt betrayed, saying they had suggested to the government measures to resume Masses while respecting new safety norms.
The timetable also brought divisions within Conte's cabinet.
""So, we can safely visit a museum but we can't celebrate a religious service? This decision is incomprehensible. It must be changed,"" tweeted Minister for Equal Opportunities and Family Elena Bonetti.
Italian museums and libraries can reopen from May 18.
Italy's death toll remains the heaviest in Europe, with more than 26,000 dead and almost 200,000 confirmed cases. But the number of new cases has been slowing and the number of patients in intensive care has been falling steadily.
The bishops said the government had a duty ""to distinguish between its responsibility to furnish precise health regulations and that of the Church, which is called to organise Christian community life in respect of (health) norms but in full autonomy.""
In response, the government acknowledged the bishops' complaint and said it would study how to let believers participate safely in liturgical functions ""as soon as possible.""
Most of Italy's churches have remained open during the crisis, but only for individual prayer.
""If there are ways to work safely, shop safely and do sport safely, there is a way to celebrate Mass safely,"" said Paolo Ciani of the small, centrist DEMOS party.
In mid-March, the cardinal of Rome modified his order to close the capital's churches, even for individual prayer, after Pope Francis cautioned against ""drastic measures"" and Catholics took to social media to complain.

The Vatican, which for the most part has been mirroring Italy's containment measures, has not yet said when St. Peter's Basilica or the Vatican museums will reopen.

Clothing manufacturers in Bangladesh's capital Dhaka and the port city of Chittagong have been permitted to resume work. Some of the world's biggest clothing firms including Gap Inc (NYSE:GPS), Zara-owner  Inditex  (MC:ITX) and H&M source their supplies from Bangladesh.
""We are making sure the workers wear masks, wash hands at the entrance, undergo temperature checks, and maintain physical distancing,"" said Mohammad Hatem, vice president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association.
Industry groups for the sector, which boasts some 4,000 factories employing 4.1 million workers, had warned the shutdown could cause the country to lose $6 billion in export revenue this financial year.
Bangladesh's competitors such as Vietnam, China and Cambodia have already resumed operations, Hatem said. Bangladesh has reported more than 5,000 cases of the coronavirus and 145 deaths.
In India, where a strict shutdown for its 1.3 billion people is due to end on May 3, Prime Minister Narendra began talks with the chief ministers of the country's 28 states to decide on what restrictions should be kept in place.
Ashok Gehlot, the chief minister of the western state of Rajasthan, said any extension of the severe lockdown could lead to people starving and the government should allow economic activity to begin in less-affected areas. Some 300 of India's 730 districts have reported no cases of the coronavirus. 
""I can't say how many people will die of corona, but if the situation continues, people will die of hunger,"" he said.
India's has 27,891 confirmed infections of the new coronavirus, according to government data on Monday, the second highest amount in Asia after China. So far 872 people have died. 
The government says the lockdown has meant that it now takes 10 days for cases to double, compared with 3.6 days last month.
""The situation in the country is improving. Hotspots districts are being turned into non-hotspots districts,"" Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said. 
The Indian Ocean island nation of Maldives also reported a spike in cases, mostly among migrant workers living in packed dormitories in the capital Male. The country has 200 confirmed cases, the government said, a large number of them Bangladeshi migrant workers. 
Here are official government figures on the spread of the coronavirus in South Asia:
* India has reported 27,891 cases, including 872 deaths
* Pakistan has reported 13,328 cases, including 281 deaths

Social media critics vented their fury at what they saw as Chinese propaganda to conceal bullying in the South China Sea and branded Filipinos involved in the song as traitors.
""We have to stop the evil of China spreading"", wrote one, Leonard Anthony Arcilla. ""We do not unify with China"", said Elna Lynda Acuerdo, while Venus Liwanag said the video was ""slapping the faces of each Filipino"".
The song is dedicated to front-line health workers of both countries, some of whom appear in the video with footage of Chinese doctors and donated health supplies, including hundreds of thousands of protective masks and testing kits. 
The lyrics include lines like ""because of your love that flows like waves hand in hand, we move to a bright future, you and I are in one sea"".
The Philippine response is another indication of China's coronavirus diplomacy struggling against a history of disputes and mistrust, particularly in Southeast Asia, where its assertive maritime presence, and building of islands and military installations, has unnerved neighbours.
Some people were instead trying to generate likes and shares for a music video from last year produced by artists from the Philippines, Vietnam and Malaysia called ""save our seas"", which takes aim at China's maritime conduct.
The Philippines last week filed diplomatic protests accusing China of locking radar on a Philippine navy boat and rejecting its formation of an administrative unit in disputed areas, following a similar move by Vietnam..
It also comes amid unease over China's deployment of coastguard and survey vessels that have disrupted Malaysian drilling operations, and the arrival of Australian and U.S. warships in the area.
There are also signs of growing solidarity among internet users in Thailand and elsewhere in Southeast Asian with Taiwan and Hong Kong, with old tension being fanned by the emergence of the new coronavirus.

1196,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>","Russia's stranded migrants lose jobs, rely on handouts and peers for food","By Tom Balmforth
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Even before Moscow's coronavirus lockdown, Ibragim Artykov, a builder from Tajikistan, was down on his luck. Over two months, he had four jobs and in all of them his employers either underpaid him or disappeared without paying him at all.
Now the 32-year-old, one of 10 million labour migrants in Russia, can't find a job at all because of the coronavirus lockdown that is four weeks old.
There is no official word on when it will be eased, and Artykov cannot go home to wait it out as all flights are grounded.
""We have no home, no car, no stash of money, so we're only just somehow surviving. One person lends money, another helps with food, whatever they can,"" he said outside a rented apartment where he is staying with acquaintances.
""We can't live on water and oxygen, and we need to somehow survive. I don't think there's anything more terrifying than dying of hunger.""
President Vladimir Putin has said the epidemic is yet to peak. Moscow has suspended all work except that considered essential in order to slow the spread of the virus. 
That means that in Moscow and its surroundings alone, 2.2 million migrants legally registered to work have lost jobs in construction and other sectors, said Valentina Chupik, a Moscow-based expert on migration. 
The real figure is likely to be much higher, as millions of economic migrants - many from poor Central Asian republics whose economies rely on them sending home some of their salaries - work in the grey economy where they can easily be exploited or cheated by employers.
Russia's government has come under fire from some Kremlin critics for not handing out enough economic support to citizens and businesses hit by the crisis. Migrants are not eligible for any state support. 
Some officials have pushed for emergency measures that would entitle them to benefits. Russian media outlets have warned of the risk of a rise in crime. 
Artykov believes the government should either allow migrants to leave Russia en masse or to help them financially while the lockdown lasts, though he was skeptical that would happen.
""The third option is death and no one wants that.""
Migrant communities and charities have organised emergency help for hard-up migrant families.
Khabibullov Qurbonov, 32, raised 900,000 roubles ($12,170) on his blog, and headed to the market to buy rice, flour, potato and other staples which he handed out to hundreds of families using a taxi service that offered the use of its cars for free.
Other charities are also handing out food.

""Today we're distributing food to migrant families who found themselves stuck in Russia without being able to get back home or earn their bread,"" said Irina Konsol, director of the Klavdia charity. ""Those people are starving.""

KABUL/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - More than 500 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first three months of the year as violence raged even after an agreement between the United States and the Taliban on withdrawing foreign forces, the United Nations said on Monday.
In all, fighting in the first three months caused 1,293 civilian casualties, of which 760 were injuries and the rest deaths, including 152 children and 60 women, the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) said in a quarterly report.
The violence increased after a Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban pact on the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees. It includes a commitment by the Taliban and the Afghan government to work towards peace.
""The report tracks a disturbing increase in violence during March at a time when it was hoped that the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban would commence peace negotiations, as well as seek ways to defuse the conflict and prioritize efforts to protect all Afghans from the impact of COVID-19,"" UNAMA said.
Despite that, the number of casualties in the first three months of this year was the lowest since 2012. The period included a reduction in violence leading up to the signing of the pact.
Deborah Lyons, the U.N. secretary-general's Special Representative for Afghanistan and head of UNAMA, reiterated calls for a ceasefire, which the Taliban have rejected in recent days.
""To safeguard the lives of countless civilians in Afghanistan and to give the nation hope of a better future, it is imperative that violence is stopped,” she said.
Efforts towards formal peace talks have been fraying as the Taliban attack government forces, despite warnings from the United States that they need to reduce violence, as well as disagreements over the release of prisoners.
A political feud within the Afghan government, between the president and his main rival after a disputed election, has also distracted attention from the peace effort.
The number of civilian deaths caused by anti-government forces, especially the Taliban, increased by more than 20% compared with the first quarter of 2019, UNAMA said.
Targeted killings, summary executions and abductions of civilians were also on the rise, it said.
A Taliban spokesman rejected the figures and said they had a commission for preventing civilian casualties which had brought them down to ""near zero"".
Afghan government forces and other pro-government forces, including foreign troops, were responsible for almost a third of the deaths, UNAMA said.
Air strikes and clashes involving indirect fire by those forces were the reason for more child deaths, it said.

1198,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 27, 2020 04:15AM ET</span>",London tailors swap costume designing to make medical uniforms,"LONDON (Reuters) - As Britain faces a shortage of personal protective equipment for health care workers battling the coronavirus outbreak, London's tailors are putting their cutting and sewing machines to use to fill the void.
The British government has faced repeated criticism from National Health Service staff that doctors, nurses and other healthcare workers are facing shortages of masks, gloves and other protective equipment.
In response, a group of more than 50 professional and amateur sewers have formed a group called the South London Scrubbers, which is distributing hundreds of medical uniforms, masks and kit bags to local hospitals. 
Ian Costello, 53, usually makes uniforms, which have featured in James Bond and Batman films and major London theatre productions. But since closing his business because of the national lockdown, the former Savile Row tailor has been making medical clothing.
""The country is in crisis and people need to help out,"" he said. ""People are banding together and trying to do something. It is a feel-good factor for everyone.""
The sewers range from teenagers to a lady in her nineties. Some are working from their dining tables or living-room floors. There are other volunteers involved in organising the supply chains and delivering the uniforms.
The British Medical Association warned earlier this month that doctors and nurses treating patients with COVID-19 are putting their lives at risk because of a lack of protective kit for frontline staff.
Britain's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said last week there is enough personal protective equipment nationally, but there are local shortages.
Sarah Trindle is one of the sewers, who normally runs a clothing and alterations company. She said that it is essential that medical staff are given the best possible uniforms. 
""I just felt very passionately that you wouldn't send a soldier to the front line without proper equipment,"" she said. ""I felt passionately that these scrubs should be made up professionally, finished to the highest standard.""

About 30 of the adult-sized stuffed dolls, complete with wigs and face masks, stethoscopes and surgical gloves, are propped up in front gardens in the village of Capel, at the foot of the Surrey Hills, about 30 miles south of London.
""We needed to cheer up the village and get people to have a laugh as they went around on their daily exercise,"" said Sally Wyborn, who instigated the idea of the scarecrows. 
Many of the unsung heroes of the coronavirus pandemic such as policeman and postmen, farmers, rubbish collectors and supermarket workers, are represented by the scarecrows, as well as doctors and nurses. 
The idea of giant dolls was not new to the villagers of Capel. They used to make them every June to advertise a fete and open gardens, but had not done so for nine years following the death of Wyborn's husband. 
After Britain went into lockdown on March 23, however, putting a stop to social interactions with people told to stay at home apart from a few exceptions including a one-hour daily outing for exercise, Wyborn had an idea. 
""In one of my mad moments, I suddenly thought why don't we resurrect the scarecrows, everybody's got time to make them,"" the 78-year-old told Reuters. 
Word was put out on email and social media and through local clubs for children, and the horticultural society for adults, and scarecrows soon lined the main street and side roads.
They will be there for the foreseeable future as Britons have no clarity on how and when the lockdown will be eased.

""Until it's all over. Leave them out until we come out of lockdown and then watch the party,"" Wyborn said.

The move by the separatist Southern (NYSE:SO) Transitional Council (STC) threatens to renew conflict between the STC and the Saudi-backed government, nominal allies under the coalition, even as the United Nations tries to secure a permanent nationwide ceasefire over the coronavirus pandemic.
Yemen's internationally recognised government warned of ""catastrophic consequences"" after the STC on Sunday declared emergency rule in southern governorates including Aden, interim seat of the government that was ousted from power in the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthi group in late 2014.
""The Coalition urges an immediate end to any steps contrary to the Riyadh Agreement, and work rapidly toward its implementation,"" the alliance said in a statement, referring to a power-sharing deal brokered by Saudi Arabia in November.
It voiced support for the Saudi-backed government and said implementation of the deal would form a ""competent government"" based in Aden to tackle the novel coronavirus, recent flooding and other economic and developmental challenges.
Yemen has been mired in violence since the coalition intervened in March 2015 on Hadi's side. There has been military stalemate for years and the Houthis hold most big urban centres.
The STC, which is backed by Riyadh's main coalition partner the United Arab Emirates, has long sought self-rule in the south and accuses Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government of mismanagement and corruption, a charge it denies.
The UAE, which shares the STC's distrust of an Islamist party in Hadi's government, reduced its presence in Yemen last year but maintains sway via southern fighters it backs.
The UAE is against the STC's unilateral move, its minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash said on Monday, adding that ""frustration"" with the Riyadh agreement's delay was no justification. 
The Riyadh agreement ended a previous stand-off between the separatists and the government last year.
The UAE has confidence in Saudi Arabia's commitment to implement the agreement, which could pave the way for the next stage of a political solution for Yemen, Gargash said. 
The Saudi-led coalition has announced a unilateral truce prompted by a U.N. plea to focus on the coronavirus pandemic. The Houthis have not accepted it and violence has continued.
While Yemen has reported only one confirmed COVID-19 case, aid groups fear a catastrophe if it spreads among a malnourished population in a country with a shattered health system.
The United Nations is trying to convene virtual talks on the truce, coordinated coronavirus efforts and confidence-building steps to restart negotiations to end the war that has killed more than 100,000.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile´s foreign ministry said Sunday it was ""astonished"" by comments from Argentine President Alberto Fernandez who recently met with Chilean opposition leaders, lambasting its neighbor for ""meddling in the internal affairs of Chile.""
Fernandez, a center-left Peronist, met Friday by video conference with members of the progressive Puebla Group, founded by lefists like Ecuador´s Rafael Correa, Brazil´s Lula da Silva and Uruguay´s Jose Musica, among others.
In the meeting, organized by Chile´s opposition, Fernandez encouraged the country´s left-leaning parties to ""overcome their differences and return to power on behalf of Chileans,"" according to media reports posted on the Puebla Group´s website. 
He told the group, which included leaders of Chile´s influential Socialist, Communist and Christian Democratic parties, that he was ""happy with what he was seeing in Chile,"" the media reports said.
Chile´s foreign ministry rebuked Fernandez´s comments in a statement on Sunday, saying they ""do not contribute to advancing a bilateral agenda that has been fruitful and which has been developed by diverse governments in both countries.""
Chile and Argentina, separated geographically by the Andes Mountains of South America, are long time rivals and have often been at odds politically.
Chile´s right-leaning President Sebastian Pinera, a billionaire businessman, faced months of often violent protests over inequality in late 2019. 

The protests, sparked by a hike in metro fares, saw the military take to the streets for the first time since the dictatorship of strongman Augusto Pinochet. They wrought billions in damages to infrastructure and business.

The Central American country reported 24 homicides on Friday, the worst one-day toll since Bukele took office in June, prompting him to order a 24-hour lockdown in prisons housing gang members.
By late afternoon on Sunday, police had registered another 29 murders, prompting Bukele to introduce tougher measures against gangs he said were taking advantage of the fact security forces were busy helping to contain the virus outbreak.
""The police and armed forces must prioritize safeguarding their lives, those of their companions and of honest citizens. The use of lethal force is authorized in self-defense or in defense of the lives of Salvadorans,"" Bukele said.
The government this weekend also ordered members of rival gangs into shared cells in a bid to break up lines of communication between members of the same group, and carried out searches in at least five prisons.

Some 12,862 gang members are incarcerated in El Salvador, prison authorities said.

Dubai on Friday cut its emirate-wide 24-hour lockdown back to a 10:00 pm to 6:00 am curfew. It has now taken the same step in the Al Ras and Naif districts, which had been sealed off as part of efforts to contain the spread of the virus.
The Supreme Committee of Crisis and Disaster Management took the decision since no new COVID-19 cases were recorded in the two areas in the last two days, the government media office said in a statement. It said more than 6,000 tests were conducted among Al Ras and Naif residents in less than a month.
The UAE has reported more than 10,300 cases and 76 deaths resulting from the virus, the second-highest count among the six Gulf Arab countries after Saudi Arabia. It does not give breakdowns for each of the seven emirates that make up the country.
The Gulf states, where expatriates make up the bulk of the labour force, have seen infections spread among low-wage foreign workers living in cramped quarters despite measures to combat the disease including the suspension of passenger flights, curfews and the closure of public spaces.

Dubai, the Middle East's business hub, on Friday allowed dine-in cafes and restaurants to resume business with a maximum capacity of 30% and shopping malls to be reopened partially. Mosques, cinemas and playgrounds remain closed.

Palestinians have expressed outrage at Israel's plans to cement its hold further on land it seized in the 1967 Middle East war, territory they are seeking for a state.
Netanyahu, in announcing a deal with his centrist rival Benny Gantz last week to form a unity government, set July 1 for the start of cabinet discussions on extending Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the West Bank and annexing outright the area's Jordan Valley. 
Such a move would need to be agreed with Washington, according to the Netanyahu-Gantz agreement.
In a video address on Sunday to a pro-Israeli Christian group in Europe, Netanyahu described a U.S. peace proposal announced by President Donald Trump in January as a promise to recognise Israel's authority over West Bank settlement land.
""A couple of months from now I am confident that that pledge will be honoured,"" Netanyahu told the European Commission for Israel.
Palestinian officials offered no immediate comment on Netanyahu's remarks.
Palestinians have flatly rejected the Trump peace proposal, partly because it awards Israel most of what it has sought during decades of conflict, including nearly all the occupied land on which it has built settlements.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday it was up to Israel whether to annex parts of the West Bank and said that Washington would offer its views privately to its new government.
The Palestinians and many countries regard Israel's settlements in the West Bank as illegal under the Geneva Conventions that bar settling on land captured in war.

Israel disputes this, citing security needs and biblical, historical and political connections to the land.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro is expected to name his presidential secretary to replace former Justice Minister Sergio Moro, who accused Bolsonaro of wrongdoing in his resignation on Friday, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The current head of the Brazilian Intelligence Agency (Abin), meanwhile, will be chosen as the new federal police chief, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
The appointments will place both jobs in the hands of two former police officers with close personal connections to Bolsonaro and his sons. 
Moro, a former judge who is popular for jailing corrupt politicians and businessmen, said he was quitting the government because Bolsonaro had fired the chief of the federal police for personal and political reasons.
Bolsonaro called the accusations ""baseless,"" while saying it was his right to pick the police chief. Bolsonaro denied interfering in police investigations involving members of his family or asking for federal police intelligence files.
Secretary of the Presidency Jorge Oliveira will take over as justice minister, with the nominations likely to be announced on Sunday, the source said. 
As secretary, Oliveira has overseen the drafting of Bolsonaro's decrees and legislative proposals, as well as other administrative tasks. 
Oliveira's father was Bolsonaro's aide for more than 20 years in Congress. Before Bolsonaro won election, Oliveira worked as chief of staff to Bolsonaro's son Eduardo.
Intelligence chief Alexandre Ramagem, who is tipped to be the new federal police chief, is also close friends with Bolsonaro's sons.
Bolsonaro took to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to defend Ramagem, whose nomination Brazilian press have reported since Friday, although he has yet to confirm his selection.
""So what? I knew Ramagem before I knew my children. Should he be vetoed for that reason? Whose friend should I pick?"" the president said in a post.
Ramagem took charge of Bolsonaro's personal security after Bolsonaro was stabbed on the campaign trail in 2018 and he became intelligence chief last July.
Bolsonaro's office declined to immediately comment. Calls to Oliveira went unanswered. The intelligence service Abin did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Ramagem.
The appointments are unlikely to fill the hole in the government left by Moro, whose exit is expected to alienate voters who backed Bolsonaro based on the president's anti-corruption message.

Moro's exit weakens Bolsonaro as Brazil is struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic. Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted as he has downplayed a pandemic that had killed more than 4,000 people in Brazil as of Saturday.

""Everyone who wants to and whose workplace allows it should be able to work in a home office - even when the coronavirus pandemic is over,"" Heil told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
With schools closed and many companies encouraging their employees to work from home to try to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, about 25% of Germans are now estimated to be working from home, up from about 12% normally.
Heil, a Social Democrat (SPD), said he would present legislation later in the year to anchor a right to home working in law, with employees allowed to work from home the whole time or for one or two days a week.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, also from the SPD, supported the idea, telling the paper: ""The past weeks have shown how much is possible in the home office - this is a real achievement that we should not just abandon.""
However, the German Employers' Association rejected it, telling the Funke media group that the last thing the battered economy needed at this time was more rules.
Katrin Goering-Eckardt, parliamentary leader of the opposition Greens, supported a right to home work but said it would only work if the government also guaranteed high-speed internet for all.
""A home office or mobile working must always be voluntary and needs binding rules. Nobody should be forced to do it, and a home office should not lead to work becoming limitless,"" she said in a statement.

Chanting popular protest slogans, mostly young activists clad in black swarmed the Cityplaza mall shouting ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times!"" while others called for the release of pro-democracy activists.
The protest was the first sizable gathering since the government imposed the ban on public meetings at the end of March to curb a spike in coronavirus infections.
Fears that Beijing is flexing its muscles over the Asian financial hub risk reviving anti-government protests after months of calm as social distancing rules start to ease.
Political tensions have escalated over the past two weeks after the arrest of 15 pro-democracy activists in the city's biggest crackdown on the movement. Beijing has said it supported the arrests in the Chinese special administrative region. 
On Sunday, police cordoned off sections of the Cityplaza mall, prompting some stores to shut as activists and shoppers, including families with children, were ordered to leave.
""People were just singing, it's very peaceful ... we didn't do anything illegally. Democracy and freedom is more important,"" said a high school student surnamed Or who came to participate ahead of his university entrance exam on Monday.

NEW DELHI, India (Reuters) - An Indian woman was allegedly gang raped in a school in the desert state of Rajasthan where she had been quarantined for a night by the police amid the nationwide coronavirus lockdown, a police official said on Sunday.
The incident occurred last week when the victim, a daily wage earner, sought shelter at a police station after walking alone for miles and losing the way to her native village.
In the absence of a quarantine centre, local police housed her for the night in a school building, where she was allegedly raped by three men.
""Three local men who raped the woman inside the school on Apr. 23 have been arrested and sent to jail,"" Parth Sharma, a deputy superintendent of police in Sawai Madhopur district in Rajasthan and the investigating officer in the case, told Reuters by telephone.
The victim, aged between 40-45 years, said in a statement to the police that she had been walking for several days from Sawai Madhopur before she reached a village where she was raped.
Sharma said the woman had been sent to a local quarantine facility to get tested for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
""We don't know how long she was on her own for, and who she came into contact with, and her test results are not yet known,"" he said, adding that a junior police official had been suspended for negligence.
The nationwide lockdown imposed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last month to contain the spread of the virus prompted tens of thousands of workers who lost their jobs in cities to walk for days in desperation to reach their homes in rural India.
Many of them are now in overcrowded quarantine centres and authorities are struggling to cope.
Experts fear that the world's biggest lockdown has not been able to reduce the spread of COVID-19, and country has begun to see a surge in cases with testing being ramped up.
India, with a population of 1.3 billion, has reported 26,496 cases of COVID-19, and 824 deaths. Despite stringent laws, rape occurs every 20 minutes, on average, according to federal crime data.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Rescuers on Sunday retrieved two bodies of South Korean trekkers who went missing after being hit by a massive avalanche in January on one of the most popular hiking trails in Nepal, police and army officials said.
Four South Korean trekkers and three guides disappeared in January after being hit by the avalanche in Hinku village, 150 km (90 miles) northwest of Kathmandu.
They were returning from a trek to the Annapurna Base Camp, one of Nepal's busiest destinations for adventure tourists.
The area is home to Mount Annapurna, the world's 10th highest mountain at 8,091 metres (26,545 feet) and is visited by thousands of foreign hikers and climbers every year.
Villagers spotted the two bodies of the South Korean trekkers on Saturday. They were found by the side of a river after the snow melted due to rising temperatures, police official Raj Kumar K.C. said.
""A rescue helicopter was used to bring the bodies today from the remote area,"" he told Reuters, adding that the bodies of one male and one female trekker will be handed over to the families after necessary legal formalities were completed.
Authorities earlier found the bodies of two of the Nepali guides who were part of the group. 
Army spokesman Bidyan Dev Pandey said search and rescue personnel continued to look for the three other missing victims - two South Korean trekkers and a Nepali guide.
Trekking and mountain climbing is a key source of income and employment in cash-strapped Nepal.
The Himalayan nation has cancelled all trekking and mountain climbing activities this year amid a nationwide lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus.

GREELEY, Colo. (Reuters) - Royal Rose is reopening her Colorado tattoo studio next week after closing a month ago, not because she wants to but because the bills are piling up and she says she has no choice.
""I would stay home if the government encouraged that, but they're not, they're saying 'Hey, the best thing to do is go back to work, even though it might be risky,'"" said Rose, 39, sitting inside her salon in a wood-sided building on a leafy street in the farming and oil town of Greeley.
Colorado is among the first wave of U.S. states beginning an experiment to reopen economies without the testing and contact-tracing infrastructure health experts say is needed to prevent a resurgence of the coronavirus, with lives in the balance.
""I feel like we are like test dummies that they're learning off of,"" said Mary Ramirez, a Greeley hair salon owner who will not be reopening next week as she believes, like Rose, there is insufficient safety guidance and planning. 
Colorado's Democratic Governor Jared Polis gave the green light for retail curbside pickup to begin on Monday. Hair salons, barbershops and tattoo parlors can open next Friday. Retail stores, restaurants and movie theaters will follow. 
Greeley's Republican-controlled Weld County Commission, which has long sparred with Polis over public policy, went a step further, telling all businesses they could reopen on Monday. The city and county of Denver, on the other hand, extended stay-at-home orders until May 8, citing a lack of testing and contact tracing.
White House guidelines say states and counties should wait until new coronavirus cases decline for two weeks before reopening. The virus has killed more than 51,000 people in the United States, more than any other country.
An influential University of Washington model often used by the White House for COVID-19 projections says the earliest Colorado should reopen is May 25-31, and only then if it has sufficient capacity to test for the virus and contain future outbreaks. It says Colorado already has the second highest death rate in the West after Washington state.
With Colorado yet to record a sustained decline in cases, the governor says he sees ""calculated risks"" in reopening. He and other governors want to get economies rolling after the virus put 26.5 million Americans out of work and decimated states' income from taxes.
'TIME OF INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY'
Weld, about an hour's drive north of Denver, with a large Latino and Hispanic community, has the third highest coronavirus death toll of any Colorado county with 70 fatalities. Its huge JBS USA (SA:JBSS3) meat processing plant was forced to close temporarily after the state reported four workers died there from COVID-19.
Still, local tattoo artist Steven Ortega, 35, wants to get back to business after the shutdown made it difficult to pay the rent and feed his family. He said he has 10 customers on his waiting list.
""People are lined up, we're ready to go,"" said Ortega, who believes he and his clients will be protected by the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks.
Loosening the restrictions does not mean the local economy will roar back to life or people will follow new guidance, which includes wearing masks, some residents say.
""Half the people who come in here aren't taking it seriously, no masks or gloves,"" Johanna Ramirez, 35, owner of Mi Pueblo Market grocery store in Fort Lupton on the county's plains, said as she rang up a customer who was not wearing a face covering.
Announcing the reopening, Polis told Coloradans they were entering ""the time of individual responsibility and choices,"" and he trusted them to ""make good choices.""
An entrepreneur known for libertarian views, his message has differed from Democrat governors in California and neighboring New Mexico who have respectively told residents they must stay home until mid or early May for the good of the community.
Epidemiologist Lee Newman said ""in an ideal world"" Coloradans would continue to stay home, but many can no longer afford food or medicine unless they return to work.
""We don't have enough tests being done to know how long we need to wait, how long we need to keep the society at the same level as we're at now in terms of closures,"" said Newman, professor of environmental and occupational health and epidemiology at the Colorado School of Public Health. 
Waiting longer to reopen makes no sense to Weld County Commissioner Kevin Ross, who is counting on PPE and social distancing to curb the spread of the virus, given the ""really low"" rate of testing.
""There's starting to be more of a panic, and more of a fear of not having work than the virus itself,"" Ross said.
Colorado is among the lowest 25% of states in terms of per capita testing, with 9,971 tests per million people, according to the Covid Tracking Project, a volunteer group which publishes data on the pandemic.
Rose is also depending on PPE to protect herself and clients at her cosmetic tattoo and beauty parlor, in the absence of what she sees as responsible national, state or county leadership.

""They're not taking this logically. They're doing this more towards favoritism, 'Let's win the people, let's give them what they want,' instead of 'No, this is what you need,'"" said Rose, who will be wearing a face shield, N95 respirator mask, gloves and protective gown when she reopens.

1216,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 07:05AM ET</span>","Heir unapparent: If North Korea faces succession, who might replace Kim?","By Sangmi Cha
(Reuters) - North Korea has never announced who would follow leader Kim Jong Un in the event he is incapacitated, and with no details known about his young children, analysts say his sister and loyalists could form a regency until a successor is old enough to take over.
South Korean and Chinese officials have publicly cast doubt on reports that Kim was gravely ill following a cardiovascular procedure, after his absence from a key state anniversary event on April 15 triggered speculation about his health.
But the media reports sparked questions about who is in place to take over if Kim, thought to be about 36, a third-generation hereditary leader, fell seriously ill or died. He became leader when his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack.
Each change at the top in North Korea has raised the prospect of a leadership vacuum or collapse of the Kim dynasty, which has ruled the country since its founding in 1948.
So far, each of the three Kims to rule North Korea has defied expectations, holding on to power with an iron grip. But under Kim Jong Un, North Korea's arsenal of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles has grown substantially, raising concerns over who would control them.
The following are key figures in the North Korean leadership circle and what role they may play in any transition.
 
KIM YO JONG
Kim's younger sister has been the most visible presence around the leader in the past two years, serving formally as a vice director of the ruling Workers' Party's powerful Central Committee but unofficially as her brother's chief of staff. 
Kim Yo Jong was named an alternate member of the ruling Workers' Party's powerful Central Committee Politburo this month, continuing her climb through the leadership hierarchy.
The leader's sister, believed to be 31, has a firm control of key party functions, setting herself to be the main source of power behind a collective leadership.
""Kim Yo Jong will be for the time being the main power base with control of the organisation and guidance department, the judiciary and public security,"" said Cho Han-bum of the Korea Institute for National Unification, a government-funded think-tank in Seoul.
PARTY ELDERS 
Choe Ryong Hae rose to be North Korea's nominal head of state last year as president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly. 
This capped decades of service with the party for the ruling Kim family, following his role as the influential political head of the military under the young leader.
Choe and Pak Pong Ju, a fellow politburo member and former state premier who oversaw the North's push to introduce more free-market functions to revive its economy, are likely to be the figureheads leading a collective leadership, analysts say.
Kim Yong Chol, a party vice chairman and former top nuclear envoy not related to the Kim dynasty, and Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon could be tasked with handling diplomatic issues, including stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States, as they played a key role in Kim Jong Un's summits with U.S. President Donald Trump. 
ESTRANGED BROTHERS, AUNT
Kim Jong Chol is the leader's older brother but has not been part of the country's leadership, instead leading a quiet life playing music, according to Thae Yong Ho, North Korea's former deputy ambassador in London, who defected to the South.
He is believed to be disinterested in public life and is unlikely to emerge as a major presence, though some analysts say he maintains ties with siblings and could play a more public role in a contingency. 
Kim Kyong Hui was once a powerful figure in the leadership circle when her brother Kim Jong Il ruled the country. But she has not been seen since her husband, Jang Song Thaek, once regarded as the second most powerful man in the country, was executed in 2013 by Kim Jong Un. She has long been ill but briefly appeared early this year at a gala performance alongside her nephew. 
 
FOURTH GENERATION
Kim Jong Un is believed to have three children with Ri Sol Ju, the youngest born in 2017, according to the South's National Intelligence Service.
The oldest is a 10-year-old son, meaning any of the three would need the assistance of their relatives or political guardians if they were to become a fourth-generation hereditary leader. 
Kim Jong Il had been groomed for 20 years to lead the country, while Kim Jong Un had just over a year to prepare, due to his father's sudden death from a heart attack.

""Kim Yo Jong is unlikely to take over the helm but could help build a caretaker regime as a power broker until the kids grow up, and Kim Jong Chol might return to help for a while,"" said Go Myong-hyun, a research fellow at the Asian Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.

1217,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 26, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","South Korea's big churches reopen with designated seats, size limits","SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's large churches reopened on Sunday, requiring worshipers to keep their distance and wear masks, after the government relaxed restrictions on religious gatherings aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.
Onnuri Church, one of the biggest churches in Seoul, required members to sign up online ahead of the service and sit on designated seats to maintain distance.
It has also limited attendance to 700 in a hall with a capacity of 3,000 people, a church official said.
Last Sunday, South Korea extended its social distancing policy until May 5 but offered some relief for religious and sports facilities previously subject to strict restrictions.
    A secretive church, the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, was at the epicenter of South Korea's coronavirus outbreak, with about half of the country's total infections of 10,728 linked to its members. 
The first confirmed patient in the church, South Korea's 31st overall, was discharged from a hospital on Friday after being treated for over two months, the hospital in the southeastern city of Daegu said on Sunday. 
    South Korea managed to curb the first major outbreak outside China with massive testing and aggressive contact tracing but there have been a series of small outbreaks involving churches and other clusters.
South Korea on Sunday reported 10 new cases, marking the eight day when the number of new infections hovered around that level.  
Church members expressed faith in the ability by South Korea and churches to tackle the coronavirus outbreak. 
“I did not have fear. I believed that the church would abide by safe principles,” Kang Hye-mi, a 29-year-old worshiper, said at Myeongdong Catholic Cathedral in Seoul.
    When restrictions were put in place, South Korean churches turned to online or drive-in services where churchgoers attended by parking their cars on school playgrounds.  
Yang Sun-kyung, who went to the Onnuri church for the first time in two months, said she is able to concentrate better when attending church rather than during online worship which was sometimes distracting. 
    ""I hope this (our church) can be an exemplary case for others,” Han Jin-gun, a 34-year-old worshiper at Onnuri said.
On Sunday, South Korean health authorities expressed concerns about the resurgence of virus, with more people going out on weekends as social distancing rules ease and ahead of a holiday that will start on Thursday.
There is a higher chance of infection in confined and dense places like churches, clubs and bars, especially among those in their twenties who account for the biggest portion of infected people, Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), told a briefing.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's stand-in leader resisted pressure on Sunday to explain how the government plans to ease a coronavirus lockdown that has been in place for a month, warning that hasty action could result in a second peak of infections.
Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from COVID-19, said the government was working privately on how to move out of the lockdown but it would be irresponsible to speculate in public.
""We are at a delicate and dangerous stage and we need to make sure that the next steps are sure-footed,"" Raab said during an interview on Sky News, urging the public to keep focusing on the current guidance to stay at home.
""We are proceeding very cautiously and we are sticking to the medical advice, the scientific advice, with the social distancing measures at this time, while doing all the homework to make sure that we're prepared in due course for the next phase.""
The number of deaths related to COVID-19 in hospitals across the United Kingdom has risen above 20,000, the latest data showed on Saturday, with the overall figure likely to be significantly higher once deaths in care homes and hospices are tallied.
The economic news has been equally dire. Data released last week showed demand had slumped to an all-time low, retail sales had plunged by the most on record and government debt was surging. 
With a Bank of England interest rate-setter warning that the economic contraction could be the worst in centuries, the data added to pressure on the government to give some indication of when and how people and businesses would be able to get to work.
""NOT CREDIBLE"" 
Johnson, who spent a week in hospital in early April including three nights in intensive care, will return to work full-time on Monday and is ""raring to go"", Raab said.
On his desk, Johnson will find an open letter from opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer arguing that the British government was falling behind the rest of the world in refusing to open up about how it would ease the lockdown.
""Simply acting as if this discussion is not happening is not credible,"" Starmer wrote in the letter, which he posted on Twitter on Sunday.
He said he believed the government had been too slow to impose the lockdown, to increase the uptake of testing and to get personal protective equipment (PPE) to hospital and care home staff.
""We need to see a significant step-change in the government's response to this pandemic. Decisions need to be taken quicker and communication with the public needs to be clearer,"" he said.
On the issue of testing, the government has set itself a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April. Fewer than 29,000 tests were carried out on April 24, the most recent available data shows.
Raab said capacity now stood at 51,000 a day and he expected a surge in actual tests being carried out in the coming week.

""You always get the exponential increase in a project like this in the last week as the capacity comes on tap,"" he said. ""I think we're going to see a big surge in the last week, and we're on track to hit that target.""

""A European race to see who will allow tourist travel first will lead to unacceptable risks,"" Maas told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.
Maas referred to the high infection rate in the Austrian ski resort of Ischgl, where many German tourists are believed to have been infected. 
""We have already experienced what an infection cluster in a popular holiday resort can do in the home countries of tourists. This must not happen again,"" he said. 
Hundreds of tourists from countries including Germany, Norway and Iceland are believed to have been infected in Ischgl, which is near the point where Austria, Switzerland and Italy meet and is renowned for its party scene.
The local authorities have been widely accused of responding too slowly as it is now clear the virus found a breeding ground in crowded apres-ski bars at various resorts and spread in Ischgl for a month before it was quarantined on March 13.
Austrian authorities lifted coronavirus quarantines this week at three of the country’s top ski resorts, including Ischgl, removing the restrictions days before they were due to expire.
The country has suggested a staggered resumption of tourism, initially allowing German visitors in, rather than a full restart of the European Union’s suspended open-border pact.
Maas said Europe needs to agree common criteria for a way back to freedom of travel ""as quickly as possible, but as responsibly as necessary"".
""We must not let the hard-won successes of the last few weeks be ruined,"" said Maas, adding that otherwise there would be travel restrictions for much longer.
Meanwhile, the German Travel Association (DRV) said 60% of travel agencies and tour operators see themselves directly threatened by insolvency, a survey of member companies published in the Bild am Sonntag showed.
According to the survey, every fifth company has already laid off employees, and 80% have applied for state aid.

Under a deal to end the power struggle in south Yemen agreed in Riyadh, the STC and other southerners were supposed to join a new national cabinet and place all forces under control of the internationally recognized government. The STC is supported by the United Arab Emirates.

Criticism is growing over the government response to the pandemic, with limited testing and shortages of protective equipment for medical workers and carers.
Johnson's stand-in leader Dominic Raab has faced questions over how Britain will ease the lockdown without a deadly second wave of infections.
Britain's interior minister urged Britons to stick to the lockdown rules earlier on Saturday. But many lawmakers want restrictions to be eased to bolster the economy, which budget forecasters say could be heading into its deepest recession in more than 300 years.

WASHINGTON/SEOUL (Reuters) - A special train possibly belonging to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was spotted this week at a resort town in the country, according to satellite images reviewed by a Washington-based North Korea monitoring project, amid conflicting reports about Kim's health and whereabouts.
The monitoring project, 38 North, said in its report on Saturday that the train was parked at the ""leadership station"" in Wonsan on April 21 and April 23. The station is reserved for the use of the Kim family, it said.
Though the group said it was probably Kim Jong Un's train, Reuters has not been able to confirm that independently, or whether he was in Wonsan. 
""The train's presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country's eastern coast,"" the report said.
Speculation about Kim's health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea's founding father and Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15. 
North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. 
China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on Kim Jong Un, according to three people familiar with the situation.
A third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father's death in 2011, Kim has no clear successor in a nuclear-armed country, which could present major international risk.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump downplayed reports that Kim was ill. ""I think the report was incorrect,"" Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.
Trump has met Kim three times in an attempt to persuade him to give up a nuclear weapons program that threatens the United States as well as its Asian neighbors. While talks have stalled, Trump has continued to hail Kim as a friend.
REPORTS AND CONTROLS
Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult because of tight controls on information. 
A Trump administration official said continuing days of North Korean media silence on Kim's whereabouts had heightened concerns about his condition, and that information remained scant from a country U.S. intelligence has long regarded as a ""black box.""
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to questions about the situation on Saturday.
Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that reports on North Korea, cited one unnamed source in North Korea on Monday as saying that Kim had undergone medical treatment in the resort county of Hyangsan north of the capital Pyongyang.
It said that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. 
Since then, multiple South Korean media reports have cited unnamed sources this week saying that Kim might be staying in the Wonsan area.
On Friday, local news agency Newsis cited South Korean intelligence sources as reporting that a special train for Kim's use had been seen in Wonsan, while Kim's private plane remained in Pyongyang.
Newsis reported Kim may be sheltering from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. 

Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.

Macron is aiming to ease some of the lockdown measures then with schools reopening first, although the government has yet to finalise how it might work in practice.
France has also offered retailers some relief by saying it wants them to reopen on May 11, though some curbs could remain in certain areas to delay a new wave of the coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin issued a rare joint statement on Saturday commemorating a 1945 World War Two link-up of U.S. and Soviet troops on their way to defeat Nazi Germany as an example of how their countries can cooperate.
The statement by Trump and Putin comes amid deep strains in U.S.-Russian ties over a raft of issues, from arms control and Russia’s intervention in Ukraine and Syria to U.S. charges that Russia has spread disinformation about the novel coronavirus pandemic and interfered in U.S. election campaigns.
The Wall Street Journal reported that the decision to issue the statement sparked debate within the Trump administration, with some officials worried it could undercut stern U.S. messages to Moscow.
The joint statement marked the anniversary of the April 25, 1945 meeting on a bridge over the Elbe River in Germany of Soviet soldiers advancing from the east and American troops moving from the West.
“This event heralded the decisive defeat of the Nazi regime,” the statement said. “The ‘Spirit of the Elbe’ is an example of how our countries can put aside differences, build trust, and cooperate in pursuit of a greater cause.”
The Journal said the last joint statement marking the Elbe River bridge link-up was issued in 2010, when the Obama administration was seeking improved relations with Moscow.
Trump had hoped to travel to Moscow to mark the anniversary. He has been complimentary of Putin, promoted cooperation with Moscow, and said he believed the Russian leader’s denials of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 
Senior administration officials and lawmakers, in contrast, have been fiercely critical of Russia, with relations between the nuclear-armed nations at their lowest point since the end of the Cold War. 
The Republican-led Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday issued a bipartisan report concurring with a 2017 U.S. intelligence assessment that Russia pursued an influence campaign of misinformation and cyber hacking aimed at swinging the vote to Trump over his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton.

U.S. intelligence officials have warned lawmakers that Moscow is meddling in the 2020 presidential election campaign, which Russia denies.

Police said on Twitter they had arrested more than 100 people.
Some protesters tried to keep a distance from each other, sitting on the ground and wearing masks, but others clustered together.
Like dozens of countries around the globe, Germany has put in place strict curbs on public activity to slow transmission of COVID-19, imposing its lockdown on March 17.
The protesters handed out newspapers entitled ""Democratic Resistance"", which said the new coronavirus is an attempt to seize power by spreading fear. The papers quoted 127 doctors from around the world who question the need for strict lockdowns. 
Police spokesman Thilo Cablitz said permission had been granted for a newspaper distribution campaign, but the health authorities had not granted permission for a public demonstration.
""During coronavirus times and according to containment regulations, we are obliged to prevent a gathering,"" Cablitz said, adding 180 police officers were on duty.
Germany's Constitutional Court ruled earlier this month that people have the right to hold protests if they adhere to social distancing rules, after pro-democracy activists brought a case argued that the lockdown breaches freedom of assembly.
On Saturday, some protesters sat peacefully on the ground at a distance from each other, holding white roses in reference to the White Rose resistance movement against the Nazis.
""We are here today ... to stand up for our opinion. For the protection of constitutional rights, freedom, and above all freedom of speech,"" said a woman holding a rose who gave her name only as Sandra.
Germany has the fifth-highest COVID-19 case total behind the United States, Spain, Italy and France. However it has kept fatalities relatively low after early and extensive testing.
Encouraged by lower infection figures, the government allowed smaller stores to re-open on Monday, along with car and bicycle dealers and bookstores, but social distancing rules remain in place until May 3.

The country's confirmed cases increased by 2,055 to 152,438 and the death toll rose by 179 to 5,500, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Saturday - a second day of deceleration in both cases and deaths.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's coronavirus lockdown put a dampener on annual celebrations marking the end of a long dictatorship on Saturday, with noisy street marches replaced by virtual events and balcony singalongs.
It is 46 years since an almost bloodless revolution finally led the country to democracy, ending the authoritarian regime put in place by dictator Antonio Oliveira Salazar, on April 25 1974.
Every year, to pay tribute to those who fought for democracy in the ""Carnation"" revolution, thousands of people gather in the streets holding red carnations and shouting ""Fascism, never again!"". 
Similar celebrations were planned this year, but the nation's strict coronavirus lockdown, which was declared on March 18 and renewed until May 2, forced authorities to come up with alternatives.
Local governments opted to organise various online concerts, theatre plays and virtual tours of galleries and landmark buildings, including the official residence of Prime Minister Antonio Costa.
And at exactly 3 p.m., many residents took to their balconies to sing the revolutionary anthem ""Grandola Vila Morena"".
""Singing from the window, all at the same time, is a way to say that even in confinement we celebrate democracy and freedom,"" the leader of the Left Bloc party Catarina Martins told RTP television. 
In Lisbon's Alcantara neighbourhood, a group of municipal workers drove around in an open truck with loud speakers, singing traditional songs and handing out carnations to residents confined to their homes.
The annual event at the country's parliament was also subdued. Normally, 230 lawmakers and hundreds of guests gather, but numbers were limited this year to reduce the risk of contagion. 

Portugal has so far reported 23,392 coronavirus cases and 880 deaths, a small fraction of the toll in neighbouring Spain, and it plans to slowly start reopening its economy from May onwards.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain released guidelines on Saturday allowing children to go outside after six weeks living under one of Europe's strictest lockdowns, as figures confirmed a daily coronavirus death toll running well below the peak seen early this month.
Spain's Health Ministry said 378 more people had died after being diagnosed with Coronavirus, up slightly on Friday's 367, the lowest in the past month, but well down on the high of 950 seen on April 2. 
The total of fatalities in one of the countries most badly affected by the virus rose to 22,902 and the overall number of cases rose to 223,759 from 219,764 the day before.
Spain sees enough evidence of the virus being under control to start easing its lockdown. Children were trying out their masks in anticipation of their first taste of fresh air since Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez declared a state of emergency on March 14.
The government said under 14s will from Sunday be allowed up to one hour of supervised outdoor activity per day between 9am and 9pm, staying within one kilometre of their home. 
Adults can accompany up to three children, who will not be allowed to use playparks and must adhere to social distancing guidelines, remaining at least two metres from other people.
The government has not yet said when confinement measures will be eased for older children. 
Spain's emergency health chief Fernando Simon urged people to ""avoid excessive euphoria"" over the deconfinement measures and said ""we must maintain collective responsibility"". 
Top police officials urged parents not to abuse the system and to ensure their children stick to the rules. 
On April 13 sectors including construction and manufacturing were allowed to reopen, but with most people still confined to their homes except for essential reasons, shops, bars and public spaces remain closed.
DECONFINEMENT PLAN
Catalan Regional President Quim Torra announced the region's own plan to ease lockdown measures, including stipulating specific hours when children of different ages could go outside. 
Defending his measures, which ignore Health Ministry guidelines and highlight a rumbling discontent in some regions with the national response, Torra said: ""We have the right to have our own deconfinement plan"". 
In Pineda de Mar, northeast Spain, volunteer seamstresses were hard at work making face masks for children ahead of the deconfinement measure.
""More than 100 people are making protective equipment,"" the town's mayor Xavier Amor told Reuters. ""We started with masks and then we followed the demand of hospitals, health centres, and nursing homes."" 
As bars and restaurants eye a gradual reopening one company is devising safety measures to encourage wary clients to return.
Leganes-based LlenaTuBar, whose name translates as fill up your bar, is fitting dining tables with clear plastic screens to protect customers and installing thermal cameras to detect any patrons with a fever.
""It's a critical situation for the hospitality sector and if we're locked down much longer, people will struggle to reopen their businesses,"" owner Manuel Gil told Reuters.
As the economic fallout from the virus continues to build, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez reiterated calls for a pan-European response.
""The depth of the economic downturn and the risk that its effects will persist after the health emergency requires that a foundation be laid for a rapid, balanced, environmentally sustainable and socially just recovery,"" Sanchez wrote in a piece for newspaper Expansion on Saturday.
The Health Ministry on Friday changed the methodology for logging cases of the virus. It will no longer count antibody tests and will only include positive results from PCR tests. 

Discounting antibody tests puts Saturday's total number of cases at 205,905 and Friday's at 202,990.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - The coronavirus epidemic has not only put Nepal's people and economy in lockdown for a month, but also stopped the slow and desperately needed reconstruction of homes and other buildings devastated by two huge earthquakes in 2015.
A magnitude 7.8 quake hit Nepal on April 25 of that year and was followed by another of magnitude 7.3 less than three weeks later. Whole towns, centuries-old temples and other historic sites were reduced to rubble.
Almost 9,000 people were killed and more than a million houses destroyed, at a cost to the economy of $6 billion (£4.8 billion).
Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli offered condolences to the families of victims in an anniversary statement released late on Friday.
Manohar Ghimire at the state-run National Reconstruction Authority said the nationwide lockdown, ordered on March 24, had kept construction workers at home along with most others.
Nepal has reported 49 cases of coronavirus and no deaths so far.
Reconstruction has already suffered from political infighting, bureaucracy and confusion. Officials say fewer than half a million houses have been built or rebuilt, along with 5,300 of the required 7,500 school buildings and less than half of the 900 damaged monuments and cultural sites.
Many people who were left without land ownership certificates after the quake have yet to receive loans from banks to start rebuilding houses.
Hari Darshan Shrestha of the independent Centre for Resilient Development said victims of the earthquake were frustrated by the slow pace of construction and the building materials and housing designs approved by the NRA.

""Many people are still living in vulnerable temporary structures,"" he said.

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia sent four planes carrying medical equipment including gloves, masks and protective suits to Italy on Saturday as a donation to help the EU member state tackle the spread of coronavirus. 
Another four equipment-laden planes will be sent in the next two days, also donated by the Serbian government, President Aleksandar Vucic said. 
""We will win together, be brave Italy, Serbia is with you,"" Vucic wrote on one of the boxes of equipment before it was loaded on to a plane.
Last year Italy was Serbia's second-largest trade partner after Germany, statistics bureau data in January showed. Italian companies including Fiat employ more than 20,000 people in Serbia. 
""On its path to Europe, Serbia always had help from Italy,"" Vucic said, noting that during devastating floods in 2014, Italy was one of the first countries to send aid. 
""This is our opportunity to say thank you."" 
Serbia so far reported 7,483 cases of people infected with the coronavirus and 144 deaths. 
The Balkan country has been cultivating strong ties with China and has received help from Beijing, which sent six doctors to help their Serbian colleagues during the pandemic.
Vucic had at the beginning of the crisis criticised the European Union for introducing a ban on the export of masks to non-EU countries, including Serbia.
Recently EU officials, including its foreign policy chief Josep Borrell, have criticised Vucic for praising only China for help. 

""I have never seen billboards thanking the European Union,"" Borrell told members of the European Parliament in Brussels this week, referring to billboards in Belgrade featuring a picture of Chinese President Xi Jinping thanking China for its help during the coronavirus crisis.

Live streaming from his studio in Taipei, Peter Petrus, the professional name he uses for his business, teaches the art of wine-tasting online to people across the island.
The containment measures have had a big impact on business, Petrus told Reuters.
""So I started contemplating if there might be a way to work around this situation - at the end of the day the company has to keep going.""
While Taiwan has been relatively successful so far in curbing the spread of the virus, with 428 cases and six deaths, the government has been promoting social distancing and discouraging large gatherings to keep the pandemic under control.
Online tasting has a few constraints - mainly around packing, maintaining the right temperature and sending the bottles on time to customers.
“The problem with wine is that it starts oxidation once you open the bottle,"" said Petrus, who meticulously pours a selection of wine into smaller bottles and labels each before couriering. 
Students who receive the wine samples join Petrus online to sip together as they flip through the course material.
Petrus, who films and livestreams via his smartphone, keeps his students engaged while he explains the finer points of each wine.
Candice Yang, a 32-year-old maths teacher, who joined one of his online courses this week, described the experience as 'quite special.'

JAKARTA (Reuters) - An Indonesian court convicted six activists of treason for organising a protest demanding independence for the easternmost province of Papua, in a verdict slammed by rights groups.
The peaceful protest of about 100 people had been held outside the presidential palace and military headquarters on Aug. 28 in the capital of Jakarta and followed a period of unrest in Papua.
In a sentencing hearing on Friday held online due to the coronavirus outbreak, Judge Agustinus Setya Wahyu Triwiranto said he had found the six defendants ""guilty of treason"". 
Activists Ambrosius Mulait, Surya Anta, Charles Kossay, Dano Tabuni, and Arina Elopere were convicted and sentenced to nine months in prison, while Isay Wenda was given an eight-month sentence.
All six have been held in prison since August. Prosecutors accused them in December of organising a rally demanding the Indonesian government allow a vote in Papua to let it separate from Indonesia.
International rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch criticised the convictions, stating that the activists had been attending a peaceful rally over perceived ethnic discrimination.
“The six who were sentenced today did nothing but attend a peaceful protest, enjoying their rights to freedom of expression and assembly,"" said Amnesty International Indonesia director Usman Hamid. 
Amnesty noted the six activists are part of 57 ""prisoners of conscience"" from Papua being held for peacefully expressing their views.
Resource-rich Papua was a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a controversial U.N.-backed referendum in 1969, which has since endured decades of mostly low-level separatist conflict.
Thousands of Papuans staged rallies in August to protest an incident that saw a racist slur against Papuan students who were hit by tear gas in their dormitory and detained in the city of Surabaya. The resulting protests were the biggest in years and triggered some calls for independence.
Oky Wiratma, the lawyer for the activists, told Reuters on Saturday the verdict was disproportionate, and the Papuan activists had ""protested peacefully against racism"".
He said the six activists were expected to be released in the coming weeks based on the time already served, barring a decision by prosecutors to appeal.

Prosecutors had originally sought 18-months sentences for the activists. Prosecutors were not immediately reachable for comment.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's ruling party on Saturday showed support for a Hong Kong bookseller who fled to the democratic island amid fears of Chinese persecution, with President Tsai Ing-wen offering congratulations as he opened a new shop in Taipei.
Lam Wing-kee sought refuge in Taiwan last year after he was detained by Chinese agents for eight months in 2015 while working at a bookshop in Hong Kong that sold books critical of the Chinese leadership.
The case triggered a huge controversy and raised fears of growing Chinese control in the financial hub.
Lam made front-page headlines earlier this week after a man threw red paint at him, just days before the reopening of his ""Causeway Bay Books"" in Taipei - a symbol of resistance to perceived Chinese encroachments on Hong Kong's liberties.
The attack shocked many in Taiwan, which has become a refuge for a small but growing number of pro-democracy protesters fleeing Chinese-ruled Hong Kong. Taiwan has voiced its strong support for the protesters and repeatedly rejected Beijing's proposals to rule the island with the ""one country, two systems"" model it uses for Hong Kong.
Senior officials from the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) joined the reopening on Saturday, including head of parliament Yu Shyi-kun, who said it was a moment of ""pride"" for the island's democracy.
President Tsai sent a pot of orchids and a short message of congratulations, citing a Christian song often sung by protesters in Hong Kong calling for fairness and justice.
""If a bookshop fails to open in Taiwan just because it is disliked by China, then what Taiwan is proud of the most - democracy and freedom - will suffer great harm,"" Taiwan's vice president-elect William Lai wrote on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
""We must strongly condemn violence and intimidation. Everyone, please support the bookshop. Supporting Causeway Bay Books in Taipei is to support freedom of publication in Taiwan.""
Lam, who moved to Taiwan last year, told Reuters that he is worried about more attacks but he will continue his fight against the Chinese Communist Party by reopening the tiny shop packed with political books in the heart of Taipei.
""Opening a bookshop is a resistance...Taiwan needs more bookshops like this,"" he said, adding that he's hoping to set up a branch in the island's southern port city of Kaohsiung. 
Three suspects were arrested and released on bail this week for the attack, the police said. 
Lam's incarceration was part of a coordinated operation by China's security apparatus that led to five booksellers disappearing in late 2015, and later showing up in Chinese detention where they were forced to make confessions on public television.
Speaking in the shop crowded with journalists, DPP Secretary General Luo Wen-jia congratulated Lam's reopening in the ""land of democracy."" 

""I hope one day the bookshop could return to its origin - Hong Kong's Causeway Bay,"" he told Lam.

Poland was one of the first European Union states to close borders due to the outbreak of the new coronavirus. It also imposed a mandatory two-week lockdown for those who enter its territory - a major jolt for those who live their lives in between two EU states. 
The protest was staged on a foot bridge connecting Zgorzelec and the German town of Gorlitz, which functioned as one town before the borders were closed.
""I've been trapped at home for six weeks, can't cross the border, go to work. I can't go back to my students,"" said Mirella Binkiewicz, a teacher living in Zgorzelec and working in Gorlitz.
Around 300 people gathered at the Polish side and some 100 at the German, some wearing face masks. The two groups were separated by a provisional metal fence that has been erected in the middle of the bridge to prevent people from crossing the border.
""Let us work, let us home,"" said one banner carried by the protesters in Poland. Some of them also chanted the Polish national anthem and others hummed the EU anthem, the Ode to Joy.
Renata Burdosz, from Zgorzelec town hall, cited data showing that around 20,000 Poles work in the German region of Saxony, 10,500 of whom cross the Polish-German border on a daily basis. Around 3,000 Poles work in Gorlitz alone, she said. 
Protests were staged also in other Polish towns located on the German and Czech borders. 
""Let's remember that jobs will not wait forever for the return of Polish workers. Will these people ... receive help and support from the state?"" local authorities from the south-western Poland said in an open letter to Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki. 
Morawiecki said earlier this month that borders would remain closed until at least May 3. 

""This is a difficult issue. I understand the difficulties of the citizens, and the government will discuss this next week,"" a government spokesman told private radio Zet on Saturday.

WASHINGTON/BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - China sought to block a European Union report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak, according to four sources and diplomatic correspondence reviewed by Reuters.
The report was eventually released, albeit just before the start of the weekend Europe time and with some criticism of the Chinese government rearranged or removed, a sign of the balancing act Brussels is trying to pull off as the coronavirus outbreak scrambles international relations.
The Chinese Mission to the EU was not immediately available for comment and China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to faxed questions about the exchange. An EU spokeswoman said ""we never comment on content or alleged content of internal diplomatic contacts and communication with our partners from another countries."" Another EU official Reuters said that the disinformation report had been published as usual and denied any of it had been watered down.
Four diplomatic sources told Reuters that the report had initially been slated for release on April 21 but was delayed after Chinese officials picked up on a Politico news report hat previewed its findings. 
A senior Chinese official contacted European officials in Beijing the same day to tell them that, ""if the report is as described and it is released today it will be very bad for cooperation,"" according to EU diplomatic correspondence reviewed by Reuters.
The correspondence quoted senior Chinese foreign ministry official Yang Xiaoguang as saying that publishing the report would make Beijing ""very angry"" and accused European officials of trying to please ""someone else"" - something the EU diplomats understood to be a reference to Washington.
The four sources said the report had been delayed as a result, and a comparison of the internal version of the report obtained by Reuters and the final version published late Friday showed several differences.
For example, on the first page of the internal report shared with EU governments on April 20, the EU's foreign policy arm said: ""China has continued to run a global disinformation campaign to deflect blame for the outbreak of the pandemic and improve its international image. Both overt and covert tactics have been observed.""
The public summary posted Friday to the bloc's disinformation portal, euvsdisinfo.eu http://www.euvsdisinfo.eu, attributed the disinformation to ""state-backed sources from various governments, including Russia and – to a lesser extent – China.""
The public summary did note ""significant evidence of covert Chinese operations on social media,"" but the reference was left to the final six paragraphs of the document.
Disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak is emerging as a flashpoint between the United States and China, and officials on both sides have traded allegations of hiding information about the pandemic.
The disputes have sometimes caught Europeans in the middle. With more than a billion euros a day in bilateral trade, the EU is China's top trading partner, while China is second only to the United States as a market for EU goods and services.

In a webcast Friday with the Friends of Europe think tank, China's ambassador to the EU Zhang Ming said, ""Disinformation is an enemy for all of us and it should be addressed by all of us.""

1242,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>","Exclusive: China sent team including medical experts to advise on North Korea’s Kim, sources say","BEIJING/SEOUL (Reuters) - China has dispatched a team to North Korea including medical experts to advise on North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, according to three people familiar with the situation.
The trip by the Chinese doctors and officials comes amid conflicting reports about the health of the North Korean leader. Reuters was unable to immediately determine what the trip by the Chinese team signaled in terms of Kim's health.
A delegation led by a senior member of the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department left Beijing for North Korea on Thursday, two of the people said. The department is the main Chinese body dealing with neighbouring North Korea.
The sources declined to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.
The Liaison Department could not be reached by Reuters for comment late on Friday. China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment late on Friday.
Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported earlier this week that Kim was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea.
South Korean government officials and a Chinese official with the Liaison Department challenged subsequent reports suggesting that Kim was in grave danger after surgery. South Korean officials said they had detected no signs of unusual activity in North Korea.
On Thursday, U.S. President Donald Trump also downplayed earlier reports that Kim was gravely ill. ""I think the report was incorrect,"" Trump told reporters, but he declined to say if he had been in touch with North Korean officials.
On Friday, a South Korean source told Reuters their intelligence was that Kim was alive and would likely make an appearance soon. The person said he did not have any comment on Kim's current condition or any Chinese involvement.
An official familiar with U.S. intelligence said that Kim was known to have health problems but they had no reason to conclude he was seriously ill or unable eventually to reappear in public.
A U.S. State department spokeswoman had no comment. U.S. Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, when asked about Kim's health on Fox News after Trump spoke said, ""I don’t have anything I can share with you tonight, but the American people should know we're watching the situation very keenly.""
North Korea is one of the world's most isolated and secretive countries, and the health of its leaders is treated as a matter of state security. Reuters has not been able to independently confirm any details on Kim's whereabouts or condition.
North Korea's state media last reported on Kim's whereabouts when he presided over a meeting on April 11. State media did not report that he was in attendance at an event to mark the birthday of his grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15, an important anniversary in North Korea.
Kim, believed to be 36, has disappeared from coverage in North Korean state media before. In 2014, he vanished for more than a month and North Korean state TV later showed him walking with a limp. Speculation about his health has been fanned by his heavy smoking, apparent weight gain since taking power and family history of cardiovascular problems.
When Kim Jong Un's father, Kim Jong Il, suffered a stroke in 2008, South Korean media reported at the time that Chinese doctors were involved in his treatment along with French physicians.
Last year, Chinese President Xi Jinping made the first state visit in 14 years by a Chinese leader to North Korea, an impoverished state that depends on Beijing for economic and diplomatic support.
China is North Korea's chief ally and the economic lifeline for a country hard-hit by U.N. sanctions, and has a keen interest in the stability of the country with which it shares a long, porous border.
Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who came to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. He has visited China four times since 2018.

Trump held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 as part of a bid to persuade him to give up North Korea’s nuclear arsenal.

""It was a significant assault, and this individual female did manage to escape, and that could very well have been the catalyst to start the chain of events,"" Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Superintendent Darren Campbell said in a news conference. 
""However, we're open to all possibilities and we're not excluding the possibility that there was any premeditated planning also involved,"" Campbell said in a news conference.
After the woman fled on Saturday night, she spent the night in hiding in the thick woods that surround the rural hamlet of Portapique, Nova Scotia, and only emerged on Sunday morning to call the 911 emergency number at about 6:30 a.m. 
By then the gunman, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, had killed 13 people in Portapique. Disguised in a police uniform and driving a fake police car, Wortman went on to kill nine more people on Sunday morning.
The Friday news conference provided the first detailed account of a shooting spree that lasted at least 13 hours. RCMP officers shot Wortman dead at a gas station about 90 km (60 miles) from Portapique, but not before Wortman wounded one RCMP officer and killed another.
On Sunday, he also randomly killed one woman who was out for a Sunday morning walk, and he used the fake police cruiser to pull over and shoot and kill at least one person. He also stopped at the home of a woman he knew, murdered her, and took her car.
""I've been a police officer for almost 30 years now and I can't imagine any more horrific a set of circumstances, when you're trying to search for someone that looks like you,"" Campbell said, referring to Wortman's impersonation of an RCMP officer.
Police faced criticism this week for using social media and not a provincial emergency alert system to notify the public that a gunman was at large, and for only sending out a tweet on Saturday night that warned of a ""firearms complaint"".
Some of the families of the victims said better communication might have saved the lives of their loved ones.
Police believed the suspect had been ""contained"" within police perimeters on Saturday night, Campbell said. But he said the families ""have every right to be angry. ... We are always looking to do better.""
On Friday evening after the earlier news conference, an alert was sent to all the cellphones in the province saying that police were responding to reports of shots fired in two different parts of a suburb of Halifax and advising people to stay inside their homes. It turned out to be a false alarm.
""All clear. ... No evidence of shots fired. Police continue to patrol the area,"" the RCMP tweeted.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking at a daily news conference, urged Canadians to join a virtual vigil at 6 p.m. ET (2200 GMT).

""Let's come together to support these communities that suffered immeasurable loss,"" Trudeau said.

HAVANA (Reuters) - About 300 U.S. citizens stranded in Cuba since Havana suspended regular air travel earlier this month due to the coronavirus pandemic were repatriated on two charter flights on Friday.
Among them were Cuban Americans who had feared a ban on Cuban citizens' leaving would stand in their way, but they received special dispensation from the Cuban immigration office.
""I thought I was going to have to stay here for a long time, for many months,"" said Rodolfo Díaz, 45, who went to live in the United States 15 years ago and was visiting family.
""I'm really relieved to be able to go,"" said Diaz, adding that he had been worried for his job as a systems operator in a nuclear plant in Georgia but his manager had been understanding of his predicament.
""I'm crazy excited about returning home,"" said Carlos Villar, 29, who moved to Florida 12 years ago, at Havana's international airport on Friday. ""I know there's a lot of risk there, but home is home."" 
A spokeswoman for Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), which operated the two charter flights, said there were 313 passengers in total but deferred to the State Department when asked if all were U.S. citizens.
The State Department not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The U.S. embassy in Havana, which arranged the flights, said it would continue to explore options for repatriation of U.S. citizens who wished to return home. But no more charter flights were scheduled.
Cuba suspended regular international air travel at the start of the month in a bid to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.

So far, the country of 11 million inhabitants has registered 1,285 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 49 deaths.

The arrest of Nsemi, whose Bundu dia Kongo (BDK) group dreams of restoring the Kongo kingdom that thrived for centuries before the colonial era around the mouth of the Congo River, took place after clashes with police on Wednesday in a neighboring province, in which 14 BDK members died.
A self-styled prophet and former member of Parliament, Nsemi has a strong following in western Congo and has been a thorn in the side of successive governments. He was arrested in March 2017 after leading deadly protests against former President Joseph Kabila, only to be broken out of prison by his supporters two months later.
Police announced his arrest on Twitter in an operation on Friday, saying: ""Mission accomplished, it's done.""
A Reuters witness said Nsemi's followers attempted to protect his house in the plush Ma Campagne neighborhood by throwing palm nuts at police, who fired their weapons as they moved in.
Nsemi is accused of rebellion, security offences and inciting ethnic hatred, Interior Minister Gilbert Kankonde said in a statement.
""This arrest came after the failure of several negotiations to persuade the person concerned to voluntarily surrender,"" Kankonde said.
Security forces detained more than 350 of his followers, 35 of whom were injured. Eight police officers were seriously wounded in the operation, he said.
Afterwards some police officers looted the property, Kinshasa police chief Sylvano Kasongo said in a statement.
""These unacceptable acts will be punished in accordance with the law,"" Kasongo said. ""The stolen objects will be returned.""
Congolese security forces killed more than 300 BDK members and bystanders in crackdowns on sometimes violent protests in 2007 and 2008, dumping their bodies in the Congo River or mass graves, rights groups say.
After escaping from prison in May 2017, Nsemi spent two years on the run before reappearing at a news conference in Kinshasa last year, pledging to contribute to the development of the country. 
He has remained in Kinshasa for the past year, sometimes lashing out at President Felix Tshisekedi and others with xenophobic slurs that accuse them of having ties to Congo's eastern neighbor Rwanda.
""He terrorized people here in the neighborhood. We are very happy with his arrest. He belongs in prison,"" a neighbor of Nsemi told Reuters.

The head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards said on Thursday Tehran would destroy U.S. warships if its security is threatened in the Gulf, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Tehran over ""harassment"" of U.S. vessels.
""We must carefully follow strategies ensuring the sustainable stability of the region while maintaining vigilance and authoritative presence in the area,"" state TV quoted Rouhani as telling Defence Minister Brigadier General Amir Hatami by telephone.
In a phone call to Revolutionary Guards commander Major General Hossein Salami, Rouhani ""referred to provocative actions by foreigners in the region and the need to maintain vigilance against these moves"", state television reported.
Trump said on Wednesday he had instructed the U.S. Navy to fire on any Iranian ships that harass it at sea, though said later he was not changing the military’s rules of engagement.
Earlier this month, the U.S. military said 11 Revolutionary Guards naval vessels came close to U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Gulf, calling the moves “dangerous and provocative”.
Tehran blamed its longtime adversary for the incident. On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Ministry summoned the Swiss ambassador in Tehran, who represents U.S. interests in the country, over the recent tensions between Tehran and Washington. 
Antagonism between Iran and the United States has sharpened since 2018, when Trump withdrew from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers and reimposed crippling sanctions.
Animosities spiked in early January when top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. Iran retaliated on Jan. 9 by firing missiles at bases in Iraq where U.S. troops were stationed. 
Iran's clerical rulers consider the U.S. military presence in the Middle East a threat to the Islamic Republic's security.
Stoking tensionover Tehran's nuclear and missile programmes, Iran's Guards said on Wednesday they had successfully launched the country's first military satellite into orbit. The announcement drew protests from Washington, London and Paris.

The main fire among several blazes was extinguished last week but advanced far into the 30 km exclusion zone around the plant, the site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986. Smaller fires are still burning in the exclusion zone, its administration said on Friday evening.
Footage from the site has shown plumes of smoke billowing from the charred landscape, and environmental activists have said the burning of contaminated trees and other vegetation could disperse radioactive particles, posing a health risk.
""The recent fires in the Exclusion Zone near the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine have not led to any hazardous increase of radioactive particles in the air,"" the Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said in a statement.
The Vienna-based IAEA, which acts as the U.N. nuclear watchdog but also aims to encourage the peaceful use of nuclear energy, said it was basing its assessment on data provided by Ukraine.
The IAEA said it found ""the increase in levels of radiation measured in the country was very small and posed no risk to human health"". 

There had been ""some minor increases in radiation"", the IAEA said, adding the State Nuclear Regulatory Inspectorate of Ukraine had found ""the concentration of radioactive materials in the air remained below Ukraine's radiation safety norms"".

Britain is enduring its fifth week of a national lockdown, with businesses shuttered and citizens ordered to stay at home as the government tries to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and stop health services becoming overwhelmed.
However, London's Metropolitan Police service said that while the lockdown was vital to the national effort it has also left ""current and potential victims of domestic abuse even more vulnerable and isolated.""
The force said calls about domestic abuse had gone up by around a third in the last six weeks and that its officers were making around 100 arrests a day for such offences. There was a 9% rise in recorded incidents compared to a year ago.

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 24, 2020 01:32PM ET</span>",Banned Vienna protest against lockdown draws 200,"VIENNA (Reuters) - A crowd of around 200 defied a police ban to gather in central Vienna on Friday for a protest against Austria's coronavirus lockdown. 
The restrictions have been in place for more than a month and helped flatten the curve of infections. The government shut bars, restaurants, schools and non-essential shops, allowing some shops to reopen last week in a first easing of the curbs.
The protest's organisers, the Initiative for Evidence-Based Corona Information (ICI), want the lockdown ended.
They argue, among other things, that wearing face masks and fabric equivalents that are compulsory in shops and on public transport is counter-productive.
Public gatherings of more than five people remain banned, and a demonstration of five people was registered in the city for Friday afternoon. However, police then banned it, saying more would come and organisers could not guarantee to respect social distancing rules.
While anti-lockdown demonstrations have not become a feature of the outbreak in Europe, in the United States protesters have taken to the streets in several states. Public health officials there have warned against a premature easing of social distancing orders.
In Vienna on Friday a crowd that a Reuters photographer estimated at around 200 assembled on a square behind the Vienna State Opera, chanting slogans including ""We are the people"" and ""Kurz must go"", referring to conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.
After looking on for an hour, police dispersed the crowd, checking the identities of those who stayed. There was one arrest, a spokesman said.
ICI urged people to respect the ban on Friday's event but said it would register ""a new, bigger demo"" for a week's time.
While there has been some criticism of some aspects of Austria's lockdown, the opposition and public have been largely supportive, though the far-right Freedom Party now says the measures are too intrusive. 
Polls suggest that during the pandemic there has been an increase in support for Kurz and his party, which is in coalition with the left-wing Greens.
The lockdown has also help cut the daily increase in infections to less than 2%, which the government says justifies the planned step-by-step reopening of shops, restaurants, bars, schools, museums and churches. 

Austria has reported 530 coronavirus-related deaths so far, fewer than some larger countries have reported daily.

The World War Two veteran took the record for the most money raised by an individual through a charity walk - as of Friday afternoon he had collected more than £28.6 million for the National Health Service (NHS) by completing laps of his garden.
Moore, who has used a walking frame with wheels since breaking his hip, had originally hoped to raise just £1,000. But he shot past that as media attention from around the globe zoomed in on his home in Bedfordshire, central England.
He was also recognised as the oldest person to reach number one in Britain's main music charts through his appearance with singer Michael Ball on a cover of ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" - another fundraiser for the health service. 
Guinness World Records said that title had been held by Welsh star Tom Jones, who was 68 when he sang on the charity single ""Barry Islands in the Stream"" in 2009. 
Moore, who turns 100 on April 30, said he felt honoured to receive the awards. 
""My charity walk has raised more money than I could have possibly imagined and I am so thankful to those who have donated money and bought the single so we could achieve these records together and raise money for our incredible NHS during these difficult times."" 
""These really are Guinness World Records titles for all of us,"" he added.
Moore's fundraising walk broke a 40-year-old record. Guinness World Records said the previous title for the most money raised through a charity walk was held by Canadian athlete Terry Fox.
Fox, who lost a leg to cancer when he was a teenager, set off on a cross-Canada run in 1980 by dipping his prosthetic limb into the Atlantic Ocean with the aim of getting all the way to the Pacific.
After 5,376km (3,341 miles) the cancer had spread to his lungs and forced him to stop near Thunder Bay, Ontario, on Sept. 1, 1980. He died less than a year later aged 22. 

Guinness World Records said Fox collected C$14.7 million - worth £5.4 million at the time and £27,201,900 today, adjusted for inflation. A subsequent telethon raised a further C$10 million in his honour, the organisation added.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban have rejected an Afghan government call for a ceasefire for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and to let authorities focus on tackling the coronavirus, raising new concern about prospects for a fragile peace process.
Hopes for an end to Afghanistan's decades of war were raised in late February when the Taliban and the United States struck a deal on the withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces in exchange for Taliban security guarantees.
But the deal did not include a ceasefire, which has been left to the U.S.-backed government to negotiate with the insurgents.
A Taliban spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, said in a post on Twitter that a ceasefire would be possible if the peace process was being implemented ""fully"" but ""hurdles"" meant the Taliban would not yet lay down their arms.
""Asking for ceasefire is not rational and convincing,"" Shaheen said in his post late on Thursday.
President Ashraf Ghani called on Thursday for the ceasefire for Ramadan, which began in Afghanistan on Friday, and to allow the country to focus on what he said was a critical novel coronavirus outbreak spreading all over the country. 
Afghanistan has detected more than 1,300 cases of the virus but health experts say the number could be higher as testing is limited and Afghanistan's weak health system would struggle with a widespread outbreak.
The Taliban, fighting for years to expel foreign forces, agreed in February to a week-long ""reduction in violence"" to secure the agreement with the United States, which was signed on Feb. 29. But they resumed attacking government forces soon after.
The U.S.-led NATO alliance called on Friday for the Taliban to cut violence levels and join peace talks.
""The current level of violence caused by the Taliban is not acceptable,"" alliance ambassadors in NATO's North Atlantic Council said in a statement on the peace efforts. 
This week alone, dozens of members of the Afghan security forces, civilians and Taliban fighters have been killed in clashes.
In one of the latest incidents, Taliban forces attacked security checkpoints manned by members of a pro-government militia in the northwestern province of Badghis late on Thursday.

Thirteen members of the militia were killed and seven captured, said Najmuddin Burhani, spokesman for the provincial governor.

Around 60 fighters from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) ambushed a convoy of civilians that was being protected by 15 rangers, said Cosma Wilungula, director of the Congo Institute for Nature Conservation (ICCN). Many others were seriously injured, he said. 
Virunga sits on the forest-covered volcanoes of central Africa and is home to over half the global population of mountain gorillas. It is Africa's oldest national park and largest tropical rainforest reserve, covering 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles).
""The guards were not the target and died while assisting the civilian vehicle that had been caught under fire from the attackers,"" the Virunga National Park said in a statement.
The FDLR has waged a periodic war with the Congolese government and rival militias since it was founded in 2000 by Hutu officials who fled Rwanda at the end of the genocide.
The group has been engaged in intense fighting with the army near the site of the ambush in Rumangabo since mid April and often retaliates by attacking civilians, said Kivu Security Tracker (KST), a research initiative that maps unrest in the region.
Almost 200 Virunga rangers have died in past militia attacks. Two years ago, five of them were killed by Mai Mai militiamen, in the deadliest attack at the time.
In May 2018, the park was closed after foreign tourists were kidnapped and their guide killed by gunmen. It reopened in February 2019.

A two-week ceasefire announced by the coalition that is battling the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen expired on Thursday without leading to a permanent truce.
The Houthi group did not accept the coalition's previous ceasefire announcement and violence has continued in several provinces, raising fears that the war will grind on and shatter Yemen's already weakened ability to combat the coronavirus.
The Houthis ousted the internationally recognized Saudi-backed government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. They want a lifting of air and sea blockades imposed by the coalition to the regions they control before agreeing to a ceasefire, sources have told Reuters.
""The coalition's command reaffirms that there is still an opportunity to focus all efforts in order to achieve a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire,"" coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Maliki was quoted as saying by the SPA.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last month called for ceasefires in conflicts across the world to allow countries to focus on the COVID-19 pandemic. 
While Yemen has reported only one confirmed case of the novel coronavirus, aid groups fear a catastrophic outbreak should the virus spread among an acutely malnourished population in a country without adequate testing capabilities.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Californians locked down for weeks during the coronavirus pandemic have trickled back to local beaches as the weather warms, prompting Governor Gavin Newsom on Thursday to plead for social distancing during a heat wave expected this weekend.
Newsom, in his daily remarks on the response to the outbreak, appeared to concede that the state's beaches would be an irresistible lure to residents, who have been largely confined to their homes since mid-March.
""We're walking into a very warm weekend. People are prone to want to go to the beaches, parks, playgrounds and go on a hike, and I anticipate there will be significant increase in volume,"" the governor said. 
""But I also think if there is and people aren't practicing physical distancing, I'll be announcing again these numbers going back up,"" Newsom said, referring to a slight downward tick in new hospitalizations and admissions to intensive-care units.
California, the nation's most populous state, recorded its deadliest day yet in the pandemic, with 115 fatalities in the 24 hours from Wednesday to Thursday.
Newsom has been credited with taking early action to lock down the state as cases of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, spread in early March, and California has seen fewer cases than New York and other East Coast states.
California's beaches are under a patchwork of state and local jurisdictions, which means some have remained open while others were shut. 
Los Angeles County closed all its beaches - including parking lots, bike paths, showers and restrooms - during the coronavirus outbreak, but leaders in neighboring Orange County voted to keep some open.
Amid a debate over whether residents are safer in open spaces such as the beach, officials in San Clemente in southern Orange County voted this week to reopen city beaches that they closed two weeks ago, the Orange County Register reported.
This week in Huntington Beach, an Orange County city that has both state and local beaches as well as the Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve, surfers could be seen in the water on either side of a closed pier as sunbathers watched from the sand and joggers used pedestrian paths. 
Lifeguards at Huntington Beach's main stretch of shoreline counted about 9,000 people on the sand and in the water on Thursday, according to local CBS television affiliate KCBS.
Los Angeles Police Department Chief Michel Moore urged residents to avoid flocking to beaches and trailheads as summery weather returns, the Los Angeles City News Service (CNS) reported.

""Save police the awkwardness of us having to admonish you and advise and direct you for something that you already know,"" CNS quoted Moore as saying. ""With that, our men and women can stay focused on public safety.

""It's great. It's brilliant. It's necessary,"" said Oury, who came with her sister Anne to their mother's nursing home after the French government earlier this week relaxed restrictions on visits it had imposed at the start of the outbreak.
Family visits to retirement homes were halted because of the risk they could contaminate residents. Elderly people are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, and the toll in nursing homes has been heavy.
Figures released on Thursday showed that 8,309 people died from coronavirus-related illnesses in French nursing homes, or 60% of France's total death toll.
But healthcare professionals have said that isolating vulnerable elderly people from their families is also a risk to their health, triggering depression and anxiety in some residents.
At Les Figuiers, the retirement home in the south of France where Cecile Oury's mother, Marie-Louise Oury, is a resident, family visits are strictly controlled to prevent the virus spreading.
Family members cannot enter the facility. They instead sit on plastic chairs in an entranceway into the building. The doors are open, but a plexiglass screen has been erected to prevent physical contact. The resident sits on the other side of the screen. 
Relatives must make an appointment, they cannot stay for more than 30 minutes, and they have to use disinfecting hand gel.

""It's been more than a month that these people are deprived of their loves ones,"" said Paul Bensadoun, head of the firm that owns Les Figuiers and other nursing homes. ""It was clear we had to take this step.""

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese lesbian couple's landmark court battle over the custody of their two children has stirred debate over LGBT rights and put a spotlight on a legal vacuum created by the absence of a same-sex marriage law.
Shanghai resident Zhang Peiyi split up with her partner last year. The partner has since broken off communication and taken their two toddlers away to an unknown location.
So Zhang has turned to the courts, filing a case in the eastern province of Zhejiang this month, to fight for custody of one of the children, the one she gave birth to, and visitation rights to the other. 
A court has accepted the case but hearings have yet to begin.
""Even if I can find them, I won't be able to see them,"" Zhang told Reuters. ""I thought who else can help me? I could only find a lawyer.""
The case is the first of its kind in China and has attracted media attention. It is likely to be complicated by the fact that Zhang and her partner are women and not legally married, at least not in China, where marriage is defined as a union between a man and a woman.
More LGBT couples are choosing to have families but many find themselves pushing up against the limits of the law if the relationship ends, said Yang Yi, a programme officer at LGBT Rights Advocacy China.
""There are more than 100 assistive reproductive companies that target gay couples,"" said Yang.
Yang said there have been custody battles between same-sex couples before but they were settled out of court.
'RIGHTS AND INTERESTS'
Zhang and her former partner had their children with the help of reproductive technology in the United States. Zhang's partner provided the eggs for the embryos and then each of them carried a separate embryo to full term.
While they were there, they also got married. However, that is not recognised in China, nor is there an existing law for Zhang's claim over the children.
Traditionally in custody disputes, the law recognises the birth parent. While Zhang can claim that she gave birth to one child, her partner can claim that she is the parent by blood.
The court will have to decide whether Zhang can claim custodial rights or is it only her partner who provided the egg and therefore has the genetic connection.
Another question is whether an LGBT parent can claim custodial rights over a child who they raised but may not have any biological relationship to, as is the case with Zhang's other child, whom her partner carried to term.
The case has stirred public interest with social media posts attracting more than 380 million views this week.
""I can't say whether I support gay people ... but I support this opportunity to give them their legitimate rights and interests,"" said one social media user.
For Zhang, the key is the legalisation of same-sex marriage.
""The focal point is how can you determine who is a child's mother. But if you consider that there are two mothers, then it will return to the issue of same-sex marriage,"" she said.
Zhang supports a campaign for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Though the prospect of the legislation looks slim, she said she won't give up.
""You may feel like it wouldn't happen very quickly, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't do anything,"" Zhang said. 
""So you need to, bit by bit, make it happen.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will make it illegal for non-health officials to access data collected on smartphone software to trace the spread of the coronavirus, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Friday, amid privacy concerns raised by the measure.
Australia has so far avoided the high death toll of other countries, with only 78 deaths, largely as a result of tough restrictions on movement that have brought public life to a standstill.
The federal government has said existing ""social distancing"" measures will remain until at least mid-May, and that its willingness to relax them will depend on whether people download the smartphone ""app"" to identify who a person with the illness has had contact with.
The tracing app, which is yet to be released, has raised concerns from legal and privacy advocates who have said the location data it collects may be used by unrelated bodies like law enforcement agencies.
Morrison said the government would make any use by non-health officials illegal.
""It will be illegal for information to go out of that data store to any other person other than that for whom the whole thing is designed, and that is to support the health worker in the state to be able to undertake the contact tracing,"" he told reporters in Canberra.
Morrison also confirmed a local media report which said the data would be stored on servers managed by AWS, a unit of U.S. internet giant Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), but added that ""it's a nationally encrypted data store"".
The promise of laws to limit use of the app came as the Australian authorities reported another day of low single-digit percentage increases of the illness, which has infected about 6,700 people and resulted in 78 deaths in the country.
With the country's borders closed for weeks, Morrison said the illness was now in its ""community phase"", which meant the health authorities hoped to slow the spread by widespread testing - even of people without symptoms - and contact tracing.
The country's state governments began urging people to come forward for testing, saying they no longer needed to meet previous criteria of having been in contact with an infected person, having been abroad, or experiencing flu-like symptoms.
A cruise ship linked to a third of the country's coronavirus deaths left the country on Thursday after a month docked in local waters.
The Ruby Princess, owned by Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp, has become a flashpoint of public anger after being allowed to unload thousands of passengers in Sydney without health checks on March 19. Hundreds of its passengers later tested positive to COVID-19, about 10% of the country's overall cases.

Separate criminal, coronial and government investigations have been launched to find out how the ship's operators were allowed to let coronavirus patients disembark.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The mayor of the western Japanese city Osaka came under fire on social media on Friday after saying women take longer than men shopping for groceries as he tried to promote social distancing to curb the spread of the coronavirus in the city.
By Friday morning there were nearly 1,500 coronavirus cases in Osaka and the prefecture that surrounds it, making it the second hardest-hit after Tokyo, national broadcaster NHK said.
Mayor Ichiro Matsui has been appealing to people to take steps to reduce the risk of virus infections, but his remarks over gender shopping behaviour stirred controversy.
""When a woman goes... it will take time,"" Matsui said when asked by a male reporter about possibly reducing shoppers' entry to supermarkets to lower the risk of coronavirus infections.
""If it was you, if you were told to get this or that, then you would go directly... and go home,"" he said. ""It's also fine for men to go shopping while avoiding contact.""
Matsui, who also said married couples should avoid going shopping together, drew criticism on Japanese Twitter over his remarks, with users saying they were sexist.
""Japan is a country where these words come calmly out of a mayor's mouth. Deplorable,"" said one user on Friday.
Another user said the remark showed politicians don't think enough about what parenting, household work and nursing involve.
""When I hear remarks like this... I feel the need for people with diverse backgrounds to participate in politics,"" the user said.
Matsui actually got things the wrong way around, another user said, saying women needed less time than men when going out shopping.
""Women are deciding more quickly when shopping,"" the user said, adding he took longer to find the right aisles for items he needed.
Matsui on Thursday also said people should limit how often the go to the supermarket to shop, suggesting people born in months with an even number should only go on even dates, and those with uneven numbered months should go on uneven dates.

The Guangzhou Daily, official party newspaper of the southern Chinese city, said security authorities concluded their investigation against Lee Henley Hu Xiang to the Guangzhou prosecutorate. Lee will be prosecuted, the report said. 
""Investigations by the national security agency confirmed that the suspect provided a large amount of funds to hostile elements in the United States, colluded with foreign anti-China forces to intervene in Hong Kong affairs, and funded the implementation of criminal activities that endangered our national security,"" the paper said.
Lee, a Belizean citizen, was arrested in November in Guangzhou. His whereabouts are unknown and is uncontactable. He has made no public comments on the charges.
Hong Kong has been the site of massive pro-democracy protests since last year, with millions taking to the streets to demonstrate against what local residents have seen as increasing interference from mainland China, overpowering the local government.
The city is ruled under the ""One Country, Two Systems"" principle which is supposed to provide for a level of independence for Hong Kong that other cities in China do not have. 
Beijing has on multiple occasions accused western countries, particularly the United States and the United Kingdom, of inciting violence and discord in the city since the protests broke out. 
There have been no mass protests in Hong Kong since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic. City authorities, however, led a surprise crackdown on Sunday where they arrested 15 prominent pro-democracy figures in the city.

China, which considers Taiwan its own, has been angered by the Trump administration's stepped-up support for the island, such as more arms sales, U.S. patrols near it and a visit to Washington by Vice President-elect William Lai in February.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the U.S. warship had transited the narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the island from its giant neighbour China in a southerly direction and was continuing to sail south.
Taiwan's armed forces monitored the ship which it described as being on an ""ordinary mission"", the ministry added, without providing further details.
Lt. Anthony Junco, a U.S. Seventh Fleet spokesman, named the ship involved as the guided-missile destroyer USS Barry, and said it had conducted a ""routine Taiwan Strait transit"" in accordance with international law. 
""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The U.S. Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows,"" he said.
Two weeks ago the USS Barry also sailed through the strait, on the same day that Chinese fighter jets drilled in waters close to the democratically-ruled island.
Taiwan said on Thursday that a Chinese aircraft carrier group had sailed to its south through the Bashi Channel that sits between Taiwan and the Philippines and was heading east.
The carrier group earlier this month sailed down Taiwan's east coast. China said at the time it was on its way to routine exercises in the disputed South China Sea.
China has carried out frequent drills near Taiwan in recent months, including flying fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers close to the island, in moves denounced by Taipei's government as attempts at intimidation.

The Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict said on Twitter that the 29-year-old was shot twice in the head in the town of Upata, though it did not identify who killed him. Photographs posted on social media showed a man in shorts and a striped T-shirt lying in a street by a puddle of blood. 
The military head of surrounding Bolivar state, General Adolfo Rodriguez, said authorities arrested 10 people during the riots, but did not mention the death. Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request to comment.
Opposition lawmakers and rights groups said there were similar protests elsewhere in Venezuela on Thursday, from the town of Punta de Mata in the east, to Pueblo Llano, in the Andean state of Merida.
Venezuela, an OPEC member, is suffering from an acute shortage of motor fuel due to the near total collapse of its refining network after years of under-investment and lack of maintenance, as well as the U.S. sanctions that have complicated crude-for-gasoline swaps.
Halted transport networks have further restricted the supply of food to places such as Upata. The quarantine has also made it harder for poor families to get out and find basic goods.
Venezuela has confirmed 311 cases of coronavirus, and 10 deaths.

1270,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 08:20PM ET</span>",Trump thinks report was incorrect on illness of North Korea's Kim Jong Un,"By Steve Holland, Mark Hosenball and Alexandra Alper
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threw more cold water on reports that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was gravely ill, but declined to say if he had been in touch with officials there. 
""I think the report was incorrect,"" Trump said at a daily White House briefing, adding that he had heard it was based on ""old documents.""
Trump had said on Tuesday that he might contact North Korean officials to inquire about Kim but gave no indication on Thursday he had done so. The two leaders have had regular communications over the past couple of years.
""We have a good relationship with North Korea, I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un and I hope he's okay,"" Trump said.
Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported on Monday that Kim, who is believed to be about 36, was recovering after undergoing a cardiovascular procedure on April 12. It cited one unnamed source in North Korea. The state-controlled media in North Korea has been silent on Kim's whereabouts.
Two South Korean government officials rejected a subsequent CNN report citing an unnamed U.S. official saying that the United States was ""monitoring intelligence"" that Kim was in grave danger after surgery.
On Tuesday, Trump, who held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons, said the reports had not been confirmed and he did not put much credence in them.
Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who rules North Korea with an iron fist, coming to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack.
The U.S. government’s latest information on the North Korean leadership is that Kim still remains out of sight and there is a dearth of reliable information about the reasons for his absence, according to a source familiar with current intelligence reporting and analysis.
U.S. officials acknowledge Kim does have a history of health problems and is overweight, and say that this does at least raise a credible possibility he has suffered some kind of health crisis, the source said.
But they do not regard theories that Kim has had a heart attack or some other serious health setback as confirmed, and said he has disappeared from public view for extended periods in the past.

U.S. government experts do not believe Kim's influential sister, Kim Yo Jong, is a shoo-in to succeed him were he to die. They believe there is “no clear” designated successor in the event that Kim dies, the source said.

1271,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","WTO report says 80 countries limiting exports of face masks, other goods","By Andrea Shalal
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Eighty countries and customs territories have banned or limited the export of face masks, protective gear, gloves and other goods to mitigate shortages since the coronavirus outbreak began, the World Trade Organization reported on Thursday.
It said the bans were imposed by 72 WTO members and eight non-WTO member countries, but only 13 WTO members had notified the global trade body as required by its regulations.
Lack of transparency about restrictions and failure to cooperate internationally could undermine efforts to slow the spread of the COVID-19 disease, which has infected 2.64 million people around the world and killed 184,910, the WTO said.
""While the introduction of export-restrictive measures is understandable, the lack of international cooperation in these areas risks cutting off import-reliant countries from desperately needed medical products and triggering a supply shock,"" the WTO report said. ""And by interfering with established medical supply chains, such measures also risk hampering the urgently required supply response.""
Export bans and restrictions are generally prohibited in the WTO, although there are exceptions which allow temporary measures to ""prevent or relieve critical shortages of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting contracting party.""
Travel restrictions had already slowed the flow of goods needed to fight the pandemic, but export restrictions made it difficult for governments and businesses to adjust purchasing decisions and find new suppliers, the report said. 
Leaders of the Group of 20 major economies last month said any emergency measures taken in response to the pandemic should be ""targeted, proportionate, transparent and temporary,"" but new export restrictions have emerged even since then.
Last week, the United States asked China to revise new export quality control rules for protective equipment after complaints that the rules were holding up supplies.
Reuters reported on Thursday that France had expanded its list of drugs that face export restrictions despite repeated calls from the European Union to lift curbs that could cause shortages in other countries.
The WTO said restrictions could prompt others to follow suit and further reduce available supplies.
""The long-term effects could be significant,"" the report said, warning that too-broad measures that stayed in place could irreparably alter supply chains and additional tariff and non-tariff barriers could spring up as a reaction.

Political fallout from the restrictions could weaken the global response to the pandemic, raising the possibility of recurring outbreaks that could affect everyone and leading to delays in getting goods to where they were needed.

1272,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>",UK royal Meghan's privacy action against tabloid goes to London High Court,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - The first court hearing in a privacy case brought by Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, against a tabloid newspaper for printing part of one of her letters takes place at London's High Court on Friday.
Meghan, wife of Queen Elizabeth's grandson Prince Harry, is suing publisher Associated Newspapers over articles its Mail on Sunday newspaper printed in February last year which were based on a letter she had sent to her father, Thomas Markle.
Lawyers for the duchess say its publication was a misuse of private information and breached her copyright. They are seeking aggravated damages from the paper.
Meghan and her father fell out on the eve of her glitzy, pomp-laden wedding to Harry in May 2018. 
Markle pulled out days beforehand after undergoing heart surgery and following news he had staged photos with a paparazzi photographer, and speculation about his attendance dominated the build-up to the ceremony.
Documents from her lawyers this week accused the Mail and other tabloids of harassing, humiliating and manipulating Markle, and contributing towards the fallout between father and daughter.
They argue the Mail had also misquoted from the letter, which was never intended to be made public, to paint the royals in a poor light.
The Mail says unnamed friends of Meghan had put her version of events in interviews with the U.S. magazine People and that Markle had the right to put his side.
The paper's lawyers also argue that given Meghan's royal status, there was legitimate public interest in her personal and family relationships.
Friday's hearing, which will be held remotely because of Britain's coronavirus lockdown, is the start of the court action and no witnesses will take part. No date has been set yet for the full trial.
In the papers submitted by Meghan's lawyers this week were details of text messages sent by Harry to his future father-in-law, pleading with him not to talk to the press and to call him and his daughter.
The duchess missed a call from Markle at 4.57 a.m. on the morning of the wedding and she has not received any calls or messages from him since then, the court papers added.
The legal action is the latest step in growing hostility between the media and the couple, who are now living in the Los Angeles area having stepped down from their royal roles at the end of last month.
This week the royals announced they would have ""zero engagement"" with four of Britain's top tabloids, accusing them of false and invasive coverage.

That statement brought anger and derision from many newspapers which accused them of egotism and questionable timing by making the announcement during the COVID-19 crisis.

PORTAPIQUE, Nova Scotia (Reuters) - Canadian police on Thursday worked to piece together the timeline of a shooting spree that started in a rural hamlet in the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia and ended 13 hours later when the gunman, who killed 22 people, was shot dead.
Police set up a tip line and on Thursday encouraged people who had information to call.
""Anything you know – no matter how small or insignificant it might seem – could help us piece the puzzle together,"" Darren Campbell of the Nova Scotia Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), said in a statement.
On Saturday night, police could not track down the gunman, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, and only picked up his trail the next day after he had gone on to kill more people, including a veteran Mountie, in the worst mass shooting in the country's history.
Investigators are now analyzing 16 crime scenes and trying to plot Wortman's movements overnight and during his flight the following morning.
One of the reasons Wortman may have slipped away is that he was driving a vehicle that looked identical to a RCMP cruiser and he was dressed in an RCMP uniform.
Police have yet to determine the gunman's motive. On Wednesday, the RCMP faced criticism for poor communication with the public to alert them that an active gunman was on the loose.
A recording between a first responder and dispatcher showed confusion on Saturday night as to whether a suspect had been caught, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported on Thursday.
And during the pursuit on Sunday morning, police officers shot at a firehouse where people who left their homes due to the gunman's rampage had taken refuge. It is not clear why the shots were fired, according to a provincial civilian police watchdog, because the suspect was not in the area.
No one was injured in the police shooting and the incident is under investigation. 
After three Mounties were killed and two were severely wounded by a gunman in Moncton, New Brunswick, in 2014, the RCMP commissioned an independent review to determine how the situation could have been better managed.
The review recommended the RCMP examine how supervisors are trained to command in critical situations and to enhance training. In 2017, the RCMP said the recommendations had been implemented.
Brian Sauve, president of the National Police Federation, said there still is not enough training.

""One of the challenges in our organization has always been finding the time to do that training, because we're so short staffed we can't even afford to have people go on training,"" Sauve said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian Justice Minister Sergio Moro has threatened to resign if President Jair Bolsonaro goes ahead with plans to change the head of the federal police, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Thursday.
Moro is one of the most popular ministers in the government due to his record fighting corruption as a federal judge and Bolsonaro originally touted him as a ""super minister"" in charge of implementing a law-and-order agenda.
Financial markets retreated on the news of instability in the presidential cabinet, with Brazil's currency weakening to a record low of 5.50 against the dollar and the benchmark Bovespa stock index slipping as much as 2.6%.
Moro's departure along with the head of Brazil's federal police would be a serious blow to Bolsonaro's argument that he is bolstering the fight against graft with investigations free of political interference.
Moro's spokeswoman said the minister would not confirm he had said he would resign. The presidential press office did not respond to a request for comment.
Newspaper Folha de S.Paulo first reported Moro's possible departure in an article published to its website, saying he had asked to quit and Bolsonaro was working to change his mind.
Moro's role in the government has served as a symbol of the fight against corruption, which was central to Bolsonaro's 2018 campaign. The justice minister's performance was rated ""good"" or ""great"" by 53% of Brazilians surveyed in December by pollster Datafolha, compared to just 30% for Bolsonaro's performance.
Yet the relationship between the two has grown tense, especially as Bolsonaro showed interest in changing the leadership of the federal police force in Rio de Janeiro, where he built his political base in three decades as a lawmaker.

Moro and Federal Police Chief Mauricio Valeixo, who was tapped for his role by the minister, resisted suggestions for the Rio job publicly floated by Bolsonaro, leading the president to propose in August that Valeixo himself could be replaced.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - Stuck at home due to the coronavirus lockdown, inhabitants of Spain's Catalonia region kept up St. George's Day traditions on Thursday with roses on balconies and book-sharing online.
The legendary dragon-slayer is the proud northeastern region's patron saint - known as ""Sant Jordi"" in the local language - as well as England's. 
Catalans generally crowd the streets with loved ones, exchanging books and roses in representation of the flower that came from the dragon's spilt blood.
But due to the COVID-19 disease, streets including Barcelona's famous La Rambla boulevard were virtually deserted. 
""It looks like there had been an atomic explosion,"" Rafel Dalmau told Catalan public channel TV3 from La Rambla, where flower shops were closed and very few people were out. 
""It's so strange"". 
Not to be deterred, however, some Catalans had flowers delivered via online purchases and placed them on their balconies, together with drawings of roses and other aspects of the legend. Regional flags abounded too. 
Giant paper mache roses hung alongside sheets displaying stories and anecdotes in Barcelona's Gracia neighbourhood, while children waved down at the occasional passers by. 
Some writers, who usually sign their works in the streets, held virtual chats while book shops took orders online. 
Activity, though, was nothing compared to a normal Sant Jordi day.
""When I think of Sant Jordi, I think about the emotion and joy it has given me and that is why it hurts me so much to be in my house,"" instead of signing books on the streets, writer Almudena Grandes told TV3.
The region's flower vendors, who ususally sell around 2 million roses during the day, saw demand fall to just 10% of that, said Joan Guillen, head of the Catalan florists guild. 
Still, he said an initiative that saw more than 200 florists deliver roses to homes was a success given the circumstances. 
Catalans will have a second chance to enjoy St. George's Day, probably with less restrictions, as book and flower businesses plan to hold a postponed celebration on July 23.
On Wednesday evening, white roses were handed to health staff at Barcelona Hospital Clinic, one of the city's largest hospitals dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed over 22,000 people in Spain. 

That is the third worst death toll in the world, and Spain has imposed one of the toughest shutdowns.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Expanding surveillance measures to police Russia's coronavirus lockdown, including the use of facial recognition technology and collection of personal data, need regulating to ensure they are temporary and proportionate, two rights groups said on Thursday.
Moscow, the epicenter of Russia's outbreak, is in partial lockdown along with many of the country's regions and the authorities are using and developing a range of technologies to monitor and regulate residents' movements.
Police say Moscow's 178,000 facial recognition cameras had caught 200 people breaking coronavirus lockdown restrictions by mid-March. The cameras are capable of tracking individuals using just their silhouette and of detecting groups standing too close to each other, according to the firm which supplied them.
The Russian capital has also introduced digital passes which are mandatory for anyone wanting to use public or private transport, a system that authorities say 21 of Russia's more than 80 regions will soon copy in some form.
Agora, a Moscow-based human rights group, and Roskomsvoboda, a digital rights campaign group, said the unprecedented nature of the pandemic meant some curbing of citizens' rights and freedoms was justified. 
But in a joint appeal to regional governors they said the expanding surveillance measures had to be regulated to ensure they were legal, proportionate and temporary in nature.
""The authorities ... are actively developing technologies to collect personal data including photographs, videos, geolocations, home addresses, car number plates and medical diagnoses,"" said Pavel Chikov, a lawyer who heads Agora.
""There's not a single federal law regulating the use of facial recognition technology or of digital passes to get around. And there's no guarantee enshrined in any regional legal act that ... information about Russians' private lives will be deleted once the quarantine is lifted.""
The authorities say Russia, like other countries, is confronted with unprecedented and rapidly changing circumstances and that their priority is to do everything they can to try to halt the virus, which has already infected over 60,000 Russians.
Moscow's Department of Information Technology (DIT) did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on data collection. The city police force said it could not comment.

1278,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 03:50PM ET</span>",Jailed Saudi princess pleads for release as Ramadan arrives,"By Raya Jalabi
LONDON (Reuters) - A prominent Saudi princess has appealed to the kingdom's king and crown prince to release her from prison as the holy month of Ramadan began, according to a letter published on her official website and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account.
Princess Basmah Bint Saud bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, 56, a businesswoman, writer and rights activist, went missing in March 2019. Only recently did she publicly communicate that she has been held at al-Ha'ir prison in the capital Riyadh for over a year and is sick.
The youngest child of the late King Saud, Princess Basmah has been particularly critical of the kingdom's treatment of women.
A close relative, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue, confirmed the letter's authenticity.
The relative told Reuters that the princess had been due to travel abroad for medical treatment around the time of her arrest in late February, 2019, and was informed after her detention that she was accused of trying to forge a passport.
The charges were dropped, but she remains imprisoned along with a daughter who was with her at the time, the relative said.
The princess has had limited, though regular contact with relatives through visits and phone calls over the past year. Her family has not heard from her since she made her public appeal.
Reuters has not been able to verify independently the circumstances of her disappearance and detention.
The Saudi government media office did not respond to a written request for comment on the details of her case.
There has been no public comment by Saudi officials on the letter published on Wednesday or an earlier plea posted on her social media accounts last week.
""This week, Muslims around the globe begin our Holy month of Ramadan ... (I) will be spending it at al-Ha'ir prison unless my uncle, Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, and my cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, decide to release me,"" the letter said.
""My health is continuously deteriorating, which may lead to my death, it's VERY critical and they know it.""
HEALTH PROBLEMS
The princess has a series of health problems, including heart trouble, osteoporosis and severe gastrointestinal issues, according to health records from 2016 and 2018 reviewed by Reuters and people close to the family.
She has not been receiving adequate medical care for several months, the relative said.
Reuters could not establish whether her arrest was linked to past detentions of Saudi royals and prominent citizens that sources have tied to Prince Mohammed's consolidation of power or crackdown on dissent, including women's rights activists.
In a petition submitted to the United Nations, dated March 5 and seen by Reuters, the princess' family suggested the reason for her detention may be her role ""as an outspoken critic of abuses in our country of birth, but likewise for ... enquiring about the frozen fortune left (by) her father"".
""She was deemed as supportive of former crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef Al Saud,"" the document said, referring to the royal whom Prince Mohammed replaced as crown prince in a palace coup in 2017.
The relative and a U.S. lawyer for the princess said that before her detention, Princess Basmah had chartered a plane to take her to Switzerland via Turkey for medical treatment.
""In hindsight this (Turkey) cast the travel plan in a bad light, it could have suggested she was fleeing,"" said the princess' lawyer Abdul Latif Bennett, who helped arrange the flight.
He was referring to the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the kingdom's Istanbul consulate which caused a global furor and strained Riyadh's ties with Ankara. 
On Feb. 28, 2019, seven men arrived at the princess' apartment near midnight, according to security footage provided by a close associate of the princess and seen by Reuters. Reuters could not independently verify its authenticity.
The princess was suspicious but went with them, accompanied by her 28-year-old daughter Suhoud al-Sharif, on assurances from a relative. But both women were taken to prison, the family member said.

1279,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",Texas to allow abortions amid pandemic after court fight,"By Nate Raymond and Andrew Chung
(Reuters) - Texas will allow abortions to resume following a legal battle over whether the Republican-governed state could enact a near-total ban on the procedure to preserve supplies of personal protective equipment during the coronavirus pandemic.
The state in a filing late on Wednesday told a federal judge in Austin, Texas, that a new executive order by Republican Governor Greg Abbott regarding elective medical procedures provided exemptions that would allow abortions to not be postponed.
The order allows healthcare facilities to resume elective medical procedures if they agree to reserve hospital capacity for COVID-19 patients and not request personal protective equipment from public sources during the coronavirus crisis.
Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's office said because the abortion providers challenging an earlier, stricter order by Abbott that expired on Tuesday have certified their compliance with the exemptions, there ""is no case or controversy remaining.""
The abortion providers included Whole Woman's Health and Planned Parenthood, which in an email on Thursday said the new order ""allows patients - once again - to get an abortion in the state.""
Texas is one of several conservative states that have sought limits on abortion through broad restrictions on non-emergency procedures aimed at freeing up medical resources to respond to the coronavirus outbreak.
In late March, Abbott issued an executive order aimed at addressing concerns about hospital capacity during the coronavirus pandemic by prohibiting medical procedures not immediately necessary.
Paxton subsequently announced that he interpreted the order as applying to abortion providers as well and said they should postpone any abortions that are not necessary to preserve a woman's life and health.
In a lawsuit, Planned Parenthood clinic operators and other abortion providers argued that the abortion ban would run contrary to the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade that women have a constitutional right to obtain an abortion.
A federal judge initially blocked the state from enforcing the near-total ban on surgical and medication-induced abortions, but a federal appeals court reversed that ruling.
U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel in Austin then narrowed his temporary restraining order, but the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday overturned his decision to allow medication-induced abortions to proceed.
The court at that time left in place a portion of Yeakel's decision that prevented the state from banning surgical abortions for women who would be past the legal limit for the procedure by the time Abbott's order expired.

Ravio Patra, an Indonesian researcher with the UK-based Westminster Foundation for Democracy, was detained on Wednesday night on suspicion of ""broadcasting messages to instigate violence and/or spread hatred,"" Jakarta police spokesman Yusri Yunus told a streamed news conference.Yunus said Patra had not been charged and declined further comment because he said it was an ongoing investigation. He did not respond when asked to address the accusation that Patra had been framed.
Patra could not be reached for comment. Lawyer Muhammad Arsyad said investigators had not allowed him access to represent Patra. The Westminster Foundation for Democracy could not immediately be reached for comment. 
A joint statement issued by 11 rights groups said Patra had told activists before he was detained that he had lost access to his WhatsApp account for five hours on Wednesday, during which time messages were sent from it to unknown contacts reading: ""CRISIS HAS ALREADY BURNED! LET'S UNITE AND BURN ON 30 APRIL FOR THE MASS LOOTING NATIONALLY, ALL STORES ARE FOR US TO LOOT!"".
Reuters saw an image of the message that had been captured from the screen of one of the recipients, who had subsequently sent it to Patra before his arrest.
Two sources at Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), which owns WhatsApp, told Reuters that Patra's WhatsApp account had been found on Wednesday to be ""compromised"", possibly in a targeted attack. They declined to provide specific details.
A WhatsApp spokeswoman said: ""While we can't comment on specific users, our primary concern is for the security and safety of our users.""
Activists urged police to release Patra and investigate who was behind the alleged hacking. Their statement was jointly issued by groups including Amnesty International Indonesia and the Legal Aid Foundation.
""We see and believe that the motive for spreading these fake messages is to frame Ravio, as if he was the provocateur attempting to create riots,"" Damar Juniarto, executive director of Southeast Asia Freedom of Expression Network (SAFEnet), said in the statement 
They did not accuse any specific individual or group.
The statement noted Patra, 27, had been critical of the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak and of its actions in the easternmost province of Papua, where the army has fought a low-level separatist insurgency for decades.
On social media platforms and local websites, Patra had criticized the government for an insufficient response to the coronavirus. Officials have repeatedly rejected this, saying they have taken appropriate measures.
Patra had also accused the government of a lack of transparency around projects in Papua. The government has also rejected these assertions.
Government offices did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Patra's views.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes an Iranian military satellite launch this week was overseen by a high-ranking commander involved in past attacks on American targets, a senior administration official said on Thursday.
The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a declassified assessment of the launch determined that it was overseen by Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards Aerospace Force, at a site in eastern Iran. 
Hajizadeh was behind the downing of a U.S. military drone in the Gulf last June, a missile attack on U.S. service members in Iraq in January, and the downing of a Ukrainian Airlines flight near Tehran the same month, the official said. 
No U.S. troops were killed in the attacks in Iraq but more than 100 were later diagnosed with traumatic brain injury. Both Iranian and U.S. officials have said the shooting down of the Ukrainian civilian plane was an error.
Iranian state TV reported that the Revolutionary Guards launched Iran's first military satellite on Tuesday. It said the satellite named ""Noor"" had reached orbit. 
The space shot was from ""a rapid deployment, mobile launch system, which is inconsistent with any civilian application,"" the administration official said.
""This was a space launch conducted by the Iranian military for military purposes,"" the official said.

With tensions running high between the two countries, Trump said on Wednesday he had instructed the U.S. Navy to fire on any Iranian ships that harass it at sea.

The Bundu dia Mayala (BDM) sect wants to restore the kingdom that thrived for centuries around the mouth of the Congo River and includes portions of Congo, Congo Republic, Angola and Gabon.
BDM has clashed sporadically with government forces in the past and tensions have escalated over the past month, with the group telling local media it is unhappy about the government's treatment of its leader, the self-styled prophet and former member of parliament Ne Muanda Nsemi.
Seven police officers were also seriously injured in the raid on Wednesday morning on a house in the Kongo-Central province, where BDM members had gathered to pray, interior minister Gilbert Kankonde said in statement.
""Facing strong resistance ... the local population resolved to lend a hand to the police, which led to the stampede of these outlaws and the demolition of the house,"" Kankonde said.
Security forces found several guns, ammunition and arrows tipped with poison, Kankonde said. BDM's spokesperson was not reachable for comment.
Nsemi, who has a strong following in the southwestern province of Kongo Central, led a string of deadly protests against former President Joseph Kabila in 2017, leading to his arrest.
But shortly after, in May 2017, his supporters, who often wear quasi-military blue shirts and red berets or bandanas, attacked Kinshasa's main prison where Nsemi was being held, freeing him and thousands of others.
After two years on the run he re-appeared at a press conference in Kinshasa last year, pledging to contribute to the development of the country.

STAINS, France (Reuters) - On April 5, 61-year-old Mang Phother felt his breathing getting worse and worse. Two days later he was rushed to a hospital in Paris' northern suburbs and found himself battling COVID-19 from an intensive care bed.
Just over two weeks later, the hotel worker of Cambodian origin was sitting on his couch at home next to his wife with just one message: Don't give up!
""I didn't think I would come out,"" he told Reuters as he left the hospital earlier. ""Thanks to everybody who brought me the joy of life.""
Emotionally and physically drained, Phother is one of dozens of people across France who have left overwhelmed intensive care units in recent days as the country begins to turn the tide after more than 21,000 deaths from the virus.
At the L'Estree clinic in Stains, the hospital staff, who put together an intensive care unit in 72 hours last month as the virus spread rapidly through the area, are torn.
Their happiness that Phother has recovered is tempered with a few tears because the man who became a kind of mascot in their fight against the virus is leaving.
""It's emotional and sad not to see him anymore, but I'm happy that he is better,"" said Widad Abdi, an anaesthetist-intensive care doctor. ""Today hope is back.""
For the COVID unit, Phother was the first person to make it out of the hospital after being seriously ill.
They hope this will provide new momentum for an area where the coronavirus mortality rate has been much higher than in the more affluent capital on the other side of the ring-road.
Christine Anest, 82, is another patient who could soon leave after spending several days fighting for her life.

1285,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 11:08AM ET</span>","Special Report: As virus advances, doctors rethink rush to ventilate","By Silvia Aloisi, Deena Beasley, Gabriella Borter, Thomas Escritt and Kate Kelland
BERLIN (Reuters) - When he was diagnosed with COVID-19, Andre Bergmann knew exactly where he wanted to be treated: the Bethanien hospital lung clinic in Moers, near his home in northwestern Germany.
The clinic is known for its reluctance to put patients with breathing difficulties on mechanical ventilators - the kind that involve tubes down the throat. 
The 48-year-old physician, father of two and aspiring triathlete worried that an invasive ventilator would be harmful. But soon after entering the clinic, Bergmann said, he struggled to breathe even with an oxygen mask, and felt so sick the ventilator seemed inevitable. 
Even so, his doctors never put him on a machine that would breathe for him. A week later, he was well enough to go home.
Bergmann's case illustrates a shift on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic, as doctors rethink when and how to use mechanical ventilators to treat severe sufferers of the disease - and in some cases whether to use them at all. While initially doctors packed intensive care units with intubated patients, now many are exploring other options. 
Machines to help people breathe have become the major weapon for medics fighting COVID-19, which has so far killed more than 183,000 people. Within weeks of the disease's global emergence in February, governments around the world raced to build or buy ventilators as most hospitals said they were in critically short supply. 
Germany has ordered 10,000 of them. Engineers from Britain to Uruguay are developing versions based on autos, vacuum cleaners or even windshield-wiper motors. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration is spending $2.9 billion for nearly 190,000 ventilators. The U.S. government has contracted with automakers such as General Motors Co (NYSE:GM) and Ford Motor (NYSE:F) Co as well as medical device manufacturers, and full delivery is expected by the end of the year. Trump declared this week that the U.S. was now ""the king of ventilators."" 
However, as doctors get a better understanding of what COVID-19 does to the body, many say they have become more sparing with the equipment.
Reuters interviewed 30 doctors and medical professionals in countries including China, Italy, Spain, Germany and the United States, who have experience of dealing with COVID-19 patients. Nearly all agreed that ventilators are vitally important and have helped save lives. At the same time, many highlighted the risks from using the most invasive types of them - mechanical ventilators - too early or too frequently, or from non-specialists using them without proper training in overwhelmed hospitals.
Medical procedures have evolved in the pandemic as doctors better understand the disease, including the types of drugs used in treatments. The shift around ventilators has potentially far-reaching implications as countries and companies ramp up production of the devices.

""BETTER RESULTS""
Many forms of ventilation use masks to help get oxygen into the lungs. Doctors' main concern is around mechanical ventilation, which involves putting tubes into patients' airways to pump air in, a process known as intubation. Patients are heavily sedated, to stop their respiratory muscles from fighting the machine. 
Those with severe oxygen shortages, or hypoxia, have generally been intubated and hooked up to a ventilator for up to two to three weeks, with at best a fifty-fifty chance of surviving, according to doctors interviewed by Reuters and recent medical research. The picture is partial and evolving, but it suggests people with COVID-19 who have been intubated have had, at least in the early stages of the pandemic, a higher rate of death than other patients on ventilators who have conditions such as bacterial pneumonia or collapsed lungs. 
This is not proof that ventilators have hastened death: The link between intubation and death rates needs further study, doctors say. 
In China, 86% of 22 COVID-19 patients didn't survive invasive ventilation at an intensive care unit in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic began, according to a study published in The Lancet in February. Normally, the paper said, patients with severe breathing problems have a 50% chance of survival. A recent British study found two-thirds of COVID-19 patients put on mechanical ventilators ended up dying anyway, and a New York study found 88% of 320 mechanically ventilated COVID-19 patients had died. 
More recently, none of the eight patients who went on ventilators at the Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi hospital had died as of April 9, a doctor there told Reuters. And one ICU doctor at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta said he had had a ""good"" week when almost half the COVID-19 patients were successfully taken off the ventilator, when he had expected more to die.
The experiences can vary dramatically. The average time a COVID-19 patient spent on a ventilator at Scripps Health's five hospitals in California's San Diego County was just over a week, compared with two weeks at the Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem and three at the Universiti Malaya Medical Centre in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, medics at the hospitals said.
In Germany, as patient Bergmann struggled to breathe, he said he was getting too desperate to care. 
""There came a moment when it simply no longer mattered,"" he told Reuters. ""At one point I was so exhausted that I asked my doctor if I was going to get better. I was saying, if I had no children or partner then it would be easier just to be left in peace.""
Instead of putting Bergmann on a mechanical ventilator, the clinic gave him morphine and kept him on the oxygen mask. He's since tested free of the infection, but not fully recovered. The head of the clinic, Thomas Voshaar, a German pulmonologist, has argued strongly against early intubation of COVID-19 patients. Doctors including Voshaar worry about the risk that ventilators will damage patients' lungs.
The doctors interviewed by Reuters agreed that mechanical ventilators are crucial life-saving devices, especially in severe cases when patients suddenly deteriorate. This happens to some when their immune systems go into overdrive in what is known as a ""cytokine storm"" of inflammation that can cause dangerously high blood pressure, lung damage and eventual organ failure.
The new coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease the virus causes, have been compared to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19, which killed 50 million people worldwide. Now as then, the disease is novel, severe and spreading rapidly, pushing the limits of the public health and medical knowledge required to tackle it.
When coronavirus cases started surging in Louisiana, doctors at the state's largest hospital system, Ochsner Health, saw an influx of people with signs of acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS. Patients with ARDS have inflammation in the lungs which can cause them to struggle to breathe and take rapid short breaths. 
""Initially we were intubating fairly quickly on these patients as they began to have more respiratory distress,"" said Robert Hart, the hospital system's chief medical officer. ""Over time what we learned is trying not to do that."" 
Instead, Hart's hospital tried other forms of ventilation using masks or thin nasal tubes, as Voshaar did with his German patient. ""We seem to be seeing better results,"" Hart said.
CHANGED LUNGS
Other doctors painted a similar picture. 
In Wuhan, where the novel coronavirus emerged, doctors at Tongji Hospital at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology said they initially turned quickly to intubation. Li Shusheng, head of the hospital's intensive care department, said a number of patients did not improve after ventilator treatment.
""The disease,"" he explained, ""had changed their lungs beyond our imagination."" His colleague Xu Shuyun, a doctor of respiratory medicine, said the hospital adapted by cutting back on intubation.
Luciano Gattinoni, a guest professor at the Department of Anaesthesiology, Emergency and Intensive Care Medicine, University of Göttingen in Germany, and a renowned expert in ventilators, was one of the first to raise questions about how they should be used to treat COVID-19.
""I realised as soon as I saw the first CT scan ... that this had nothing to do with what we had seen and done for the past 40 years,"" he told Reuters.
In a paper published by the American Thoracic Society on March 30, Gattinoni and other Italian doctors wrote that COVID-19 does not lead to ""typical"" respiratory problems. Patients' lungs were working better than they would expect for ARDS, they wrote - they were more elastic. So, he said, mechanical ventilation should be given ""with a lower pressure than the one we are used to.""
Ventilating some COVID-19 sufferers as if they were standard patients with ARDS is not appropriate, he told Reuters. ""It's like using a Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) to go to the shop next door, you press on the accelerator and you smash the window.""
The Italians were swiftly followed by Cameron Kyle-Sidell, a New York physician who put out a talk on YouTube saying that by preparing to put patients on ventilators, hospitals in America were treating ""the wrong disease."" Ventilation, he feared, would lead to ""a tremendous amount of harm to a great number of people in a very short time."" This remains his view, he told Reuters this week.
When Spain's outbreak erupted in mid-March, many patients went straight onto ventilators because lung X-rays and other test results ""scared us,"" said Delia Torres, a physician at the Hospital General Universitario de Alicante. They now focus more on breathing and a patient's overall condition than just X-rays and tests. And they intubate less. ""If the patient can get better without it, then there's no need,"" she said.
In Germany, lung specialist Voshaar was also concerned. A mechanical ventilator itself can damage the lungs, he says. This means patients stay in intensive care longer, blocking specialist beds and creating a vicious circle in which ever more ventilators are needed. 
Of the 36 acute COVID-19 patients on his ward in mid-April, Voshaar said, one had been intubated - a man with a serious neuro-muscular disorder - and he was the only patient to die. Another 31 had recovered.
""IRON LUNGS""
Some doctors cautioned that the impression that the rush to ventilate is harmful may be partly due to the sheer numbers of patients in today's pandemic.
People working in intensive care units know that the mortality rate of ARDS patients who are intubated is around 40%, said Thierry Fumeaux, head of an ICU in Nyon, Switzerland, and president of the Swiss Intensive Care Medicine Society. That is high, but may be acceptable in normal times, when there are three or four patients in a unit and one of them doesn't make it.
""When you have 20 patients or more, this becomes very evident,"" said Fumeaux. ""So you have this feeling - and I've heard this a lot - that ventilation kills the patient."" That's not the case, he said. ""No, it's not the ventilation that kills the patient, it's the lung disease."" 
Mario Riccio, head of anaesthesiology and resuscitation at the Oglio Po hospital near Cremona in Lombardy, Italy's worst-hit region, says the machines are the only treatment to save a COVID-19 patient in serious condition. ""The fact that people who were placed under mechanical ventilation in some cases die does not undermine this statement.""
Originally nicknamed ""iron lungs"" when introduced in the 1920s and 1930s, mechanical ventilators are sometimes also called respirators. They use pressure to blow air - or a mixture of gases such as oxygen and air - into the lungs.
They can be set to exhale it, too, effectively taking over a patient's entire breathing process when their lungs fail. The aim is to give the body enough time to fight off an infection to be able to breathe independently and recover.
Some patients need them because they're losing the strength to breathe, said Yoram Weiss, director of Hadassah Ein Kerem Medical Center in Jerusalem. ""It is very important to ventilate them before they collapse."" At his hospital, 24 of 223 people with COVID-19 had been put on ventilators by April 13. Of those, four had died and three had come off the machines.
AEROSOLS
Simpler forms of ventilation - face masks for example - are easier to administer. But respirator masks can release micro-droplets known as aerosols which may spread infection. Some doctors said they avoided the masks, at least at first, because of that risk. 
While mechanical ventilators do not produce aerosols, they carry other risks. Intubation requires patients to be heavily sedated so their respiratory muscles fully surrender. The recovery can be lengthy, with a risk of permanent lung damage.
Now that the initial wave of COVID-19 cases has peaked in many countries, doctors have time to examine other ways of managing the disease and are fine-tuning their approach.
Voshaar, the German lung specialist, said some doctors were approaching COVID-19 lung problems as they would other forms of pneumonia. In a healthy patient, oxygen saturation - a measure of how much oxygen the haemoglobin in the blood contains - is around 96% of the maximum amount the blood can hold. When doctors check patients and see lower levels, indicating hypoxia, Voshaar said, they can overreact and race to intubate. 
""We lung doctors see this all the time,"" Voshaar told Reuters. ""We see 80% and still do nothing and let them breathe spontaneously. The patient doesn't feel great, but he can eat and drink and sit on the side of his bed.""
He and other doctors think other tests can help before intubation. Voshaar looks at a combination of measures including how fast the patient is breathing and their heart rate. His team are also guided by lung scans.
""HAPPY HYPOXICS""
Several doctors in New York said they too had started to consider how to treat patients, known as ""happy hypoxics,"" who can talk and laugh with no signs of mental cloudiness even though their oxygen might be critically low.
Rather than rushing to intubate, doctors say they now look for other ways to boost the patients' oxygen. One method, known as ""proning,"" is telling or helping patients to roll over and lie on their fronts, said Scott Weingart, head of emergency critical care at Stony Brook University Medical Center on Long Island. 
""If patients are left in one position in bed, they tend to desaturate, they lose the oxygen in their blood,"" Weingart said. Lying on the front shifts any fluid in the lungs to the front and frees up the back of the lungs to expand better. ""The position changes have radically impressive effects on the patient's oxygen saturations."" 
Weingart does recommend intubating a communicative patient with low oxygen levels if they start to lose mental clarity, if they experience a cytokine storm or if they start to really struggle to breathe. He feels there are enough ventilators for such patients at his hospital.
But for happy hypoxics, ""I still don't want these patients on ventilators, because I think it's hurting them, not helping them.""
QUALITY, SKILL
As governments in the United States and elsewhere are scrambling to raise output of ventilators, some doctors worry the fast-built machines may not be up to snuff. 
Doctors in Spain wrote to their local government to complain that ventilators it had bought were designed for use in ambulances, not intensive care units, and some were of poor quality. In the UK, the government has cancelled an order for thousands of units of a simple model because more sophisticated devices are needed. 
More important, many doctors say, is that the additional machines will need highly trained and experienced operators. 
""It's not just about running out of ventilators, it's running out of expertise,"" said David Hill, a pulmonology and critical care physician in Waterbury, Connecticut, who attends at Waterbury Hospital.
Long-term ventilation management is complex, but Hill said some U.S. hospitals were trying to bring non-critical care physicians up to speed fast with webinars or even tip sheets. ""That is a recipe for bad outcomes.""
""We intensivists don't ventilate by protocol,"" said Hill. ""We may choose initial settings,"" he said, ""but we adjust those settings. It's complicated.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian police have registered a case against a top television news anchor for inciting religious discord after he criticised opposition leader Sonia Gandhi during a show about a vigilante attack in which Hindu holy men were killed.
Arnab Goswami, who is editor of the fiercely nationalist Republic Bharat TV and is known for shouting at guests on his nightly show, has been accused of promoting hatred between religious groups, according to the police complaint filed late on Wednesday.
Goswami did not respond to a request for comment. 
In a tweet he said he had filed a police complaint of his own after an incident in which he said two men tried to assault him and his wife late on Wednesday as they were leaving their studio in Mumbai. 
The case against Goswami, 57, stems from a show he aired on Tuesday on a lynching incident in the western state of Maharashtra, in which three men, including two Hindu holy men, were killed by a mob last week.
Local newspapers and news channels have said the three men were headed to a funeral when they were dragged out of a car and killed by a crowd that apparently thought they were thieves.
It was a rare case of an attack on Hindu holy men in a country that has more commonly seen lynchings of people from the minority Muslim community over incidents such as the slaughter of cows or on suspicion of being anti-national.
In his programme, which millions watch each day, Goswami said Sonia Gandhi and the Congress party she leads had failed to condemn the latest lynching incident because the victims were Hindus.
""Let me question if a Muslim or Christian preacher was attacked, would these people be silent? Would Sonia Gandhi, who hails from Italy, be quiet?,"" Goswami said. Gandhi was born in Italy but came to India as a young woman more than five decades ago.
""Today there is no word from them, because perhaps she's satisfied with the killing of Hindu seers in the state where her party is ruling,"" he added referring to Maharashtra state which is governed by the Congress party.
The Congress on Monday condemned the attack, saying ""There is no place for violence in our civilized society and the strictest possible action must be taken against the accused.""
Gandhi, the widow of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, is a bitter foe of India's ruling Hindu nationalist alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Congress party has strongly criticised Modi's policies, saying they are aimed at marginalizing Muslims.
The Congress said Goswami had crossed all limits in his attack on their leader. ""Ridiculous attack by Arnab Goswami on Sonia Gandhi in derogatory language is totally shameful and unacceptable,"" said Amarinder Singh, a party stalwart and chief minister of northern Punjab state.
The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party said that Goswami had faced a physical attack and that should be condemned by all. 
""We condemn the attempt to attack Arnab Goswami. We condemn every attack on any journalist ... it is really ironical that those who preach tolerance have become so intolerant,"" Information and Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javdekar told Reuters partner ANI.
Mumbai police said they had detained two men for questioning. They had thrown ink at Goswami's car, the police said.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Roadwork is booming in Israel as construction crews take advantage of empty roads and railways in the time of coronavirus to upgrade the developed world's most congested highways.
Many countries have debated whether to keep up construction amid fears of spreading the infection, but Israel, spotting a chance early on in its battle with the outbreak, took the risk and kept labourers deployed with masks and social distancing.
The government injected over 1 billion shekels ($280 million) into the impromptu campaign and for nearly two months companies have been cramming in the work while the rest of the country is stuck at home. One recruitment campaign is referred to as ""Opportunity in the Crisis.""
The push to finish projects quickly should have an immense, long-term impact on the economy.
Traffic density in Israel is three times the average among the 36 industrialised countries of the OECD. Commuters lose on average an hour a day in traffic congestion, a hit to productivity that costs about $5 billion a year. 
Since increasingly stringent coronavirus restrictions began in February, traffic has dropped about 85%, according to Israel's national roads company. On the eve of the Passover holiday, one of the busiest times of year, Israel was under lockdown and traffic was just 1% of the usual level.
Some of the biggest and most crucial projects, like the final stretch of a new fast train between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem or the expansion of a highway in central Israel, will be finished six months to a year ahead of schedule because building was accelerated. 
GREEN LIGHT TO HIRE
A main street where part of Tel Aviv's new subway is being built will be closed for 10 days rather than five weeks.
If there aren't enough workers, companies have a green light to hire as many as necessary, one official told Reuters, a rare phenomenon since unemployment has soared to 26% in the crisis.
If they lack equipment they are told to improvise. Railroad workers who needed to erect electric poles in a remote area dismantled a cement mixer and attached it to a train car to bring it up the line.
The government, seeing a silver lining to the high unemployment, hopes to recruit more bus drivers than ever to help an ailing public transportation system
Jacob Blitshtein, acting director general of the Transportation Ministry, said there was no limit on manpower. 
It is still too early to estimate what the payoff of the infrastructure push will be, Blitshtein said, but he was confident it would have ""serious economic significance.""
Israel's death toll from the coronavirus is lower than many countries -- 191 people have died -- and it's already easing some restrictions to jumpstart the economy.
Crews will have to scale back as commuters re-emerge.
""But for as long as it's possible to accelerate, we will accelerate,"" Blitshtein said.

KOBLENZ, Germany (Reuters) - Two suspected members of President Bashar al-Assad's security services had charges of torture and sexual assault read out against them on Thursday in a German court, in what lawyers say is the first trial for war crimes by Syrian government agents.
Anwar R., a former intelligence officer who applied for asylum in Germany six years ago after leaving Syria, is charged with 58 murders in a Damascus prison where prosecutors say at least 4,000 opposition activists were tortured in 2011 and 2012.
Grey haired, with a bald patch and wearing a moustache, glasses and a dark sweater, he sat calmly behind a glass cubicle erected under hygiene rules adopted by the court against the coronavirus outbreak. The charges read out included at least one rape and multiple sexual assaults.
The second suspect, Eyad A., 43, charged with facilitating the torture of at least 30 opposition activists arrested after an anti-Assad demonstration in 2011, covered his face with his grey jacket hood as he took his seat at the court. He arrived in Germany in April 2018.
Arabic interpreters repeated the charges to the suspects, identified by their first names only under German privacy laws.
Campaigners have hailed the process as a first step towards justice for thousands of Syrians who say they were tortured in government facilities, after attempts to establish an international tribunal for Syria failed.
The Assad government denies it tortures prisoners.
""The defendants are accused of having been members of Syria's general intelligence directorate,"" said Petra Zimmermann, spokeswoman of the higher regional court in Koblenz. ""Anwar R. is believed to have been the head of an investigation unit in department 251 which was responsible for Damascus. It is believed that systematic torture of prisoners occurred at this prison and that he was aware of that.""
German prosecutors say Anwar R. oversaw interrogations before leaving Syria in 2012. He arrived in Germany in 2014.
They have brought the case under universal jurisdiction laws that allow Germany to try crimes against humanity committed anywhere in the world. International lawyers have said they believe it is the first case anywhere against suspected officials in Assad's government for such crimes.
Attempts by Western powers to set up an international tribunal for Syria have been blocked by Russia and China at the U.N. Security Council. Syria is also not a signatory to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
About a dozen Syrian refugees and human rights campaigners held banners outside the court reading, 'Assad's Syria is a torture state' and 'Assad to The Hague'.
Campaigners and survivors hope the trial will open the door for similar processes in other European countries such as Norway, which have similar universal jurisdiction laws and where former Syrian security service members are believed to live.
""It was a huge challenge for our clients to come out and talk about these crimes for the first time ever,"" said lawyer Patrick Kroker, head of the European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), which is supporting 16 Syrians in the proceedings.

""We hope they are being heard worldwide and that there is a first trial which hopefully sends a signal to Damascus.""

PARIS (Reuters) - France offered retailers some relief on Thursday, saying it wanted them to reopen when a nationwide lockdown ends on May 11, though some curbs could remain in certain areas to delay a new wave of the coronavirus.
The government has ruled out restaurants, bars and cafes reopening straight after the lockdown is lifted, and Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire indicated restrictions were likely to remain in regions that have been hit worst by the virus. 
""We want all retailers to be able to open on May 11 in the same way out of fairness,"" Le Maire told France Info radio, though he said protocols would first have to be worked out to protect clients and workers alike. 
France has suffered the world's fourth-highest reported coronavirus death toll of more than 20,000, with more than 158,000 infections.
President Emmanuel Macron ordered the lockdown in mid-March to slow the spread of the virus, but the government has been working on a plan that would minimise the chances of France being hit by a second wave of coronavirus cases when it ends.
The government is under pressure to get the economy running again as soon as possible, even from within Macron's own party, but it has made clear that curbs will remain on travel between regions after May 11. 
Le Maire did not say where restrictions on retailers could remain, but the areas hit hardest by the coronavirus are eastern France and the Paris region. Western France has been affected much less, and there are concerns that removing restrictions on travel between regions could increase its exposure.
Retail outlets that do reopen will need to adapt strict rules to limit the number of people in shops at one time. 
Restaurants, cafes and bars will not reopen until mid-June at the earliest, and sports and religious gatherings will be banned at least until then, but people will in principle no longer need a document to walk the streets or go jogging.
PREVENTING A SECOND WAVE 
Public Health Authority chief Jerome Salomon also added a note of caution, telling a parliamentary hearing on Thursday that lifting the lockdown would depend on a substantial fall in the number of people sick and in intensive care. 
""France's goal is not to create collective immunity by creating a second and then a third wave, that seems too dangerous to us,"" Salomon said. ""The goal is to prevent the circulation of the virus, and to create favourable conditions to gain time before the arrival of effective drugs or vaccines."" 
Less than 10% of France's 67 million population is expected to have contracted the virus by the end of the lockdown.
The government is also looking at limiting the movements of older people, who are more susceptible to contracting the virus, and the government has made clear that people ""will not live as before"" after the lockdown ends.
Companies have been told to encourage employees to continue working from home if they can, as this would limit the number of people using public transport.
The government wants to ensure face masks are available to the public by the end of the lockdown, though it is unclear whether it will be compulsory to wear them. 

The government also aims to increase the number of tests to about 700,000 a week, from about 200,000 at the moment, Salomon said. It is also assessing whether those who test positive can then be isolated to break the transmission chain.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will destroy U.S. warships if its security is threatened in the Gulf, the head of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards told state TV on Thursday, a day after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Tehran over ""harassment"" of U.S. vessels.
""I have ordered our naval forces to destroy any American terrorist force in the Persian Gulf that threatens security of Iran's military or non-military ships,"" Major General Hossein Salami said. ""Security of the Persian Gulf is part of Iran's strategic priorities.""
Trump said on Wednesday he had instructed the U.S. Navy to fire on any Iranian ships that harass it at sea, but said later he was not changing the military’s rules of engagement.
Earlier this month, the U.S. military said 11 Revolutionary Guards naval vessels from the Guards navy came close to U.S. Navy and coast guard ships in the Gulf, calling the moves “dangerous and provocative”.
Tehran blamed its longtime adversary for the incident. On Thursday, Iran's Foreign Ministry summoned the Swiss ambassador in Tehran, who represents U.S. interests in the country, over the recent tensions between Tehran and Washington. 
""I am telling the Americans that we are absolutely determined and serious in defending our national security, our water borders, our shipping safety, and our security forces, and we will respond decisively to any sabotage,"" Salami said.
""Americans have experienced our power in the past and must learn from it.""
Tensions between Iran and the United States have escalated since 2018, when Trump withdrew from Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six world powers and reimposed crippling sanctions.
MILITARY SATELLITE
Animosity reached historic heights in early January when top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. Iran retaliated on Jan. 9 by firing missiles at bases in Iraq where U.S. troops were stationed. 
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif suggested that Trump should focus on saving U.S. service members from the new coronavirus outbreak. 
""The U.S. military is hit by over 5,000 #covid19 infections. 
...Also, U.S. forces have no business 7,000 miles away from home, provoking our sailors off our OWN Persian Gulf shores,"" Zarif tweeted.
Iran's clerical rulers consider the U.S. military presence in the Middle East a threat to the Islamic Republic's security.
Stoking antagonism over Tehran's nuclear and missile programs, Iran's Guards said on Wednesday they had successfully launched the country's first military satellite into orbit. The announcement drew protests from Washington.
The U.S. military says the same long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could allow Tehran to launch longer-range missiles, perhaps someday with nuclear warheads.

Tehran denies U.S. assertions that such activity is a cover for ballistic missile development and says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.

Several fishing trawlers carrying hundreds of Rohingya, members of a Muslim minority from Myanmar, are bound for Bangladesh, after being turned back from Malaysia where they were seeking asylum, according to rights groups.
Last week, a boat carrying nearly 400 starving and emaciated Rohingya arrived on the southern coast of Bangladesh after drifting for weeks in the sea between Thailand and Malaysia, the Bangladesh coast guard said. Survivors said dozens had died.
Indrika Ratwatte, director of UNHCR's Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific, said it was urging “greater coordination and responsibility-sharing by states” to avert a crisis.
“We are increasingly concerned by reports of failure to disembark vessels in distress and of the grave immediate risk this poses to the men, women and children on board,” he said.
""In the context of the unprecedented current COVID-19 crisis, all states must manage their borders as they see fit. But such measures should not result in the closure of avenues to asylum, or of forcing people to return to situations of danger.""
Malaysian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Human rights groups fear restrictions to stem the spread of the virus across Southeast Asia could trigger a repeat of a 2015 crisis when a crackdown by Thailand prompted smugglers to abandon Rohingya at sea on crowded, rickety boats.
Bangladesh officials have said they will not accept new arrivals, but a coast guard official said a search was underway for the boats.
""If we cannot rescue these Rohingya people then who will take the responsibility for their lives?"" another official said.
More than a million Rohingya live in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, the majority having been driven from homes in Myanmar after a 2017 military crackdown which the Myanmar army said was a response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.

Myanmar denies persecuting Rohingya and says they are not an indigenous ethnic group but rather immigrants from South Asia, even though many Rohingya are able to trace their ancestry back centuries.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - When Hungarian ex-world champion canoeist Marton Joob and fiancee Dora got married they planned to have six children.
So far they've had 10, with an 11th on the way - and now that schools are closed and the country is under lockdown, looking after them has become a full-time job with sometimes unforeseen consequences.
""We think everything is all right and the fridge is full, and then 2-3 days later we open it and its almost empty,"" said 37-year-old Marton. 
They get by with two fridges and a big freezer, and use a 17-seater bus to transport the family around their home city of Szeged.
But their biggest challenge has been home schooling. Six of the children - they range in age from 15 years to just 14 months - have been studying at home for weeks, and all have assignments to be coordinated, completed and delivered on time.
The lockdown has taught the children to be more self-reliant and cooperate more readily in tidying the house, playing together in smaller groups and packing away toys - helping to bring the family closer together and reinforcing their Christian values.
""This virus has changed many things ... we have slowed down a little,"" said Marton, a three-time sprint canoe world champion between 2003 and 2007. 

While the epidemic is a worrying time ""seeing our children around us gives us great hope (and)... if God (wills it) ... we would like to have one or two more.""

""I'm so glad to be helping,"" Akkad said in an interview on Zoom. 
The 32-year old refugee has lived in London for four years. His footage of the journey he made surviving a sinking dinghy from Turkey into Europe and on to the UK, was part of a documentary series which in 2017 won BAFTA and International Emmy awards.
With the outbreak of the disease, he saw a way to thank the community that had welcomed him and become ""like home"" by becoming a hospital cleaner at Whipps Cross Hospital.
Akkad has been working there for four weeks, five days a week, and says it is one of his toughest challenges yet.
""It's a stressful job. It's physically and mentally demanding,"" he said, adding that disinfecting every inch of the ward while wearing personal protective equipment leaves him sweating and out of breath. 
And there was an emotional toll. ""It's really difficult to see patients suffering, especially that they cannot be visited by their loved ones because of the rules. You see them on their beds, talking to their loved ones, crying. It's hard to witness that,"" he added. 
But he says the experience will be worth it.
It will enable him to be able to tell the story of this pandemic, as well as to promote causes he is passionate about, such as better treatment for immigrants and refugees, and higher pay for workers at the ""bottom of the pyramid"". 
Sounding like a true native of his new country, Akkad bemoaned the lack of funding for the state-run National Health Service, and sang the praises of the multiculturalism of its nurses, cleaners and porters and their ability to work together. 
His colleagues on the coronavirus ward are from Nigeria, Jamaica, Ghana, Syria, Spain, Thailand and Poland, he said. 
When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke of his recent treatment in another London hospital for coronavirus, he thanked two nurses from Portugal and New Zealand for their care.
Noting that not all migrants and refugees have such a positive experience as he had when he first came to the UK, Akkad said he hoped that the coronavirus pandemic would bring a sense of unity and put an end to the hostility sometimes felt by new arrivals.
""Now that we see immigrants and refugees on the front line, I hope that will urge people again internationally to have a discussion about the value of immigrants and refugees to their host communities,"" he said.

The U.S. ambassador to Denmark said in an op-ed this week that the government is working on ""a substantial package of economic aid"" to Greenland. 
""They have clearly crossed the line,"" said Karsten Honge, member of the foreign affairs committee for the Socialist People's Party, a government ally. 
""It's completely unheard of that a close ally tries to create division between Greenland and Denmark this way,""

Soren Espersen, a member of the Danish parliament's foreign affairs committee for opposition party The Danish People's Party, called the U.S. offer ""an insult"" to Greenland and Denmark.
The Arctic island is important for the U.S. military and its ballistic missile early warning system, as it balances a Russian and Chinese commercial and military buildup in the Arctic. 
Greenland, home to only 56,000 people but rich in natural resources, is an autonomous Danish territory.
The United States plans to open a consulate in Greenland's capital Nuuk later this year.

CLICHY-SOUS-BOIS, France (Reuters) - The queue for the food bank snaked for hundreds of metres, out of the shuttered marketplace bordered by tower blocks and down the side of a four-lane highway on the outskirts of one of Europe's wealthiest cities.
In Paris's depressed suburbs, the number of people relying on food handouts is soaring as a strict coronavirus lockdown plunges France into its deepest recession since World War Two.
Many worked in the grey economy before the outbreak, and now receive little protection from France's generous welfare state.
""There were lots of women who worked looking after children... There was a whole economy based on getting by,"" said Bachir Ghouinem, volunteering at the food bank in Clichy-sous-Bois, some 20 kilometres (12 miles) from the city centre.
""So as everything stopped what did people find themselves with? Nothing.""
He and other volunteers would end up handing out sugar, pasta, cheese, milk and fresh fruit and vegetables - most donated by local stores rather than large retail chains - to around 1,600 families during the day, twice the number expected.
Clichy-sous-Bois is part of the Paris banlieues, the low-income districts that encircle the city. Unemployment among its largely immigrant population was already well above the national average before the epidemic struck.
Queueing for food, Nathalie Barlagne, 46, said she had lost her job as a creche assistant before the crisis. 
She had never before needed to rely on charity to support her family but could no longer afford her food bill after local markets closed. ""Now we have to shop in supermarkets and it's very expensive,"" she said.
""WE'RE ALL HERE FOR THE SAME REASON""
As the queue lengthened, Mohamed Mechmach, founder of local charity ACLEFEU, urged those in line to respect social distancing rules.
""Otherwise we won't be able to keep doing what we're doing,"" he told the crowd. ""The prefect will just say 'Stop everything'. That would be a shame. We're all here for the same reason.""
In the banlieues, the strict curbs ordered by President Emmanuel Macron to try to contain the epidemic have exacerbated deep-seated social tensions. 
Cramped social housing, workers with frontline jobs and a restless younger generation have turned some into hotspots of infection and unrest. Violence hit several neighbourhood for five straight nights over the past week.
Due west of Clichy-sous-Bois in another suburb, Argenteuil, Kante Sakho's charity was delivering food parcels to households. He says he is shifting 600 a week, and is barely able to keep up with demand.
Some recipients were illiterate and unable to fill out the mandatory government forms justifying movement outside the home. Others were families struggling to feed their children three meals a day after schools shut down.

""Since the coronavirus outbreak, there's a lot more poverty,"" Sakho said.

Regardless of where they are, the themes are often the same.
From Tokyo to Buenos Aires, and New York to Kathmandu, youngsters have taken to their balconies or front lawns to display and explain the drawings they have made to Reuters photographers.
Eight-year-old Reku Matsui in Tokyo has drawn himself between his grandparents, all three of them smiling together.
""I miss being with my grandmother and my grandfather. Also, I want to go to my grandmother's house,"" he said. 
His older sister Yaya, 12, has drawn a picture of herself and a friend. ""What I want to do the most right now is hang out with my friends.""
In the German town of Bad Honnef, near Bonn, 6-year-old Tom explains: ""I have painted a picture of the house of grandma and grandpa, because I miss them so much.""
Besides longed-for grandparents, children are also depicting the sports they miss.
Ivan Posta, 8, and brother Vince, 11, who live in the Hungarian capital Budapest, have drawn huge soccer balls.
""I drew a soccer ball, because we can't play football in the garden as there are trees and bushes everywhere,"" said Vince.
Thousands of miles away in the Nigerian city of Lagos, 11-year-old Olatunji Adebayo has also drawn a huge soccer ball.
""I miss playing football with my friends before the lockdown ... I feel sad about the lockdown,"" he said.
NATURE
Flowers, woods and green spaces also feature prominently.
Jane Hassebroek, who lives in Brooklyn, New York, said: ""I chose to draw my local park because it's a place me and my friends can hang out with each other away from school and home and just have fun.""
""This lockdown has made me feel pretty trapped because I live in New York City so it is hard to social distance when there are so many people around,"" the 13-year-old added.
Sandithi Illeperuma is 14 and lives in Sri Lanka's capital Colombo.
In her picture, a girl sits alone in the bottom right corner with her knees up to her chin, wearing a face mask. At the top, a group of female figures in swirling skirts dance together, enjoying themselves.
""Before the lockdown, I used to draw fun and creative stuff. But after the lockdown ... I started to draw the things I missed the most ... I draw my emotions. It has made me feel very lonely because I'm the only child,"" she added.
Some youngsters have tackled the coronavirus itself.
Nipoon Kitkrailard, 10, who lives in Thailand's Samut Prakan province, has drawn the virus as a monster coming to invade the world, but medical workers and items including hand gel and face masks hold it back.
In China, where the outbreak of the new coronavirus began, and where the lockdown has been lifted first, 11-year-old Li Congchen in Beijing has made an intricate series of drawings showing the virus arriving on a ""bat aircraft"", people willing to give their lives to stand up to it, and in the end human beings defeating it with ""vaccine guns.""

GAZA/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The electric lanterns and ornate decorations of Ramadan would normally be hanging in the streets of Gaza, the West Bank and east Jerusalem by now, but not this year amid coronavirus restrictions and growing economic woes.
The holy fasting month is expected to start on Friday but, as elsewhere, Palestinians this year are facing the prospect of celebrations without the usual large gatherings for family meals or evening prayers, known as Tarawih.
And the same closures that are set to dampen the mood are also suppressing the economy - Palestinian officials have ordered the closure of schools, wedding halls, restaurants and mosques, sending tens of thousands into unemployment.
With two deaths and 335 infected cases reported, different coronavirus regulations have been imposed by Hamas in Gaza and the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and by Israel in East Jerusalem, where Muslim religious authorities have stopped worship at the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest place in Islam..
""There are no worshippers, there are no people, and the closure of Al-Aqsa Mosque has a great influence on the Palestinian people and on the people of Jerusalem in particular,"" said Ammar Bakir, a resident of east Jerusalem.
Tens of thousands would usually pray in Al-Aqsa in Ramadan, rising to hundreds of thousands in the final days. Instead prayers will be broadcast from inside the mosque.
""Such a decision was the first in 1,400 years, it is tough, and it pains our hearts,"" said Sheikh Omar Al-Kiswani, the director of Al-Aqsa Mosque.
GAZA
In Gaza, with no confirmed coronavirus cases outside quarantine centres, Hamas said a full lockdown was not yet needed.
Customers still flock to markets and stores display the dates, cheese, pickles, nuts and other snacks favoured during Ramadan meals
But with families saving money in case of an outbreak, many are just window shopping.
""People will be very cautious to visit one another because of the coronavirus crisis,"" said restaurant owner Anas Qaterji.
""People are coming to the market to waste time, they are entertaining themselves after the cafes are closed,"" said Sameh Abu Shaban, 57, who owns a store selling dates and sweets. ""No- one is buying."" 
WEST BANK
In the West Bank the Palestinian Authority has declared a state of emergency, but a full lockdown has been eased to allow some businesses resume partial operations, amid predictions of a 50% fall in revenue.
""It is a sad Ramadan,"" said Maher al-Kurdi, a supermarket owner in Hebron.

""Usually shops would be crowded with large numbers of people. And mosques are closed, which would spoil the flavour of Ramadan,"" he said.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia called on Thursday for disputes over the South China Sea to be resolved by peaceful means, amid a standoff between Chinese and Malaysian vessels that a U.S. think tank said had been going on for months. 
U.S. and Australian warships arrived in the South China Sea this week near an area where a Chinese government survey vessel, the Haiyang Dizhi 8, has been operating close to a drillship under contract to Malaysian state oil company Petronas, regional security sources have said.
The standoff was the latest development in a series of targeted harassments by Chinese vessels of drilling operations in five oil blocks off the Malaysian coast in the past year, said Greg Poling, director of the Washington-based Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI). 
Since December, Chinese forces have been harassing supply ships servicing the West Capella, an oil exploration vessel operated by Petronas, Poling said. 
Last week, the Haiyang Dizhi 8, accompanied by a Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) vessel, entered Malaysia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and began a survey close to where the West Capella was operating. 
On Thursday, the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was still within Malaysia's EEZ, about 337 kilometres (209.4 miles) off Borneo, data from ship tracking website Marine Traffic Showed.
Three U.S. warships and an Australian frigate conducted a joint exercise in the South China Sea this week, near the site of the West Capella's operations, officials and security sources have said. 
China has denied reports of a standoff, saying the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was carrying out normal activities. 
Malaysia said on Thursday it remained committed to safeguarding its interests in the South China Sea. 
""While international law guarantees the freedom of navigation, the presence of warships and vessels in the South China Sea has the potential to increase tensions that in turn may result in miscalculations which may affect peace, security and stability in the region,"" Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein said in his first official remarks on the standoff. 
Hishammuddin said Malaysia maintained ""open and continuous communication"" with all relevant parties, including China and the United States. 
Petronas did not respond to requests for comment.
Separately, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said that a Chinese aircraft carrier group lead by China's first aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, had ended a mission in the South China Sea on Wednesday and was now heading east through the Bashi Channel, which separates Taiwan from the Philippines.
The carrier group earlier this month sailed down Taiwan's east coast. China said at the time it was on its way to routine exercises in the South China Sea.

IDLIB, Syria (Reuters) - A team of volunteers in Syria have cobbled together prototypes of a ventilator and a testing machine - homemade equipment to fight the new coronavirus if it hits the last rebel stronghold, where hospitals lie in ruins after nine years of war.
The group of 12, mainly technicians and engineers, hope to build hundreds of makeshift machines to combat the pandemic in Syria's northwest, where an army advance made nearly 1 million people homeless this year.
""If coronavirus cases start to surface here, it will spread widely,"" said Ayoub Abdul-Karim, a 20-year-old graduate who specialized in medical equipment. ""We're working on this today because there won't be enough machines. We suffer in the hospitals from a big lack of ventilators.""
His homemade ventilator is assembled inside a brown wooden box, with white plastic hoses sticking out to help the patient breathe.
Doctors worry that people in overcrowded camps would be impossible to protect if an outbreak hits the area. The region, home to 3 million people many of whom fled other parts of Syria, has no confirmed cases so far, but little testing has been done. There is only one machine to run a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect the virus. 
The volunteers have so far tried out their prototype ventilator at a hospital and have the green light from local doctors. They hope to get funding or equipment from aid agencies in the northwest and across the border in Turkey to produce hundreds of the breathing machines - critical to keeping COVID-19 patients alive. 
While the virus has forced the world's big cities into lockdown, Syrians crammed in refugee camps and makeshift settlements face grave risks. Clean water is often scarce, illnesses are rife and social distancing is nearly impossible.
A truce that Russia and Turkey brokered in March has brought some calm, halting the army's offensive.
""There are very few ventilators, much less than the need if the coronavirus spreads, and this had us very worried,"" said Yamen Abu al-Walid, 37, who helped set up the team to bring together expertise and try to meet the region's needs.

""The infrastructure is destroyed. We risk having many deaths if the disease strikes if there's no preparation.""

SOWETO, Johannesburg (Reuters) - They perform one of South Africa's most important services, collecting recyclables that would otherwise swell the country's rubbish dumps and burden municipal trash collection, but the coronavirus lockdown has left thousands of wastepickers jobless.
The shutdown ordered by President Cyril Ramaphosa that began on March 20, and was extended until April 30, is among the toughest in the world. It bans anyone apart from essential workers leaving their homes except to buy food or medicine.
Yet although municipal rubbish collectors were classified as essential workers, authorities excluded itinerant wastepickers who ply the streets of Johannesburg pulling heavy carts laden with more than three quarters of the city's total recycling.
For the past decade, 55-year old grandmother Abigail Kubheka has been rising at 3 a.m. every morning in her house in the township of Soweto. She walks some 10 kilometres a day to scavenge for recyclable trash and load it onto her cart.
""If you leave much later, you'll get nothing,"" she told Reuters at a Soweto yard where other wastepickers with whom she works sorted plastic from glass bottles and aluminium cans. 
Even when she goes to church on Sunday, she carries a waste bag to scoop up any promising items on the way back. Besides doing wonders for her fitness, her activities have enabled her to feed, clothe and educate three children -- one is now at university -- and support two grandchildren.
But with the lockdown, everything dried up.
""People think wastepickers are low down, but I find it good. I'm healthy and I'm free,"" she said. ""Now I'm just sitting at home because we can't work.""
A spokesman for the environment ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
A 2016 report by South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) estimated there were up to 90,000 waste pickers in the country, which is notorious for having the world's worst extremes of wealth and poverty.
The same report said they collect 80-90% of the paper and packaging that South Africa recycles, saving municipal authorities 750 million rand ($39.54 million) in one year. 
Another report by South Africa's plastic industry body put its recycling of plastics at 46% in 2018, compared with just 31% across Europe, thanks largely to the wastepickers' efforts.
Wastepicking also fill stomachs in a country with 30 percent unemployment and large families often depending on a single breadwinner. Adelina Nkopane, who works with Kubheka, was pulling in 1,000 rand a week -- a good wage in South Africa.
""Since the lockdown, I don't have money to buy food or pay my rent. My husband is not working and I never manage to keep money for more than a few days. It's a disaster,"" she said, before stuffing a sack full of plastic drink bottles.
Instead, she has been queuing up for government food handouts. ""If they can just allow us to work and we respect the rules and they gave us masks, we could be very happy,"" she said.

On Wednesday, U.S. cybersecurity firm FireEye said the hackers had tried to compromise the personal and professional email accounts of staff at China's Ministry of Emergency Management and the government of Wuhan, the Chinese city at the centre of the pandemic.
""The accusation is baseless,"" foreign ministry spokesman Ngo Toan Thang told a regular news conference. ""Vietnam forbids all cyber attacks, which should be denounced and strictly dealt with by law"".

Vietnam is willing to cooperate with international partners to combat cyber attacks, Thang added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As stores have closed across Japan during a state of emergency, some pachinko parlours remain defiantly open, sparking concern the noisy gambling halls could undermine the government's fight against the novel coronavirus.
The halls, where players sit back-to-back at long rows of machines amid the jangle of bouncing steel balls and garish flashing lights, are a fixture on many Japanese streets and are popular with young people, the underemployed and hardcore gamblers.
""I think this is actually more crowded than usual,"" Kensuke Takao, a 22-year-old restaurant worker, said at a pachinko parlour in Tokyo's Hatagaya district. ""I suppose everybody doesn't have jobs or places to go other than these pachinko parlours, which are still open.""
Even as Japan imposed a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other areas on April 7, then extended it to the nation last week, some parlours have jangled away as usual.
The parlours are found all over Japan, creating a headache for officials trying to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
""We would like to consider a next step against pachinko parlours that do not comply, such as a public announcement,"" Japanese Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters this week.
Japan's two major pachinko chains, Maruhan and Dynam, told Reuters that more than a half of their hundreds of branches are already closed, or will be shut down by the weekend. Others remain open with precautionary measures in place. 
  ""Places that are touched a lot, such as the pachinko machines, slot machines and lockers, are wiped down with alcohol,"" a Dynam spokesman said. ""The conditions at each location vary, so social distancing measures are left to the individual parlours.""
Though gambling is strictly controlled in Japan, pachinko - a vertical, pinball-like game that pays out in ball bearings - skirts the rules. Players exchange the balls for prize tokens, which can be redeemed for cash.
Popularity has been dropping, however. The industry has shrunk to about 20 trillion yen ($185.5 billion) from about 30 trillion yen a decade ago, according to Japan Productivity Center, which compiles statistics on the leisure sector.
Although some pachinko customers said the coronavirus crisis could warrant a shutdown, parlour owners warned that they might not be able to reopen.
""There's pressure from officials and society, but some owners cannot easily shut down, because our businesses might face risks of bankruptcy if the situation drags on,"" one owner of a few parlours outside Tokyo told Reuters, speaking anonymously because of the sensitivity of the issue.

BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese citizen journalist who posted videos about the coronavirus situation in the city of Wuhan has resurfaced after going missing for almost two months, saying in a YouTube video that he had been forcibly quarantined. 
Li Zehua, 25, was one of three citizen journalists who went missing in Wuhan. 
A video he published on Feb. 20 showed temporary porters being hired to transport corpses of people who apparently died of the coronavirus. It was viewed 850,000 times on YouTube, which is blocked in China.
Days later, he posted live video footage of the police coming to his home. He was then not heard of until his new video was posted on Wednesday.
The other two citizen journalists, Chen Qiushi and Fang Bin, who according to media reports posted footages of overwhelmed hospitals and corpses piled in a minibus, have not resurfaced publicly.
Chen's mother said earlier he was missing while Fang also posted video of the police knocking on his door.
Chinese authorities made no public comment on any of the three.
U.S. congressman Jim Banks called in March 31 on the U.S. State Department to urge China to investigate the disappearance of the three.
Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying dismissed Banks' call at the time, saying it was ""totally based on trumped up messages and information"".
Li, in his new video posted on Wednesday, said police took him from his apartment in Wuhan on Feb. 26 and questioned him at a police station on suspicion of disrupting public order.
He said that after nearly 24 hours, the police station chief told him he would not be charged but must undergo quarantine because he had been to high-risk areas, such as a crematorium.
Li said he was quarantined in a hotel until March 14, and then escorted to his hometown, where he was quarantined for another 14 days. He said police had required that he give his electronic devices to a friend while he was in quarantine.
It is not clear why Li chose to post the new video recounting his experience, which he said was made on April 16, three weeks after his last quarantine ended. 
Li did not immediately respond to a request for comment and Wuhan police could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday.
In the YouTube video recorded in late February, moments before Li opened the door to let police in, the former state television employee spoke about his ambition to speak up on behalf of the people.
He also lamented what he said was a dearth of idealism among young people and used a euphemism to refer to student protests that led to a crackdown in Beijing's Tiananmen Square (NYSE:SQ) in 1989, a taboo subject for China's ruling Communist Party.

(Reuters) - Severe storms and a tornado swept through the U.S. states of Oklahoma and Texas, killing at least six people and injuring dozens, officials said on Thursday.
Three people died and at least 20 were injured when a tornado touched down in Onalaska, Texas, on Wednesday, emergency officials said. Onalaska is about 90 miles north of Houston.
Two people were also killed in southern Oklahoma, while local media reported that a woman died in storm in Louisiana.
""On April 22, a tornado struck the city of Onalaska and other portions of Polk and San Jacinto counties, and possibly even far eastern Walker County"", Houston's National Weather Service (NWS) said in a statement.
The tornado touched down near Oklahoma's border with Texas around Wednesday evening. NWS said it will be sending crews on Thursday morning to survey the path of the ""Onalaska tornado"".
Polk County, where Onalaska is located, issued a declaration of disaster on Wednesday night after the tornado hit.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said that the state had deployed response teams and medical resources to provide assistance. 
""The state will continue to do everything it can to support those affected by this severe weather,"" Abbott said in a statement.
Several homes were damaged in the storms and thousands were left without power. More than 7,000 people across Oklahoma and about 9,000 people in Onalaska faced power outages. 
Images in local media showed the devastation caused by the storms, including damage to homes, downing of power lines and twisted billboards.
The development comes as most Americans are under ""stay-at-home"" orders due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.
Earlier this month, at least six people were killed as a strong storm system swept across the southern states of Mississippi and Louisiana, spinning off more than a dozen tornadoes and leaving behind a path of destruction.

LONDON (Reuters) - At midnight, silence shrouds London's party land.
The packed streets and teeming bars that have tended to the nocturnal needs of drunken poets, louche musicians and revellers seeking adventure have been left desolate by the coronavirus lockdown.
From the pubs of London's West End to the hedonistic nightclubs of Shoreditch, the fun has departed the British capital, at least for now.
Gone is humanity: the crowds, the diners, the drunks, the bewildered tourists, the opera aficionados, the watchful doormen, the lovers snatching an elicit embrace.
Soho's rainbow flags flutter above deserted bars, massage parlours lie dark and neon signs outside shuttered sex shops offer fantasies but nothing more.
London at night is deserted as never before. The big screens of Piccadilly Circus flash at nothing but a few ducks from the nearby royal park waddling nonchalantly past the fountain pool.
A solitary bell tolls, usually inaudible above the din, echoing along John Nash's elegant Regent Street. Empty red bus follows empty red bus.
Like many other cities, London is now looked after by just a skeleton staff: bus drivers in masks, police officers, the odd food delivery cyclist and street cleaners.
Homeless people find life even harder than it was.
A 19-year-old heroin addict, who asked not to be named, was sleeping rough on the streets of Europe's richest city. She said she found it hard to get money and had nowhere else to go.
""London is dead - it's goodnight London,"" said Darryl Wainwright, 40, who has been homeless for nearly two years. ""It is weird. It is crazy. I cannot understand it. I have never seen London like this.""
WEST END FINALLY SLEEPS
The coronavirus lockdown has left many bars and restaurants across the world facing an unprecedented cash crunch: large rents, often high debt and zero income. Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered pubs and restaurants closed on March 20.
London's night-time economy usually employs 1.6 million people, contributes billions of pounds to the economy and is one of Europe's top spots for revelry alongside Paris, Berlin, Madrid and Ibiza.
Soho, though, was deserted. 
Its bars have long been a refuge for famous writers, musicians, resistance leaders and philosophers.
The French House, on Dean Street, was frequented by Charles de Gaulle after the fall of France. Welsh poet Dylan Thomas once left the manuscript of ""Under Milk Wood"" under a chair there.
Karl Marx lived in Soho, as did Thomas De Quincey, author of ""Confessions of an English Opium-Eater"". George Orwell celebrated U.S. recognition of his ""Animal Farm"" in the Dog and Duck pub.
The Beatles recorded ""Hey Jude"" in a Soho studio and David Bowie recorded ""Ziggy Stardust"" there too.
In nearby Chinatown, lanterns swaying in the wind are the only things that move. Leicester Square (NYSE:SQ) is even quieter.
Street sweepers said they now had the space to give the city a thorough clean.

One said: ""The West End never sleeps - never - or not until now.""

Szijjarto announced the agreement in a post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page after talks with Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic and European Integration Minister Jadranka Joksimovic.
Serbia closed its borders in March to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, as did other countries in the region.
Szijjarto said the measure would enable ethnic Hungarians living in northern Serbia to take up work in Hungary after a shutdown imposed by Serbia, halting all passenger traffic, created major issues for Hungarian companies in the region.
Agricultural workers from both countries were allowed to cross the border at three checkpoints as of 0400 GMT on Thursday, Szijjarto said.

The reopening pact follows a similar bilateral agreement with Austria, which has enabled Hungarian commuters to cross the border at a reopened checkpoint to cut waiting times seen at busier border crossings.

Muslims around the world fast during day throughout the month of Ramadan, which begins on Thursday this year. Those who can't fast because they're ill are allowed to catch up later in the year.
Tajikistan has reported no coronavirus cases, but it has closed its borders and taken other steps to keep Covid-19 from spreading. That includes closing mosques.
In an address to Muslims, who make up the vast majority of the Tajik population, Rakhmon said that ensuring public health and food security was a valid reason to put off fasting.
""I urge everyone working in the fields ... in the name of their health and that of their families, ensuring their households' welfare, to use this dispensation and delay the fast until a more favourable time,"" Rakhmon said.
The former Soviet republic of 9 million has asked the International Monetary Fund and other donors for emergency aid to offset the impact of global recession on its economy.
Tajikistan imports some key food, such as wheat, and one of its suppliers, Kazakhstan, has already introduced quotas to limit exports.

Tajikistan is also likely to have much less hard currency to pay for imports, because Tajiks working in Russia are sending less money home.

Jenny McGee, who has worked for the National Health Service since 2010, told a New Zealand television station that she was unfazed by the task of caring for Johnson, who received the same care as any other patient and ""absolutely needed to be there"".
""There was a lot of media interest about him being in hospital and, to be honest, that was the toughest,"" McGee told TVNZ in an interview which aired on Thursday, her first public remarks since the episode.
""As a unit, he was just another patient we were trying to do our best for, so it was business as usual. It was just another day at the office,"" McGee added.
Johnson, 55, was taken to Guys and St Thomas' hospital on April 5 after his symptoms for COVID-19 worsened and he was moved into intensive care the following day, remaining there until April 9.
On being discharged on April 12, Johnson said in a video message, ""the NHS saved my life, no question"". He named and thanked the nurses who had cared for him, including ""Jenny from New Zealand"".
When Johnson sent that public message, McGee said in the interview, she was getting ready for her nightshift and a friend texted her the update.
""My first reaction was that it was a joke,"" she said.
As McGee carried out intensive care duties, she and said she and the prime minister ""spent a lot of time together and we talked away about NZ"", particularly about her home city of Invercargill, which she said he took an interest in.
After shifts caring for the British leader, she said she would get in her car and ""hear things about Boris Johnson on the news that was very surreal because I thought 'wow, I've been looking after him'"".
""But I really wasn't fazed by looking after Boris Johnson,"" she added.
Johnson wasn't the only national leader to congratulate McGee, who acknowledged she took longer than planned to respond to a message from New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, saying ""it's very surreal to have a message from Jacinda. She's a hero of mine.""

Once the nurse did respond to the New Zealand leader, the two shared ""a little bit of banter which again was surreal, (and) a couple of emojis"".

1312,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 23, 2020 12:15AM ET</span>",Special Report: Former Labradoodle breeder tapped to lead U.S. pandemic task force,"By Aram Roston and Marisa Taylor
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - On January 21, the day the first U.S. case of coronavirus was reported, the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services appeared on Fox News to report the latest on the disease as it ravaged China. Alex Azar, a 52-year-old lawyer and former drug industry executive, assured Americans the U.S. government was prepared.
“We developed a diagnostic test at the CDC, so we can confirm if somebody has this,” Azar said. “We will be spreading that diagnostic around the country so that we are able to do rapid testing on site.”
While coronavirus in Wuhan, China, was “potentially serious,” Azar assured viewers in America, it “was one for which we have a playbook.”
Azar’s initial comments misfired on two fronts. Like many U.S. officials, from President Donald Trump on down, he underestimated the pandemic’s severity. He also overestimated his agency’s preparedness.
As is now widely known, two agencies Azar oversaw as HHS secretary, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, wouldn’t come up with viable tests for five and half weeks, even as other countries and the World Health Organization had already prepared their own.
Shortly after his televised comments, Azar tapped a trusted aide with minimal public health experience to lead the agency’s day-to-day response to COVID-19. The aide, Brian Harrison, had joined the department after running a dog-breeding business for six years. Five sources say some officials in the White House derisively called him “the dog breeder.”
Azar’s optimistic public pronouncement and choice of an inexperienced manager are emblematic of his agency’s oft-troubled response to the crisis. His HHS is a behemoth department, overseeing almost every federal public health agency in the country, with a $1.3 trillion budget that exceeds the gross national product of most countries.
Azar and his top deputies oversaw health agencies that were slow to alert the public to the magnitude of the crisis, to produce a test to tell patients if they were sick, and to provide protective masks to hospitals even as physicians pleaded for them.
The first test created by the CDC, meant to be used by other labs, was plagued by a glitch that rendered it useless and wasn’t fixed for weeks. It wasn’t until March that tests by other labs went into production. The lack of tests “limited hospitals’ ability to monitor the health of patients and staff,” the HHS Inspector General said in a report this month. The equipment shortage “put staff and patients at risk.”
A promised virus surveillance program failed to take root, despite assurances Azar gave to Congress. Rather than share information, three current and three former government officials told Reuters, Azar and top staff sidelined key agencies that could have played a higher-profile role in addressing the pandemic. “It was a mess,” said a White House official who worked with HHS.
Officials across the government, from President Trump on down, have been blasted for America’s halting response to the pandemic. Critics inside and outside the administration say a meaningful share of the responsibility lies with HHS and Trump appointee Azar.
“You have to blame the problem on the virus, but it’s Azar's operation,” said Lynn Goldman, the dean of the public health school at George Washington University, who has served on advisory boards of the FDA and CDC. “And the buck stops there.”
HHS declined to make Azar available for an interview. Michael Caputo, the new chief HHS spokesman, declined to answer Reuters questions about Azar’s stewardship, saying in a statement: ""We are communicating to the American public during a deadly pandemic.”
DALLAS LABRADOODLES
Azar is a Republican lawyer who once clerked for the late conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and counts current Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh as a friend. Under George W. Bush, Azar worked for HHS as general counsel and deputy secretary. During the Obama years, he cycled through the private sector as a pharmaceutical company lobbyist and executive for Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). After Trump’s first HHS secretary was forced out in a travel corruption scandal, Azar stepped in, in January 2018.
Two years later, at the dawn of the coronavirus crisis, Azar appointed his most trusted aide and chief of staff, Harrison, as HHS’s main coordinator for the government’s response to the virus.
Harrison, 37, was an unusual choice, with no formal education in public health, management, or medicine and with only limited experience in the fields. In 2006, he joined HHS in a one-year stint as a “Confidential Assistant” to Azar, who was then deputy secretary. He also had posts working for Vice President Dick Cheney, the Department of Defense and a Washington public relations company.
Before joining the Trump Administration in January 2018, Harrison’s official HHS biography says, he “ran a small business in Texas.” The biography does not disclose the name or nature of that business, but his personal financial disclosure forms show that from 2012 until 2018 he ran a company called Dallas Labradoodles.
The company sells Australian Labradoodles, a breed that is a cross between a Labrador Retriever and a Poodle. He sold it in April 2018, his financial disclosure form said. HHS emailed Reuters that the sales price was $225,000.
At HHS, Harrison was initially deputy chief of staff before being promoted, in the summer of 2019, to replace Azar’s first chief of staff, Peter Urbanowicz, an experienced hospital executive with decades of experience in public health.
This January, Harrison became a key manager of the HHS virus response. “Everyone had to report up through him,” said one HHS official.
One questionable decision, three sources say, came that month, after the White House announced it was convening a coronavirus task force. The HHS role was to muster resources from key public health agencies: the CDC, FDA, National Institutes of Health, Office of Global Affairs and the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response.
Harrison decided, the sources say, to exclude FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn from the task force. “He said he didn’t need to be included,” said one official with knowledge of the matter.
When task force members were announced January 29, neither Hahn nor the FDA were included. Hahn wasn’t put on the task force until Vice President Mike Pence took over in February. Two of Hahn’s high-profile counterparts were on it from the start: CDC director Robert Redfield and Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
The HHS denied it was Harrison’s decision to leave out Hahn and the FDA, but declined to say who made the call. The agency lauded Harrison’s work on the task force. 
In a statement, Hahn said the FDA was focused on the coronavirus epidemic, “not on when we were added to the task force,” and that the agency was not “excluded.”
Fauci, who has become a public face of the Trump Administration’s COVID-19 effort, said he wasn’t sure including the FDA was necessary at the start. Initially, the Chinese government was saying the virus spread through animals, not human to human, he said. “You would include the FDA when you want to expedite drugs or devices,” Fauci said.
Others said the lack of a strong FDA role early on had direct consequences. Two sources familiar with events say the White House wasn’t getting information from the FDA about the state of the testing effort, a crucial element of the coronavirus response.
Reached by phone, Harrison declined to answer Reuters’ questions. In a later statement, he did not address questions about the task force but said he was proud of his work history. “Americans would be well served by having more government officials who have started and worked in small family businesses and fewer trying to use that experience to attack them and distort the record,” he wrote.
In a statement to Reuters, Azar said Harrison has been an asset. “From day one, Brian has demonstrated remarkable leadership and managerial talents,” Azar wrote.
LOW RISK?
In the pandemic’s early days, Azar offered words of both concern and assurance in public. On January 31, a day after the WHO declared COVID-19 a global health emergency, Azar declared it a public health emergency.
That same day, during the first Coronavirus Task Force briefing, Azar told the public: “I want to stress: The risk of infection for Americans remains low.”
The United States, he said, had taken adequate precautions. Travel restrictions and 14-day quarantines on Americans who had been to Wuhan, where the virus originated, were imposed. Americans returning from other parts of China had to self-quarantine.
The next week, on February 7, in another press conference, Azar repeated the message. “The immediate risk to the American public is low at this time,” he announced.
Behind the scenes, his aides say, Azar had alerted the White House in early January, and then later that month spoke directly to the president. It is unclear exactly what Azar told the president, because transcripts are not available.
“There’s a lot of CYA going on,” said one senior administration official, who said Azar never spelled out that stockpiles of protective equipment might be inadequate or the tests were not working. “We were told the test was ready. That turned out to be flat-out wrong.”
Trump denied Azar sent out alarms. “@SecAzar told me nothing until later,” he tweeted earlier this month.
Meanwhile, Azar continued to say “the immediate risk” to Americans was low and that travel restrictions had worked. “So I think so far, our measures have been quite effective,” he told NPR on February 14.
Others were raising alarms. “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen any more, but rather more of a question of exactly when this will happen,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a February 25 news briefing.
MORE GLITCHES
Responding to Congressional concerns, Azar said HHS had launched a coronavirus surveillance system in five cities. The plan was to test patients who showed up with flu symptoms, to see if they actually were infected with the novel coronavirus.
But the system was either delayed or not implemented in the cities and now is seen by epidemiologists as irrelevant given the massive community spread and continued inadequate testing.
By the end of February, Azar sought more money to attack the crisis as he testified before Congress. “This is an unprecedented potentially severe health challenge globally, and will require additional measures,” he said.
Still, he assured senators his agency was in control. “We have enacted the most aggressive containment measures in the history of our country,” he said.
He again provided words of calm, appearing on Fox News. “But thanks to President Trump's historically aggressive containment efforts, we've actually contained the spread of this virus here in the United States at this point,” he said February 25. “I think part of the message to the American people is we all need to take a bit of deep breath here.”
“The government is working on this. You've got the right people on this.”
By the end of February, Azar and Harrison were no longer running the White House task force. That month, Vice President Pence took control. The FDA and Hahn are now actively involved. A Pence spokesperson said the issue of precluding the FDA from the task force “pre-dates the VP’s leadership” and declined further comment.
Azar seemed caught off guard by the change. “I’m still chairman of the task force,” he told the press after Pence took over.
Given Azar’s early struggles, the White House should have taken a stronger role over the task force from the outset, said Ashish Jha, director of Harvard University’s Global Health Institute. “It was very clear that Azar wasn’t able to marshal the forces across the government like he needed to,” he said.
Jeffrey Flier, a former Harvard Medical School dean, said the HHS role remains as vital as ever. As of Wednesday, over 47,000 Americans have died of COVID-19, and more than 830,000 have been infected.

“Clearly there was a need for better coordination of the FDA and CDC and other agencies,” he said. “HHS has to be operating effectively in a crisis like this.”

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Spooked by a sharp increase in coronavirus cases in the navy, Taiwan is debating whether to consider a broad lockdown, even with only some 200 active infections and weeks after far more seriously affected countries shuttered their cities.
Taiwan's early prevention and detection efforts have so far made it a model for how to contain the outbreak, with 426 confirmed cases to date, of which 236 have recovered. Six people have died.
But 28 new infections on a Taiwanese navy ship that was part of a friendly mission to the Pacific island state of Palau last month have caused unease, affecting a previous sense of general safety.
Although life in Taiwan has largely continued as normal while the pandemic has swept across the world, the prospect of parts of the island shutting down has jumped up the political agenda.
Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, a medical doctor, told reporters on Wednesday that next week officials would hold a ""tabletop exercise"" to simulate how to close down the capital, though he gave no details. 
""Shutting down a city is not a feel-good move,"" Ko said, adding that it would be extra difficult in Taipei, home to parliament and other central government offices. 
The mayor of the southern city of Tainan, Huang Wei-che, said this week he would also consider a lockdown if the navy cluster spread into the community, and may cancel next week's Labour Day long weekend to ensure large numbers of people don't gather, creating a risk of infection.
New Taipei city, which surrounds the capital, has already held a lockdown drill, and the major port city of Kaohsiung is planning one in coming days.
The central government, however, says lockdowns are not being seriously considered for now, even as city governments raise the possibility.
Although Taiwan has reported a handful of cases where the source of infection is unclear, it has no widespread community transmission, and the majority of cases are termed ""imported"", having been brought to the island from people infected overseas. 
Taiwan does not carry out mass coronavirus testing, saying it has no need because its rates of infection are so low and it can trace the contacts of those who are infected.
Last week, Taiwan reported three days with no new cases.
""Considering the global and domestic disease situation, and the control over emergency situations, it is not the time to implement a lockdown for Taiwan,"" Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters this week. ""Everyone should be cautious, but we are very far from having a lockdown.""
Late Wednesday, vice-president elect William Lai, who was a physician before entering politics, appealed on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page for calm, pointing out that lockdowns were for when there was a massive rise in cases that may overwhelm the health system.
Infection control for the navy is well in hand, he said, adding: ""Please don't be alarmed"". 
Taiwan's military has apologised for the infections and is investigating what happened.

About 700 sailors have been quarantined and tested, and the government has sent 200,000 text alerts to the phones of people who might have been in contact with them.

1314,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 06:41PM ET</span>",Canada police accused of poor communication during Nova Scotia mass shooting,"By Tim Krochak
SHUBENACADIE, Nova Scotia (Reuters) - Canadian police faced mounting criticism on Wednesday for using social media and not a provincial emergency alert system to notify the public that a gunman was at large for some 13 hours after he murdered the first of his 22 victims over the weekend.
During the worst mass shooting in the country's history, the Nova Scotia provincial detachment of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) sent a series of tweets to about 90,000 followers warning that there was an active shooter in the area.
But some of the families and friends of the victims said a provincial warning system, which would have sent out text, radio and TV warnings, might have saved the lives of their loved ones. 
""I don't use Twitter, and I don't know anyone that does use Twitter,"" Nick Beaton said in an interview broadcast by CTV News. Beaton's wife, Kristen, a nurse and mother from Debert, was shot dead on Sunday while on her way to work.
Beaton said he would have never let his wife leave the house that morning had he known the gunman was still at large.
Nova Scotia RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather defended the use of social media on Wednesday, saying he was ""very satisfied"" with the messaging, which he said the media helped spread, and that the ""communications being provided were the best and clearest information that could be provided.""
Police were in the process of preparing to use the emergency alert system when the gunman was shot and killed by police, Leather said.
The shooter, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, began the rampage on Saturday night which continued in several small Nova Scotian towns and ended around noon on Sunday.
Wortman's motive remains unknown. Police have said some of his victims were known to him, but others appear to have been chosen randomly.
Police are still piecing together the timeline of events, Leather said, adding more details could come on Thursday. Wortman did not possess a firearms license in Canada, he said.
Police set up two barriers around the initial crime scene in Portapique on Saturday night, but they did not realize until between 7 and 8 o'clock the next morning that the shooter had disguised himself as an RCMP officer and was driving a vehicle resembling a police car.
There are 22 confirmed victims, but police have cautioned they are still investigating crime scenes, including more than five homes Wortman burned to the ground.
Meghan Nearing, a resident of the area where many of Wortman's victims lived, was home with her son on Saturday night and heard about the shootings, but did not know the gunman was still active when she woke up the next morning.
""There was nothing, no alert, so I thought everything was OK,"" she told Reuters, speaking not far from where RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson was shot and killed by Wortman on Sunday.

""Little did I know he was in my town when I was thinking that.""

The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday that he hoped the Trump administration would reconsider its suspension of funding, but that his main focus was on ending the pandemic and saving lives.
There were ""worrying upward trends"" in early epidemics in parts of Africa and central and South America, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.
""Most countries are still in the early stages of their epidemics and some that were affected early in the pandemic are starting to see a resurgence in cases,"" Tedros told Geneva journalists in a virtual briefing. 
""Make no mistake we have a long way to go. This virus will be with us for a long time,"" he said, while noting that epidemics in Western Europe appear to be stabilising or declining.
U.S. President Donald Trump last week criticised the WHO's handling of the pandemic and announced he was suspending funding to the U.N. agency. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday said the United States strongly believes that China's ruling Communist party failed to report the outbreak of the new coronavirus in a timely manner to the WHO.
""I hope the freezing of the funding will be reconsidered and the U.S. will once again support WHO's work and continue to save lives,"" Tedros said. ""I hope the U.S. believes that this an important investment, not just to help others but for the U.S. to stay safe also.""
The WHO's top emergencies expert Dr. Mike Ryan warned against opening up global travel too quickly, saying it would require ""careful risk management"".
He noted surges in infections in Africa such as a nearly 300 percent increase in cases in Somalia in the past week. ""We are at the beginning in Africa,"" Ryan said.
The WHO officials urged countries to continue investing in preparedness, saying that only 76 percent had surveillance systems to detect cases.
""There are still many gaps in the world's defences and no single country has everything in place,"" said Tedros.

Amid criticism that it should have acted earlier, Tedros defended the WHO's decision to declare an international emergency only on Jan. 30 - its highest level of alert.
""Looking back I think we declared the emergency at the right time and when the world had enough time to respond,"" said Tedros, adding that on that date there were only 82 COVID-19 cases outside of China and no deaths at the time.
Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, said that the world would need to learn to live with the new COVID-19 disease. ""This is not a discrete one-off episode. My belief is that this is now an endemic human infection...We’re going to have to find ways to deal with that,"" he told an online media briefing.

The scientist died in March 2018 at age 76 after a lifetime spent probing the origins of the universe. He was diagnosed with a rare early-onset form of motor neurone disease at the age of 21.
""Professor Stephen Hawking's family has donated his ventilator to Royal Papworth Hospital as we care for increasing numbers of COVID-19 patients,"" the hospital said on Wednesday.
His daughter Lucy Hawking described the care her father had received there as ""brilliant, dedicated and compassionate"", it said.
""We'd like to say a huge thank you to the Hawking family for supporting us at this challenging time,"" said the hospital, which is a world-leading center for heart and lung transplants.
The medical equipment was bought by Hawking himself, the BBC reported, and after checks had been added to the hospital's fleet.
Facing a potential shortage of ventilators to treat COVID-19 patients in Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson in March called on industry to help produce thousands of the devices.

The first of the new devices have been produced and numbers have also been boosted by imports, helping the state-run health service to treat all patients requiring ventilation during the pandemic.

KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Leading Pakistani doctors on Wednesday urged the government and clerics to reverse a decision to allow prayer congregations at mosques during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, warning that the spread of coronavirus could spiral out of control. 
Pakistan on Saturday lifted precautionary restrictions on congregational prayers. The decision came three days after clerics said such limitations were not acceptable and after several incidents of clashes between police and worshippers.
Congregations increase in size during Ramadan, which is expected to begin on Friday in Pakistan.
""Unfortunately, our rulers have made a wrong decision; our clerics have shown a non-serious attitude,"" Dr Qaiser Sajjad, secretary-general of the Pakistan Medical Association, told a news conference hastily convened by the doctors.
Pakistan, the world's second most populous Muslim country after Indonesia, has reported more than 10,000 cases of the coronavirus, including 212 deaths. Both the government and experts say the peak for infections is expected to hit in May.
Last week, Pakistan extended a nationwide lockdown for two weeks, but eased restrictions on some activities, including key industrial production and mosques.
The doctors said a 20-point standard operating procedure for mosques agreed between the government and religious leaders was not practical or implementable
Another doctor at the news conference, Dr Saad Niaz, said coronavirus facilities in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city, had already reached maximum capacity.
At this rate, Niaz added, medical facilities will face great difficulties in coming days and patients will have to be denied admission because there will be no beds.
In a statement distributed at the news conference, doctors called for strict enforcement of lockdowns, urging businesses to bear with the hardships for a few more weeks until the virus can be brought under control.

Prime Minister Imran Khan underwent a test for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, on Wednesday after meeting an infected social worker last week. The result is not yet known.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps said on Wednesday it had successfully launched the country's first military satellite into orbit, at a time of heightened tensions with the United States over Tehran's nuclear and missile programmes.
U.S. officials have said they fear long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used to launch nuclear warheads and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Tehran must be held accountable for the launch. 
Iran denies U.S. assertions that such activity is a cover for ballistic missile development and says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.
""Iran's first military satellite, Noor, was launched this morning from the central desert of Iran. The launch was successful and the satellite reached orbit,"" state TV said.
The satellite, whose name Noor means ""Light"", was orbiting 425 km (264 miles) above the earth's surface, they said in a statement on their website. 
The force said it used the Qased, or ""Messenger"", satellite carrier to launch Noor, without giving details of the technology. 
""The three-stage Qased satellite launcher uses a combination of solid and liquid fuels,"" it said.
TV footage showed the satellite carrier was inscribed with a verse of the Koran that Muslims often recite when travelling: ""Glory to Him who has subjected this to us, as we could never have done it by our own efforts"".
Regional tensions have been high since the start of the year.
In the latest sabre-rattling, U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had instructed the U.S. Navy to fire on Iranian ships if harassed, a week after the United States said 11 vessels from the Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) came dangerously close to U.S. vessels in the Gulf.
""I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,"" Trump wrote in a tweet, hours after Tehran's announcement of the satellite launch.
Iran immediately reacted by saying that The United States should focus on saving its military from the coronavirus disease ""instead of bullying others"". 
In early January, top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad. Iran retaliated on Jan. 9 by firing missiles at bases in Iraq where U.S. troops were stationed. 
NUCLEAR DEAL
Trump administration reimposed sanctions on Iran following Washington's 2018 withdrawal from a 2015 international accord designed to put curbs on Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for Tehran halting its sensitive nuclear work.
Trump said the nuclear deal did not go far enough and also did not include restrictions on Iran's ballistic missile programme and support for its proxies in the Middle East.
Israel, which Tehran refuses to recognise, called on the international community to condemn Iran's satellite launch. 
""Israel calls upon the international community ... to impose further sanctions on the Iranian regime. All in order to deter it from continuing such dangerous and opposing activity,"" Israel's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
Despite the launch, analysts said Tehran and Washington would not seek a conventional war. 
""This is psychological warfare to send a message and tell the adversary that 'we are ready to stop any offensive',"" Hisham Jaber, a retired Lebanese army brigadier general and analyst, told Reuters.
""Iran is using this policy as a deterrence. But the result: No effect on the ground. No dramatic effect... Nobody is ready to handle any consequences of war, not America, not Iran or anyone.""
The United States argues that such launches by Iran breach United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231, which calls upon Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. 
The resolution, which endorsed the nuclear pact between Iran and six major powers, stops short of explicitly barring such activity. Iran says its space programme is peaceful. 

Iran's Guards, which report to the country's top authority Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, have repeatedly warned that U.S. regional bases and its aircraft carriers in the Gulf are within the range of Iranian missiles.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had instructed the U.S. Navy to fire on any Iranian ships that harass it at sea, a week after 11 vessels from Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Navy (IRGCN) came dangerously close to American ships in the Gulf.
Close interactions with Iranian military vessels were not uncommon in 2016 and 2017. On several occasions, U.S. Navy ships fired warning shots at Iranian vessels when they got too close.
""I have instructed the United States Navy to shoot down and destroy any and all Iranian gunboats if they harass our ships at sea,"" Trump wrote in a tweet, hours after Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps said it had launched the country's first military satellite into orbit.
The United States should focus on saving its military from the coronavirus, an Iranian armed forces spokesman said after Trump's comments.
While the Navy has the authority to act in self-defense, Trump's comments appeared to go further and are likely to stoke tensions between Iran and the United States.
Senior Pentagon officials said that Trump's comments on Iran were meant as a warning to Tehran, but suggested that the U.S. military would continue to abide by their existing right to self-defense instead of any changes to their rules.
""The president issued an important warning to the Iranians, what he was emphasizing is all of our ships retain the right of self-defense,"" Deputy Secretary of Defense David Norquist told reporters at the Pentagon.
Earlier this month, the U.S. military said 11 vessels from the IRGCN came close to U.S. Navy and Coast Guard ships in the Gulf, calling the moves ""dangerous and provocative.""
At one point, the Iranian vessels came within 10 yards (9 meters) of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Maui.
While such interactions at sea had occurred occasionally a few years ago, they had stopped recently.
Tensions between Iran and the United States increased earlier this year after the United States killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran’s elite Quds Force, in a drone strike in Iraq.
Iran retaliated on Jan. 8 with a rocket attack on Iraq’s Ain al-Asad base where U.S. forces were stationed. No U.S. troops were killed or faced immediate bodily injury, but more than 100 were later diagnosed with traumatic brain injury.

Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps said on Wednesday it had successfully launched the country's first military satellite into orbit.

The insurgent group had also attacked several checkpoints in the northern province of Sar-e-Pul, provincial governor spokesman Zabihullah Amani said, killing 11 Afghan security force members, wounding 19 and resulting in one being captured by the Taliban.
Attacks are threatening to derail a fragile peace process, with the Taliban rejecting the Afghan government’s repeated calls for a ceasefire as the country also attempts to deal with the growing outbreak of coronavirus and prisoner exchanges take place with an eye to formal peace talks.
After a week-long reduction in violence leading up to the signing of a troop withdrawal agreement with the United States in February, the militant group resumed attacks on Afghan forces, though has held back on attacking foreign forces. 
The United States and other foreign powers have called for the Taliban to reduce its attacks, with the commander of U.S. forces this month meeting the Taliban leadership at their political capital in Qatar over the issue.
The Ministry of Interior said in a tweet that a clearance operation in Logar had resulted in 20 Taliban fighters being killed. 
In southern Kandahar province, clashes in three districts killed four Afghan security force members and 31 Taliban fighters, according to a provincial police statement.

1325,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 11:16AM ET</span>","Alarmed as COVID patients' blood thickened, New York doctors try new treatments","By Jonathan Allen
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As the novel coronavirus spread through New York City in late March, doctors at Mount Sinai Hospital noticed something strange happening to patients' blood. 
Signs of blood thickening and clotting were being detected in different organs by doctors from different specialties. This would turn out to be one of the alarming ways the virus ravages the body, as doctors there and elsewhere were starting to realize.
At Mount Sinai, nephrologists noticed kidney dialysis catheters getting plugged with clots. Pulmonologists monitoring COVID-19 patients on mechanical ventilators could see portions of lungs were oddly bloodless. Neurosurgeons confronted a surge in their usual caseload of strokes due to blood clots, the age of victims skewing younger, with at least half testing positive for the virus. 
""It's very striking how much this disease causes clots to form,"" Dr. J Mocco, a Mount Sinai neurosurgeon, said in an interview, describing how some doctors think COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, is more than a lung disease. In some cases, Mocco said, a stroke was a young patient's first symptom of COVID-19. 
As colleagues from various specialties pooled their observations, they developed a new treatment protocol. Patients now receive high doses of a blood-thinning drug even before any evidence of clotting appears. 
""Maybe, just maybe, if you prevent the clotting, you can make the disease less severe,"" said Dr. David Reich, the hospital president. The new protocol will not be used on certain high-risk patients because blood thinners can lead to bleeding in the brain and other organs.
""FUNNY YOU MENTIONED THAT""
In the three weeks beginning mid-March, Mocco saw 32 stroke patients with large blood blockages in the brain, double the usual number for that period.
Five were unusually young, under age 49, with no obvious risk factors for strokes, ""which is crazy,"" he said. ""Very, very atypical."" The youngest was only 31.
At least half of the 32 patients would test positive for COVID-19, Mocco said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Hooman Poor, a Mount Sinai lung specialist, found himself working a late shift with 14 patients on ventilators. The ventilator readings were not what he expected. 
The lungs did not seem stiff, as is common in pneumonia. Instead, it seemed blood was not circulating freely through the lungs to be aerated with each breath.
Poor ran into a kidney doctor that night, who remarked that dialysis catheters were often getting blocked with clots. 
""And I said, 'It's funny that you mentioned that because I feel like all these patients have blood clots in their lungs,'"" Poor recalled. 
Reich, the hospital president, told Poor about the surge in strokes seen by Mocco and said the two doctors should team up, setting off days of discussions and meetings with the hospital's department heads.
At 2:46 a.m. on Easter Sunday, Poor sent Mocco his first draft of what would become the new treatment protocol. 
DOCTORS SHARE FINDINGS  
As their wards began to overflow with COVID-19 patients, the Mount Sinai doctors read papers describing similar findings from doctors in China's Hubei province and other hard-hit areas, and discussed them with their peers in phone calls and webinars.
Mocco called neurosurgeons he knows elsewhere in the country. At Philadelphia's Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, Dr. Pascal Jabbour had begun to see a similar surge in strokes among people with COVID-19. The way his patients' blood congealed reminded him of congenital conditions such as lupus, or certain cancers.
""I've never seen any other viruses causing that,"" Jabbour said.
In Boston, the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center began a clinical trial earlier this month to see if tPA, an anti-clotting drug, could help severely sick COVID-19 patients.
Clotting can develop in anyone who gets very sick and spends long periods of time immobile on a ventilator, but doctors say the problem seemed to show up sooner in COVID-19 patients as a more direct consequence of the virus.
At Mount Sinai, patients in intensive care often receive the blood-thinning agent heparin in weaker prophylactic doses. Under the new protocol, higher doses of heparin normally used to dissolve clots will be given to patients before any clots are detected. 
The treatment joins a growing toolbox at the hospital, where some patients are receiving the antibody-rich plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients or experimental antiviral drugs.
The American Society of Hematology, which has also noted the clotting, says in its guidance to physicians that the benefits of the blood-thinning therapy for COVID-19 patients not already showing signs of clotting are ""currently unknown."" 

""I certainly wouldn't expect harps to play and angels to sing and people to just rip out their intravenous lines and waltz out of the hospital,"" said Reich. ""It's likely going to be something where it just moderates the extent of the disease.""

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 10:09AM ET</span>",Russian communists defy lockdown with Red Square parade for Lenin's 150th,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Dozens of Russian communists defied Moscow's coronavirus lockdown on Wednesday by marching across Red Square (NYSE:SQ) to lay flowers outside Vladimir Lenin's tomb to mark 150 years since the birth of the Bolshevik leader. 
Led by Gennady Zyuganov, head of Russia's Communist Party, a small group of people, some holding red flags, marched to the granite mausoleum where Lenin's embalmed body lies to pay their respects. 
The ritual, which is observed annually on April 22, comes with Moscow in its fourth week of a lockdown aimed at slowing the spread of the new virus. 
Muscovites are only allowed outside to buy food or medicine nearby, receive urgent medical treatment, walk the dog or take out the trash.
A policeman guarding Red Square, which has been closed off to the public and was otherwise empty as it snowed on Wednesday, told Reuters the communists had received special permission to stage the event. 
The Moscow police and the mayor's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Speaking to reporters on Red Square, Zyuganov said the Russian authorities' efforts to contain the virus were no match for the Soviet approach to fighting a smallpox outbreak in Moscow in 1960.
""Now they can't even produce masks in three months,"" he said, referring to the current Russian authorities. 
Some Russian regions have experienced shortages of protective gear for medical workers but the country has still exported equipment to countries including the United States, Italy and Serbia. 
Moscow, a city of more than 12.5 million, has been the hardest-hit of Russia's regions by the coronavirus outbreak and on Wednesday recorded 2,548 new cases, pushing the nationwide tally to almost 58,000.
Similar events were held across the country to honour Lenin. 
The initiatives, however, have drawn criticism from people who say the communist events violate lockdowns. 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the outspoken head of Russia's nationalist Liberal Democratic Party, has said the people laying flowers on Lenin's tomb during lockdown should be arrested.
Russia abandoned communism when the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, but the tomb remains a popular attraction among tourists and Russian communists.
Authorities shuttered the tomb and other attractions last month in a bid to stem the spread of the coronavirus. 

Lenin died of a stroke in 1924 and is said to have wanted to be buried alongside his mother in St. Petersburg. Attempts over the years to have his body transferred there have been thwarted by warnings that such a move could split society.

1327,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",First Syria torture trial opens in Germany on Thursday,"By Joseph Nasr
BERLIN (Reuters) - The first trial of suspected members of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's security services for crimes against humanity, including torture and sexual assault, starts in Germany on Thursday.
Campaigners have hailed the process as a first step towards justice for thousands of Syrians who say they were tortured in government facilities after attempts to establish an international tribunal for Syria failed. 
""Arbitrary arrests and torture are the main weapon used by the Assad regime to spread fear among Syrians and suppress their demands for democracy and justice,"" said human rights lawyer Anwar al-Bunni, who says he was held at a jail near Damascus by the main suspect to be tried in the German city of Koblenz.
""This trial will break the immunity of the criminals in Syria, from the head of the regime all the way down.""
Syria's government has regularly rejected reports of torture and extrajudicial killings in a civil war in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed. Assad himself has in the past denied such accusations against the security apparatus.
Neither Syrian state media nor Syrian officials have made mention of the trial in Koblenz.
Lawyers for the two suspects have not said how they will plead. Under German law a suspect can only enter a plea once the trial has started.
""We do not wish to make any public statement about our defence strategy,"" said Michael Boecker, a lawyer for the main suspect, identified only as Anwar R under German privacy laws.
INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNAL BLOCKED
German prosecutors have used universal jurisdiction laws that allow them to prosecute crimes against humanity committed anywhere in the world to bring the trial. 
They say Anwar R. is a former intelligence officer charged with 58 murders in a Damascus prison where they say at least 4,000 opposition activists were tortured in 2011 and 2012.
Prosecutors say he oversaw interrogations before leaving Syria in 2012. He arrived in Germany in 2014.
The second suspect, Eyad A., 43, is charged with facilitating the torture of at least 30 opposition activists arrested after an anti-Assad demonstration in 2011. He arrived in Germany in April 2018.
Attempts by Western powers to set up an international tribunal for Syria have been blocked by Russia and China at the U.N. Security Council. Syria is also not a signatory to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in The Hague.
Campaigners and survivors hope the trial in Koblenz will open the door for similar processes in other European countries such as Norway, which have similar universal jurisdiction laws and where former Syrian security members are believed to live.
""Syria is probably the most unfair country in the world,"" said Hamoudi Shoaib, 37, who says he was tortured in a government prison in the northern town of Deir Al-Zor in 2011 and fled to Germany six years ago.

""So to me, just the fact those people are having a fair trial in a respectable court feels like a revelation,"" he said. ""I don't have a grain of revenge in me. I just want justice.""

1328,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Libya's GNA focused on Tripoli battle: interior minister,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Libya's internationally recognised government is focused on trying to push its enemies out of artillery range of Tripoli after making advances in the main western battle fronts last week, the interior minister said.
Driving the forces of commander Khalifa Haftar out of the town of Tarhouna, southeast of the capital, could end the country's civil war, Fathi Bashagha told Reuters by phone.
But this would be ""the most difficult military option"" at this moment in the Government of National Accord's (GNA) fight against eastern-based Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), Bashagha said.
""All our focus is on how to protect Tripoli and the people of Tripoli and keep the artillery bombardment away from them,"" he said.
Tarhouna, surrounded by hills, has been the LNA's main strategic centre in the west, providing local manpower for a campaign that has leaned heavily on air support supplied by the United Arab Emirates and Russian military contractors.
Pro-GNA forces made advances last week in the main fronts in western Libya, taking back territory along the coast and then pushing towards the LNA's main support base at Tarhouna, 65 km (45 miles) from the capital.
It marked a possible turning point in the year-long war between the GNA and the LNA, which launched an offensive in April 2019 to capture Tripoli and has been bombarding the capital for weeks. 
LNA forces already control eastern Libya, where a rival administration to the GNA rules in Benghazi, and much of the country's south. However, Libya's main institutions, including the oil company and central bank, are based in Tripoli. 
The GNA's overall strategy is to regain control over western Libya, Bashagha said. He added that no military solution to the conflict was possible, but it was also not possible to negotiate with Haftar. 
""As for Tarhouna, this is the most difficult military option to storm because it is the first focal and rallying point (for the LNA). By entering Tarhouna, we believe that the war would end because no other city (in western Libya) is considered a gathering point for Haftar's forces,"" Bashagha said. 
Diplomatic peacemaking efforts have run aground and the United Nations special envoy resigned in March citing ill health. 
Turkish military support for the GNA this year, particularly with air defences and drones, was crucial in its latest advances. 
The United Nations Libya mission said on Tuesday that at least 3,100 people had been displaced from their homes in Tarhouna and the nearby GNA-held town of Qarabouli, this week as the fighting escalated. 

Eye witnesses in another west LNA-held Libya town, Qasr bin Ghashir, said shelling had killed eight people there.

Poland this week started to ease some of the restrictions it launched to stop the spread of the new coronavirus, saying it needs to put its economy back on a growth track. Before the pandemic, Poland's economic growth was one of the fastest in Europe, at 4.1% in 2019.
Poland, whose coal mining industry employs 83,000 people, is the only EU member not to have pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, arguing it needs more time to replace its coal-fuelled power plants with cleaner ones. It has also been criticised by the EU for other environmental issues, including increased logging in ancient forest and bad water management.
""A focus on GDP growth and relentless overconsumption only worsens our situation - it is like pressing down the gas pedal in a car that is approaching a concrete wall,"" Greenpeace said on Wednesday, marked as Earth Day around the world.
Greenpeace activists on Wednesday morning put a giant banner in front of a government building saying ""Return to normal=crisis"", explaining that reverting to policies from before the pandemic would lead to a deeper climate crisis. 
Pawel Szypulski, a director at Greenpeace, added that Poland should adopt schemes such as New Zealand's wellbeing budget, introduced in 2019, which prioritises mental health and alleviating child poverty or Amsterdam's ""doughnut"" model, introduced since the pandemic that focuses on social and ecological goals for better living. 
Greenpeace said Poland should phase out coal by 2030 and become climate neutral by 2040, and should classify as protected up to 30% of the country's surface area and optimise its water resources.
The environmentalists also urged Poland to stop industrial farming by 2030. Warsaw should uphold democracy and social justice, and provide high-quality healthcare and education, Greenpeace added.
The government's spokesman was not immediately available to comment on Greenpeace's statement. 
To mark Earth Day, Poland's President Andrzej Duda encouraged Poles to plant new trees and clean forests ""especially today, a day which connects us so strongly with protecting all that is important from the point of view of sustainable development"".
Greenpeace's appeal comes days after activists with Fridays for Future Poland criticised a film for school children made available on the Education Ministry website, which offered pros and cons of global warming, including the assertion that global warming would cut household heating bills. 

The film has now been removed.

1333,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 07:38AM ET</span>",Special Report: A night on the New York subway - Homeless find shelter underground during pandemic,"By Maurice Tamman
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The lights still scream for attention, but on this night Times Square (NYSE:SQ) has the feel of an abandoned Hollywood film set. Gone are the hordes of tourists shooting selfies with Elmo and Wonder Woman. Instead, a lone SUV glides by and a passenger's phone glows as she records the scene from the safety of the car.
The unease grows on the descent into the Times Square subway station. Tutting commuters don't barge past dawdling visitors. The full-time panhandlers have withdrawn. There is no music; the buskers are home, following orders to shelter in place.
On a normal night, in a normal time, you might not notice the gaunt man on the platform, his jeans held up by a cinched belt. But on this night, you notice that his face is uncovered.
""I am so hungry,"" he says. ""Do you got some change?""
As a pandemic races through New York, killing some 14,000 people in the city alone, all the frantic layers of everyday life are pulled away. The homeless – always there, but usually invisible – are now in sharp relief.
Many are spending their nights on the ghost trains and platforms of the New York subway system, finding shelter in a place abandoned by almost everyone else in a shut-down city.
Reuters photographer Lucas Jackson and I decided to spend several hours looping around the subway late one night last week talking to those who have nowhere else to go. We wanted to know how they were coping with the risk of catching the novel coronavirus – and why some of them feel safer there than in the city's crowded shelter system.
We begin the journey around 10 p.m. on the platform for the uptown 1, 2 and 3 train at the Times Square station. At the north end, two police officers wearing loose-fitting surgical masks offer a hello before heading up the stairs.
A dozen steps behind the lawmen, the gaunt man waits for them to leave before approaching anyone arriving on the platform. A little farther down, a few people wait for the next train wearing masks to protect against the virus.
Moments later, a 1 train arrives. As we ride up to 137th Street in Harlem on a nearly empty train, only a few of the passengers seem like they have no destination. The rest sit several seats apart; above their masks, their eyes track anyone moving around the car, especially those whose faces are bare.
But as the hour grows later, the masked commuters ebb away, and the hard curved plastic of the subway seats become a bed for those without them, for a little while, at least.
""NO PLACE TO GO""
New York state and city officials have ordered anyone who doesn't have an ""essential job"" to stay home. And people have. Subway ridership is down 93% since the pandemic hit, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
""The last couple of days, I'd say at least a third, if not half, of the folks who have been on the train car with me appeared to have no place else to go,"" says Sarah Feinberg, interim MTA head of the city's buses and subways. ""I think it's even starker overnight.""
Feinberg says MTA police and city police are supposed to stop people from spreading out in cars or sleeping, but she admits that enforcement is weak. What they have tried to do, in a program that started last summer, is to try and connect homeless riders with services that might help, though only a fraction have taken up the offer.
She says the city's leadership has put the MTA in a difficult position because it hasn't sufficiently protected the homeless in shelters from the coronavirus and that, as a result, some feel safer in the subway.
""The place for them to go to is not adequate,"" MTA security chief Patrick T. Warren says of the city's shelters.
The mayor's office didn't provide answers to several requests for a response to the MTA officials' comments or conditions inside city shelters.
As of Monday, 43 people from the city-run shelter system had died of COVID-19, according to the city's Department of Social Services. The agency said 617 shelter residents and other homeless people – including a handful living on the streets – had tested positive for the virus so far.
According to New York's Coalition for the Homeless, an advocacy group, about 62,000 people were living in city-run shelters in January, 60% more than 10 years ago.
Thousands more are living on the streets and the subways, says the group's policy director, Giselle Routhier. She says the city hasn't done enough. Her organization wants the city to pay for housing the homeless in some of the thousands of empty hotel rooms in the city.
On April 11, Mayor Bill de Blasio said 6,000 hotel beds would be available for single shelter residents by this week. Of those beds, 3,500 homeless were already in hotels when the disease struck, and since the outbreak, 1,000 shelter residents have been moved into hotels, including about 500 residents sick with the disease, DSS spokesman Isaac McGinn said in an email.
He said plans are ""underway"" to move an additional 1,500 elderly and single shelter residents into hotels.
In a statement, the agency said: ""As we continue to fight back against this unprecedented threat, every life saved gives us hope, strength and renewed resilience.""
""I WISH I HAD A MASK TOO""
The 1 train pulls into the 18th Street station, where a small community of homeless men have set up camp, their clothes and luggage piled on one side of a worn wooden bench in the middle of the platform. Two seats on the bench serve as a makeshift dining table holding two clear plastic containers of sushi, an untouched apple atop one, a browning core on the other.
One of the men jumps for a hidden electrical outlet at the top of an I-beam pillar they're using to charge their phones. It takes him three jumps to reach it.
Farther up the platform, a man sits in an old office chair stirring a blue powdery liquid in a one-liter soda bottle with the top cut off. He says it's bleach. He doesn't have time to talk about the coronavirus. ""I am busy,"" he says. ""I am not homeless. I am working.""
He nods toward a slender man with a swollen nose near the exit. ""Talk to him; he'll talk to you.""
The man, Michael, says someone jumped him the other day and broke his nose. Now he can't breathe through it. ""I can't sleep breathing through my mouth,"" he says.
As he speaks, a recorded subway announcement booms off the tiled walls: ""MAINTAIN A SAFE SOCIAL DISTANCE.""
Michael raises his voice and stares at my blue mask, the one Reuters mandates that we wear while working outside.
""I wish I had a mask too,"" he says, leaning in. I wonder if his burning eyes mean he is feverish.
""Maybe I should go to the emergency room,"" he says. ""Maybe they have a mask.""
""IF YOU ARE NOT AN ESSENTIAL WORKER, STAY HOME.""
Michael says he's not sure where he'll spend the night, although at well after 11 p.m., he doesn't have many options other than to sleep here, on the street, or in a subway car.
""I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE SICKNESS""
On the northbound platform of the 6th Avenue line at the Rockefeller Center station, a man sits next to a shopping cart filled with plastic bottles and containers, a couple of mats and other detritus picked up along the way as he navigates life on the streets.
He's trying to stay awake, and his head bobs up and down until I approach. He looks up gravely, suspiciously.
""Well, at this moment, yeah, I'm concerned about the sickness,"" he says. ""But you know what? I try my best to protect myself from this coronavirus.
""I got a nice jacket, and I have here this corona mask.""
He pulls a red-white-and-black scarf from around his neck and over his chin.
""So this way, you know that you won't catch it. A lot of people are dying in the shelter, and that tells you the shelter is bad.""
Eventually, he says his name is Sylver, with a ""Y."" He's in his 50s, an immigrant from Nigeria, a member of the Ibo tribe. He's lived on the streets for 12 years.
I tell him we share a history in Nigeria, where I lived for six years as a boy, and his suspicion disappears.
""So you understand me, you understand Nigeria,"" he says, and smiles broadly.
His job, he says, is collecting discarded treasures. But it is late; he's tired. And he can't decide if he should sleep here, on the bench, or rest his head in a subway car.
""I hope I won't be sick,"" he adds, tugging on his scarf. ""But I've got this mask. Sometimes I put it on. I don't put it on all the time, because you know, that's the chance we take in life.""
A few days before this, I met up near Grant's Tomb with Father Clyde Kuemmerle, who has been ministering to the homeless on and off for decades. He said many shelter residents are scared of being infected, and some have moved out, believing they're safer on the streets or in the subway system.
""I think that for the most part, the people who were outside have stayed outside,"" he said. ""And some people who were inside have chosen to go outside. And the reason is, 'I do not want to live in a petri dish.'""
One of his homeless parishioners, a man named Ajay, said life was tense in the shelters but he preferred it to life on the streets despite sleeping within a three-foot radius of several other men.
""You're sleeping there, I'm sleeping here,"" he said, while approximating about three feet with his hands. ""And then you just happened [to cough] on top of me, what can I do? I just turn around, just turn my face.""
Ajay said he keeps to himself but that when someone in the room coughs, everyone wants to know who it was. ""And that's where the aggression comes in,"" he says.
""They are always aggressive in there. It's the only way to survive in the shelter. But the thing is, now, everybody's an expert on how you get corona.""
And that might lead to an argument over how you get infected or the latest conspiracy theory to explain what's behind the disease.
""I'm telling you I'm right. You're telling me you're right.""
And before long the room is full of screaming men, he said.
""WHAT CAN I DO?""
Riding south on the 1 train through Lower Manhattan, Luis sifts through two plastic garbage bags, one gray, one blue. He removes a pair of underwear, some socks and a T-shirt and places them on the two seats to his right.
Luis, 46, says he recently became homeless after losing his job at a restaurant on 113th Street. Since then, he's slept on the subway and the streets. He's not sure if the coronavirus is a real threat to his health.
""I don't think it's dangerous, so what can I do?"" he says, talking even as the screeching of the train drowns out his words.
""It's not right,"" he says as the train pauses at a station. ""A lot of restaurants is closed. I don't know what happened, no money, no nothing, that's it. Everyone at the restaurant is home.""
He speaks passable English but doesn't understand how to get help. He asks about a nearby shelter but says he's heard they're not safe.
He doesn't have a phone, so I find a nearby homeless assistance organization for him to visit and write the address on a piece of paper.
He folds it into a small square and tucks it in his top pocket and then shoves his clothes back into his plastic bags. He wants to go home and live with his mother in Mexico City, but he has no money.
""Maybe in December I go,"" he says, wistfully. ""Maybe.""
SHOOTING UP ON THE R TRAIN
As one day moves into the next, the trains have more and more the feel of a no-man's land. Dried deltas of urine crisscross the floors. Piles of empty bottles and paper bags collect in the corners. Graffiti tags have started to appear in the cars, which hasn't been a problem for decades.
Near the front of a Manhattan-bound R train, a man wearing black jeans, a shaggy beard and a mask under his chin glances over his shoulder.
None of the other homeless riders at the back of the car are paying him any attention. He turns back and picks up a syringe and needle resting on the seat next to him.
He holds it in front of him, staring at it briefly, before flicking at the syringe a few times. He twists to his left, rolls up the left sleeve of his jacket, well past the elbow, and quickly finds a vein.
He doesn't care that I'm watching him. We don't speak.
""I AM DEAD ALREADY""
Michelene leans against a white-tile wall of the tunnel connecting the 2 and 3 platform to other lines at the Atlantic Avenue station in Brooklyn. She's wearing a black baseball cap with the word ""Jesus"" on the front in silver lettering.
A young woman with a speck of a gold stud in her nose pauses to give Michelene a take-out container of fried rice and a half a gallon of fruit punch before rushing off toward the 2 and 3 platform.
It's around midnight and Michelene is still roaming the station, looking for a place to lie down. The station has been her home for two years, she says.
Her grasp on reality seems like quicksilver. She says she was forced underground by a landlord who locked her inside her apartment for 33 days with no water and stole her money and all of her legal documents, including her passport and birth certificate.
""I used to sleep on the train, but they tortured me,"" she says. ""They tried to kill me here, but I am dead already and God raised me.""
Still, she says she doesn't need God's protection from the coronavirus.
""I have special blood,"" she explains. ""Not everyone has this type of blood.""
HE SAYS GOD WILL DECIDE 
Back above ground at Times Square at the end of the night, the streets are so empty that you can stand in the middle of 7th Avenue. But there is life in the shadows, and one at a time, men appear with a hand out.
Times Square, after all, is where the homeless and other panhandlers can usually make enough money to get by. This is where tourists and office workers are forced together, and enough of them can be persuaded to part with some change or small bills.
But no more, says Tom, an Alabama native who prefers the subway to the shelters.
He stands over a takeaway bowl of spicy Cajun rice and beef, using a rectangular concrete bollard at 42nd Street and 7th Avenue as a table.
""I shouldn't eat this,"" he says, easing the pressure on his right foot while packing his uneaten food into a torn plastic bag. ""I got the gout."" He winces. As a gout sufferer, I tell him I understand the despair of his constantly hammering pain.
He says God will decide if he catches the coronavirus.
""I gotta go. I gotta find a bathroom.""

He turns and limps across 42nd Street toward the subway entrance, holding his leftovers with his right hand and the waistband of his drooping trousers with his left.

1334,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 07:35AM ET</span>","On Earth Day, pope says nature will not forgive our trespasses","By Philip Pullella
VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis made an impassioned plea for protection of the environment on Wednesday's 50th anniversary of the first Earth Day, saying the coronavirus pandemic had shown that some challenges had to be met with a global response.
Francis praised the environmental movement, saying it was necessary for young people to ""take to the streets to teach us what is obvious, that is, that there will be no future for us if we destroy the environment that sustains us"".
The pope, who wrote a major encyclical in 2015 on the defence of nature and the dangers of climate change, dedicated his general audience - broadcast from his library because of the coronavirus lockdown - to the theme.
Recounting a Spanish proverb that God always forgives, man sometimes forgives but nature never forgives, Francis said: ""If we have deteriorated the Earth, the response will be very ugly.""
A landmark in the emergence of the environmental movement when it first took place in 1970, this year's Earth Day has prompted calls from many, including U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, for governments to pursue ""green recovery"" in response to coronavirus
Both the pope and Guterres have made environmental protection and climate change signature themes of their offices.
""We see these natural tragedies, which are the Earth's response to our maltreatment,"" Francis said. ""I think that if I ask the Lord now what he thinks about this, I don't think he would say it is a very good thing. It is we who have ruined the work of God.""
Saying the Earth was not an endless deposit of resources to exploit, he said: ""We have sinned against the Earth, against our neighbour and, in the end, against the creator.""
Last year, after a synod of bishops from the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) region, Francis said he was considering adding a definition of ""ecological sins"" in the Roman Catholic Church's Catechism, a compendium of teachings and rules.
Francis, like Guterres, has likened the response to environmental dangers to that of the coronavirus.
""Only together, and looking after the most fragile (members of society) can we win global challenges,"" the pope said. 
So far, massive economic stimulus packages launched by the United States, China and European governments have focused mainly on staunching the damage to existing industries and staving off the threat of a global depression. 

But ministers from Germany, France and other EU members have signalled their support for subsequent interventions to align with climate goals, a theme taken up by climate campaign groups around the world.

1335,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 07:10AM ET</span>","Moscow residents open homes to psychiatric patients, disabled children during lockdown","By Polina Ivanova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow resident Arina Muratova knew something was wrong when the messages she received from Nina, a patient at Psychiatric Hospital No.22 who has become a friend during her voluntary work there, suddenly lost their usual, optimistic ring. 
The hospital had gone into a precautionary lockdown, aimed at preventing the spread of the new coronavirus, and Nina, 26, was feeling more confined than ever.
""They were already living in isolation,"" Muratova, who has volunteered for three years at the hospital in the city's Elk Island park, said. ""Now their (living space) had been shrunk to a tiny cube.""
Concerned about how fast the coronavirus could spread in the densely populated ward, Muratova decided to use a new government emergency measure allowing people to take residents of state institutions home during the lockdown to get Nina out.
Muratova, a 30-year-old marketing researcher, already had a flatmate, so she moved into temporary accommodation provided by her volunteer group, the Life Route foundation. 
Nina, who has spent her life in children's homes and then the psychiatric hospital, moved in with Muratova the next day.
With Moscow in a partial lockdown, the two women are self-isolating, and as Nina's disability means she is not considered to have legal status, they are unsure how to register her for a digital pass allowing some excursions outside.
""So right now we are sitting in pretty strict self-isolation. All our groceries are delivered, everything we need is contact-free delivery and we don't go outside,"" Muratova said on a call, adding the plan is to do so at least until July.
""The main thing for me is that I can be with a girl friend here,"" Nina, also on the video call, said. 
They are cooking together and finding activities for Nina to do, Muratova said, adding that Nina was enjoying having her own space for the first time and being able to take showers alone, rather than in groups.
""UNEXPECTEDLY POSITIVE OUTCOMES""
""All over the country, institutions house hundreds, sometimes thousands of people in one place ... If one gets sick with coronavirus, so will everyone else,"" Lida Moniava, director of a Moscow children's hospice, said.
In a call with regional governors on Friday, President Vladimir Putin said if such outbreaks occurred, it was due to a failure of leadership: ""Outbreaks, as a rule, occur as a result of our incomplete work. Because we have missed something.""
Last week, a psychiatric hospital in Russia's northern city of Arkhangelsk reported an outbreak of 79 coronavirus cases. Two facilities housing children with special needs went into lockdown this week in Siberia's Chelyabinsk region after staff members tested positive for COVID-19, Interfax reported. 
""It's terrifying, but sometimes terrifying situations can produce unexpectedly positive outcomes,"" Moniava said, referring to the new government policy. 
""Thanks to the coronavirus, an event occurred that is unprecedented in the whole adult and child boarding house system ... The doors of these institutions were thrown open.""
Five staff members at Moniava's Lighthouse Charity Foundation have taken in severely physically disabled children home from two Moscow city orphanages for the quarantine period.
Medical beds rigged with all the necessary equipment to support the children's breathing and movement were installed in their homes, and the orphanage set up a WhatsApp chat group to provide medical advice and tips to the children's new hosts.
Moniava said the paperwork granting temporary adoption rights was handled by authorities within a day. 
Vica Lobanova, a 28-year-old editor working remotely during Moscow's lockdown, who offered to share her home with Svetlana, from the same psychiatric ward in Elk Island park, said that in their case the paperwork was more arduous.
Delays brought Svetlana, who knew of the spread of the coronavirus from the news shown on a television in the ward, to tears. With around 100 people on her building's floor, keeping a safe distance would have been tough. 
Now self-isolating in Lobanova's flat, Svetlana, who has been in institutions since her early teens, spends time playing with Lobanova's dog and taking online classes.
""I gave Sveta one of my two laptops and it has Zoom and Sveta knows her schedule, puts in the conference number herself,"" Lobanova, who also volunteers with Life Route, said, adding that the decision was a straightforward one for her.
""I live alone, I have a one bedroom flat ... so I have space,"" Lobanova said.

As Britain endures its fifth week of a national lockdown, with businesses shuttered and citizens ordered to stay at home, parliament returned from an extended Easter break on Tuesday and will question stand-in leader Dominic Raab at 1100 GMT.
A maximum of 50 lawmakers will be physically allowed in the debating chamber, with another 120 permitted to join in via Zoom video conference beamed onto television screens dotted around the walls of the 18th century wood-panelled room.
""Fingers crossed it's going to work well today,"" Speaker Lindsay Hoyle, who will be directing proceedings from within the chamber, told Sky News. ""It's symbolic, isn't it? 700-years of working, and then suddenly we change to something new.""
Raab, deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson who is recovering from a spell in intensive care with COVID-19, will face up to 50 questions from lawmakers over 45 minutes. Once he is finished, health minister Matt Hancock will make a statement on the government's response to coronavirus outbreak.
The new arrangement is so-far limited to questioning ministers, although officials are looking at ways that legislation can be discussed and even voted upon digitally. 

""This is a starting point, this isn't the end. What we want is a robust system that we build up from this point,"" Hoyle said.

1337,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 05:20AM ET</span>",India battles supply snags in race to build affordable ventilators,"By Sachin Ravikumar and Anuron Kumar Mitra
BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian medical device makers, racing to churn out ventilators as domestic COVID-19 cases spike, have been beset by supply bottlenecks, cost overruns and labour shortages that are delaying their efforts to produce an affordable device.
Ventilators help patients breathe and are seen as critical given severe COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia and lung damage. Experts warn India may run out of devices as it has fewer than 50,000 and may need 20 times that in a peak infection scenario.
Companies, including Bengaluru-based Dynamatic, startup Nocca Robotics and New Delhi's AgVa Healthcare, are rushing to fill the expected supply gap with stripped-down ventilators, priced between $33 and $7,000. 
Top-end ventilators can cost up to $16,000 in India.
But with many countries boosting output and India forced into a lockdown, components and labour are in short supply, leading to production delays of up to two weeks.
""We require components that are extremely hard to procure,"" said Amitabha Bandyopadhyay, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, who is collaborating with Nocca.
Nocca has been set back by two weeks and now aims to make 30,000 ventilators by mid-May, as it struggles to import high-capacity pumps and flow sensors that help regulate air in ventilators, Bandyopadhyay added.
""These materials are so rare now in the international market that there has been a 50%-75% increase in prices in the last one month,"" he said. This has doubled the estimated price of Nocca's devices to 150,000 rupees ($1,950).
Nocca is in talks with several large manufacturers to start production once its prototypes clear tests by early May.
Most Indian medical device executives said they were making ventilators for domestic use. Bandyopadhyay said exports would depend on government curbs and economic viability.
COSTS SKYROCKET
India has ordered its 1.3 billion people indoors until May 3 so its modest public health system does not collapse under the weight of infections that are nearing 19,000. Over 600 people have died due to the coronavirus in the country.
Most of those numbers are from this month.
""If 10% of our population is infected and only 1% of them need ventilators, even then we are way behind,"" said Subhrojyoti Bhowmick, clinical director, academics and research department, at Peerless Hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata.
Before the pandemic, hospitals invested less in ventilators as they are expensive and the devices were available mainly in some hospitals in bigger Indian cities, Bhowmick added.
But companies are now pushing to make affordable devices.
Dynamatic Technologies is making a $33 ventilator that does not need electricity to function, while AgVa is aiming to make 10,000 ventilators by mid-May, priced under $2,000.
AgVa is collaborating with automaker Maruti Suzuki and state-run Bharat Electronics to make parts.
But it is facing labour shortages and higher costs as it sources controllers and microprocessors from Germany, the United States and China, AgVa co-founder Diwakar Vaish said.
""The overall costs have ... doubled, maybe even tripled,"" prompting AgVa to rope in five or six suppliers for some components from just two or three earlier, Vaish said.
LOCKDOWN: SERIOUS DISABLER
To speed up production, India's government is helping with sourcing components and easing bottlenecks. State-run HLL Lifecare Ltd has floated a tender to procure 20,000 ventilators.
India's drugs regulator has also allowed firms to make ventilators without a manufacturing licence, according to an email from the agency's chief seen by Reuters.
Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), a government agency, is collaborating with Skanray, a medical device player based in the southern city of Mysuru.
DRDO is making on a ""war footing"" components such as sensors that are typically imported to aid ventilator production, Skanray Managing Director Vishwaprasad Alva said.
Skanray ventilators cost around $7,000.
But for manufacturers, ""the lockdown is a serious disabler"", Dynamatic CEO Udayant Malhoutra said. ""The challenge is huge, because the whole ecosystem of suppliers is shut down.""
Supply issues are causing a delay of 3-4 days in the 30-day manufacturing cycle, he said. ""In a 10-month development cycle, that means you are off by a month.""

1338,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 05:05AM ET</span>","Sweat, stress and hope: a 24-hour shift with Spain's first responders","By Raul Cadenas and Elena Rodriguez
MADRID (Reuters) - Doctor Cristina Fernandez stands in a residential Madrid stairway, both feet in a red plastic bag while a coworker gingerly peels off her personal protective equipment (PPE), taking care to only touch the inside of her disposable overalls.
    ""The exterior could be contaminated,"" explains Juan Carlos Lopez, an ambulance technician with Summa 112, the only first-responders' unit to cover the whole Madrid region, where the coronavirus outbreak has raged.
    Spain has reported more cases of the new coronavirus than anywhere but the United States and its death toll of 21,282 is Europe's second-highest after Italy. A strict lockdown has helped bring down the infection rate, though an average of 495 people died daily in the past week.
    ""There were very hard days, with many (patient) transfers,"" said Santiago Albadalejos, ambulance technician on the same unit. ""But we're trained for emergencies, to withstand extreme situations.""
    At the peak of the outbreak, Albadalejos' team handled up to eight transfers a day - sometimes shuttling intubated patients between intensive care units, or moving elderly people whose nursing homes had become vectors for the infection.
    For these specialised medics, minimising risk is paramount, meaning each transfer takes two to three hours.
    ""We deploy higher protection than others because the patients we handle present intense symptoms and are more contagious,"" Albadalejos said. ""Transfers are slow, and very meticulous.""
    The Summa teams work 24-hour shifts and rely on one another to stay safe, taping up seams between shoe covers and suits and disinfecting each other.
    A coordinator accompanies them everywhere, monitoring their safety and ensuring they stick to protocols for gearing up and removing PPE.
""It's true that when you get home, you think 'Another day. Yet another day. Mother of God,"" said Albadalejos. ""But it seems we're getting better, and I ask people for precaution and patience.""
    When fully suited, Dr Fernandez can only hear by orienting the bell of her stethoscope towards the sound, while double-layered gloves mean her coworkers struggle to feel for veins.
    But, despite her eardrums hurting from the stethoscope's constant pressure and her vision being impaired by a slipping face mask, falling hood, and steamy visor, Dr Fernandez says PPE is the best way to avoid spreading the virus.
    Freed of the knee-high plastic shoe covers, head-to-toe overalls, face mask, plastic hood, goggles and face shield, Dr Fernandez smiled.
    ""It's exhausting to breathe in your own air all day, and I do feel more tired than usual by 9 a.m.,"" she said, referring to the end of a 24-hour shift.
    But a few hours earlier, when Spaniards applauded medical staff, Dr Fernandez joined in, saying that people staying home deserved as much recognition as herself and her colleagues.

    ""I clap for the children, who are behaving so well. I clap for the collaboration of all of us.""

1341,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 22, 2020 02:21AM ET</span>",North Korean media silent on Kim's whereabouts as speculation on health rages,"By Josh Smith and Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean state media on Wednesday made no mention of leader Kim Jong Un's health or whereabouts, a day after intense international speculation over his health was sparked by media reports he was gravely ill after a cardiovascular procedure.
North Korean media presented a business as usual image, carrying routine reporting of Kim's achievements, publishing his older or undated quotes on issues like the economy.
South Korean and Chinese officials and sources familiar with U.S. intelligence have cast doubt on the South Korean and U.S. media reports, while the White House said it was closely monitoring the matter.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who held unprecedented summits with Kim in 2018 and 2019 in an attempt to persuade him to give up his nuclear weapons, said the reports had not been confirmed and he did not put much credence in them.
""I just hope he's doing fine,"" Trump told a White House news conference on Tuesday. ""I've had a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un. And I'd like to see him do well. We'll see how he does. We don't know if the reports are true."" 
Asked whether he would try to reach out to Kim to check on his condition, Trump said: ""Well I may, but I just hope he's doing fine.""
Speculation about Kim's health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea's founding father and Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15.
On Wednesday, the main headlines from KCNA included pieces on sports equipment, mulberry picking, and a meeting in Bangladesh to study North Korea's ""juche"" or self-reliance ideology. The official Rodong Sinmun newspaper carried older or undated remarks attributed to Kim in articles about the economy, the textile industry, city development, and other topics.
As usual Kim's name was plastered all over the newspaper, but there were no reports on his whereabouts.
Daily NK, a Seoul-based website, reported late on Monday that Kim, who is believed to be about 36, was hospitalised on April 12, hours before the cardiovascular procedure.
The story's English version carried a correction on Tuesday to say the report was based on a single unnamed source in North Korea, not multiple as it earlier stated.
It said his health had deteriorated since August due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork, and he was now receiving treatment at a villa in the Mount Myohyang resort north of the capital Pyongyang. 
'EXTENDED SILENCE IS UNUSUAL' 
On Tuesday, CNN reported an unnamed U.S. official saying that the United States was ""monitoring intelligence"" that Kim was in grave danger after surgery.
However, two South Korean government officials rejected the CNN report and South Korea's presidential Blue House said there were no unusual signs from North Korea. China, North Korea's only major ally, also dismissed the reports.
Trump's national security adviser, Robert O'Brien, told Fox News the White House was monitoring the reports ""very closely"".
""There's lots of conjecture going around,"" a senior Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity late on Tuesday when asked if there was confirmation of the reports.
North Korea experts have cautioned that hard facts about Kim's condition are elusive, but said his unprecedented absence from major celebrations for his grandfather's birthday last week signals that something may have gone awry.
Thae Yong Ho, a former North Korean deputy ambassador to London who defected to South Korea in 2016, said state media's extended silence is unusual because it had been quick to previously dispel questions about the status of its leadership. 
""Every time there is controversy about (Kim), North Korea would take action within days to show he is alive and well,"" he said in a statement. 
His absence from the April 15 anniversary worship, in particular, is ""unprecedented,"" Thae said.
Kim is a third-generation hereditary leader who rules North Korea with an iron fist, coming to power after his father Kim Jong Il died in 2011 from a heart attack. 
Reporting from inside North Korea is notoriously difficult, especially on matters concerning its leadership, given tight controls on information. There have been past false reports regarding its leaders, but the fact Kim has no clear successor means any instability could present a major international risk.
Trump said he had asked Kim about succession in the past but declined to elaborate.
""The basic assumption would be maybe it would be someone in the family,"" said O'Brien. ""But, again, it's too early to talk about that because we just don't know what condition Chairman Kim is in and we'll have to see how it plays out.""
With no details known about Kim's young children, analysts said Kim's sister and loyalists could form a regency until a successor is old enough to take over.
""At least Kim Jong Un did his best to talk and meet with President Moon in the past. I don't recall any other other time we were in such a good relationship with North Korea,” said Lee Eun-ji, a 28-year-old nurse in Seoul.
""If his health really has deteriorated and he becomes critically ill, then I wonder if his replacement would even try to make those efforts....I worry his successor could be a warmonger and it could be a threat to South Korea.”
In recent years, Kim has launched a diplomatic offensive to promote himself as a world leader, holding three meetings with Trump, four with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and five with Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Kim has sought to have international sanctions against his country eased, but has refused to dismantle his nuclear weapons programme, a steadfast demand by the United States.

It was unclear whether any of the incidents were related to the anti-government protests that rattled Hong Kong last year before pausing in recent months amid social distancing adopted to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
The latest incident involved a suspected small, homemade explosive device mailed in an envelope to police headquarters, police said, adding it could have injured anyone within one metre (3 ft).
Police said the explosive ordnances disposal team dealt with the device and evacuation was deemed unnecessary.
In recent months, police said they had discovered explosive substances and devices across the city, including in a downtown school and on train tracks near the mainland border. They said some homemade devices were discovered at protests sites last year and during raids of homes where protesters were arrested.
""I want to remind people of the risk of rising home-grown terrorism,"" Lee told reporters. ""Some might die because of bombs, buildings might be demolished.""
""I asked police and other law enforcement agencies to strengthen the work related to that,"" Lee said, adding that this could include using terrorism financing legislation to freeze the assets of those involved.
Critics say authorities in Hong Kong and Beijing are increasingly using the threat of what they call terrorism to justify calls for new national security laws.
A previous attempt to draft a national security law for Hong Kong, known as Article 23, was met with mass protests in 2003 amid fears it would limit the city's freedoms. It was abandoned.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - An Australian frigate has joined three U.S. warships in the South China Sea near an area where a Chinese vessel is suspected to be exploring for oil, near waters also claimed by Vietnam and Malaysia, officials said on Wednesday.
The warships arrived this week close to where the Chinese government survey ship Haiyang Dizhi 8 has been operating, which is in turn near where a vessel operated by Malaysia’s Petronas state oil company is conducting exploratory drilling, regional security sources have said. 
The U.S. navy said on Tuesday the USS America amphibious assault ship and the USS Bunker Hill, a guided missile cruiser, were operating in the South China Sea.
They were joined by Australia's frigate HMAS Parramatta and a third U.S. vessel, the destroyer USS Barry, as part of a joint exercise, the Australian defence department said.
""During the passage exercises, the ships honed interoperability between Australian and US navies, including replenishment-at-sea, aviation operations, maritime manoeuvres and communications drills,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.
The Haiyang Dizhi 8 was 325 km (202 miles) off the Malaysian coast, within its exclusive economic zone, data from ship-tracking website Marine Traffic showed on Wednesday. 
The ship, accompanied by a Chinese coastguard vessel, has been moving in a hash-shaped pattern consistent with a seismic survey for nearly a week, the data showed. 
The area is near waters claimed by both Vietnam and Malaysia as well as China.
China claims most of the energy-rich South China Sea, within a U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" on its maps, which is not recognised by its neighbours.
Petronas and Malaysia's foreign ministry have not commented on the situation but the United States has called on China to stop its ""bullying behaviour"" in the South China Sea.
China, however, has denied reports of a standoff, saying the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was conducting normal activities.
Last year, Vietnamese vessels spent months shadowing the Haiyang Dizhi 8.
It appeared off Vietnam again last week, within Vietnam's exclusive economic zone. Vietnam said it was closely monitoring the situation.
The United States has accused China of pushing its presence in the South China Sea while other claimants are pre-occupied with the coronavirus.
At the same time, China has been donating medical aid to Southeast Asian countries to help them tackle the virus, which emerged in central China late last year.
A team of Chinese medical experts arrived this week in Malaysia, which has reported more than 5,400 coronavirus infections. 
On Sunday, Vietnam protested after China said it had established two administrative districts on the Paracel and Spratly islands in the disputed waters. China has called Vietnam's claims illegal.

Hong Kong's Director of Immigration, Erick Tsang, will replace Patrick Nip as head of the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau, the official Xinhua news agency said. 
The move comes two days after Nip apologised for conflicting statements over the role of Beijing's two agencies overseeing the Chinese-ruled city's affairs. 
Nip has been reassigned as the head of the city's civil service, replacing Joshua Law, Xinhua said. 
The shake-up is the biggest under the administration of embattled Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam, who has rejected repeated calls to step down even after admitting she had caused ""unforgivable havoc"" by igniting political turmoil last year. 
Protests that escalated in June evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement that is expected to pick up steam after a lull amid the coronavirus outbreak, as debate rages over Beijing's increasing influence in the global financial hub. 
Ratcheting up tensions in the past week, Beijing's top representative office in the city enraged democrats when it said it was not bound by a law that restricts interference by other mainland Chinese agencies in the former British colony.
The remarks prompted conflicting statements from the Hong Kong government at the weekend regarding the legal status of Beijing's Liaison Office, and Nip apologised for the confusion.

(Reuters) - Canadian police had yet to determine a motive for the country's worst mass shooting, as the death toll from the carnage in Nova Scotia over the weekend climbed to 23 from 19, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said on Tuesday.
The shooting rampage has rattled rural communities in the Atlantic province, as investigators seek answers to questions such as how the gunman obtained an authentic police uniform and secured a police look-alike cruiser, both of which aided his easy movement during his 13-hour spree.
Memorials cropped up all over the province of fewer than a million people, featuring Canadian flags, flowers and illustrations of broken hearts. The Canadian Broadcasting Corp said the death toll included the suspect.
The incident started at a home in Portapique, a rural seaside community of about 100 residents in the winter, increasing to some 250 residents in the summer.
The RCMP said in a statement it was investigating the 16 crime scenes that were part of the murder spree, several of which included burnt-out homes. Police said there were also injuries in the attack, but did not say whether the death toll would rise further. 
The gunman, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, who worked as a denturist, began his rampage late on Saturday. He was fatally shot by police at noon on Sunday at a service station.
The youngest among those confirmed killed so far was a 17-year-old, the RCMP said. Some of the victims were known to the gunman but others were not. A veteran police officer, a teacher and a nurse were among the dead.
Kristen Beaton, a nurse, was killed while working, according to a GoFundMe set up in her name. Beaton's husband, Nick, told CTV News he warned his wife about the presence of an active shooter just before she was killed.
She was pregnant with the couple's second child.
""We never got the chance to tell family,"" he said. ""We were going to tell them this week, she was going on vacation.""
'TWITTER ALERTS'
The RCMP has been criticized for not alerting the public to the presence of an active shooter via the province's emergency alert system and instead relying on its Twitter account, which had just under 91,000 followers at the time.
Nova Scotia RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather told reporters on Monday the force felt it was a ""superior way to communicate"" the threat in the community, but said [the force would look into the matter.
Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil said the province had not received a request from police for an emergency alert to be sent out. McNeil said the military was assisting in the RCMP's investigation.
No details have been released about the type of gun used by Wortman or how it was obtained.
Bringing in stricter gun control measures was an election promise of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's Liberals in the October 2019 federal election, and he told reporters on Tuesday the legislation had been ""almost ready to go"" when the novel coronavirus crisis hit.

""The tragedy in Nova Scotia simply reinforces and underlines how important it is for us to continue to move forward on strengthening gun control in this country,"" Trudeau said. ""We will do that at the appropriate time.""

Bloomberg News quoted an unnamed U.S. official as saying the White House was told that Kim had taken a turn for the worse after the surgery.
However, authoritative U.S. sources familiar with U.S. intelligence questioned the report that Kim was in grave danger.

MEETINGS WITH TRUMP
In recent years, Kim has launched a diplomatic offensive to promote himself as a world leader, holding three meetings with Trump, four with South Korean President Moon Jae-in and five with Chinese President Xi Jinping.
China is North Korea's only major ally. Speaking to Reuters, an official at the Chinese Communist Party's International Liaison Department expressed the belief that Kim was not critically ill. 
Daily NK said Kim was hospitalized on April 12, hours before the cardiovascular procedure, as his health had deteriorated since August due to heavy smoking, obesity and overwork. It said he was now receiving treatment at a villa in the Mount Myohyang resort north of the capital Pyongyang.
""My understanding is that he had been struggling (with cardiovascular problems) since last August but it worsened after repeated visits to Mount Paektu,"" a source was quoted as saying, referring to the country's sacred mountain.
Kim took two well-publicised rides on a stallion on the mountain's snowy slopes in October and December. 
Speculation about Kim's health first arose due to his absence from the anniversary of the birthday of North Korea's founding father and Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, on April 15.
North Korea's official KCNA news agency gave no indication of his whereabouts in routine dispatches on Tuesday, but said he had sent birthday gifts to prominent citizens.
Kim has sought to have international sanctions against his country eased, but has refused to give up his nuclear weapons, which pose a threat to the United States. 
Joseph Yun, a former U.S. envoy to North Korea under President Barack Obama and Trump, told Reuters he believes ""something really is quite amiss, quite awry right now in North Korea"". 
""It's worrisome. If he's seriously ill and he dies, there is no succession plan,"" he said. ""You could see a huge power struggle, people jockeying for position. Their lives would depend on it.""

Yun said for all its secrecy, North Korea in recent years had been quick to respond to significant foreign news reports and it was noteworthy that it had stayed silent so far.

1349,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",Bipartisan U.S. Senate report backs spy agencies' findings on Russia,"By Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee concurred with spy agencies' findings that Russia sought to boost now-President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign, according to a bipartisan report declassified and released on Tuesday.
The report found that the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation had coherent and well-constructed grounds to conclude that Russian President Vladimir Putin aimed to undercut Trump's 2016 rival, Democrat Hillary Clinton.
Trump, who has consistently bristled at suggestions that foreign interference helped his upset 2016 victory, has sought to discredit the intelligence agencies' findings as the politically charged work of a ""deep state."" Russia has denied that it was behind any efforts to meddle in U.S. elections.
The Senate report - the fourth of five chapters so far released - found that the CIA and FBI had high confidence in their findings that Russia was trying to boost Trump's chances, while the NSA was only moderately confident on that point.
It said that interviews with officials who drafted and prepared the intelligence community assessment had ""affirmed that analysts were under no political pressure to reach specific conclusions.""
The report comes as Trump seeks re-election, looking ahead to a November match-up in which he will likely face Democratic former Vice President Joe Biden.
The committee report on the Intelligence Community Assessment, is heavily redacted, which sources familiar with the document said was because it is extensively based on documentation and testimony that remain highly classified.
""One of the ICA's most important conclusions was that Russia's aggressive interference efforts should be considered 'the new normal,'"" said the committee's chairman, Republican Senator Richard Burr.
The committee is still working on a final chapter summarizing its investigation. Congressional sources said that unlike the first four chapters, which present conclusions agreed upon by the committee's Republican majority and Democratic minority, the fifth chapter will reflect at least some partisan differences over the extent to which interference by Russia influenced the result of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

""The young men were about to be recruited but they resisted, which provoked the ire of the bandits that killed the 52 indiscriminately,"" police spokesman Orlando Modumane said.
The killings took place in the village of Xitaxi in Muidumbe district in the province of Cabo Delgado, home to multi-billion-dollar gas projects led by oil majors such as Total.
Last Wednesday, national police commander Bernardino Rafael said no parts of the troubled province were under the control of insurgents. His comments came after an increase in the frequency of attacks in the province.

Soldiers killed three women and 10 children in the northwestern Ngarbuh village in February and then tried to cover up their actions by torching parts of the community, the government said in a statement on Tuesday. 
Several other soldiers involved in the mission will face disciplinary proceedings, it added.
""After an exchange of fire...the detachment discovered that three women and 10 children died as a result of their actions. In panic, the three soldiers...tried to mask the facts by lighting fires.""
Previously, in the immediate aftermath of the February clashes, the government said that its soldiers were on a reconnaissance mission in Ngarbuh when they were attacked. The fighting that followed caused several fuel containers to explode and set nearby houses ablaze, it said, killing five civilians. 
The latest findings, the result of an investigation into the incident, come amid mounting pressure from the United Nations and rights groups. The U.N. in February said that 22 people were killed, 14 of whom were children, based on interviews with survivors, according to James Nunan, an official with the U.N. humanitarian coordination agency OCHA. At least 600 people fled, he said.
Human Rights Watch put the toll at 21 and said the soldiers deliberately carried out the killings, including by burning people in their homes. 
Anglophone rebels in the northwest and southwest regions have called for a split from the country for decades, but fighting has escalated since 2017 as support for secession grows and armed groups appear. 
Witnesses of past clashes have told Reuters of army abuses https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-cameroon-separatists-exclusive/exclusive-we-are-in-a-war-cameroon-unrest-confronted-by-army-offensive-idUKKBN1FS1WT, but the army had denied any wrongdoing. 
The fighting, often in remote villages surrounded by cocoa farms and forests, has been one of the greatest threats to President Paul Biya's government during his nearly 40 years in power. 
Conflict between Cameroon’s army and English-speaking militias began after the government cracked down violently on peaceful protests by lawyers and teachers in 2016 who complained of marginalization by the French-speaking majority.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Allies of both Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his bitter foe, opposition leader Juan Guaido, have secretly begun exploratory talks as concerns grow about the possible impact of coronavirus, according to sources on both sides.
The discussions emerged from concerns about COVID-19, hyperinflation and growing fuel shortages, as well as worries among some members of the ruling Socialist Party about how to ensure their political survival under a possible change of government as Washington tightens sanctions, the sources said.
The talks, which have no clear agenda, show that allies of both Maduro and Guaido remain unconvinced that they can defeat the other amid a global pandemic and a broad U.S. sanctions program meant to push Maduro from office.
""There are two extremes: Maduro and those who believe that the virus will end Guaido's leadership, and those on the other side (who) hope this crisis will bring down Maduro,"" said an opposition legislator in favor of the rapprochement. 
""I think we have to find solutions.""
Reuters was unable to determine when the talks began, where or how they are taking place, and how Maduro and Guaido view them. Seven sources, who represent both sides of Venezuela's deep political divide, confirmed the talks.
Maduro and Guaido are competing with one another to help combat the effects of the pandemic, with each side convinced the outbreak will undermine the other politically, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
Activists and rights groups around the world have urged the two factions to seek a truce in order to coordinate the delivery of aid and boost gasoline imports.
The U.S. State Department in March offered to begin lifting parts of the sanctions if members of the Socialist Party form an interim government without Maduro, a plan backed by Guaido but quickly shot down by the government.
Venezuela's information ministry and Guaido's press team did not immediately reply to a request for comment about the current talks.
Maduro has frequently said he is willing to hold dialogue.
""We are ready for dialogue, to understand one another and reach a humanitarian agreement to attend to the coronavirus (pandemic),"" Maduro said during a televised broadcast over the weekend, without making reference to any specific set of talks. 
Guaido, head of the national assembly who assumed an interim presidency last year after disavowing Maduro's 2018 re-election, is recognized by the United States and more than 50 countries as the nation's legitimate leader. But other powers such as China and Russia still back Maduro.
One source linked to the government acknowledged the talks were going on.
""There are proposals coming and going"" between Maduro allies and members of the four principal opposition parties, said the source.
""There are approaches,"" said one opposition deputy who is aware of the discussions. ""There are key elements in the government that want to negotiate their salvation."" 
The two sides last year participated in a dialogue brokered by Norway in which the opposition had pressed for a new presidential election. But Maduro's side walked away from the process in protest at U.S. sanctions. 
Maduro assures his government has controlled the coronavirus outbreak in Venezuela with the support of China, while Guaido accuses him of using the pandemic as an excuse for disastrous economic policies.
Venezuela as of Monday had reported 285 coronavirus infections. The United Nations has called it one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the virus due to the lack of soap and water in hospitals and the overall impoverishment of the population. 
Guaido, who controls Venezuelan government funds held in offshore accounts, is seeking to provide $20 million to the Pan American Health Organization to acquire supplies, according to three sources. 
But Maduro's government is aiming to block the operation via the United Nations, which still recognizes his government.
The Venezuelan offices of the Pan American Health Organization and the United Nations did not respond to request for comment.

Guaido has offered to pay $100 per month to doctors and nurses with the help of the Organization of American States, a mechanism that has not yet started.

The government has repeatedly insisted it has no plans to extend the post-Brexit transition arrangements due to end on Dec. 31, despite the coronavirus pandemic which has hit Britain and much of Europe hard and disrupted negotiations.
Asked by a lawmaker whether this deadline was still realistic, Simon McDonald, permanent under secretary and head of the diplomatic service at the foreign ministry, said it was ""clearly an option"" to extend the transition period.
""But the government’s attachment to that deadline is equally clear,"" he told parliament's Foreign Affairs Committee.
Both sides would have to agree by the end of June to extend the period by one or two years. The British parliament has passed a law ruling that out.
McDonald said the question of an extension was one the government would need to consider ""in the next weeks"" and would be one of the first things Johnson, who is currently recovering from COVID-19, would have to decide on when he returns to work.

""I believe the prime minister will confirm the existing timetable,"" he said.

The authorities acted days before the start of the fasting month of Ramadan, the holiest month in the Islamic calendar where families tend to go out to shop in the evening.
But this Ramadan will be different for Iraqis, as the new measures will allow freedom of movement inside the capital Baghdad only between 6 a.m. until 7 p.m. while maintaining a complete curfew on the Friday-Saturday weekend.
Under the new regulations, government offices can keep staffing levels at a maximum of 25 percent and some shops will be allowed to reopen, though malls, parks and mosques where large numbers of people normally gather will remain closed, a government statement said.
The easing of the curfew is due to last until May 22 at the end of Ramadan, when it is expected to be tightened again.
Schools and universities will stay closed and all flights will remain halted, said the statement.
Hours after the curfew was lifted on Tuesday, thousands of Iraqis flocked to the markets in Baghdad to stock up on supplies ahead of Ramadan.
""After a month of curfew I came to the market to prepare for Ramadan and I’m following protective measures to stay away from this vicious disease,"" said Ali Hussain, who came to shop at one of central Baghdad’s crowded markets.
Authorities imposed a curfew on March 15 and then tightened it, shuttering airports, offices, closing schools and ordering people to stay mostly at home.

As of April 20, Iraq had recorded 1,574 cases of COVID-19, including 82 deaths and 1,043 recovered, according to the health ministry.

The House of Commons, parliament's elected lower chamber, will sit on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, with the first two hours taken up by questions to government ministers and ministerial statements.
""Parliament has always evolved to make sure it could work efficiently,"" said Rees-Mogg, who coordinates government business in the Commons.
""Any changes now will be temporary for the period of the lockdown because, like many things, the chamber works best when members can meet in person.""

Rees-Mogg also said the government intended initially to stick to non-contentious business that was not expected to need formal votes, and was looking at how remote voting could be put in place for the future.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Elias Feinzilberg, a 102-year-old Holocaust survivor, had to commemorate Israel's annual memorial day for the six million Jewish dead on Tuesday separated from his family because of the coronavirus lockdown.
From his third-floor Jerusalem home, he blew kisses to his daughter, grandchildren and great-grandchildren who stood in the street below to be with him, at a safe distance, as a siren sounded across Israel to honour those who perished.
""It pains me that I cannot be with my family, with my friends,"" said Feinzilberg from his window.
Below, his family members, including five of his 19 great-grandchildren, brandished a sign that read ""Remembering close-by, embracing from afar"", part of a nationwide campaign to show solidarity with Israel's roughly 190,000 Holocaust survivors at this time of coronavirus lockdown and enforced separation.
As the siren sounded, his family bowed their heads and then waved to Feinzilberg. 
The average age of the survivors today is 84, putting them in the highest risk group for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
Israel, which has about nine million people, has reported 13,833 confirmed COVID-19 cases to date, including 181 deaths.
Feinzilberg, born in Poland in 1917, was imprisoned with his family in the Lodz ghetto after the Nazi German invasion at the start of World War Two in 1939. His father perished there and his mother and sisters were murdered at the Chelmno death camp.
    
""A GREAT INSPIRATION""
Feinzilberg was packed aboard a cattle train and sent to Auschwitz-Birkenau, where more than a million Jews were murdered. He survived months of forced labour before being marched by the Nazis from one concentration camp to another in the final weeks of the war. 
He and his wife moved to Israel in 1969 and opened a shoe store. She died in 2008 and Feinzilberg now has a full-time care worker living with him.
The Holocaust survivors, like other elderly Israelis, are confined to their homes under the country's partial lockdown and find themselves far from their usual network of support.
""Loneliness is one of their greatest sources of distress,"" said Offir Ettinger, a spokesman for Israel’s Authority for Holocaust Survivors' Rights, which provides thousands of survivors with regular support through dedicated NGOs.
""Every Holocaust Day we see an increase in survivors turning to us for help, but this year, because of the coronavirus isolation, it’s different,"" said Ettinger.
""Even a mere word like 'curfew' can bring back painful memories for some,"" he added, because of its associations with draconian wartime restrictions in the ghettos and camps. 
Therapy sessions, led by social workers and psychologists, have been increased since the outbreak, said Ettinger, and are being conducted by phone and video chats.
Jenny Brodsky, Feinzilberg's daughter, said her father was dealing with isolation relatively well.  
""(The coronavirus) is nothing compared with what he's been through,"" she said. ""The most difficult part for him is knowing that his family are okay, but he has a lot of patience, he is very optimistic. He's a great inspiration to us.”

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Police in Uganda said on Tuesday they had arrested a prominent journalist and news anchor at one of the country's biggest TV stations for alleged subversive activities.
Samson Kasumba was being investigated along with other co-conspirators, police said.
Journalists from independent media in the East African country are frequently targeted by the government of President Yoweri Museveni and have been jailed or interrogated over their work. 
Museveni, in power since 1986, has little tolerance for criticism, the opposition and rights activists say, adding that accusations of crimes against the state are often used to intimidate or silence the media and political opponents.
Kasumba, a news anchor and reporter at NBS Television, was arrested on Monday as he left the station, police spokesman Fred Enanga said. 
""He was picked up yesterday evening as he was heading back home,"" Enanga told a news conference.
Enanga said detectives had interrogated Kasumba and would conduct searches at various locations for potential evidence. He denied that the arrest was connected to Kasumba's work as a journalist.
With Museveni widely expected to stand in presidential elections due next year, security forces have been clamping down on supporters of the opposition, including those of musician-turned-lawmaker Bobi Wine, seen as Museveni's main challenger.
A growing number of authors and online critics of Museveni have also been targeted, often charged with offences that rights activists and lawyers say are a disguised punishment for their censure of government.
A man who wrote a fictional book called ""The Greedy Barbarian"", seen as critical of the government, was brought to court on Monday and charged, a charge sheet seen by Reuters on Tuesday showed.
Kakwenza Rukirabashaija was accused of making Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts encouraging people to disobey the government's anti-coronavirus measures, risking the spread of the infection. 
He had been in military detention for a week without access to lawyers or relatives and was charged after his attorneys got a judge to order that he be brought to court.

1361,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 10:21AM ET</span>",Weary Algerians fear fresh economic turmoil as oil prices dive,"By Lamine Chikhi and Hamid Ould Ahmed
ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algerians are watching the collapse of oil prices with alarm as the energy markets on which the North African nation relies for most of its export revenues have been plunged into turmoil by the coronavirus crisis.
The oil and gas producer has burnt through more than half its foreign currency reserves since 2014, when an earlier oil price rout began, while this year's budget outlined a 9% cut in spending but was based on oil prices double today's levels.
The economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic, which has sent global demand for crude into tailspin, threatens to fling Algeria into a new crisis after a year of political upheaval and mass protests that forced a veteran president from power.
""We will soon start to feel a big crisis unless oil prices go back up,"" said Halim Cherifi, a banker in Algiers. 
Algeria's Saharan Blend is now trading at less than $20 a barrel, while this year's austerity budget was based on a price of $50 a barrel. Benchmark international crudes are trading at their lowest in about two decades.
The presidential spokesman said on television on Tuesday that the situation was under control because of ""spending cuts and postponing some projects"".
But not everyone is convinced by such words of reassurance.
""The current oil market level is far below government forecasts,"" said economics professor Abderrahmane Aya. ""The situation may hit the value of the dinar currency and then the purchasing power of Algerians.""
Algeria has frozen much of its state housing construction, halted some energy projects and cancelled other development plans to reduce spending and bring deficits under control. 
But the budget deficit has still been running at between 6% and 15% of economic output for the past five years, with generous subsidies on bread, electricity and other basic supplies weighing on state coffers.
NO CHOICE
""In the short term, Algeria can resist the consequences of what is happening on the oil market ... But this exceptional situation requires urgent structural, economic and financial reforms,"" said El Houari Tighersi, a member of the parliament's finance committee. 
Even without the current global energy crisis, state-owned Sonatrach has struggled to maintain oil and gas export volumes, with rising domestic consumption of fuel and as European customers have turned to other gas suppliers for imports. 
""Algeria no longer has the choice of delaying economic reforms. They are going to be difficult to implement, but this is the time to diversify the economy,"" said a former energy minister who asked to remain anonymous.
Zoheir, a former Sonatrach engineer who did not give his family name, said oil producers should start cutting output immediately to defend prices. ""Who will take this oil if the economy is down, and who will stock it?"" he said.
Algeria, which has joined Saudi Arabia, Russia and other oil producers in a global deal to curb oil supplies, has repeatedly said it aimed to diversify away from oil and gas but has proved reluctant to open up an economy dominated by state industries.
It is one of the few countries that did not join the World Trade Organization and until this year prevented majority foreign ownership of projects. Private businesses have long complained about corruption and bureaucracy.
In a bid to address some concerns, the government has encouraged foreigners to invest in Algeria, allowing majority ownership in ""non-strategic sectors"", while making it easier to partner Sonatrach to help raise oil and gas output.

But the latest oil price slide has already prompted international energy companies to scrap new projects worldwide, while threats of a deeper global economic downturn are likely to make attracting foreign cash in other areas more challenging.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Mosques in Germany that depend on donations from Friday prayers face bankruptcy as the coronavirus lockdown strips them of their only source of income, which peaks during the month of Ramadan that starts this week.
After five weeks of closure, some have launched online appeals urging members to donate via bank transfers.
But Imam Mohamed Taha Sabri, who runs the Dar Assalam mosque in Berlin's Neukoelln district, said an online campaign had produced only a trickle of donations.
""Mosques are going through a massive crisis,"" he said in the empty mosque, where hand-washing instructions are displayed on placards next to Koranic verses. ""I think that some mosques are going to be forced to close, especially those which have to pay rent.""
Religious gatherings, including Friday prayers, have been suspended since mid-March, when a lockdown was imposed to slow the spread of the virus, which has infected about 143,000 in Germany and killed almost 4,600.
Germany has now allowed some pupils to go back to school and some businesses to open. Yet mosques, churches and synagogues must remain shut.
Mosques have to finance themselves as they do not benefit from hundreds of million of euros in state funds given to Christian churches.
The Islamic Council, an umbrella group of 400 mosques, has urged the government to provide financial assistance for mosques, warning that many face bankruptcy because closures will stretch into the holy fasting month of Ramadan, usually a vital period for donations.
In Britain, mosques have also said the lockdown means they have lost a major source of funding, especially in donations from the faithful.
Sabri said the response to the online funding drive by his mosque, where 1,500 Muslims pray on a normal Friday, had been ""tepid"" and even when the lockdown ends it won't be possible to relaunch charitable activities like free meals.
""We cover about half to two thirds of our expenses from donations made during Ramadan,"" said Sabri, whose mosque needs 7,000 euros a month to pay its bills. ""Unfortunately, this Ramadan is going to be difficult.""
He hopes the pandemic will be an opportunity to change the way Muslims give money.
""It's not that they don't want to donate. They need time, they need to be encouraged to move from donating in the mosque during Friday prayers to donating by bank transfer.""
Hamzah Al-Suweidi, a Syrian social worker who prayed at the mosque before its doors were shut, said he was not surprised online fundraising was not taking off.

""When you are at the mosque, you see your neighbour put 5 euros in the donations box and you feel you have to give something too. So everyone ends up giving something,"" said Suweidi. ""When you pray at home there is no such pressure.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - There are 48 bodies in the basement of the funeral home in Harlem. Forty are in cardboard boxes, ready for cremation. The other eight are in the refrigerator, to be embalmed and buried. It will be weeks or months before they get either. 
As health officials began burying COVID-19 victims in a mass grave on Hart Island during New York's worst week of death, the four female undertakers at the International Funeral & Cremation Service started turning bodies away.
This band of women morticians in heeled boots began to feel like they were failing. The way they see it, a person should get what they want in death, even if that was never possible in life.
""That's our thing,"" says Lily Sage Weinrieb. ""You want six limos and you want them painted pink? Yes. Now, we're like: you want a cremation? I'm sorry, no. You want a burial and you already have a plot and everything? Sorry, no. We don't have any room.""
""We're being told that we're heroes for being on the front lines of this but I feel like I'm failing families every day.""
On the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, nurses and doctors are caring for the living. But there is another front line of those caring for the dead. They fear they can also get infected and die. Some of them have sent their own children to live with relatives. And because American cities like New York were never designed to dispose of so many dead, their call of duty will last much longer.
SINGLE MOMS AND DAUGHTERS
At the beginning of the pandemic, Alisha Narvaez, 36, sent her 17-year-old daughter to live with her twin sister, but after two weeks the distance was too much. ""It's always just been me and her and she wanted to come home,"" says Alisha.
Alisha showers at the funeral home after embalmings and before going home, then removes all of her clothes in the hallway and showers again when she gets home. She sprays her bag with Lysol and rinses her mouth out with Listerine.
""I gotta make sure I keep healthy just not to harm her,"" says Alisha. ""Although she's been in quarantine for several weeks, every day I come home from work is Day Zero for her."" 
Jenny Adames sent her daughter to live with her mother. She recently caught herself snapping at her in a text exchange.
""Today kind of broke my heart,"" says Jenny, 36. ""She needs her mom. She don't need Jenny the funeral director."" 
Nicole Warring, 33, worries about dying, or infecting her 10-year-old son. Her boyfriend who works for the casket company got the virus. Fortunately, he recovered. She was off of work for a week for heart palpitations from anxiety. 
""It's traumatizing for everyone,"" she says. ""No mortuary school can prepare you for what we're seeing now."" 
Lily moved out of a shared house with friends in Philadelphia because she didn't think it was right to constantly expose her housemates to the virus. Her parents let her move home but she says no one has hugged her for more than a month. 
""That sucks,"" she says.
Several nights each week Lily, 25, sleeps in the chapel at the funeral home. 
BUYING TIME
Jenny doesn't remember the first body she turned away in the pandemic but she does remember the first one that made her cry. A man called - every hour, at least four times in one day - about his friend lying dead in a nursing home.
""I need help,"" she recalls him saying. ""I don't know what to do. I don't want to leave him to be thrown in a potter's field. Please, you gotta help me Jenny."" 
""I really couldn't do anything and that broke my heart,"" says Jenny. ""It's not that we are turning you away. We just need to buy time.""
The death toll in the United States is now the highest in the world. A third of U.S. deaths, more than 13,000, have been in New York City.
New York, the most-populous city in the United States, has just four crematories. 
Death in a pandemic isn't pretty. The refrigerated trailers outside of the hospitals don't have enough shelving and bodies are sometimes stacked on top of each other and on the floor. Some trailers don't have lights. 
Hospitals, which used to store bodies for 14 days now sometimes will only keep them for six.
""You have 20 other funeral directors ahead of you that have to get bodies out,"" says Nicole.
""You see tons of body bags and tons of people and they're labeled COVID-19, COVID-19, COVID-19. It's like a horror show."" 
And little stands between the women and the risks their work carries. No one even knows if the bodies of victims are contagious. 
Two weeks ago, the women ran out of gloves. 
In that shortage, Jenny found an unexpected detente with the father of her daughter. ""We hate each other,"" she explains, but says she turned to him for help because he works in a hospital. He brought her gloves, a box of masks and an apron. 
""I don't really like you much but you're my daughter's mother. Here you go,"" he told her.
The phones in the funeral parlor ring constantly, punctuated by ambulance sirens. Suppliers say they are running out of caskets and urns. Jenny says she no longer hands families the casket catalog; she just asks what color. 
LAST GOODBYES 
Most COVID-19 victims die alone, and when they die, their families are told to quarantine. The women try to find ways for them to say goodbye.
Jenny gives families her mobile number. They text her late into the night.
For those who are cremated, Lily offers to let the families pour the ashes into the urn and say a few words.
The funeral home in Harlem is one of the few allowing viewings for COVID-19 victims. Because of the pandemic, only 10 people can gather at a time; most families are bigger so the women offer four-hour viewings, 10 people per hour. Families have to bring their own gloves and masks.
Jenny says the women have to watch each other right now. The message, she says, is ""limit your compassion please, because we gotta move onto the next one. There's no time to stop."" 
Jenny's grandfather died of the coronavirus on April 6. A week later, on Good Friday, her aunt died. ""Suspected COVID-19,"" her death certificate read. They were family so Jenny took care of both of them herself. 
""I'm not the emotional type to tell you the truth,"" she says. ""I don't want to sound heartless but it's a job. It's what I do.""

The Alpine republic acted early in its outbreak to close restaurants, bars, theatres, non-essential shops and other potential gathering places more than a month ago. It has told the public to stay at home and work from there if possible.
It has also been among the first to loosen its lockdown, allowing DIY stores, garden centres and shops of less than 400 square metres - roughly twice the area of a singles tennis court - to reopen a week ago. Shopping centres, larger shops and hairdressers are due to follow from May 1.
""We are going faster here than other countries towards something like a new normality,"" Kurz told a news conference, adding that ""gastronomy businesses"", a term that often includes bars, will be allowed to reopen from May 15 and stay open until 11 p.m. Religious services can resume from the same day.
Shops that have reopened must limit the number of customers they let in and shoppers must cover their mouths and noses with a mask or fabric. 
Kurz said that wearing a face mask would be part of the ""new normality"". Face masks are already compulsory on public transport.

As previously announced, secondary schools are due to reopen in early May for students in their final year. Kurz said schools would reopen for pupils in lower years in an unspecified step-by-step process beginning on May 15.

1367,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 07:33AM ET</span>","In Spain, asparagus lies unpicked as lockdown shuts out migrant workers","TORRE DEL BURGO, Spain, April 21 (Reuters) - About half of farmer Jaime Urbina's asparagus crop lies unpicked in his fields in central Spain as border closures to curb the coronavirus block Eastern European seasonal labourers.
Right at peak food-harvesting time, farms across the nation have a shortfall of thousands of workers. Asparagus, especially, requires a lot of labour as it is harvested piece-by-piece.
""Everyone here in the asparagus sector has this problem - we don't have the manpower,"" Urbina lamented, standing in a field in Torre del Burgo in Guadalajara province.
In normal circumstances, Urbina exports part of his produce. But with so much of the crop lying unpicked, Spain is in the unprecedented situation of having to import asparagus from Germany to meet domestic demand, he said.
Facing one of the world's worst outbreaks of the COVID-19 disease, Spain went into lockdown on March 14, closing borders and confining people to home.
In early April, the government started an initiative to get more workers into the fields, authorizing temporary hiring of tens of thousands of immigrants or jobless people. (Full Story)
But many who have applied to pick asparagus do not have the stamina of the foreign seasonal workers who traditionally move from harvest to harvest across Spain, said Urbina.
""Many people have contacted us but we know from experience that although they start with a lot of gusto, they are not accustomed to this kind of work and it exhausts them,"" he said.
Out of 40 or 50 workers interviewed and hired for the lockdown harvest, only around 10 remain, he said.
In a muddy field, labourers bend to cut the green spears with a long curved knife. They place the asparagus in plastic boxes that are collected by tractor. The vegetable is then brought to the warehouse and bundled ready for sale.
In the packing shed is Elena Garcia, a self-employed beautician who worked in a hairdresser's until losing her job due to the lockdown.
""I think it's harder working out in the field than here packing. Here the work is tough but I get along fine,"" she said.

1369,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>","India's virus lockdown gives world's most polluted capital clear skies, clean air","By Neha Arora and Mayank Bhardwaj
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Residents of New Delhi are experiencing the longest spell of clean air on record, according to government data, as a stringent lockdown to prevent the spread of novel coronavirus drastically cuts pollution in the world's most polluted capital. 
With all transport and construction suspended, good air has emerged as one of the few positive byproducts of the lockdown to stem the virus, that has infected more than 17,000 people and claimed over 500 lives in India. 
A combination of industrial, agricultural and vehicle pollution blankets New Delhi and dozens of other Indian cities with a thick grey smog for several months of the year. Delhi was the world's most polluted capital for the second year running in 2019, according to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that gathers air quality data globally. 
But during the first 25 days of the lockdown that began on March 22, the concentration of poisonous PM2.5 particles in a cubic metre of air averaged at 44.18, according to a Reuters analysis of government data, indicating a rare ""good"" rating, the safest level on the scale.
That is sharply down from an average concentration of 81.88, recorded between March 22 and April 15 of 2019, according to the analysis of data gathered by the state-run Central Pollution Control Board. IQ AirVisual said New Delhi's average annual concentration of PM2.5 in a cubic metre of air was 98.6 in 2019. 
""Clean air has come as a boon,"" said Rakesh Singh, a computer engineer who lives in Noida, a satellite city of New Delhi. ""Breathing good air will only boost my immunity against the coronavirus."" 
The reading is the best on record for the city since the government began collecting detailed data. New Delhi had few pollution monitors before 2016, making like-for-like comparisons before then difficult. 
Vehicular exhaust and dust from construction work significantly contributes to air pollution in New Delhi. 
India's sprawling capital city has nearly 10 million vehicles, more than the other three major cities - Mumbai, Chennai and Kolkata - put together.
Shutting down India's $2.9 trillion economy has also significantly cut India's fuel and power demand, helping pollution levels plummet.
As power demand plunged, 11 of the 12 coal-fired plants situated within a 300 km (185-mile) radius of New Delhi have closed their operations, said Sunil Dahiya, an analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA). Consumption of diesel is down by nearly a quarter year-on-year, he added. 
But while the 20 million inhabitants of New Delhi will be breathing good air ahead of Earth Day on Wednesday, the respite from the pollution could be short-lived.
Experts warn that air quality will drop sharply once the government lifts the lockdown, that is scheduled to run until at least May 3.
""After the lockdown, we'll see new stimulus packages and revival plans for the economy, and my biggest fear is that the environment will be the first casualty,"" said Vimlendu Jha, an environmental expert who founded the activist group Swechha.

1370,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Explainer: Netanyahu hangs on in unity government in deal after inconclusive Israeli elections,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz have signed an agreement for a unity government under which they will take turns leading Israel after three elections that neither won.
Here are some questions and answers about the complicated power-sharing deal.
WHO IS PRIME MINISTER AND FOR HOW LONG?
Currently head of a caretaker government after an election on March 2 and similarly inconclusive ballots in April and September last year, Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud party, will serve as prime minister of a new administration for 18 months. He will then hand over to centrist Blue and White leader Gantz, who will also serve for a year and a half.
Once the new government is sworn in - within the next three weeks - Gantz, 60, will become defence minister and also ""substitute prime minister"" under Netanyahu, 70. Netanyahu will be ""substitute prime minister"" when it is Gantz's turn to lead.
WHAT ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S COMPOSITION AND POLICIES?
Netanyahu's current government is comprised of right-wing and Jewish religious parties, a bloc of 59 of parliament's 120 seats. Even if some pull out over the unity deal with Gantz, the 17 legislators behind the former armed forces chief should ensure a measure of stability.
Peacemaking with the Palestinians, long on hold, is another matter.
The coalition agreement, while stating that the new government will strive for peace, may also move towards implementation of Netanyahu's plan to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank - de facto annexation of land Palestinians seek for a state.
Such a step, which Netanyahu said will also include formal annexation of the West Bank's Jordan Valley, would have to be approved by the United States, according to the unity deal.
U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, embraced by Israel and rejected by the Palestinians - awards Israel most of the land it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Under the power-sharing pact, the new Israeli government would not consider the territorial moves until July 1, to enable it to focus first on the coronavirus crisis. 
WHAT HAPPENS WITH NETANYAHU'S CORRUPTION TRIAL?
As prime minister, Netanyahu can remain in office while under indictment.
His trial is due to open on May 24, after being postponed for two months because of the coronavirus crisis. By agreeing to the unity deal, Netanyahu will be able to argue his case against charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust from the position of premier.
Should the Supreme Court intervene and rule that Netanyahu can indeed be barred from heading a government because of the criminal proceedings against him, a new election would be called, under the unity deal. A petition asking the court to step in was filed by the Movement for Quality Government in Israel on Monday.
WILL THE NETANYAHU-GANTZ ROTATION REALLY HAPPEN?
Political pundits have been sceptical that Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving leader and dubbed ""the magician"" by many supporters, will actually transfer power to Gantz.
With sleight of hand in mind, the agreement calls for Gantz to take over as prime minister in the months leading to a new election should Netanyahu opt to dissolve parliament and not go through with the handover.

1372,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 05:35AM ET</span>",Driver killed in WHO vehicle carrying virus swabs in Myanmar's Rakhine,"(Reuters) - A World Health Organization vehicle carrying swabs from patients to be tested for coronavirus came under gunfire in Myanmar's western Rakhine state and the driver was killed, the United Nations said on Tuesday.
It did not say who carried out the attack in a region where fighting between the army and Arakan Army insurgents has intensified despite global calls for a ceasefire over the pandemic that killed five and caused 119 infections in Myanmar.
The driver, Pyae Sone Win Maung, had died in the state's Minbya township on Monday, the United Nations office in Myanmar said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post. 
""The WHO colleague was driving a marked UN vehicle from Sittwe to Yangon, transporting COVID19 surveillance samples in support of the Ministry of Health and Sports,"" it added.
Both Myanmar's army and the Arakan Army denied responsibility for the attack and accused each other.
In a statement, the information ministry said the UN-marked car came under gunfire from insurgents while carrying swabs from Rakhine to the biggest city, Yangon. The Arakan Army blamed the military.
Government troops and insurgents from the Arakan Army, which wants greater autonomy for Myanmar's western region, have been locked in fierce fighting for more than a year, but clashes have intensified recently.
""Why would the military shoot them?"" replied Major General Tun Tun Nyi, a military spokesman, when Reuters asked about the incident by telephone. 
""They are working for us, for our country. We have the responsibility for that... Everyone who has a brain knows that. If you are a Myanmar citizen, you shouldn’t ask that.""
Another healthcare worker injured in the attack is being treated in hospital.
The driver's father, Htay Win Maung, said his son, aged 28, had worked for the WHO in Sittwe for three years.
""My heart is broken for him,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""I am trying to calm myself thinking he died in serving his duty at the frontline. He went there in the midst of fighting when many people didn’t dare to go.""
Britain and the United States are among the countries that have called for an end to fighting in Rakhine, not least to help protect vulnerable communities from the pandemic. 
The Arakan Army declared a month-long ceasefire for April, along with two ethnic armed groups, citing the pandemic. The army rejected the plea, with a spokesman saying a previous truce declared by the government went unheeded by insurgents.

1375,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 03:05AM ET</span>",Bookseller who fled Hong Kong attacked with red paint in Taiwan,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Hong Kong bookseller who fled to Taiwan amid fears of Chinese persecution was attacked on Tuesday by a man who threw red paint at him, just days before he was set to open a new bookshop in Taipei.
Lam Wing-kee, who sought refuge in Taiwan last year after he was detained by Chinese agents in 2015 while working at a bookshop in Hong Kong that sold books critical of the Chinese leadership, had red paint poured over him in a Taipei cafe.
The attack came days after Hong Kong police launched a surprise crackdown on pro-democracy activists. 
A growing number of protesters have been fleeing Chinese-ruled Hong Kong to democratic Taiwan, which has repeatedly rejected Beijing's proposals to rule the island with the ""one country, two systems"" model it uses for Hong Kong.
Taiwan has also voiced its strong support for the Hong Kong protesters.
""I was attacked with red paint in the cafe,"" Lam told Reuters by telephone while assisting the police with their investigation. 
""Some people don't want me to open the bookshop in Taiwan,"" Lam said, describing the attack as a threat by supporters of Beijing.
Police are hunting for the assailant, reviewing security camera footage from the scene, the official Central News Agency reported.
Lam's incarceration was part of a coordinated operation by China’s security apparatus that led to five booksellers disappearing from locations in China, Hong Kong and Thailand in late 2015, and later showing up in Chinese detention where they were forced to make confessions on public television. 
The case generated huge controversy, and undermined public confidence in China’s commitment to preserving Hong Kong’s freedoms. 
Before it was shutdown by authorities in Hong Kong, Lam's ""Causeway Bay Books"", had become a symbol of resistance to perceived Chinese encroachments on Hong Kong's liberties. Lam's new shop in Taipei will bear the same name.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, which oversees the island's policy towards China, condemned the attack and said anyone who sought to challenge the law would be ""severely punished"".
Lam last year decided to move to Taiwan months before a controversial law was expected to be passed in Hong Kong that would allow individuals to be sent to China for trial.
The incident on Tuesday was the latest attack on Hong Kong pro-democracy activists in Taiwan. Activists told Reuters last year they were coming under increased surveillance and harassment from pro-China media outlets and unofficial ""operatives"".
Hong Kong singer and activist Denise Ho was attacked in September by a masked man who threw red paint at her at a pro-Hong Kong democracy rally in Taipei. 
In July 2018, two Taiwanese were convicted of assaulting Hong Kong activists meeting with independence advocates in Taipei.

1376,By Bloomberg,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 02:45AM ET</span>","Kim Jong Un Was in Critical Condition After Surgery, U.S. Official Says","(Bloomberg) --
The U.S. is seeking details about Kim Jong Un’s health after receiving information that the North Korean leader was in critical condition after undergoing cardiovascular surgery last week, U.S. officials said.
The Trump administration wasn’t sure of Kim’s current condition, said the officials, who asked not to be identified. One of the officials said the White House was told that Kim took a turn for the worse after the surgery, while CNN earlier cited a U.S. official with direct knowledge saying the North Korean leader may be in “grave danger.” The White House declined to comment.
South Korea’s Yonhap News on Tuesday cited an unidentified official in President Moon Jae-in’s office saying that Kim was conducting “normal activities” in a rural part of the country. The North Korean leader is being assisted by close aides and no special movements were detected, the report said. Kang Min-seok, a spokesman at South Korea’s presidential office, said earlier there was nothing to confirm on speculation over Kim’s health.
The news around Kim’s health spurred the benchmark Kospi gauge to extend losses to as much as 3% while the won slid 0.9% against the dollar.
The health of Kim, 36 and a heavy smoker, is one of North Korea’s most closely guarded secrets, typically only known by a handful of people in the inner circle of leadership. While North Korea had scaled down major events as it battles the coronavirus pandemic, speculation about Kim had been growing since his unprecedented absence from April 15 celebrations for the birthday of his grandfather and state founder Kim Il Sung, one of the biggest days on the country’s calendar.
Even the most well-informed North Korea experts find it hard to tell what’s happening in the secretive state. The Daily NK, a Seoul-based website that gathers information from informants inside the isolated nation, separately reported that Kim underwent a “cardiovascular surgical procedure” and was now mostly recovered. Reuters cited an official with the Chinese Communist Party’s International Liaison Department saying that Kim was not believed to be critically ill.
Any leadership crisis in North Korea could potentially have serious ramifications for regional stability, as well as for talks with the U.S. over the country’s nuclear arsenal. Kim, who took power in 2011 following his father’s 17-year reign, developed the capability to deliver a nuclear warhead to any part of the U.S. before engaging in direct talks with President Donald Trump over his arsenal and sanctions imposed on the state.
“When Kim Jong Un came to power, his path to leadership had been carefully cultivated by his father’s guidance and maneuvering,” said Mintaro Oba, a former U.S. diplomat who was responsible for Korean Peninsula issues. “Now there is no clear transition plan and no clear future leader. There would be a great amount of uncertainty in North Korea, and potentially, major power struggles and internal instability.”
White Horse
Kim has been shown in state media in recent months appearing at military drills and riding a white horse on the country’s revered Mt. Paektu, where state propaganda says his grandfather used as a guerrilla base to fight Japanese colonial occupiers. North Korea’s state media reported on April 11 that Kim attended a Politburo meeting of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. The next day it said he inspected a military unit, but didn’t reveal the date of that visit.
South Korea’s Unification Ministry said Friday it was “inappropriate” to speculate about the reasons for Kim’s absence. Kim has made 17 public appearances this year that were mentioned in state media -- at a pace of a little more than one a week -- the ministry said. That’s slightly down from 84 public appearances last year.
South Korean intelligence said Kim Jong Un married Ri Sol Ju, a former singer, in 2009. They are thought to have three children, but there is no official mention of their offspring. Dennis Rodman, the offbeat basketball great who visited Kim in North Korea, said in 2013 he held the leader’s baby girl in his arms, a daughter named Ju Ae.While there’s been little time for him to groom a successor, Kim raised the status of his younger sister Kim Yo Jong as a key player in the secretive state. She was thrust into the global spotlight when she served as envoy to the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and became the first member of the immediate ruling family to visit Seoul.

1377,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 21, 2020 01:20AM ET</span>",Two U.S. warships in South China Sea amid China-Malaysia standoff,"By A. Ananthalakshmi and Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Two U.S. warships are operating in the South China Sea, the Navy said on Tuesday, with three regional security sources saying they were near an area of a standoff between China and Malaysia. 
The Haiyang Dizhi 8, a Chinese government research ship, was spotted last week conducting a survey close to an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia’s state oil company Petronas, months after it undertook a similar patrol off Vietnam. 
The incident prompted the United States to call on China to stop its “bullying behaviour” in the disputed waters, citing concern over Beijing's provocative actions towards offshore oil and gas developments there.
The U.S. State Department has said China was taking advantage of the region's focus on the coronavirus pandemic to ""coerce its neighbours"".
The USS America amphibious assault ship and the USS Bunker Hill, a guided missile cruiser, have been deployed and were operating in the South China Sea, U.S. Indo-Pacific Command spokeswoman Nicole Schwegman said on Tuesday. 
""Through our continued operational presence in the South China Sea, we are working ... to promote freedom of navigation and overflight, and the international principles that underpin security and prosperity for the Indo-Pacific,"" Schwegman said in an emailed statement to Reuters. 
""The U.S. supports the efforts of our allies and partners to determine their own economic interests.""
Rear Admiral Fred Kacher, commander of the USS America Expeditionary Strike Group, told Reuters that his forces had interacted with Chinese naval forces in the South China Sea this week.
""All our interactions continue to be safe and professional with them,"" Kacher said in a telephone interview from the USS America.
Schwegman did not state the exact location of the warships but security sources said they were close to the Haiyang Dizhi 8 and the Petronas-operated West Capella drillship. The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.
The area is near waters claimed by both Vietnam and Malaysia as well by China, through its sweeping claim to most of the South China Sea within its U-shaped 'nine-dash line' that is not recognised by its neighbours or most of the world. 
China has denied reports of a stand-off, saying that the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was conducting normal activities. 
""The ‘confrontation’ at sea you mention did not happen,"" the foreign ministry said in a faxed response to Reuters' questions on Monday. 
Petronas and Malaysia's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Chinese survey vessel's moves this month come as Beijing ramps up coronavirus diplomacy, donating large supplies of medical equipment and aid to Southeast Asian countries.
A team of Chinese medical experts arrived this week in Malaysia, which has reported more than 5,400 coronavirus infections. 
The United States has accused China of taking advantage of the distraction of the pandemic to advance its presence in the South China Sea.
On Sunday, Vietnam protested after China said it had established two administrative districts on the Paracel and Spratly islands in the disputed waters.

Trouble had first broken out in Villeneuve-La-Garenne, north of the French capital, on Saturday night, after a motorcyclist collided with an unmarked police car during a chase.
The male driver had to go to hospital for treatment, while French police have said they will launch an internal inquiry into the incident.

1381,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 10:16PM ET</span>","Mexican president tells gangs to stop donating food, end crime instead","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president chastised drug gangs on Monday, telling them to end violence instead of distributing food, after several reports across the country in recent days showed armed narcos handing out care packages stamped with cartel logos.
Imploring criminals to behave better, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador declared that the care packages filled with basic foodstuffs and cleaning supplies are not helpful.
""These criminal organizations that have been seen distributing the packages, this isn't helpful. What helps is them stopping their bad deeds,"" he told reporters at a news conference.
The leftist president, who has advocated a less confrontational approach than his predecessors to taming raging cartel violence, said gang members should refrain from harming others and instead think of the suffering they cause to their own families and the mothers of their victims.
Mexico notched a homicide record of 34,582 dead during Lopez Obrador's first full year in office in 2019, as the president advocated for more social spending to address the root causes of crime.
Last week, reports first circulated of several Mexican cartels deploying members to dole out aid packages to help cash-strapped residents ride out the coronavirus pandemic.
A daughter of jailed drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman was among those spotted handing out the packages stamped with her own company's ""El Chapo 701"" logo, which includes the image of her infamous father.
The boxes included cooking oil, rice, sugar and other items were distributed in Guadalajara, Mexico's second-biggest city.[nL8N2C40PE]
Beyond the Guzman-linked Sinaloa Cartel, other gangs have similarly courted publicity with care packages for mostly poor residents, including the Jalisco New Generation and Los Durango cartels. Photos posted on social media on Monday showed heavily armed members from both handing out packages including toilet paper and shampoo. 
Lopez Obrador, meanwhile, has come under sharp criticism for not advocating more financial support for companies or jobless workers.
Over the past month, the country's economy has dramatically slowed due to coronavirus containment measures. 

To date, there are more than 8,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as well as nearly 700 deaths attributed to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus.

1383,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>",Muted celebrations as Britain's Queen Elizabeth turns 94,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's record-breaking Queen Elizabeth turns 94 on Tuesday but the coronavirus lockdown means there will be little fanfare to mark the occasion.
Elizabeth, the world's eldest and longest-reigning monarch, typically spends her birthday privately without much public celebration but this year the event will be even more muted.
Royal birthdays and anniversaries are traditionally marked by ceremonial gun salutes, in which blank rounds are fired from various locations across London, but the queen felt it would be inappropriate to allow this to go ahead given the circumstances.
The latest official figures show that about 16,000 Britons infected with the new coronavirus have died in hospital, the fifth highest number globally. The nation is in its fourth week of lockdown, with most businesses closed and citizens ordered to stay at home.
Flags are usually flown on government buildings to mark the queen's birthday but officials have been told that this year not everyone would be expected to arrange for that to happen.
The queen herself is staying at Windsor Castle, west of London, with her 98-year-old husband Prince Philip. 
From there, she has issued a number of rallying messages to the nation, including only the fifth televised address of her 68-year reign.
On Monday Philip made a statement, a rare event since he retired from public life three years ago, to thank those involved in the response to the coronavirus crisis.
Elizabeth, who was born on April 21, 1926, in Bruton Street, central London, grew up not expecting to become queen. Her father, George VI, only took the crown when his elder brother Edward VIII abdicated in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
Elizabeth ascended to the throne in 1952 at the age of 25, and surpassed her great-great-grandmother Queen Victoria as Britain's longest reigning monarch in September 2015.
""Inevitably a long life can pass by many milestones,"" she said at the time.

Buckingham Palace last month said a parade to celebrate the queen's official birthday, which usually takes place in June, would not go ahead in its traditional form in light of restrictions on social gatherings.

PORTAPIQUE, Nova Scotia/OTTAWA (Reuters) - The death toll from the worst mass shooting in Canadian history rose to 19, including a police officer and the gunman, Canadian police said on Monday, adding that they expected to uncover more fatalities from the weekend massacre in Nova Scotia.
The gunman, who at one point masqueraded as a policeman and also painstakingly disguised his car to look like a police cruiser, shattered the peace of rural communities in the Atlantic province during a 12-hour rampage that started late on Saturday, authorities said on Sunday.
""We're relatively confident we've identified all the crime scenes,"" Nova Scotia RCMP Chief Superintendent Chris Leather told reporters on Monday, but said that fires set at some of those sites, mostly residences, made the search for other victims difficult.
""We believe there may be victims still within the remains of those homes which burnt to the ground,"" Leather said.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police identified the gunman as 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, who worked as a denturist. Police said they had yet to determine a motive.
Police said on Sunday they had ended the threat posed by Wortman, who was dead, but they would not confirm a report by the CTV network that the RCMP had shot him. 
RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp on Sunday there was no indication at that time that the killings were terrorism-related. Police also said there was no apparent link between Wortman and at least some of his victims.
Lucki told reporters on Monday the investigation was going to be very long and complicated, adding the suspect was not well-known to police.
Leather said the suspect's ability to move around the province was ""greatly benefited"" by the fact that he had a vehicle that looked identical in every way to a marked police car and that he was wearing a police uniform that was either a very good fabrication or an actual uniform.
Earlier, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau told reporters: A gunman claimed the lives of at least 18 people, among them a woman in uniform whose job it is to protect lives even if it endangers her own."" 
He was referring to veteran RCMP Constable Heidi Stevenson, who was killed in the shooting spree on Sunday. She was a mother of two.
Another RCMP officer was wounded and was recovering at home, the police union said.
Trudeau said the killings ""happened in small towns: Portapique, Truro, Milford and Enfield, places where people have deep roots, places where people know their neighbors and look out for one another."" 

""Now these communities are in mourning and Canada is in mourning with them,"" Trudeau said.

The power sharing agreement clinched after weeks of negotiations gave a clear end-date for the premiership of Netanyahu, Israel's longest serving leader, who has become for many the face of the nation.
Netanyahu, who is under criminal indictment in three corruption cases, will remain prime minister for 18 months after which Gantz will replace him, according to the agreement signed by both men. 
Netanyahu's trial on charges that include bribery, fraud and breach of trust is due to begin on May 24. He denies any wrongdoing. 
Over the past year the right-wing leader, in power for more than a decade, has presided over a caretaker government following three inconclusive elections in April and September 2019 and on March 2, just as the country began grappling with the coronavirus outbreak.
""We have prevented a fourth election. We will protect democracy. We will fight coronavirus and care for all Israel's citizens,"" Gantz said on Twitter after signing the deal. Netanyahu Tweeted the Israeli flag. 
Until he takes over as premier, Gantz, a former armed forces chief, will serve as defence minister with his political allies receiving the same number of ministerial portfolios as Likud.
The coalition agreement, released to the media, also states that while the new government will strive for peace and regional stability, plans to extend Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements in the occupied West Bank - land that the Palestinians seek for a state - could be promoted. 
The move would mean a de-facto annexation of territory presently under Israeli military control. It would have to be greenlighted by the United States, after which Netanyahu would be permitted to advance plans from July 1, the agreement says. 
""Given the Trump administration’s close relationship with Netanyahu, we have very serious, challenging days ahead,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official. ""This is extremely dangerous not just for Palestine, for Israel, for the region, but for the world."" 
A U.S. peace proposal announced by President Donald Trump in January was embraced by Israel and rejected flat out by the Palestinians, partly because it awards Israel most of what it has sought during decades of conflict, including nearly all the occupied land on which it has built settlements.
But the new Israeli government's first priority would be managing the coronavirus crisis. 
Israel, with a population of about 9 million, has so far confirmed more than 13,500 COVID-19 cases and 173 deaths. Restrictions to curb coronavirus transmission have sent unemployment above 26%. 
On the campaign trail, Gantz pledged not to serve in a government led by a prime minister facing criminal charges, but he backtracked last month, saying the enormity of the coronavirus crisis necessitated an emergency unity government.

The decision to join forces with Netanyahu enraged many of Gantz's political allies who split from the party and will be part of the opposition in Israel's 120-member parliament.

Kashmir Police Chief Vijay Kumar told Reuters freelance Kashmiri photojournalist Masrat Zehra, a contributor to various international publications, had been booked under India's Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act for her ""anti-national"" posts on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other social media.
The law allows the government to designate individuals as terrorists and empowers India’s National Investigation Agency to investigate such cases. 
Police have not arrested the journalists so far.
""The post by the (Facebook) users can provoke the public to disturb the law and order besides glorifying the anti-national activities”, Kumar said, in an apparent reference to Zehra's postings on social media.
Recent feeds from Zehra, who has accused the government of censorship, have focused on militancy in Kashmir, as well as scenic beauty and COVID-19 related issues.
""They want to silence and suppress me for bringing out the repressed voices and stories from Kashmir,"" she said on Monday.
The government in August revoked the constitutional autonomy of Jammu and Kashmir, India’s only Muslim-majority state, splitting it into two federal territories in a bid to integrate it fully with India and to rein in militancy.
Kashmir is claimed in full by both India and Pakistan, which have gone to war twice over it, and both rule parts of it. India’s portion has been plagued by separatist violence since the late 1980s.
The change in status was accompanied by a security crackdown that included the severing of telecommunications links and curbs on travel and the deployment of thousands of troops.
Kumar also said Pirzada Ashiq, a journalist working with the Hindu newspaper, had been summoned for publicizing “fake news” in the newspaper about a gunbattle in which two militants were killed last week.
Senior staff at the newspaper could not be reached for immediate comment.
“The details reflected in the news item were found factually incorrect,"" he said, adding that ""district authorities” had not been sought out for confirmation.
Kumar added that the journalist would be arrested if he were found to have acted deliberately.
The Kashmir Press Club condemned what it described as harassment in the summoning of journalists by police in Kashmir.
“Even in this time of Coronavirus pandemic journalists in Kashmir have been called to police stations and forced to present themselves to explain their stories”, a statement issued by press club said.
“Government especially the police, need to understand there is a vast difference between journalism and cybercrime”, the statement said.

State media said Assad conveyed condolences to Iran, where more than 5,200 people have died from the disease.
Echoing comments by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, Zarif, who was also wearing gloves, was quoted as saying the U.S. administration showed its ""inhumane reality"" by its refusal to lift sanctions on Syria and Iran when coronavirus was spreading around the world.
Assad said the handling of the crisis showed the West's moral failure. 
U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has held out the possibility that the United States may consider easing sanctions on Iran and other nations to help fight the epidemic but given no concrete sign it plans to do so.
Speaking last month, Pompeo said humanitarian supplies were exempt from sanctions Washington reimposed on Tehran after President Donald Trump abandoned Iran's 2015 multilateral deal to limit its nuclear programme.
The United States has also ratcheted up sanctions on Syria since the uprising against Assad began in March 2001. The State Department says it is ""trying to deprive the regime of the resources it needs to continue violence against civilians"".
The Syrian government says it has 39 confirmed cases of coronavirus and three dead. Medics and witnesses say there are many more. Officials, who deny any cover-up, have imposed a lockdown and measures including a night-time curfew to stem the pandemic.

The presence of thousands of Iranian militias fighting alongside Assad's forces in Syria and Iranian pilgrims have been cited by some medics and humanitarian workers as a main source of the contagion in Syria.

PARIS (Reuters) - France will look to avoid setting different rules for older people and other forms of discrimination once the government starts easing its coronavirus confinement measures, the French President's office said. 
France's lockdown to combat the outbreak, which like in Spain, Italy and many other European countries includes restrictions on store openings and people's movements, will remain in place until at least May 11, President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week. 
After that, schools and shops are set to reopen, though it is still unclear at what speed France will allow some businesses like hotels or cafes to restart, and whether it plans to lift home confinement recommendations for everyone at the same time. 
Speculation had grown in recent days over whether older people, who are considered more vulnerable to the deadly virus, would be told to stay at home for longer. 
Comments this week in France's Senate by Professor Jean-François Delfraissy - who heads the scientific council advising the government on the epidemic - in particular sparked a backlash, after he said that for people aged 65 or 70, the confinement order could continue. 

""The President has followed the growing debate about the situation for elderly citizens after May 11,"" the Elysee palace said in comments sent to Reuters on Saturday. 
""He does not want there to be any discrimination among citizens after May 11 in the context of a gradual easing of confinement measures, and will appeal to people's individual responsibility."" 
France's registered death toll from coronavirus infections neared 19,000 on Friday, but most data provided further indications that the spread of the disease was slowing after the one-month-old national lockdown.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador in Moscow accused Russian authorities on Monday of making a mockery of justice after he was turned away for a second time from what he called a ""secret"" trial behind closed doors of an ex-U.S. Marine charged with espionage. 
Russia last month began the trial of U.S. national Paul Whelan on charges of spying after his arrest by Russian security agents in a hotel room sting operation in December 2018. He denies the charge. 
The case, as well as that of Michael Calvey, a U.S. investor charged with embezzlement in Russia, has complicated already strained relations between Moscow and Washington. 
Whelan, who also holds British, Canadian and Irish citizenship, faces up to 20 years if found guilty. 
The Moscow court had said the trial would involve classified information and would therefore not be open to the public, but U.S. Ambassador John Sullivan said he had tried to attend the hearing in Moscow on Monday and had been turned away. 
""The fact that it is a closed hearing, that it is a secret trial – Paul hasn't seen the evidence against him – it makes a mockery of justice,"" Sullivan said in remarks carried on the U.S. Embassy's website.
He urged Russia's authorities to ensure Whelan would receive a fair and impartial trial, to grant him a phone call to his family and to allow him medical treatment. 
""He hasn't been allowed to make a phone call, to speak to anyone in his family in 16 months,"" Sullivan said. 
Whelan, who turned 50 in custody last month, has used his appearances at hearings since his arrest to allege he has been ill-treated by prison guards and also denied medical attention. 
Russian authorities have dismissed his remarks and accused Whelan of faking health problems in custody to draw attention to his case.
The trial's preliminary hearings began on March 23 even as many court hearings have been put on hold because of the coronavirus lockdown.

Moscow says Whelan was caught red-handed with classified information, but his lawyer has said he was set up and thought he was receiving holiday photos from a Russian acquaintance.

COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Denmark's hairdressers flung open their doors on Monday after a month-long coronavirus lockdown, fixing a horror show of home haircuts and giving hope to other Europeans that their bad hair days will soon end as well.
""Basically for the next two weeks we are super packed,"" hairdresser Erik Bjornsson said as he worked in the spacious Street Cut salon in downtown Copenhagen, shaking his head at the early procession of amateur attempts at a chop.
""I want to take this opportunity to say to people who actually didn't cut their hair at home - thank you very much.""
Across Europe, people under lockdown are nursing a burning desire to visit a hair salon or barber shop. In Greece, a third of people surveyed by MRB pollsters put this at the top of the list of things they want to do when the health crisis ends.
Greeks still don't know when their hairdressers will reopen, but the Swiss only have to wait one more week. Germany, Austria and perhaps Portugal follow. Everywhere, though, the thrill of a professional shampoo and cut is tinged with anxiety.
In Copenhagen's Street Cut salon, hairdressers drape clients in disposable plastic gowns, clean their scissors and combs and the surfaces of chairs and benches between sittings. They don't serve coffee as normal or leave magazines in piles to be read.
But neither they nor their clients wear masks.
Denmark, which locked down early in Europe, has relatively few coronavirus infections and deaths, and masks are not mandatory. But in harder-hit countries, they may be required.
""We need a strict hygiene plan. If safety is not good enough, they should not open,"" said Melanie Chatfield, 26, a hairdresser in Berlin where salons are set to reopen on May 4.
""I don't think anyone's life depends on getting their hair cut or dyed.""
For tech executive Martin Boston, a regular at the Street Cut salon, it was a relief to have his hair professionally cut again. He can't wait for his colleagues to do the same.

""To be honest I have a lot of video conferences and to look at people who have cut themselves - it looks like they've been through a wood chipper,"" he said.

BERLIN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Germans returned to the shops on Monday, craving retail therapy after a month of lockdown, but Chancellor Angela Merkel urged them to remain disciplined to avoid a relapse in the fight against the coronavirus.
Shops up to 800 sq metres, as well as car and bicycle dealers and bookstores, are allowed to reopen this week under an agreement with the leaders of Germany's 16 states, all keen to start the long haul of pulling the economy out of recession. Schools are set to begin reopening in two weeks.
Europe's largest economy has relied more on domestic demand in recent years as the strength of its traditional export engine has faded, and the move echoes a slow easing in neighbouring countries, equally desperate to revive business and society.
""We need life again. This whole time it was like a ghost town,"" said Michaela Frieser, not wearing a face mask, in Frankfurt's main shopping district. ""The sun's out, we saved enough money and now we need to go out and spend it!""
The federal and state governments have strongly recommended that Germans wear face masks when shopping and on public transport, and some states have even made that compulsory.
Gertrude Sietzy, wearing a face mask and disposable gloves nearby, was thrilled to get outside.
""I don't like ordering on the internet,"" she said, adding that, if shoppers kept their distance, ""it should work"".
To the east, farmers' markets, craft shops, car dealerships and dog grooming salons opened in the Czech Republic, which had imposed one of Europe's earliest and strictest lockdowns.
""This is relief from the stress that we will have to throw away the harvest,"" vegetable grower Milan Vystejn said at his stand in Prague's Tylovo Square (NYSE:SQ).
Germany's southern neighbour Austria took a first step in relaxing restrictions last Tuesday by letting DIY stores, garden centres and smaller shops reopen, and plans to reopen museums and libraries from mid-May.
SPLIT CLASSES
To the west, Luxembourg said a similar selection of stores could reopen, and that schools would begin reopening from May 4, starting with final year pupils taking exams. But when all schools reopen, classes will be split into two halves that each alternate between a week in school and a week studying at home.
Merkel told officials from her Christian Democrats (CDU) that the danger of infection remained high in Germany, after weekend sunshine drew many into parks.
She told reporters it would take 14 days to see if the easing was pushing up the infection rate, adding: ""We must remain vigilant and disciplined.""
There was a risk that contagion would surge if the restrictions were eased too fast, and then they would have to be tightened again, Merkel said.
Germany has the fifth highest COVID-19 caseload behind the United States, Spain, Italy and France, but has kept fatalities down thanks to early and extensive testing, and has only a third of the deaths of New York city alone.
Its total of confirmed cases rose by 1,775 to 141,672 on Sunday, the second consecutive day that the number of new infections had fallen.
The death toll rose by 110 to 4,404, the tally from the Robert Koch Institute showed.
The gradual easing provides for social distancing rules to remain in place until May 3. Schools will start opening from May 4, with priority for final-year students. Hairdressers can also reopen then. The group will meet again on April 30 to review how to proceed after May 3.
The Germany economy is now in a severe recession, according to the central bank, the Bundesbank, which said recovery was unlikely to be quick as many coronavirus restrictions could stay in place for some time.

The government has tried to cushion the economic effect of the shutdown with measures including a 750 billion euro ($815 billion) stimulus package.

Prosecutors said Milen Tsvetkov, 53, died after the 22-year-old driver of a high-performance car struck his vehicle in the capital Sofia on Sunday, Orthodox Easter in the Balkan country.
They said the driver was under the influence of drugs and detained for 72 hours while the Sofia City Court prepared a ruling to keep him in custody pending trial. He faces a jail term of between three and 15 years if convicted.
""Tsvetkov had stopped in his car at a red traffic light and a speeding jeep crashed into it,"" a witness told local media. 
The social media uproar over the death of Tsvetkov, one of Bulgaria's most prominent TV presenters, underscored growing public concern over Bulgaria's road fatality rate, the highest in the 27-nation European Union.
A total of 623 people were killed in car accidents in 2019, and 611 deaths the previous year, Interior Ministry data show. Last year 8,482 people were injured in road accidents.
""I hope the tragic fate of Milen Tsvetkov will finally turn into a powerful signal that ruthless measures are needed against the war on the roads,"" said journalist Georgi Filipov, who was severely injured in another car crash last year.
Bribes often enable Bulgarians to escape punishment for intoxication while behind the wheel. Some politicians said after Tsvetkov's death that a crackdown was urgently needed.
""It is time to adopt a law with a minimum sentence of 20 years behind bars if you drive drunk or drugged, without a licence, for speeding or driving an illegally tuned car to the extent that you cannot control it,"" said Nastimir Ananiev, leader of the opposition Volt party.
The Bulgarian government had no immediate comment.

1401,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",Burkina security forces accused of killing 31 unarmed civilians: rights group,"OUAGADOUGOU (Reuters) - International advocacy group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said on Monday that it believed security forces in Burkina Faso had summarily executed 31 unarmed detainees earlier this month during operations against Islamist militants.
The bullet-riddled bodies of the men from the Fulani ethnic group were discovered in the northern town of Djibo on April 9, shortly after they had been arrested by security forces and taken away in a convoy, 17 witnesses and people with knowledge of the situation told HRW.
A government spokesman did not respond to repeated requests from Reuters for comment about the incident, including questions on Monday about HRW's report. 
The day after the incident, a researcher from Amnesty International tweeted that, according to multiple witnesses, security forces had executed 29 men in Djibo.
The government is struggling to contain jihadist groups in northern Burkina Faso who have stoked ethnic conflict by closely associating themselves with Fulani herders. As a result, Fulani civilians have borne the brunt of reprisals by soldiers and vigilantes, rights groups say. 
Since 2017, armed Islamist groups, some with ties to al Qaeda and Islamic State, have killed more than 300 civilians in Burkina Faso, while the government has killed several hundred men for their alleged support of these groups, according to HRW.
Burkinabe officials have promised to investigate such allegations in the past but rights group say the government has not done enough to hold perpetrators accountable.
""The Burkinabe security forces apparently executed 31 men in a brutal mockery of a counter-terrorism operation that may amount to a war crime and could fuel further atrocities,"" said Corinne Dufka, HRW's director for the conflict-hit Sahel region in West Africa.
""The government should stop the abuse, fully investigate this terrible incident, and commit to a rights-respecting counterterrorism strategy,"" Dufka said in the report. 

Last year was Burkina Faso's deadliest in recent memory, and the violence has continued unabated this year. Two attacks in northern regions in January killed 36 and 39 people, respectively, while at least 43 people were killed in raids on northern villages by unidentified assailants in March.

""We remain very concerned about reports of his declining physical and mental health, and of his mistreatment in prison,"" the State Department said, adding that it continued to call on Beijing for the release of ""all those unjustly detained,"" saying Washington remained concerned by China's ""weak rule of law, arbitrary detentions and torture in custody.""
A Chinese court in January 2019 had imprisoned the prominent rights lawyer for 4-1/2 years for subversion of state power, after he was tried a month before that in a hearing that rights groups had called a sham.
Wang, who had taken on cases deemed sensitive by Chinese authorities, such as accusations of police torture, had gone missing in August 2015 amid a sweeping crackdown on rights activists and lawyers.
Tensions between Washington and Beijing have escalated over the past month over the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China late last year and since then has infected more than 2.3 million people across the globe.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has repeatedly accused China of attempting to cover up the spread of the outbreak in its early days and failing to share accurate data about the scale of the cases.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's ministry of defence said on Monday it had ordered thousands of troops into a two-week quarantine after a vast Red Square (NYSE:SQ) military parade in Moscow they had been rehearsing for was called off because of the novel coronavirus pandemic. 
Up to 15,000 troops were due to parade alongside military hardware on May 9 to mark the 75th anniversary of the Soviet Union's World War Two victory, an event the Kremlin hoped would showcase Russia's military and diplomatic clout. 
But a sombre President Vladimir Putin was forced to push back the commemorations last week to a later, unspecified date. 
Putin said the Victory Day events, including the parade he personally oversees from a raised stand every year, were ""sacred"" to Russians, but that the coronavirus outbreak in Russia meant the event was too risky to hold. 
TV footage of rehearsals showed thousands of troops marching in lockstep next to one another at a training ground outside Moscow earlier this month. There was no evidence of social distancing and none of them were shown wearing masks. 
All of the soldiers who took part in the rehearsals in Moscow would be sent back to their permanent garrisons across the country where they would be isolated for a fortnight, the defence ministry's Zvezda TV channel said on Monday. 
The ministry did not say if the quarantine was anything more than a precaution and whether any of its soldiers had fallen ill or been put under observation, but that all military vehicles, trains and aircraft used to rebase them would be disinfected. 
The soldiers had been issued personal protective equipment to be rebased, it said.
Russian media reports suggest the virus has in fact spread among those who took part in rehearsals. 
The head of St Petersburg's Nakhimov cadet school, who had been rehearsing for the parade, told the Fontanka media outlet on April 16 that he was in hospital with a fever and had been tested for the coronavirus, though his results had not yet come back. 
Confirmed infections in Russia have risen rapidly this month, despite authorities imposing lockdown restrictions in Moscow and elsewhere. 
Russia's Kommersant newspaper last week reported that, as of the end of March, three people in the military had caught the coronavirus and at least 133 people been put under observation. 

Later that day, the defence ministry said the coronavirus situation was stable and entirely controllable, the RIA news agency reported. On Thursday, however, the ministry said 14 servicemen and a civilian had been diagnosed with the coronavirus at a cadet school in the Siberian region of Tyumen.

The partial re-opening, agreed last week by Chancellor Angela Merkel and regional premiers, started with the oldest students, who will observe strict social distancing as they write their papers.
""I believe the students are ready for their final exams now,"" said Antje Luekemann, headteacher of Berlin's Steglitz High School, where students arrived wearing face masks and disinfecting their hands with sanitiser before sitting down at widely spaced school desks.
""The longer the uncertainty lasts, the more difficult it will be to keep them motivated and that's why I believe it's very important that we received the go-ahead for these exams,"" Luekemann added.
Pupils across the world have been taking their classes over the internet since governments ordered that schools be closed in order to slow the transmission of the new-style coronavirus that has so far killed over 100,000 people around the world.
German authorities last week concluded that social distancing measures, including shop closures, limits on public gatherings and widespread home working had succeeded in slowing the disease's spread sufficiently to allow limited reopening.
The details of how schools will reopen are up to Germany's 16 states to decide. In Berlin, 16-year-olds will follow the 19-year-olds back to class a week later, with other age-groups following in stages over coming months.
Smaller shops also reopened across much of Germany on Monday, though restaurants, cinemas and large stores will remain closed.
Germany has the fifth highest COVID-19 caseload behind the United States, Spain, Italy and France at nearly 142,000 but has kept fatalities down to a relatively low 4,404 thanks to early and extensive testing.

""Of course I'm somewhat worried,"" Luekemann said. ""The more students there are in the building, the more complicated it gets to stick to the framework conditions. Ultimately we are talking about youths here, who might not always be in a position to evaluate dangers 100%,"" she added.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Politicians from Poland's ruling alliance and the opposition began talks on Monday on delaying next month's presidential election due to the coronavirus pandemic, amid deep divisions that could deprive the conservative government of its majority.
The ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) is keen to hold the election on schedule on May 10 because President Andrzej Duda, its ally, is projected to win, though a majority of Poles also now back a delay in the vote due to fears over the coronavirus.
But its junior governing partner, Jaroslaw Gowin's Accord, whose support PiS needs to govern, wants to delay the election by two years, on condition that Duda would then stand down. This option would require constitutional change, and therefore the support of the main opposition party, Civic Platform (PO).
PO leader Borys Budka said on Monday he believed an election could not be held safely in Poland before May 2021.
""I believe we can build a (parliamentary) majority for this,"" he told reporters before going into talks with Gowin.
After the first round of talks on Monday, Budka said he was optimistic about finding ""common ground"", but Gowin struck a more cautious note.
""It is good that we are holding talks, but we are far from reaching a consensus,"" Gowin told news conference, adding that further talks with the opposition were planned.
Poland reported 545 new coronavirus infections on Sunday, the biggest daily rise to date. On Monday the total number of infections stood at 9,453, including 362 deaths, in the country of 38 million.
PiS, which was not represented at Monday's talks between PO and Accord, has proposed holding the election by postal ballot, though even its own supporters are now mostly opposed to a May vote. Also, a postal union chief said some 30% of postal workers were on sick leave, raising doubts about the plan's feasibility.
CHANGING CONSTITUTION?
PiS has said it would consider postponing the election by just a few weeks but also, in an apparent gesture to Accord, it has proposed legislation to change the constitution that would allow Duda's term to be extended by two years. 
PiS wants the election to take place soon because it needs an ally as president to ensure it can make further progress in its conservative agenda and controversial judiciary reforms, which the European Union says undermine the rule of law.
PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski knows his party can accomplish little without the continued support of Accord in parliament.
""For Kaczynski the stakes could not be higher because he has no majority without Gowin,"" said Anna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at Warsaw University.
""Ruling the country without a majority in the lower house would be very uncomfortable (for PiS),"" she said, referring to the possibility of Accord withdrawing its support.
Accord could join with opposition parties in blocking the postal ballot plan, a plan Materska-Sosnowska said was in any case a ""lost cause"". 

Changing the constitution to prolong Duda's mandate requires a two-thirds parliamentary majority, which Kaczynski lacks and which gives the opposition leverage.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - Farmers markets, craft shops, car dealerships and dog grooming salons opened in the Czech Republic on Monday, another step towards a return to normal life as the government grows more confident the coronavirus pandemic is under control.
Although strict hygiene rules are still in force such as requiring farmers to display produce two metres apart, the decision offered a glimmer of hope to small businesses hit hard by the lockdown. 
""This is relief from the stress that we will have to throw away the harvest,"" said Milan Vystejn, a vegetable grower from the Melnik region north of Prague, at a stand in Prague's Tylovo Square (NYSE:SQ). 
""On the other hand, we are afraid of catching Covid as Prague has the most of it,"" he said at his stand with potatoes, celery, parsley, carrots and vegetable plants.
The central European country lifted restrictions after the coronavirus outbreak stabilised in the past week. Around 5,300 cases have been reported with 188 deaths, fewer than most west European countries. 
The Czech government moved quickly to impose some of Europe's strictest measures, closing schools and most borders, and shuttering restaurants and shops apart from food stores and pharmacies.
While residents enjoyed being able to shop in more places, business groups eager to recharge the nation's economy called the moves cautious in comparison with countries like neighbouring Germany.
The lobby group for retail trade, SOCR, said the government did not make clear what it based its reopening plan on or how future developments would alter it.
""I would for example understand a limit on the number of people rather than size of the store,"" SOCR chief Tomas Prouza told Reuters. 
Small shops of up to 200 square metres are to open next Monday followed by those up to 1,000 square metres and fitness centres on May 11.
Restaurant and beer gardens, hair salons and museums get back to business on May 25 with all other shops, including malls, pubs and hotels, due to open their doors on June 8.
Dog groomer Martin Kuruc, co-owner of the Darling salon, said after using the downtime for refurbishment he was happy to have a line of clients waiting for a trim.
""This now means a lot of work,"" he said. ""It all got backed up so we will be running morning to evening, Saturdays, Sundays, holidays.""

1407,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>","Prince Harry begged father-in-law to call him before wedding, document shows","By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry appealed to the father of his wife Meghan to call him in the days before he decided to pull out of the couple's star-studded wedding two years ago, documents submitted to London's High Court on Monday showed.
Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, is suing Associated Newspapers, the publisher of the Mail on Sunday tabloid, for breaching her privacy by printing a letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle, to address the rift between them caused by events on the eve of the wedding.
In a document filed at the High Court ahead of a hearing on Friday, Meghan's lawyers said tabloid newspapers, particularly the Mail, had harassed and humiliated her father, contributed towards the fallout between them, and that the Mail had misquoted from the letter she sent him.
The papers include text messages from the prince to Meghan's father that provide a rare insight into the personal lives of the royals, who fiercely guard their privacy.
The release of the papers comes hours after Meghan and Harry, Queen Elizabeth's grandson, announced they would no longer work with four of Britain's major tabloid newspapers, which they accuse of false and invasive coverage.
Markle overshadowed the run-up to his daughter's wedding at Windsor Castle in May 2018 when he decided not to attend just days beforehand after undergoing heart surgery and following news that he had staged photos with a paparazzi photographer.
He has since given a number of interviews to British tabloids and broadcasters, saying he had been ignored by his daughter.
Associated Newspapers issued a 44-page defence of its story and use of the letter in January, saying unnamed friends of Meghan had put her version of events in interviews with the U.S. magazine People and Markle had the right to put his side.
It argued that given Meghan's royal status, there was legitimate public interest in her personal and family relationships.
In her response, lawyers said Harry and Meghan had repeatedly tried to contact Markle ahead of their wedding, adding the prince had warned the media had created the whole situation. 
""Tom, Harry again! Really need to speak to u. U do not need to apologize, we understand the circumstances but “going public” will only make the situation worse,"" Harry said in one text message.
""So please call me so I can explain. Meg and I are not angry, we just need to speak to u. Thanks. Oh any speaking to the press WILL backfire, trust me Tom. Only we can help u, as we have been trying from day 1.""
Meghan's lawyers said despite their pleas, Markle instead issued a statement through the Los Angeles-based celebrity website TMZ.
The duchess missed a call from Markle at 4.57am on the morning of her wedding and has not received any calls or messages from him since then, the court papers said.
""It was the defendant's publication of these contents, and the highly manipulated, sensational and deliberately inflammatory way in which this was done that so deeply upset her, not the fact that the newspaper published 'her father’s side of the dispute' (a 'dispute' which the defendant itself created),"" the papers said.

""It is the defendant’s (unlawful) actions that give rise to the claimant’s claim, and not her father’s conduct.""

NAIRAB, Idlib, Syria (Reuters) - Taher al-Matar's home in northwest Syria is in ruins but he has gone back to live there anyway, driven by dire conditions in camps for displaced people, where he fears any outbreak of the coronavirus would be devastating. 
Even though he worries a fragile ceasefire in the Idlib region may not last, the Syrian father is clearing rubble from what's left of his house while looking out for any unexploded shells that could have fallen in the last government offensive.
""It's better than living in the camps. We were there, we lived the humiliation,"" Matar, 42, told Reuters in the town of Nairab, where his house, close to a frontline dividing territory held by rebels from Russian-backed Syrian government forces, was destroyed by a missile three months ago.
""They tell us to stay home because of corona ...but in the camps, the tents are right next to each other and people can't keep their distance.""
Matar wants to spend the holy month of Ramadan with his six children at home. ""Praise God, I got them out unscathed,"" he said. ""Now I'm making repairs with my own hands because I have no money.""
Like Matar, thousands of Syrians have started moving back to the Idlib region since a truce brokered by Russia and Turkey took effect in March, halting an offensive in the last remaining rebel stronghold.
Nearly 1 million people were uprooted, many of whom had already fled other battles earlier in the nine-year war. While the region has no confirmed coronavirus cases, with little testing so far, doctors warn its ravaged hospitals and makeshift camps would quickly turn any outbreak into a catastrophe. 
A local relief agency said nearly 120,000 people had returned to towns in Idlib and the nearby Aleppo countryside since the ceasefire.
""What will happen next, only God knows... At the end of the day, a person has nothing but his home,"" said Saher al-Ali, 32, a driver who also went back to Nairab to try fixing his house.
Air strikes blew out all the windows and doors before his family escaped. After first fleeing to a camp on the border, he searched for other houses, but they were too full or expensive.

""Where was I supposed to live? In the camps or in the street?... If the battles come back, we will flee again.""

Twenty-three floors below Ibrahim's home, officials in white hazmat suits spray disinfectant over the usually crowded avenue that slices through the heart of the world's largest French-speaking city.
""I can't go and play outside because I risk getting contaminated,"" Ibrahim said. 
The 11-year-old misses his school friends, but can see the upside. ""I am also happy because since the lockdown started we don't have to study so much,"" he said later over the washing up. 
Cooped up with his father, three brothers and three sisters in a three-bedroom apartment, Ibrahim is still luckier than most children in Kinshasa.
The vast majority of the city's 11.6 million residents live in informal settlements crammed with overcrowded shacks. Only 15% have running water in their homes, and a third have their own toilet, according to a survey by the UN children's fund https://mics-surveys-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/MICS6/West%20and%20Central%20Africa/Congo%2C%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the/2017-2018/Survey%20findings/Congo%2C%20Democratic%20Republic%20of%20the%2C%202017-18%20MICS%20SFR_French.pdf (UNICEF).
Congo has suspended commercial flights and ordered schools and restaurants to close among other measures to contain the virus, which has infected over 300 people and killed 25.
But a stringent city-wide lockdown of the type enforced in Europe or in Ibrahim's plush neighbourhood of Gombe just would not work in poorer districts, said Nick Rice-Chudeau, a water and sanitation expert at UNICEF.
""People have to go outside their house to use the shared latrines,"" Rice-Chudeau said. ""Even if people could access a water truck, how would they store enough water for more than two weeks at a time?""
Then there's the problem of money.
""If we do a total lockdown, they won’t be able to find anything to eat,"" said Roger Kamba, head of the presidential taskforce on combatting the coronavirus.
For Ibrahim's father Nathalis, a lawyer, the implications of the lockdown are not so extreme, but it is still a struggle managing a house full of children on his own. His wife Michelle, who works at the finance ministry, was stranded on holiday in South Africa when Congo shut down its airspace on March 20.
Nathalis stockpiled games like scrabble and Uno before the lockdown and lets the kids burn off energy climbing up and down the stairs as he tries to keep to a routine of studying, praying and household chores. 

""Her absence pains me, but with God's help...we'll survive,"" he said.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan reported 22 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, almost all of them sailors who were on a navy visit to the small Pacific islands state of Palau, which said there was ""little chance"" it was the source of the infection.
Taiwan's government on Sunday said 700 navy personnel were being quarantined and tested and there were 24 positive cases altogether. Of those, three cadets had been to Palau, one of only 15 countries to maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, and one of the last states in the world yet to report a coronavirus outbreak.
Taiwan Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said cases were discovered on one of the three ships that visited Palau from March 12-15 but further investigations were needed before they could determine where exactly they were infected. 
Taiwan has to date been relatively successful at controlling the novel coronavirus through a focus on early prevention and detection. 
Palau closed its borders as a pre-emptive measure a month ago as cases rose sharply among its neighbours.
Palau Health Minister Emais Roberts said on Monday the government would stay in touch with Taiwan during its investigation into the outbreak, which was most likely a ""ship cluster"" contained within that vessel. 
More than a month had passed since the ships visited, he said, and no-one in Palau has tested positive or shown any symptoms of the coronavirus. 
""There is little chance that the virus on the vessels came from Palau,"" he said in a statement. ""There is no reason for us in Palau to panic."" 
Palau last week started its own domestic testing programme with the help of Taiwanese lab experts and equipment purchased from Taipei and transported by fishing boat.
In an interview with Reuters, Palau President Tommy Remengesau said he was prepared to keep borders closed for ""as long as necessary"" to keep the virus out of the country of 20,000 people. 
Mei Chia-shu, deputy navy commander, gave a deep bow on Sunday in an expression of apology for the infections and for not properly carrying out prevention measures.
President Tsai Ing-wen had been at the ceremony to welcome back the ships but had only waved to the sailors from the shore and had not been exposed, her office said.

Taiwan on Monday reported two new cases of the coronavirus, taking the number of infections to 422, with six deaths.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - The election of a new prime minister in Vanuatu, Bob Loughman, is expected to speed up emergency relief work for residents of the Pacific island nation left without shelter by tropical cyclone Harold.
Loughman, the leader of Vanua'aku, one of Vanuatu's oldest political parties, was elected prime minister by a ballot of lawmakers, 31-21, ahead of former foreign minister Ralph Regenvanu.
General elections were held four weeks ago, but the choice of Loughman was only announced on Monday.
Since general elections were held four weeks ago, Vanuatu has shut its borders to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, hampering the delivery of aid to residents left homeless on some islands after tropical cyclone Harold made landfall on April 6.
Tess Newton Cain, adjunct associate professor for Asia and the Pacific at Griffith University in Australia, said the cyclone had added to the delay in counting after the general election.
She said there had been some international assistance, but concern was growing that efforts were too slow and some people were without shelter and facing possible food shortages.
""Now there is solid political leadership, it could spur on a faster and targeted response,"" Newton Cain said.
Loughman has been in parliament since 2004, and served as deputy prime minister and education minister, but is not well-known internationally.
Regenvanu's party won the most seats in Vanuatu's 52 seat parliament, but a coalition of parties is needed to form government.
There is unlikely to be any shift in foreign policy on the priority area of climate change, Newton Cain said, but raised the possibility of changes to a contested programme granting citizenship to foreign investors that has been heavily used by investors from China.
""It is seen as passports being sold,"" she said.
Vanuatu, which has no COVID-19 cases, has received humanitarian aid on chartered flights from Australia, New Zealand, China and from New Caledonia on a French military aircraft.

Across the Pacific islands, Fiji has recorded 18 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Papua New Guinea has recorded seven cases, French Polynesia 55, New Caledonia 18 and Guam 133, including five deaths, according to World Health Organization figures.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - There are no visitors at Australia's biggest zoo due to the coronavirus restrictions, but training and feeding times must keep to schedule, keepers say, particularly for animals that perform in live shows like sea lions and birds of prey. 
""Animals don't seem to react differently, however they would definitely notice that there are no crowds out here when we are doing training sessions on stage,"" said Danielle Fox, supervisor of marine mammals at Sydney's Taronga Zoo.
Australia has largely avoided the high numbers of casualties which have beset other countries as the coronavirus officially called COVID-19 leaves a path of destruction around the world, with about 6,600 infections and 71 deaths.
That has been put down to heavy restrictions on public movement including border closures, shuttering most businesses that rely on paying visitors - like zoos - with no end date given.
But the absence of crowds does not affect the needs of animals, and their keepers said they are sticking to routines including keeping the same feeding times, cleaning of enclosures and training, albeit with the option to roam around the deserted waterfront park.
""One day when the zoo does open back up again we don't want them to have gone through a such a big period of change ... and for them to have to adapt back into their routine,"" said Fox.
Brendan Marcos, a falconer at the zoo, said it was hard to say if the performing birds were affected by the empty seats, but he definitely was.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Bangladesh has tightened a clampdown on seven villages after tens of thousands attended the funeral of a popular local cleric in spite of a nationwide lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus, officials said on Monday. 
The massive gathering in Brahmanbaria district, about 60 km east of the capital Dhaka, has raised concerns about the potential for a spike in infections in a country of 160 million people with poor medical infrastructure.
""We've strictly ordered all residents of the seven villages to stay at home at all times at least for the next 14 days so we can identify if anyone contracted the virus following Saturday's gathering,"" a local police officer told Reuters. 
Police had not expected such a large number of people to gather for the funeral, defying a weeks-long lockdown that forbids going out except for groceries and medicine. Local media said few of the mourners wore masks.
The government has ordered the two most senior policemen in the district to be removed from duty for failing to prevent crowds gathering for the funeral prayers of Maulana Jubayer Ahmed Ansari who died of cancer, the police said. 
Bangladesh has 2,456 confirmed coronavirus cases and 91 deaths. The government-imposed lockdown is in place until at least April 25 but many are starting to flout the rules including garment workers who took to the streets over the weekend demanding back pay.
Powerful religious leaders are also continuing to allow small congregations at mosques despite the risk of contagion and warnings from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. 
Many people are still attending Friday prayers and the start of the holy fasting month of Ramadan later this week, when typically more worshippers will gather at mosques, will put additional pressure on authorities, officials said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreans are returning to work and crowding shopping malls, parks, golf courses and some restaurants as South Korea relaxes social distancing rules amid a continued downward trend in coronavirus cases. 
A growing list of companies, including SK Innovation and Naver, has ended or eased their work from home policy in recent weeks, though many continue to apply flexible working hours and limit travel and face-to-face meetings. 
Parks, mountains and golf courses brimmed with visitors over the weekend, while shopping malls and restaurants were slowly returning to normal. 
South Korea's ongoing recovery from the first major coronavirus outbreak outside China paints a stark contrast to many other countries where metropolises remain sealed off and sweeping stay-at-home orders are in place. 
""I'm a member of a community football club and we went out to play on Saturday for the first time in two months,"" said Kim Tae-hyung, a 31-year-old power plant engineer living in Seoul. ""We were wearing a mask while we played, still worried about the coronavirus, but the weather was nice and I felt so refreshed.""
South Korea extended its social distancing policy for another 16 days on Sunday but offered some relief for religious and sports facilities previously subjected to strict restrictions.
The decision is aimed at cautiously reopening Asia's fourth-largest economy as daily infections continue to hover around or less than 20, most arriving from overseas. 
Seoul's defence ministry also said on Monday that the military is resuming medical screening for candidates while considering easing restrictions on travel and guest visits. 
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 13 new cases on Monday, a day after posting just eight -- the first single digit daily rise since the Feb. 28 peak of 909. The death toll stands at 236. 
Health authorities urged vigilance, warning new clusters could still emerge at any time, especially after South Korea held the first national election last week since the epidemic began, and ahead of long holidays starting next week. 
Schools have yet to open and are holding online classes. 
An official at SK Innovation, a battery maker, said about 80% of its employees will be back this week and they will get a temperature check at the entrance and maintain distance in the office. 
Naver Corp., which operates South Korea's largest web portal, said it is allowing less than half its employees to come into the office, while employees at Netmarble, a mobile gaming firm, come into the office three days a week.
""We have installed thermal cameras, full-body sterilisers, and table partitions at cafeterias,"" Naver said in a statement. 
Authorities were on alert after a 58-year-old man living in the second largest city of Busan was confirmed with the virus on Saturday and had voted in the election, attended Easter church service and visited restaurants while running symptoms. 
More than 1,000 people are now quarantined or being checked after coming in contact with that man and his daughter, who is a nurse and has also tested positive, city officials said. 
""We're looking at the trend of group infections though it has mostly been small clusters over the past two weeks,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing. 

""If we let our guard down in social distancing, (the virus) could come back and greatly hurt and endanger our society.""

The Emirates Fatwa Council said in a statement carried on state media late on Sunday that all healthy people are obliged to fast but medical workers on the frontline of the novel coronavirus pandemic need not do so ""if they fear that fasting could lead to weakening their immunity or to losing their patients"".
It said Muslims should comply with physical distancing while praying during Ramadan and the Eid Al Fitr holiday that marks its end. The UAE has suspended prayer in all houses of worship including mosques as part of containment measures. 
""Congregating to perform the prayer could endanger lives, an act that is strictly forbidden in Islam,"" said the statement.
The UAE, the region's business hub, has recorded 6,781 infections with 41 deaths, the second highest count after Saudi Arabia in the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council where the number of cases has steadily risen to surpass 26,600 with more than 160 deaths as countries ramp up testing. 
Several Gulf Arab states have suspended passenger flights, imposed curfews and closed most public venues, but have seen a rise in transmissions among low-income migrant workers, many of whom live in cramped quarters. Some Gulf governments are trying to arrange repatriation flights for expatriates who have lost jobs or been put on leave.
UAE Vice-President Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, who is also ruler of Dubai emirate, announced the launch of a humanitarian campaign on Sunday to provide 10 million meals or food parcels to communities hit by the outbreak in the country.
""Providing food for everyone, with the approach of the Holy Month of Ramadan, is a social priority in our battle against the pandemic,"" he said in an English-language Twitter post. ""In the UAE, no one sleeps hungry or in need. No one is left.""
Millions of foreign workers, many from Asia, form the backbone of Gulf economies and work in sectors that have been hit by the coronavirus outbreak.

The pandemic is also likely to disrupt the significant remittances those workers send back to their home countries.

1419,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 03:01AM ET</span>",Australians told restrictions must stay even as new virus infections slow,"By Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - More than 150 Australian economists on Monday warned the government against easing social distancing rules aimed at halting the spread of the new coronavirus even as the rate of infections slowed to a multi-week low. 
Australia has so far avoided the high numbers of coronavirus casualties reported around the world after closing its borders and imposing restrictions on public movement.
While the measures have slowed the growth in new infections to fewer than 40 new cases a day, the restrictions are expected to push unemployment to a 16-year high of about 10%.
Australia has now recorded 6,617 cases of coronavirus and 71 deaths since the first case in late January.
With growing calls to ease the restrictions, leading Australian economists issued an open letter to call on the government to prioritise containing the spread of coronavirus.
""We cannot have a functioning economy unless we first comprehensively address the public health crisis,"" the group of 157 economists from Australian universities wrote.
Australia's government and central bank have said they will inject A$320 billion ($203 billion) into the country's economy to try and cushion the economic blow.
RESTRICTIONS TO REMAIN
Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week said there would no easing of Australia's restrictions for at least four weeks, and several state premiers on Monday urged the public to keep to the social distancing rules.
""We've all made massive sacrifices, given a lot. We can't give back all the gains made because of sense of frustration gets the better of us,"" Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.
Any significant easing of the current limitations would not occur until Australia had increased testing capacity, strengthened contact tracing and readied local responses for further outbreaks, Andrews said.
Central to the government's strategy is a controversial new mobile phone app that will track users' movements to allow contact tracing in the event of an outbreak of coronavirus.
The government said it will need at least 40% of the country's population to be signed up to make it effective.
ERADICATION POSSIBLE?
Australia's three most populated states on Monday recorded just seven new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, stoking hopes that Canberra could even eradicate the virus.
While praising Australia's efforts, experts say eradication is unlikely.
""You have to look at New Zealand and Taiwan. Both have been very successful in containing the virus but there are still cases popping up,"" Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra Hospital, told Reuters.
""Australia hasn't taken the same hard-line approach to New Zealand so eradication is very unlikely.""
The government may ease some minor restrictions when the national Cabinet meets on Tuesday.
Morrison said last week the Cabinet would consider ending a ban on elective surgeries, and the Australia's main medical association on Monday said recent deliveries of protection equipment would mean some procedures could restart.
""We’ve been so successful so far that that’s given us the opportunity now to plan a sensible, safe, graduated return into the low-risk procedures which provide clinical benefit to patients,"" Tony Bartone, the head of Australian Medical Association told Channel 7.

1420,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 20, 2020 02:55AM ET</span>",New Zealand to ease tough virus lockdown measures next week,"By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand will next week ease some of the world's strictest lockdown measures taken to tackle the novel coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday, after a month of tight restrictions slowed the spread of the disease.
The Pacific nation of 5 million introduced its highest lockdown measures in late March, shutting down offices, schools and all non-essential services including bars, restaurants, cafes and playgrounds. 
New Zealand move out of alert level 4 on April 27, a few days longer than the scheduled one-month lockdown, after which it will be in alert level 3 for two weeks, Ardern said in a news conference.
""On the recommendation of the Director General of Health, who is confident there is currently no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand, today we are able to take a balanced approach in transitioning through alert levels and restarting our economy,"" Ardern said.
The New Zealand dollar  jumped about half a percent after the announcement, rising from negative territory to $0.6050, its highest in three sessions. 
Construction, manufacturing and forestry businesses would be allowed to operate under the new rules, meaning hundreds of thousands of people will resume work, local media reported.
Shops, malls, hardware stores and restaurants will remain shut under alert level 3, but can permit online or phone purchases.
New Zealanders stuck at home for a month were immediately on social media asking whether restaurant takeaways and malls would open, while checking rules for travel and resuming acitivies including bush walks and surfing.
The government has said swimming at the beach, a day walk, or fishing from a wharf would be allowed in level 3. Experienced surfers would be allowed, and tramping and biking is ok for day walks on easy trails. 
Some travel would be permitted around the country for essential services and a handful of other cases. 
Air New Zealand (NZ:AIR) Chief Revenue officer Cam Wallace said there was significant spike in bookings just five minutes after Ardern's announcement.
""The line graph is trending upwards, haven't seen that in weeks!"" he tweeted.
Schools will be able to open partially up to year 10 but attendance will be voluntary. Funerals and weddings will be able to go ahead, but limited to 10 people.
Ardern said she still wants the vast majority of people to work and learn from home.
NEXT PHASE
New Zealand's hard and fast lockdown approach, shutting its borders and announcing a state of national emergency before it recorded a coronavirus death - has been credited with containing the highly contagious disease.
Just nine new cases of COVID-19 were recorded on Monday and no new deaths, taking the total to 1,440 cases with 12 fatalities.
Decisions on whether restrictions can be relaxed further will be made on May 11, Ardern said.
""If we want to make sure that we are a health success story, and ensure our economy can start to operate again without the virus taking off, we need to get the next phase right,"" she said.
""The worst thing we can do for our country is to yo-yo between levels, with all of the uncertainty that this would bring."" 
New Zealand has scaled up testing, with more than 85,000 people tested. The country's transmission rate, the number of cases each person with the virus passes it onto, is now 0.48, less than half a person each. Overseas the average is 2.5 people, Ardern said.

PORTAPIQUE, Nova Scotia (Reuters) - A gunman who at one point masqueraded as a policeman killed at least 16 people in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia during a 12-hour rampage, authorities said on Sunday, in what was the country's worst modern-era mass shooting.
Among the victims of the shooting spree that spread across part of the Atlantic Canadian province was RCMP officer Heidi Stevenson, a 23-year veteran of the force with two children.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the gunman, 51-year-old Gabriel Wortman, who worked as a denturist, appeared at one stage to have been wearing part of a police uniform. He had also painstakingly disguised his car to look like a police cruiser.
Police added they had ended the threat posed by Wortman, who was dead, but would not confirm a report by the CTV network that the RCMP had shot him.
Wortman shot people in several locations in Nova Scotia, the RCMP told a briefing. RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp the police knew of at least 16 victims, besides the shooter. She added there was no indication at this time that the killings were terrorism-related.
Police said there was no apparent link between Wortman and at least some of his victims. They said they had no idea what his motivation might have been.
""Today is a devastating day for Nova Scotia, and it will remain etched in the minds for many years to come,"" said Lee Bergerman, commanding officer of the RCMP in Nova Scotia.
The death toll exceeded that of a Montreal massacre in 1989 when a gunman killed 15 women. 
Mass shootings are relatively rare in Canada, which has tighter gun control laws than the United States. 
Nova Scotia, like the rest of Canada, is under a stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Police discovered the killings late on Saturday after multiple reports of shots at a house in the small coastal town of Portapique, about 130 km (80 miles) north of the provincial capital, Halifax.
""When police arrived on the scene, members located several casualties inside and outside of the home,"" said Chris Leather, the Nova Scotia RCMP's criminal operations officer.
Several buildings in the town were ablaze and police exchanged gunfire at one point with Wortman. Probes subsequently disclosed he had also killed people in several other locations.
""We're not fully aware of what (the) total might be,"" said Leather.
At one point on Saturday evening, Wortman ""appears to have been wearing - if not all - then a portion of a police uniform,"" Leather said. But he did not specify whether the suspect had been disguised as an officer when the killings occurred.
""The fact that this individual had a uniform and a police car at his disposal certainly speaks to it not being a random act,"" Leather said.
'WE HEARD GUNSHOTS'
According to the websites of the Denturist Society of Nova Scotia and the province's Better Business Bureau, Wortman operated a denture clinic in Dartmouth, close to Halifax. 
In response to a question, Leather said police would look at a possible link to the coronavirus outbreak, which has forced the closure of non-essential businesses.
A local resident said she had come across two burning police vehicles while out driving on Sunday.
""There was one officer we could see on scene and then all of a sudden, he went running toward one of the burning vehicles,"" Darcy Sack told the CBC. 
""We heard gunshots,"" she added. Television footage from Portapique showed two burned-out vehicles on a road.
Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil decried what he called senseless act of violence.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said his government would help Nova Scotians ""as they heal from this tragedy.""

The killings do not represent the largest act of murder in the country's history, given that 268 Canadians were among the 329 people who died in 1985 when a bomb brought down an Air India jet over the Atlantic.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - In homes that are cramped, stuffy and increasingly low on food, residents of Mumbai's huge Dharavi slum are struggling under India's nationwide lockdown.
In Dharavi, where an estimated one million people live, residents are stretching out meals and relying on donations. But anxiety has been building since the lockdown began on March 25.
""I used to feed my children when I went out for work, but now there is only sorrow and no work,"" said Najma Mohammad, who was employed at a garment shop that has closed. Her son and two daughters rely on food handouts from neighbours, she added.
Dharavi, believed to be Asia's largest slum, is a tough place to be confined, and also one of the most vulnerable to the new coronavirus because of the density of its population and poor sanitation. 
Hundreds of people sometimes share the same bathroom. Access to clean water is not guaranteed. Soap has become a luxury.
""Anything can happen. There are nine people in this room, all of us could be in danger,"" said migrant worker Namchand Mandal, who is from the northeastern state of Jharkhand.
Dharavi has 138 reported cases so far, but experts fear that number will accelerate higher.
""I am really worried it is just a matter of time,"" virologist Shahid Jameel said of Mumbai's slums, which are home to an estimated 65% of the city's core population of around 12 million.
Anxious residents have tied handkerchiefs or shirt sleeves around their faces in lieu of proper masks. Some have also barricaded alleyways using carts, bicycles and sticks. Signs warn outsiders to keep away.
Still, many residents say it is impossible to stay confined in small rooms, which are sometimes shared by day labourers who work different shifts.
Deep in the slums, people throng informal markets. Some adults kill time playing chess or watching videos on their cell phones. Children play cricket and cards.
One tailor opened his small shop early in the morning, saying he wanted to make a little money before police arrived later in the day to enforce the lockdown.
Officers have punished lockdown violators by making them sit in the sun, do squats or by hitting them with sticks, according to a Reuters witness.
""It's very difficult. No one listens to us,"" said one police officer in Dharavi, adding that some bank employees shared special passes with friends so they could move around.

Mumbai police did not respond to a request for comment.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers called on Sunday for expanding payroll assistance to struggling local newspapers and broadcast stations that have seen advertising revenue plummet during the coronavirus pandemic.
Democratic Senators Maria Cantwell and Amy Klobuchar and Republicans John Kennedy and John Boozman urged Senate leaders to revise the rules to make thousands of local newspapers, TV and radio stations eligible for assistance under the Paycheck Protection Program.
Many local outlets are ineligible because they are owned by parent companies too large to qualify.
""Ensuring that local news outlets remain viable at this critical time is not only a matter of fairness, but is essential to public health,"" the senators wrote in a letter.
On Sunday, officials said U.S. lawmakers were close to an agreement on approving extra money to help small businesses hurt by the coronavirus pandemic and could seal a deal soon.
The four senators said local newspapers had lost as much as 50% of advertising revenue, while the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) says some local broadcasters have reported as much as a 90% loss in advertising revenues.
Tens of thousands of local media workers are being forced to take unpaid furloughs or seeing cuts to paychecks, while other outlets are shrinking staff and reducing the frequency of printing, and some smaller newspapers in California, Vermont and South Dakota are closing.
Newspaper publisher  Gannett Co  (N:GCI) said this month it would reduce expenses by another $100 million to $125 million this year through staffing reductions, furloughs and ""significant pay reductions for senior management and cancellation of non-essential travel and spending."" 
The parent company of the Los Angeles Times said this week it was imposing temporary pay cuts for senior managers of up to 15% and furloughing some non-newsroom employees for up to 16 weeks.
Unlike many other businesses, news organizations were already hurting before the pandemic. Employment at U.S. newsrooms fell 25% from 2008 to 2018, the Pew Research Center reported, a loss of 28,000 jobs, while 1,800 U.S. newspapers have closed since 2004.
NAB President Gordon Smith said on Sunday that ""local stations are suffering advertising losses of historic proportion that will undermine this critically important service.""

Earlier this month, four groups representing broadcasters and newspapers - including the NAB - asked lawmakers to back up to $10 billion in government advertising and to rewrite Paycheck Protection Program rules.

The Greek authorities had banned large family gatherings and mass church attendance during the Orthodox Easter week, which ends on Sunday. Last week, they had doubled fines for all those across the country who tried to travel by car for Easter without a serious reason. 
Greeks stuck to the restrictions and spent the day with their close families and roasted lamb on verandas and balconies for the traditional Easter meal.
""We had ordered and sent lambs to Corfu in order to go and celebrate Easter with relatives, but coronavirus came along and we are stuck here,"" said Vassilis Kourtelis, 62, from his porch of his house in Athens while roasting the lamb.
""But we are not going to let it ruin our mood, (we are celebrating) here with the family, as if we were there with our relatives. We send them video calls, they see us as we sing and dance."" 
Greece has a relatively low rate of infections, which stood at 2,235 by Saturday, including 110 fatalities.
But as thousands of Greeks travel from Athens to their family homes for the Easter every year, the government was worried people would relax social distancing measures and banned unnecessary movement from Holy Saturday night to Easter Monday midnight, doubling the fines for offenders. 
""We have pushed aside the first waves with discipline and solidarity,"" Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in his Easter address. ""Staying on the same course, we will soon be starting a gradually transition to a new era"".
Athens has said it would unwind its plan to ease the lockdown which ends April 27 after Easter but cautioned this will be a slow process.

""I believe next Easter we and others will be with our loved ones, with friends, with relatives, with our children, everyone together,"" Kourtelis said.

China has recently been pushing its presence in the energy-rich waters while other claimants are pre-occupied with tackling the new coronavirus pandemic, prompting the United States to call on China to stop its ""bullying behaviour"" there.

Rivers State has recorded two cases of coronavirus so far. Nigeria has 541 confirmed cases nationwide and 19 deaths. The most high profile victim was the president's chief of staff, Abba Kyari, who died on Friday. 

Nigeria's petroleum regulator has ordered oil and gas companies to reduce their offshore workforce and move to 28-day staff rotations, instead of the usual 14 days, to help to curb the spread of the coronavirus.

Ministers had on Saturday highlighted an 84-tonne consignment that was due to arrive from Turkey containing personal protective equipment (PPE), including 400,000 protective gowns.
A British foreign office spokesperson cited ""clearance and paperwork"" for the delay, first reported by Sky News.
""It's not quite ready yet,"" the official said, adding that they were ""working to get this delivered as soon as possible"".
With hospitals under strain, health workers have criticised the government's advice that PPE worn while treating patients infected with coronavirus could be re-used, as supplies run low across the country.
Helena McKeown, chair of the British Medical Association which represents doctors, told Sky News the delay would be ""devastating"" news for health professionals.
Britain is at or near the peak of a health crisis in which more than 15,000 people have died in hospitals alone - the fifth highest national death toll of a pandemic linked to at least 150,000 deaths worldwide.

The true toll is likely to be substantially higher as data on deaths in the community, such as in care homes, takes much longer to trickle in.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is not considering lifting the lockdown enacted almost four weeks ago to control the coronavirus outbreak given ""deeply worrying"" increases in the death toll, a senior minister said on Sunday.
Britain is at or near the peak of a health crisis in which more than 15,000 people have died - the fifth highest national death toll of a pandemic linked to at least 150,000 deaths worldwide.
Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said a Buzzfeed report that the government was considering lifting the lockdown in phases over the coming months was not correct.
""The facts and the advice are clear at the moment that we should not be thinking of lifting of these restrictions yet,"" Gove told Sky News.
The latest data show 15,464 people have died in British hospitals after testing positive for the novel coronavirus, a total that has increased by more than 800 for three days running. 
A further 2,500 had died in care homes during the week to April 13, according to the National Care Forum, a representative body for the adult social care sector. 
""One of the things that is deeply worrying and concerning is the high level of deaths,"" Gove said.
""The evidence suggests that the rate of infection and the death rate is flattening, but we're not absolutely certain that we are yet on a downward trajectory.""
Gove described as ""grotesque"" a Sunday Times story that said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had skipped five crisis meetings to address the coronavirus pandemic early in the outbreak.

""The prime minister took all the major decisions. Nobody can say that the prime minister wasn't throwing heart and soul into fighting this virus,"" he added.

""What's not going to come back quickly are scenarios in which we can't safely socially distance,"" Harris told the Sunday Independent newspaper in an interview.
""I can't see how people can be in packed pubs again as long as this virus is still with us and we don't have a vaccine or an effective treatment.""
Ireland's chief medical officer declared on Thursday that the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak had been contained in the population at large.
That raised hopes that stay-at-home restrictions could begin to be rolled back from May 5.
But Harris cautioned that any easing back of the most severe constraints will be done on a slow and phased basis. 
""I'd like to see a situation where you could expand somewhat the areas in which people can go beyond their home,"" he said.
""I'm conscious of the fact that cocooning may well remain a reality for quite a period of time because we know people, once they reach a certain age, are vulnerable. But is there a safe way that they can get out every now and again and take a walk?""
Currently people can only go out to shop for groceries or for brief physical exercise within a 2 kilometre radius of their homes. Over 70s have been told not to leave their homes.
Harris said he would like to see a situation where schools could reopen or at least partially reopen.

Allowing students back just one day a week ""would provide breathing space for families and information and I think that would help,"" Harris said.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Suppressing Hong Kong's democracy movement is a priority for China, even in the midst of the coronavirus crisis, a top pro-democracy leader said on Sunday, a day after police arrested him and 14 others in a surprise crackdown.
The United States and others criticised the arrest of the 15 on charges of organising and participating in anti-government protests last year, the biggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement since the outbreak of the protests almost a year ago.
""This is all happening while we are in midst of a pandemic,"" pro-democracy activist Avery Ng told Reuters by telephone.
""The world is dealing with this virus, but this signals that Beijing still sees a political crackdown in Hong Kong is a top priority."" 
Those arrested included Democratic Party founder and barrister Martin Lee, 81, millionaire publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, 71, and former lawmaker and barrister Margaret Ng, 72.
Police said those arrested were charged with organising and participating in unlawful assemblies on Aug. 18 and Oct. 1 and 20 last year. Major and often violent demonstrations broke out across the former British colony on those days.
They were due to appear in court on May 18. Police said more arrests were possible. Avery Ng and some of the others arrested were released on bail late on Saturday.
The arrests prompted criticism from the United States and Britain, which both called for Hong Kong's rule of law to be maintained.
""The United States condemns the arrest of pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong,"" U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.
""Beijing and its representatives in Hong Kong continue to take actions inconsistent with commitments made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration that include transparency, the rule of law, and guarantees that Hong Kong will continue to 'enjoy a high degree of autonomy',"" he said.
Hong Kong returned to Beijing in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees it broad freedoms not seen in mainland China, and a high degree of autonomy.
China rejected the U.S. criticism.
""It serves as another evidence of their collusion with the local troublemakers, which deserves condemnation by the entire international community,"" a spokesman for Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said a statement.
'HAWKISH'
In Britain, a Foreign Office representative said the government expected any arrests and court procedures to be ""conducted in a fair and transparent manner"".
The right to peaceful protest was ""fundamental to Hong Kong's way of life"" and authorities should avoid inflaming tension and ""focus on rebuilding trust through a process of meaningful political dialogue"".
The Hong Kong government defended the arrests. The city's Security Bureau said were carried out in line with the law.
Hong Kong's protest campaign has gone quiet as the coronavirus threat has grown. There have been no major demonstrations in the city since Jan. 1.
But nevertheless, Ng said he believed Beijing would not compromise and more activists were likely to be arrested.
""It is a very significant political decision and shows the direction that Beijing will take in dealing with Hong Kong,"" he said. ""They will be very hawkish ... we can expect there will be more crackdowns.""
In another sign of the growing power of Beijing over the city, Beijing's Liaison Office, the Chinese government's top representative office in the city, announced on Friday that it was not bound by a law that restricts interference by other mainland Chinese bodies.
The city government backed the announcement drawing the condemnation of 22 opposition members of the city's legislature who accused Chief Executive Carrie Lam’s government of ""betraying"" Hong Kong by its ""capitulation"".
The International Bar Association condemned the arrests of Lee and Margaret Ng, who have been active human rights and rule of law campaigners during their careers.

It was vital that justice was applied transparently in Hong Kong, especially while the world is gripped by the coronavirus pandemic, it said.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea extended its social distancing policy for another 16 days on Sunday but offered some relief for churches and sporting fixtures, as it reported just eight new coronavirus infections, the lowest in two months.
The slightly relaxed guidelines mean high-risk venues like churches will face fewer restrictions, while sports matches such as the popular Korea Baseball Organization (KBO) League can resume without an audience.
""It is safest to maintain the intensive social distancing, but it isn't easy realistically. We need to find a middle ground,"" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a televised meeting of government officials.
""If we can maintain a stable management at the current level, we will shift to 'routine social distancing' from May 6,"" Chung said.
Health authorities have said this would allow a reopening of the economy, while maintaining guidelines on disinfection and preventing the spread of the virus in people's daily lives.
South Korea in March issued an administrative order that strongly recommended religious, indoor sports and entertainment facilities such as nightclubs suspend operations. The language has now been softened, allowing facilities to restart operations as long as they comply with disinfection guidelines.
""The government will evaluate the degree of risk every two weeks and readjust the level of social distancing when necessary,"" Health Minister Park Neung-hoo told reporters.
The latest figure on new infections was the first time since Feb. 18 that South Korea reported a single digit daily rise. The increase takes its total cases to 10,661.
Of the new cases, five were imported from overseas, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The death toll rose to 234.
South Korea has largely managed to bring the outbreak under control and has recently been reporting daily new cases hovering around 20.
Health authorities called the trend good news, but issued a note of caution about overly optimistic predictions.
""We are continuously on the alert to ensure we haven't missed any new infections, or whether the epidemic could be spread by asymptomatic or mildly infected patients,"" KCDC chief Jeong Eun-kyeong told a briefing.
President Moon Jae-in on Sunday said South Korea's progress gave hope that the COVID-19 is ""surmountable"" in other parts of the world. Earlier this year, South Korea had Asia's largest number of infections outside China. It has since been overtaken by other countries.
""The government will prepare for new daily lives and the new world order 'post-COVID' with the unified power of the citizens,"" Moon said.

U.S. President Trump spoke to Moon on Saturday and expressed appreciation for South Korea's help in procuring COVID-19 tests for the United States.

The government announced a halt to domestic flights on March 23, ordering commercial airlines to shut down domestic operations on top of an existing ban on international flights to try and contain the spread of the coronavirus.
""The Ministry of Civil Aviation clarifies that so far no decision has been taken to open domestic or international operations,"" civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said in a tweet late on Saturday. 
""Airlines are advised to open their bookings only after a decision in this regard has been taken by the Government"", he added.
About 144 million people travelled on domestic flights last year.
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day national lockdown in late March to contain the spread of the virus outbreak. The lockdown has been extended until May 3 at least.
Still, India has announced a roadmap to restart some industrial activity after April 20 in locations that are not coronavirus hotspots to try to revive the economy.
India has reported over 15,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 500 deaths as of early Sunday, according to data from the Indian government.

The raids mark the biggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement since the beginning of anti-government protests across the former British colony in June last year.
""The United States condemns the arrest of pro-democracy advocates in Hong Kong,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.
""Beijing and its representatives in Hong Kong continue to take actions inconsistent with commitments made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration that include transparency, the rule of law, and guarantees that Hong Kong will continue to 'enjoy a high degree of autonomy',"" Pompeo said.
U.S. President Donald Trump last November signed into law legislation backing protesters in Hong Kong despite angry objections from Beijing.
The legislation requires the State Department to certify, at least annually, that Hong Kong retains enough autonomy to justify favorable U.S. trading terms that have helped it maintain its position as a world financial center. The law also threatens sanctions for human rights violations.
In a separate statement, U.S. Attorney General William Barr called the arrests ""the latest assault on the rule of law and the liberty of the people of Hong Kong.""
""These events show how antithetical the values of the Chinese Communist Party are to those we share in Western liberal democracies,"" he added, saying the arrests and other actions ""demonstrate once again that the Chinese Communist Party cannot be trusted.""

Among those detained on charges of illegal assembly were Democratic Party founder Martin Lee, 81, publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, 71, and former lawmaker and barrister Margaret Ng, 72, according to media and political sources.

1444,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2020 08:40PM ET</span>",Trump warns China could face consequences for virus outbreak,"By Jeff Mason and Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned China on Saturday that it should face consequences if it was ""knowingly responsible"" for the coronavirus pandemic, as he ratcheted up criticism of Beijing over its handling of the outbreak.
""It could have been stopped in China before it started and it wasn't, and the whole world is suffering because of it,"" Trump told a daily White House briefing.
It was the latest U.S. volley in a war of words between the world's two biggest economies, showing increased strains in relations at a time when experts say an unprecedented level of cooperation is needed to deal with the coronavirus crisis.
""If it was a mistake, a mistake is a mistake. But if they were knowingly responsible, yeah, I mean, then sure there should be consequences,"" Trump said. He did not elaborate on what actions the United States might take.
Trump and senior aides have accused China of a lack of transparency after the coronavirus broke out late last year in its city of Wuhan. This week he suspended aid to the World Health Organization accusing it of being ""China-centric.""
Washington and Beijing have repeatedly sparred in public over the virus. Trump initially lavished praise on China and his counterpart Xi Jinping for their response. But he and other senior officials have also referred to it as the ""Chinese virus"" and in recent days have ramped up their rhetoric.
They have also angrily rejected earlier attempts by some Chinese officials to blame the origin of the virus on the U.S. military.
Trump's domestic critics say that while China performed badly at the outset and must still come clean on what happened, he is now seeking to use Beijing to help deflect from the shortcomings of his own response and take advantage of growing anti-China sentiment among some voters for his 2020 re-election bid.
At the same time, however, White House officials are mindful of the potential backlash if tensions get too heated. The United States is heavily reliant on China for personal protection equipment desperately needed by American medical workers, and Trump also wants to keep a hard-won trade deal on track.
Trump said that until recently the U.S.-China relationship had been good, citing a multi-billion agricultural agreement aimed at defusing a bitter trade war. ""But then all of a sudden you hear about this,"" he said.
He said the Chinese were ""embarrassed"" and the question now was whether what happened with the coronavirus was ""a mistake that got out of control, or was it done deliberately?"" 
""There's a big difference between those two,"" he said.
WUHAN LAB
Trump also raised questions about a Wuhan virology laboratory that Fox News this week reported had likely developed the coronavirus as part of China's effort to demonstrate its capacity to identify and combat viruses. Trump has said his government is seeking to determine whether the virus emanated from a Chinese lab.
As far back as February, the Chinese state-backed Wuhan Institute of Virology dismissed rumors that the virus may have been artificially synthesized at one of its labs or perhaps escaped from such a facility.
Wandering off the topic of the coronavirus, Trump also used the White House briefing to take a swipe at presumed Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his long record on China as a senator and former vice president.
While stressing his own confrontational trade policies toward China, Trump, using his nickname ""Sleepy Joe"" for his rival, said if Biden wins the White House that China and other countries ""will take our country."" 
Trump also again cast doubt on China's death toll, which was revised up on Friday. China said 1,300 people who died of the coronavirus in Wuhan - half the total - were not counted, but dismissed allegations of a cover-up.
The United States has by far the world's largest number of confirmed coronavirus cases, with more than 720,000 infections and over 37,000 deaths.
Even Dr. Deborah Birx, coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force who has steered clear of political aspects of Trump's contentions briefings, questioned China's data.

Showing on a chart that China's death rate per 100,000 people was far below major European countries and the United States, she called China's numbers ""unrealistic"" and said it had a ""moral obligation"" to provide credible information.

TBILISI (Reuters) - Hundreds of Christian parishioners went to churches in ex-Soviet Georgia to attend Orthodox Easter Vigil despite a state of emergency and calls from the government and doctors to stay home amid outbreak of the coronavirus.
Dozens went to the South Caucasus country's main Sameba (Saint Trinity) cathedral in the capital Tbilisi, where 87-year-old Catholicos-Patriarch Ilia II held the service.
More attended services in big churches across the country, although some bishops in different regions called on their flock to stay at home, encouraging them instead to tune in to Easter services streamed live on TV or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Crowds were unusually small everywhere compared to the tens of thousands who normally attend this service every year.
The Catholicos-Patriarch said in his Easter address that the problem of the new virus had caused fear among many and their gaze had turned to God.
""We should not be afraid of temptation, the Christian takes problems with gratitude and sees God's hand in everything ... and at the same time tries to find the right solution in the current situation,"" he said.
Holy Fire had been brought to Georgia on Saturday night by a charter flight from Jerusalem, where the ceremony in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which symbolizes the resurrection of Jesus after his death on the cross, was attended only by Christian clergymen for the first time in centuries.
Worshippers came to the Sameba cathedral in Tbilisi before the 9 p.m. start of curfew and planned to stay on church premises until its end at 6 a.m.
Violators face a 3,000 lari ($1,000) fine.
""It took me more than three hours to come here and I will stay till the morning as my presence demonstrates my dedication and my belief,"" Mariam, a 27-year-old Tbilisi resident, said.
Almost everyone, including some priests, were wearing face masks.
The Georgian Orthodox Church Patriarchy said earlier this month that all Easter services would be held in a traditional manner, but parishioners would be required to maintain social distancing between each other to stem transmission of the virus.
The Patriarch and majority of Georgian priests were reluctant to call on their flocks to stay at home and have continued to provide the holy sacrament from the same spoon to parishioners, which critics said threatens efforts to contain the coronavirus.
Georgia has in place a state of emergency until May 10 entailing a 9 p.m.-to-6 a.m. curfew, closures of restaurants, cafes, shops, a ban on public transport and on gatherings of more than three people. Grocery stores, pharmacies and petrol stations remain open.
Government officials and doctors have pleaded with citizens to refrain from mass gatherings and to stay at home during Easter celebrations.

The Caucasus republic of 3.7 million people has reported 388 cases of COVID-19 the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, and four deaths as of Sunday.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - More than 230 deported Guatemalans being held in mass quarantine at a sports center in the Central American nation's capital are fearful they may have been exposed to the coronavirus after compatriots flown home from the United States tested positive.
President Alejandro Giammattei said on Friday a dozen randomly selected people from a deportation flight on Monday tested positive for the coronavirus when examined by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Giammattei suggested more on the flight had tested positive as well. The infected deportees are interned in a hospital in Guatemala City. 
However, at least 234 Guatemalan deportees are now quarantined in the Ramiro de Leon Carpio sports complex a few blocks from the Guatemala City airport, according to the nation's migration institute, including some from the flight that arrived on Monday.
Flights deporting Guatemalans from the United States were on Thursday temporarily suspended after reports of the mass infection.
""We don't want to be here, we prefer to quarantine at home,"" said a man named Daniel at the sports center, who did not provide his last name and who arrived on Tuesday from Brownsville, Texas, along with 108 other Guatemalans. ""We feel at risk here,"" he said. 
Guarded by police, relatives of the quarantined returnees are leaving clothing and personal hygiene products in bags that migration agents check before handing over.
Despite recommendations for social distancing to curb the spread of the virus, rooms are packed with about 20 beds and bunk beds, separated by about 1 meter. 
""They check our temperature at midnight, at four in the morning, then again at noon and in the afternoon, and again at night,"" said Daniel, adding he had not been tested for the coronavirus.
A Reuters witness saw about 10 people leave the shelter on Friday after they obtained permission to return home. 
""We panicked here,"" said one of them as he left. ""We were scared because we've heard that the people here don't like us, that they think we're sick."" 
Family members also said they are concerned disease might spread at the complex and said they had not received information about how long their loved ones would be held.
Several declined to be interviewed over fears that once their names become public they will face discrimination or even violent attacks.
Deportees have faced tightened entry restrictions, put in place by mayors of different departments, with some mayors even prohibiting their entry. Other mayors have threatened to expel families from their hometowns.

Deportation flights were suspended for the third time on Thursday. The Guatemalan president has insisted that deportees returning to his country must be healthy.

France is due to start exiting its strict lockdown from May 11, with schools set to reopen then, but the government has yet to spell out when businesses like cafes and cinemas can restart and to what extent people will be allowed to move around. 
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo told the Journal Du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper in an interview published on Sunday that hand gel would be made widely available as the French capital tries to keep the virus spread under control.
This will include free dispensers at swimming pools, sports stadiums and nurseries, but also in the street and at bus stops, she said, adding that JCDecaux, a company known for making advertising billboards, was working on the scheme. 
Asked whether authorities in the broader Paris region should make it compulsory to wear face masks in metros and on commuter trains, Hidalgo said discussions on that were under way.
""Given how crowded these lines are, this really strikes me as necessary,"" Hidalgo said. 
Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron's government has faced criticism over a shortage of face masks and testing kits. The president has said that by May 11, France would be able to test anyone presenting COVID-19 symptoms and give nonprofessional face masks to the public.
Hidalgo added that some streets in Paris could be closed to cars in the immediate aftermath of the lockdown exit. These would be turned into cycle highways in a bid to keep pollution down and not further exacerbate the outbreak of the virus, which causes respiratory problems in some of those affected. 
France has been under virtual lockdown since March 17. Some measures have been progressively tightened in the capital, and authorities banned Parisians from outdoor sports activity like jogging between 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. local time.

The advance comes days after forces loyal to the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) had pushed back Haftar's allies along the coast west of the capital, marking a possible turning point in their attempt to fend off a year-long offensive by Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA).
Tarhouna, about 65 km (45 miles) southeast of the capital, Tripoli, has been a crucial asset for the LNA, providing local manpower for a campaign that has leaned heavily on air support supplied by the United Arab Emirates as well as Russian military contractors.
GNA attempts to swing Tarhouna to its side have failed. The GNA has depended on military support including drone strikes provided by Turkey, which has stepped up its involvement in Libya's conflict this year.
One witness from Tarhouna said residents had heard loud blasts from Saturday morning, followed by the sound of intensive clashes in an outlying area of the town that continued for up to six hours.
LNA officials told Reuters the GNA forces had failed to enter the town and that the offensive, the first since Haftar launched his military bid for Tripoli in early April 2019, had been repelled. They also said they had shot down a drone.
LNA forces control eastern and southern Libya and have been positioned around the outskirts of Tripoli for a year. The capital has seen heavy bombardment in recent days, and shelling continued on Saturday, wounding at least 10 civilians, local medics said.
The GNA has also been trying to capture al-Watiya airbase, about 125 km (80 miles) southwest of Tripoli and the LNA's other strategic foothold in Tripoli.
Libya is struggling to prepare for the expected spread of the new coronavirus, and the GNA on Friday imposed a 24-hour curfew in western regions it controls for 10 days. Libya has confirmed 49 cases, including one death. 
Libya slid into turmoil after the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that toppled former ruler Muammar Gaddafi. Since 2014 rival factions based in Tripoli and the east have vied for power.

Three regional security sources told Reuters on Friday that a Chinese government survey ship was tagging an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia's state oil company Petronas in those waters.
The vessel Haiyang Dizhi 8 was earlier this week spotted off Vietnam, where it had last year conducted suspected oil exploration surveys in large expanses of Vietnam's exclusive economic zone.
""The United States is concerned by reports of China's repeated provocative actions aimed at the offshore oil and gas development of other claimant states,"" the U.S. State Department said in an emailed statement in response to questions on the Haiyang Dizhi 8's presence in Malaysian waters.
""In this instance, (China) should cease its bullying behaviour and refrain from engaging in this type of provocative and destabilizing activity,"" it said.
China's actions threaten regional energy security and undermine the free and open Indo-Pacific energy market, it added.
Earlier in the week, when the survey ship was off Vietnam, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman had said the ship was conducting normal activities and accused U.S. officials of smearing Beijing.
China claims almost all of the resource-rich South China Sea, also a major trade route. The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.
The Haiyang Dizhi 8 was still within Malaysia's exclusive economic zone, Marine Traffic data showed on Saturday. The area is close to waters claimed by both Vietnam and Malaysia as well as by China. 
A Malaysian security source had said the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was flanked at one point on Friday by more than 10 Chinese vessels, including those belonging to maritime militia and the coast guard. A Vietnamese vessel was also tagging the Petronas vessel.

1452,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 18, 2020 10:20AM ET</span>",France to shun strict discrimination by age in lockdown exit,"PARIS (Reuters) - France will try to avoid setting different rules for older people and other forms of discrimination once the government starts easing its coronavirus confinement measures, the French President's office said. 
France's lockdown to combat the outbreak, which like in Spain, Italy and many other European countries includes restrictions on store openings and people's movements, will remain in place until at least May 11, President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this week.
After that, schools and shops are set to reopen, though it is still unclear at what speed France will allow some businesses like hotels or cafes to restart, and whether it plans to lift home confinement recommendations for everyone at the same time. 
Macron's latest announcements have sparked a backlash in recent days, after he said on Monday that older people, who are considered more vulnerable to the deadly virus, would be asked to stay at home for longer. 
Professor Jean-François Delfraissy, who heads the scientific council advising the government on the epidemic, also fuelled the debate after he proposed that confinement should continue for people aged 65 to 70 and above. 
""The President has followed the growing debate about the situation for elderly citizens after May 11,"" the Elysee palace said in comments sent to Reuters on Saturday. 
""He does not want there to be any discrimination among citizens after May 11 in the context of a gradual easing of confinement measures, and will appeal to people's individual responsibility."" 
The government is still likely to recommend that some people should stay at home for their own protection, however. 
""We will ask the most vulnerable people, older people, severely disabled people, and those who suffer from chronic illnesses, to remain in confinement even after May 11, at least in a first instance,"" Macron said in his televised address on April 13. ""I know it's a major constraint ... But we'll have to try to abide by this to protect you, it's in your interest.""

France's registered death toll from coronavirus infections neared 19,000 on Friday, but most data provided further indications that the spread of the disease was slowing after the one-month-old national lockdown.

A month ago, the government closed all the shops, bars, restaurants, schools and public transport leaving open only food stores, pharmacies and petrol stations. 
Croats have been allowed to leave their homes to buy essentials or seek medical treatment, go for a walk or do an exercise, but not in a group and avoiding social contact. Many people have been working from home.
Croatia has recorded 1,832 cases of COVID-19, with 39 deaths. On Saturday the number of new infections rose by 18 which is the lowest daily increase registered since March 17. 
The number of new cases has been dipping in recent days, with 50 new cases on Thursday and 23 on Friday. Last Sunday, health authorities confirmed 66 new cases. 
""We decided to extend the measures for 15 days, until May 4,"" Bozinovic said.
He said the government was considering the possibility of relaxing certain measures to help the economy, while at the same time continuing to protect the health of citizens.
One such measure could be easing the restriction on leaving their homes, but travel would be possible only within their region of the country. Travelling between different regions would remain barred unless people have a permit for specific business or medical reasons. 
He gave no timeframe for a decision. The government is due to convene for a session on Thursday.

While the government has yet to release its projection of the impact the COVID-19 crisis will have on the economy, the International Monetary Fund forecast a downturn of 9.0% in 2020 and the World Bank projected a fall of 6.2%, mostly due to the country's reliance on the tourist industry.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Some of the neediest residents of Colombia's capital Bogota have started receiving food donations, while dozens living on the street were given a chance to shower and change clothes, as the city rides out a five-week lockdown to contain the coronavirus.
Residents of the Andean city, home to about seven million, had set tires on fire and blocked roads in isolated Thursday protests to demand help during the quarantine.
The government has budgeted 18 trillion pesos (about $4.43 billion) to shore up an inadequate healthcare system and fund welfare payments during the lockdown that runs until April 27.
But many families who get by in informal industries like street selling, construction and recycling are now cut off from work and are scrambling to make ends meet. Many say they have received no aid at all.
Others have been luckier.
On Friday, army soldiers in gloves and masks distributed boxes of rice, beans, sugar, salt, canned meat, toilet paper and bottled water to residents of the Egipto neighbourhood, whose steep streets wind up the skirts of the Andes.
""I'm so grateful to the army because they are the only ones who have gone house to house,"" said a tearful Luz Maria Piraquive, 61. ""This arrived just at the moment when we're lowest on supplies.""
Major Johan Alzate, operations head for the presidential guard, said: ""We are coming to a community with many needs ... joining efforts to try to mitigate some of the emergency that we are living."" 
Meanwhile, the mayor's office offered showers, toiletries, changes of clothes and meals to people living on the street - some of whom have been rendered homeless due to the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.
""I've been sleeping on the street for seven days,"" said 42-year-old Hamilton Mosquera, who lost his job as a club doorman when the government shut down nightlife last month.
The coronavirus has killed over 150 people in Colombia and infected nearly 3,500. Giving people a way to shower and change will prevent them from becoming vectors, city officials said.

""We started these self-care sessions, which is a place where we put in showers, bring clothes, bio-safety supplies like alcohol, antibacterial gel and food,"" said Daniel Mora, from the city's social integration department.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Holy Fire ceremony symbolising Jesus' resurrection was lit in a deserted Jerusalem on Saturday, without the joyful throng of Orthodox Christian pilgrims who normally attend a spectacle that brings the Easter season to a colourful climax.
Bells tolled above a near-empty Church of the Holy Sepulchre as the Greek Orthodox Patriarch, Theophilos III, emerged carrying the flame from the crypt where Christians believe Jesus was buried.
This year, amid coronavirus precautions in a locked-down Jerusalem, he was accompanied only by a handful of mostly Orthodox clergy, some wearing face masks.
Outside in the medieval courtyard of the Holy Sepulchre, by tradition the site of Jesus' crucifixion, burial and resurrection, the plaza was empty of all but a few Israeli police and clerics maintaining social distancing.
The Holy Fire ceremony typically draws tens of thousands of worshippers to the imposing grey edicule in the Holy Sepulchre that is believed to contain the tomb where Jesus lay two thousand years ago.
Sunbeams that pierce through a skylight in the church's dome are believed by worshippers to ignite a flame deep inside the crypt, a mysterious act considered a Holy Saturday miracle each year before Orthodox Easter Sunday. 
Jerusalem's Greek Orthodox Patriarch then lights a candle with the Holy Fire and disperses it to the faithful.
In normal years this would be to the thousands of tiny candles held by cheering worshippers packed into the passageways of the building.
But this year only a handful of Greek, Armenian, Russian and Coptic clergy, many garbed in black and wearing face masks, were present inside the church to receive the flame from the patriarch.
Ripples of applause broke out from a small group awaiting the flame outside the church, including envoys from Orthodox Christian countries.
As the fire passed through the Christian Quarter of the Old City, worshippers who had been unable to attend the church ceremony thronged into the back streets to receive it, ignoring coronavirus restrictions as they chanted, banged drums, waved crucifixes and climbed on each others' shoulders.
Taking a more stately approach, diplomats from states such as Russia and Armenia were permitted to transport the flame with a police escort from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion Airport, where it will be flown out on designated jets. 
Delegations on board were not permitted to disembark due to virus restrictions, Israeli media reported.
As he left Jerusalem's walled Old City through the ancient Jaffa Gate, one Armenian official spoke with delight as he prepared to transport the flame to the airport and back to his homeland.
""We congratulate all the world, all the Christians by the Holy Light, which is a prediction of the resurrection of the Christ,"" he said, carrying a bundle of lit candles and a white lantern.
""Christ... broke the doors of hell and... gave to us a hope for the future, for the eternal life. Christ is risen,"" he added.
The Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox churches share custody of Church of the Holy Sepulchre with Roman Catholics, who celebrated Easter last week. 
The flame was also transported by oil lamp a few miles south to the Palestinian town of Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank, where clergy witnessed the Holy Fire arrive at the Church of the Nativity. 
The church, revered in tradition as Jesus' birthplace, has been closed for weeks because of a coronavirus outbreak in Bethlehem, as have other churches in the Holy Land.

Jerusalem has sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity. Leaders of all three religions have closed holy sites or restricted access, and have urged followers to celebrate festivals at home this year.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal may make face mask use compulsory on public transport and impose beach restrictions during the summer months as part of a plan to ease the coronavirus lockdown. 
In an interview in Saturday's Expresso newspaper, Prime Minister Antonio Costa said he hopes to relax restrictions on schools, stores, restaurants and cultural spaces from May onwards but such a plan would require new rules to keep people safe. 
Portugal declared a state of emergency to halt the spread of coronavirus on March 18 and on Thursday extended it until May 2. Until then most non-essential businesses will remain shut, and restrictions on movement and gatherings will remain in place.
Costa said the plan, which is likely to be announced on April 30, could limit the number of people visiting beaches across the country which are usually crowded during summer. 
""This virus doesn't hibernate in the summer,"" Costa said. ""Mass gatherings cannot happen. Municipalities will have to take necessary measures so that we can go to the beach without overcrowding.""
The country has so far reported 19,685 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and 687 deaths, well below neighbouring Spain.
Costa also said the use of masks could be made compulsory in schools, all of which have been closed since mid-March.
He said it was not yet clear when events, such as music festivals, would be allowed to take place but that cinemas might be able to re-open sooner under new restrictions to reduce risk of contagion.
Portuguese football league matches might be able to go ahead but behind closed doors or only allowing season ticket holders to attend matches.
On Thursday, Costa said small neighbourhood shops, hairdressers and childcare centres were likely to be among the first to re-open in May.

The virus outbreak looks certain to push Portugal's tourism-heavy economy into recession. The International Monetary Fund expects the country's gross domestic product to contract by 8% this year.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - An Argentine official has given some on-air sex education for onanistic lovers in the time of the coronavirus, underscoring how the pandemic and lockdown in response to it are shaking up every aspect of people's lives.
Jose Barletta, a doctor with the country's health ministry, said in a televised broadcast that people needed to wash their hands after sex - whether it was in person or, as is increasingly the case, over digital channels.
""It's more important than ever to wash your hands after having sexual relations, after masturbation, or virtual sex,"" the doctor said. 
""It is important to disinfect keyboards, telephones, sex toys and whatever else you might be using, whether or not you are sharing these things with others,"" he said.
The coronavirus lockdown has led to an increase in sales of sex toys in countries ranging from Denmark to Colombia.
Argentina's lockdown began on March 20 and will run until at least April 26. The country has recorded 2,669 confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far, 122 of them fatal.
The country's center-left President Alberto Fernandez, who has been praised for being one of the first leaders in Latin America to impose strict measures aimed at slowing the spread of the pandemic, was even drawn into the question.
In a radio interview on Friday, Fernandez was asked about the guidance offered by the ministry about sex and hygiene.

Britain is at or near the peak of an outbreak in which more than 14,000 people have already died - the fifth highest national death toll of a pandemic linked to at least 150,000 deaths worldwide.
Ceremonial gun salutes, in which blank rounds are fired from various location across London, are typically used by the royal family to mark special occasions such as anniversaries and birthdays. The Queen's birthday is on April 21. 
The Queen was keen that no special measures were put in place to allow gun salutes as she did not feel it appropriate in the current circumstances, a royal source said.
It is believed to be the first such request in the Queen's 68-year reign, the source said.
""'We will not be marking Her Majesty’s birthday in any special way' this year due to the #coronavirus crisis,""  ITV  (LON:ITV) reporter Chris Ship, who first reported the queen's request, tweeted citing a source.
Britain is in its fourth week of a national lockdown, with businesses forced to close and citizens ordered to stay at home. Earlier this month, the country's longest-serving monarch made an exceptional address to the nation, promising ""Better days will return.""
Buckingham Palace last month said a parade to celebrate the Queen's official birthday, which is celebrated in June, would not go ahead in its traditional form in light of restrictions on social gatherings. 

There are no alternative plans to replace the parade, the source said on Saturday.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested 14 activists in raids on Saturday on charges of illegal assembly, in the biggest crackdown on the city's pro-democracy movement since the outbreak of mass protests last year.
Among those detained in the swoop were prominent Democratic Party founder and senior barrister Martin Lee, 81, millionaire publishing tycoon Jimmy Lai, 71, and former legislator and barrister Margaret Ng, 72, according to media and political sources. 
In all, nine former legislators were arrested.
Democratic legislator Claudia Mo, who was not among those arrested, said the city government, led by Chief Executive Carrie Lam, was trying ""into introduce a ring of terror in Hong Kong"".
""They are doing whatever they can to try to silence, to take down, the local opposition,"" Mo said, pointing to upcoming legislative elections in September in which democrats hope to win back veto power in the city assembly. 
Hong Kong police superintendent Lam Wing-ho told reporters that 14 people aged between 24 and 81 were arrested on charges of organising and participating in ""unlawful assemblies"" on Aug. 18 and Oct. 1 and 20 last year. He did not identify the 14.
Those days saw big and at times violent protests across the city.
Five of the 14 were also arrested for publicising unauthorised public meetings on Sept. 30 and Oct. 19, Lam said.
They were all due to appear in court on May 18, but Lam said more arrests were possible. It is not known whether any of those arrested on Saturday were being held in detention.
The raids mark the biggest crackdown on the pro-democracy movement since the beginning of the anti-government protests across the former British colony in June last year.
NEW PUSH FOR SECURITY LAW
Marchers initially targeted a now-scrapped bill proposing to send suspects to mainland China for trial but protests broadened into demands for full democracy and a public investigation of the use of force by police.
Lai was arrested on similar charges in late February, along with veteran activists Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum, who were also arrested on Saturday.
After his release on Saturday afternoon, Martin Lee said he felt ""relieved to be listed as a defendant because I have seen many brilliant young people being arrested but I didn't.""
""I don't regret what I have done,"" he added. ""I'm proud to have the chance to walk our democracy road with Hong Kong's excellent young people.""
A spokesman for the government's Security Bureau said that regardless of background or status, ""in Hong Kong, everyone is equal before the law"".
""No-one is above it nor can anyone break it without facing consequences ... The police will handle the case in a fair, just and impartial manner,"" the spokesman said.
The arrests come after several months of relative calm amid a partial coronavirus lockdown but just as Chinese and city government officials launch a new push for tougher national security laws for Hong Kong.
The Asian financial hub returned to Beijing in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees it broad freedoms not seen in mainland China, and a high degree of autonomy.
A previous attempt to draft a national security law for Hong Kong, known as Article 23, was met with mass protests in 2003 and abandoned. 
Hong Kong government and security officials have recently described some of the democracy movement's actions as being close to terrorism.
Authorities are increasingly using the threat of terrorism to justify the need for new national security laws, a requirement under the Basic Law - the mini-constitution that guarantees Hong Kong's broad freedoms and outlines its relationship with Beijing. 
Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested more than 7,800 people over their involvement in the last year's protests, including many on rioting charges that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. 
It is not clear how many of them are in custody. China's state media has repeatedly demanded Hong Kong's independent judiciary take tough measures against protests.

The drones could monitor ""enemy movements from a considerable distance"" and were capable of combat missions, he said at the delivery ceremony in Tehran broadcast on TV. 
The aircraft were equipped with bombs and missiles, and they can fly at an altitude of up to 45,000 feet (13,716 meters), he said, without indicating the name of the new drones. 
The drones were manufactured by Iran's military industry with the participation of local universities, he said.
Drones are a key element in Iran's border surveillance, especially the Gulf waters around the Strait of Hormuz, through which one-fifth of the world's oil supply flows.
Tensions between Iran and the United States have reached the highest levels in decades since the United States killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to fire missiles days later at bases in Iraq where U.S. troops are stationed.

Three Taiwan navy vessels visited Palau - one of only 15 countries to maintain formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan - in the middle of March, before returning to Taiwan a month later, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters.
The three confirmed cases had all shared quarters on the same ship, but all 700 sailors on all three ships were being re-called and would be put into quarantine, he said.
Taiwan's presidential office said that President Tsai Ing-wen had been at the ceremony to welcome back the ships but had only waved to the sailors from the shore and had not been exposed to the risk of infection. 
These are the first coronavirus cases reported in Taiwan's military. The navy was carrying out a deep clean of the three ships to disinfect them.
Taiwan has only reported 398 coronavirus cases and six deaths, a far lower number than many of its neighbors due to strict measures taken in the early stages of the outbreak to contain its spread.
The president of Palau, Tommy Remengesau, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that his country of 20,000 people had not had a single case of the coronavirus and he was going to shut it off from the outside world to keep the virus out.

Lopez Obrador said that Trump called him to discuss a prior request by the Mexican president for the United States to sell it thousands of ventilators to help treat COVID-19 patients. 
He said Trump promised on Friday's call to sell Mexico 1,000 ventilators by the end of the month, with the option to buy more. On April 10, Lopez Obrador asked Trump for 10,000 ventilators, and 10,000 monitors. 
""He guaranteed that at the end of this month we will have 1,000 and we could acquire some more because our country does not have restrictions for the purchase of equipment,"" Lopez Obrador posted on Twitter.
He did not say what Trump's reaction was to the suggestion of a meeting, which he said would be to thank the U.S. president personally for the medical equipment and to celebrate the implementation of a new trade deal. 
Mexico, the United States and Canada are trying to implement the USMCA trade deal that replaces NAFTA by June 1, although business groups are calling for a postponement amid the coronavirus outbreak.
The Mexican search for medical equipment comes as the number of infections is forecast to rise sharply in coming weeks, possibly overwhelming the under-resourced public health system. 

Lopez Obrador said Trump told him there would be no restrictions on equipment sales to Mexico, as countries across the region battle to buy scarce medical equipment to treat people suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.

LONDON (Reuters) - A 99-year-old British war veteran who has raised more than 20 million pounds ($25 million) for the health service by walking laps of his garden was praised by Queen Elizabeth's grandson as an ""absolute legend"".
Tom Moore, retired army captain who served in India, Burma and Sumatra during World War Two, became a symbol of British endurance in the face of adversity after completing 100 laps of his garden in a fundraising effort for the health service.
Moore, who has used a walking frame with wheels since breaking his hip, had aimed to raise 1,000 pounds by completing his challenge before his 100th birthday on April 30.
But his endeavour - and enduring optimism - struck a chord with people across the United Kingdom and the wider world, bringing a ray of hope amid the doom of the coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 147,000 people worldwide.
Prince William, the queen's grandson, said Moore was an ""absolute legend"". 
""What I love also is he's a 99-year war vet, he's been around a long time, knows everything and it's wonderful that everyone has been inspired by his story and his determination,"" William said in an interview broadcast on Friday.
Moore said that the current doom would clear and that one day ""the sun will shine on you again and the clouds will go away"".
Such is his renown, that some have called for Moore to be knighted by Queen Elizabeth - a ritual recognition that dates back thousands of years through England's medieval past.
""It makes me laugh,"" Moore said on Thursday when asked about being recognised formally, quipping a reference to the Tudor statesman Sir Thomas More.
""Sir Thomas Moore sounds quite good,"" he chuckled.
British honours, such as knighthoods, are awarded by the queen, usually on the recommendation of a committee comprising government officials and citizens.
British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said ""everybody is supportive of the idea"" of Moore being recognised.
""I wouldn't want to preempt Her Majesty's honours list but it is quite clear that this gentleman has just been almost the salvation of the nation in these difficult times,"" he said. 
""I think everybody is supportive of the idea of him being recognised.""
His exploits have also inspired pieces of art.
In the Yorkshire town of Pontefract, 120 miles (190 km) north of Moore's home in the south of England, artist Rachel List painted a mural of the veteran on Friday.
Moore said the walk was inspired by the care he received from Britain's state-run National Health Service when he broke his hip and when he was treated for cancer.
Moore said on Thursday his supporters had donated an ""absolutely fantastic sum of money"". 
""It's unbelievable that people would be so kind to give that sort of money to the National Health Service,"" he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo on Friday launched a blistering attack on President Donald Trump's response to the coronavirus crisis, accusing him of ""passing the buck"" to the states and favoring big business over communities hardest hit.
Cuomo, who had previously kept his criticism of Trump in check, unleashed a flurry of broadsides following a reporter's question about the president's comments suggesting New York had asked for too much aid that was never fully used.
The governor said the president should ""maybe get up and go to work"" instead of watching TV and accused him of favoring the airline industry and other business cronies in a recent bailout package that Cuomo said left little for the states.
Cuomo said that he had been quick to praise the president when the state was in dire need of hospital beds and ventilators and that his requests for help with those were motivated by the White House's own dire projections for the virus. 
""We built more beds than we needed,"" Cuomo, said pointing to initial federal projections on the impact of the virus which predicted that as many as 2.2 million people could die. ""Our only mistake was believing your numbers and your projections."" 
Cuomo, whose state is at the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, accounting for nearly half of the country's deaths, said the president had repeatedly refused to help states with ramping up testing because it was ""too complicated.""
He said he needs federal funding to significantly ramp up testing capacity and to fill a $10-$15 billion budget shortfall that is hampering the state's ability to fund such efforts on its own. He criticized the aid packages passed by Congress to date for a lack of funds to hard-hit states like New York.
""Is there any funding so I can do these things that you want us to do? 'No,'"" Cuomo told a daily briefing on the coronavirus. ""That is passing the buck without passing the bucks.""
He spoke one day after the Trump administration outlined plans for a phased reopening, starting with the states least affected by the virus.
'ZERO, ZILCH, NADA'
""The federal government has passed three bills to address this crisis. Of those three bills the state governments have gotten precisely zero, zilch, nada in unrestricted aid,"" Cuomo said. 
""Okay, it's up to the states, but then don't ask the states, don't give them this massive undertaking that has never been done before and then not give them any resources to do it.""
In a separate briefing, Governor Phil Murphy of neighboring New Jersey said he had been in constant contact with the White House to get ""the right testing infrastructure and regime in place,"" a prerequisite for reopening the state.
Murphy avoided Cuomo's combative rhetoric, calling his teleconference on Thursday with Trump and other White House officials ""a good discussion."" 
On Thursday, Cuomo extended the closure of businesses and schools in his state until at least May 15, but he has started to plan on a phased reopening that would hinge on keeping hospitalizations and other key metrics on a downward trend.
Cuomo said on Friday that a total of 17,316 people were hospitalized across New York because of COVID-19, down from 17,735 a day earlier and the lowest since April 5. Intubations and admissions to intensive care units also fell, he said.
Cuomo said that about 2,000 infected people were newly admitted to hospitals on Thursday, hovering at a high level, while the state recorded an additional 630 deaths, up from 606 deaths the previous day.
New Jersey, which is second after New York in coronavirus cases and fatalities, reported 323 new deaths on Friday for a total of 3,840, and 3,250 new confirmed cases for a total of 78,467.

But the rates of increase in the spread of the virus have ""dropped dramatically"" over the past several weeks, Murphy said. ""This is what we've been working toward, and what we must keep doing,"" he added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - On Oct. 10 last year, eight North Korean vessels - several carrying illicit coal shipments - were anchored in Chinese waters off the port of Ningbo-Zhoushan, according to a photo in a U.N. report published online on Friday.
That appears to be a lax enforcement by China of U.N. sanctions aimed at curbing Pyongyang's nuclear program under which countries are required to inspect cargo destined to or coming from North Korea that is within their territory or being transported on North Korean-flagged vessels. 
The annual report to the U.N. Security Council by independent sanctions monitors said North Korea continued to flout council resolutions ""through illicit maritime exports of commodities, notably coal and sand"" in 2019, earning Pyongyang hundreds of millions of dollars. 
A U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said China has the capacity to stop sanctions busting by its ally North Korea but ""is simply choosing not to implement the Security Council resolutions.""
""According to a Security Council member, Chinese warships have received notification in real time on multiple occasions of vessels entering its territorial waters who have been observed to be in violation of the U.N. Security Council resolutions,"" the diplomat said.
China's policing of neighbor North Korea's adherence to U.N. sanctions, first put in place in 2006, is considered crucial to the effectiveness of the measures, spearheaded by the United States and unanimously adopted by the Security Council.
Reuters first reported in February that the sanctions monitors report found North Korea continued to enhance its nuclear and ballistic missile programs last year. 
CHINA SAYS IMPLEMENTS SANCTIONS
When asked if China had received the notifications and acted on them, the office of the spokesperson at the Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday that China implemented U.N. sanctions.
""China has always earnestly fulfilled its international obligations and dealt with relevant issues in accordance with the resolutions,"" it said. 
The office said: ""The report clearly states that this is information provided by 'a member state' and not the opinion of the expert group.""
North Korea's mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
A second photo from the U.N. report shows ten North Korean vessels anchored in Chinese waters on Sept. 15 last year near the port of Lianyungang. The photos were provided to the U.N. sanctions monitors by an unidentified member state. 
The monitors reported that North Korea conducts ship-to-ship transfers of illicit cargo such as coal, which has been banned since 2017 in a bid to cut off funding to Pyongyang. 
More photos in the report show floating cranes supporting ""illicit ship-to-ship coal transfers.""
Under U.N. sanctions imposed in 2017 all countries were also required to repatriate North Koreans working abroad by the end of last year to stop them earning foreign currency for leader Kim Jong Un's government. 
A senior U.S. official in January accused China of failing to send home all North Korean workers.
The United States has said it believed Pyongyang was earning some $500 million a year from nearly 100,000 workers abroad, 50,000 of whom were in China. 
In a March 20 letter to the council's North Korea sanctions committee, China - which requested that its note remain private - said it had completed the repatriation by the Dec. 22 deadline. 

""China will continue to implement Security Council resolutions and fulfill its international obligations,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun wrote in the note, seen by Reuters.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainians geared up to celebrate Orthodox Easter this weekend under the wary eye of authorities who have tightened lockdown measures to fight the spread of the coronavirus and fined people for breaking the rules. 
While not closing churches, the government has effectively barred attendance by not allowing services with more than 10 people present, and only allowed people to travel in public places alone or in pairs.
Most church leaders have complied, agreeing to broadcast their services online and on television. 
Priests consecrated the traditional Easter breads directly in bakeries and factories before they were sold, to avoid devotees taking them to priests. In villages, Easter baskets were left at garden gates for priests to consecrate.
But police announced criminal proceedings against some rule-breakers, for example against a procession in Sambir in western Ukraine that authorities said violated regulations on social distancing and wearing compulsory masks.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Ukrainians to stay home over Easter, mindful of a potential spike in infections of a disease that has killed 125 people in the country. 
One of the contagion hotspots has been a sprawling 1,000-year-old monastery complex in Kiev, where around a hundred people were infected and two died. 
The monastery had initially criticized the government's quarantine measures and urged people to continue going to church. The Kiev authorities have sealed off the complex.
""This whole situation demonstrates that your nationality, gender or religion are not important to coronavirus,"" Zelenskiy said, alluding to the monastery. ""It demonstrates that you cannot have a careless attitude towards the disease.""
The monastery is the headquarters of the Russian-backed wing of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church known as the Moscow Patriarchate, which has accused the Kiev government of ""threats and blackmail"" in trying to stop people going to church.
Its leader, Metropolitan Onuphriy, drew further scrutiny by suggesting that people would gather to celebrate Easter in the streets if they were not doing so in churches. 
Archbishop Kliment, spokesman for the church, said by phone that the church was obeying the government's quarantine rules.
""We try to comply with the requirements and let in no more than 10 people into each temple,"" he said.
Asked about Onuphriy's comments, Kliment said Onuphriy had not called people into the street but observed that they would do so themselves and would need to be handled properly. 

""So it's better to organise it correctly than to put your head in the sand and think that it's not happening,"" he said.

There are some 20,000 nurses and doctors in good health who would qualify to participate, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador told his regular news conference.
They would work from April 23 to May 23 to free up younger health workers for coronavirus cases, which are expected to hit a peak by May 10 in the populous capital of Mexico City and surrounding areas.
""According to the projections, we calculate that the number of hospitalizations will increase, and there will also be an increase in intensive care,"" Lopez Obrador said, adding that 20,000 extra workers would be sufficient to cover the higher demand. 
Mexico has so far registered 6,297 cases of the coronavirus and 486 deaths, and authorities are urging people to stay at home to prevent mass numbers of illnesses that could overwhelm the health system. 
Government workers over 60, including medical staff, had been told to stay home as a precautionary measure to protect their health, Lopez Obrador noted. Mexican health authorities have said people above that age could be especially vulnerable to developing complications from the coronavirus.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told his Russian counterpart on Friday that any future arms control talks must focus on an American proposal for a new arms control accord that includes Russia and China, the State Department said.
Pompeo emphasized in a telephone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov that ""any future arms control talks must be based on President (Donald) Trump's vision for a trilateral arms control agreement that includes both Russia and China,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.
China, whose arsenal of an estimated 300 nuclear weapons is far smaller than those of Russia and the United States, has rejected such talks.
Ortagus said Pompeo's comments came as he and Lavrov discussed ""next steps in the bilateral Strategic Security Dialogue, taking into account the COVID-19 pandemic"".
Trump last year proposed that the United States, Russia and China negotiate a new pact to replace the 2010 New START accord that cut deployed U.S. and Russian nuclear warheads and the bombers and land- and submarine-based missiles that carry them to their lowest levels in decades.
New START will expire next February unless the sides agree to extend it for up to five years. Russia has said it would be willing to extend the accord, but the Trump administration has declined to state a position.
The Russian foreign ministry said Lavrov had ""reiterated the Russian proposal to extend the START treaty, due to expire in February 2021"", in his conversation with Pompeo.
""(On the call) it was underlined that Russia is ready to work on possible new nuclear weapons agreements, but that it would be important to preserve... the START treaty while preparations are ongoing,"" the ministry said in a statement.
U.S. administration officials argue that China must be brought into any new arms control pact because of the growing threat they say is posed by its nuclear arsenal, which is undergoing a modernization program. 
Arms control experts, however, have described Trump's proposal to include China in a new treaty as a ""poison pill"" strategy to kill New START and end restraints on U.S. nuclear arms deployments.
Ortagus said Pompeo also discussed with Lavrov bilateral issues, ""including the detention of U.S. citizens"". She did not elaborate on the number or identity of Americans detained in Russia.

France has extended until May 11 a virtual lockdown to curb the coronavirus outbreak that has killed nearly 18,000 people. While most of France's 67 million people are staying in their homes, the homeless are also trying to respect the rules.
""They (the homeless) are confined to their cardboard boxes, in their corner. They respect, well, the ones we know, they respect the confinement in their own way,"" Celine Mendak at the Goelette charity group told Reuters.
The French capital has more than 3,600 homeless people.
Since the start of the lockdown a month ago, Goelette's workers have been collecting food almost daily, loading up trolley bags and then walking through the city centre. 
They stop to chat with some of the homeless camping out on the sides of boulevards and offer them necessities.
Erwan, a homeless man who only gave his first name, told Reuters that even though the money he received on the streets had halved during the lockdown, he enjoyed the conversations with Parisians. 

    ""I've seen people on the street who ignored me and look down their noses, and since the lockdown, they stop to talk to me and so, it's really nice,"" he said.

Kerridge, who has presented cooking programmes on UK television, runs eight food-led businesses including ""The Hand & Flowers"", a pub with two  Michelin  (PA:MICP) stars, but they have been hit by the lockdown imposed to stem the spread of coronavirus.
Kerridge said he and friends set up ""Meals from Marlow"" following a social media post from Wexham Park Hospital in the nearby town of Slough, west of London, seeking help for staff who had no canteen and limited access to food in supermarkets.
""So it was like 'OK, what can we do?... How do I help, when I've got a unit that produces food for an airline and corporate entertainment for football, Premier League football and does Formula One ... that whole thing is shut down,"" he told Reuters.
A GoFundMe page followed and within five days the group had raised 140,000 pounds ($175,000).
With that cash and donations from local food suppliers, they were able to use Kerridge's food production facility 'The Lush Unit' to start making meals for local hospital workers and vulnerable people. They hope to have enough money and volunteers to keep going for at least six weeks.
""The food is actually being taken to them (doctors and nurses) physically on the ward... and they... can just stick it in a microwave and ...get on - it's fuel to keep them going,"" said Kerridge.
Noting the strong public response to his project and the large number of 'thank you' emails, texts and photographs he has received, he added: ""Little things seem to go a long, long way at the minute, emotionally.""
Kerridge, 46, said staying busy was key to dealing with all the bad news generated by the pandemic, which has now killed more than 150,000 people worldwide, including more than 14,000 in the United Kingdom.
""Just setting out the 'Meals from Marlow', I think something like that... keeps me feeling positive,"" he said.

MOSCOW/OSLO (Reuters) - Russia on Friday accused Norway's coastguards of detaining a Russian fishing trawler near a remote chain of islands in the Arctic earlier this month and said it had filed a protest to Oslo over the incident. 
The Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard, about 850 km (500 miles) north of mainland Norway, is seen as a potential flashpoint between Moscow and the West as climate change has opened up the resource-rich region.
Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Friday Russia was seriously concerned after a Russian fishing vessel named the Borey was detained on April 2, within Norway's fish protection zone that Russia considers illegal. 
""We believe the practice of detaining foreign vessels by the Norwegian coastguard in the so-called fish protection zone is in line with Norway's policy of illegally expanding its rights in the archipelago region,"" Zakharova was quoted by TASS news agency as saying.
Norway's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request to comment. It was not clear if the vessel and its crew were still in Norwegian custody. 
Previous incidents of Russian vessels being detained in the area have been reported in 2003, 2011 and 2016. 
Svalbard is regulated by a 1920 treaty which grants Norway sovereignty but allows other signatories, including Russia, residence and commercial rights. A Russian coal mining company has operated there for decades.
Moscow has accused Norway in recent years of flouting the treaty, listing concerns such as Norway's establishment of the fish protection zone. Norway has rejected those accusations and said it is fully compliant with the treaty. [nL8N2AL3D1 
The Borey could be seen sailing south of Svalbard earlier this month and last reported its location on April 10 southeast of Bear Island on the edge of Svalbard's fishing protection zone, shipping data on Refinitiv Eikon showed.

Pont-a-Celles, Belgium (Reuters) - With travelling the roads a way of life for the Sinti community, Belgian Etienne Charpentier and his family say that having their freedom restricted due to the coronavirus epidemic is hitting them especially hard.
""Life is not the same anymore, everything is turned upside down, everything has changed, we can't do what we wanted to anymore,"" Charpentier, the president of Belguim's national committee of travellers, told Reuters.
The Sinti are a European Roma community. While millions of people across the continent are locked down inside their homes to stop the spread of coronavirus, Belgium's travellers are finding it hard to remain settled in one place without moving around freely.
""Our house is our trailer so we don't have as much ease staying indoors as we do outdoors,"" Charpentier said in an interview in his camp, set up in a car park near the decrepit industrial part of the Belgian town of Pont-a-Celles.
The biggest difficulty, he said, is not being able to visit family members in France who are affected by the COVID-19 disease.
""It is something that touches us, because we have a family life and for us, family life is something sacred, it is something that is important.""
Travellers likely face more weeks off the road. Belgium's federal government has extended containment measures to control the spread of the coronavirus to May 3, with only a slight easing of restrictions to allow home improvement stores and garden centres to open and limited visits to care homes.

""It's not always easy,"" Charpentier said. But he added: ""With time, we adapt.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - The European Union's (EU) legislature rebuked nationalist-ruled members Poland and Hungary on Friday for flouting ""European values"" by pressing ahead with an election and assuming extra powers respectively during the coronavirus crisis. 
Hungary's parliament has granted Prime Minister Viktor Orban the right to rule by decree for an indefinite time to fight the pandemic, while Poland's ruling Law and Justice party (PiS) still plans a May presidential vote.
In a clause to a resolution carried by 395 votes to 171, the European Parliament deemed both nations' moves ""totally incompatible with European values"" of democracy and fairness.
Hungary had weakened oversight of government, while Poland's election at a time of health crisis may both endanger lives and undermine the concept of free votes, the resolution said.
Poland has reported 8,214 coronavirus cases and 318 deaths, while Hungary has had 1,763 infections and 156 fatalities. 
Even before the resolution was passed, the Polish prime minister's chief of staff Michal Dworczyk rejected it, telling public radio use of postal ballots would make the election safe. 
In power since 2015, the conservative PiS party has been in increasing conflict with Brussels over issues including judicial reforms, refugees, and climate change. 
The party wants to hold the vote on May 10, or one or two weeks later, President Andrzej Duda's election campaign spokesman Adam Bielan said this week. 
But the opposition says the government is sacrificing public health for political gain. ""Health and life cannot be put at risk by unrestrained lust for power,"" Tomasz Grodzki, a doctor and speaker of the opposition-controlled Senat upper house, told private broadcaster TVN24.
Opinion polls show Duda, a PiS ally, rising in popularity with some projecting him more than 50% of the vote, though turnout could be as low as 30%. Poland's de facto ruler Jaroslaw Kaczynski, the leader of PiS, has said he fears the coronavirus crisis may weaken support for his party in the longer term. 
Hungary, long criticised around Europe for erosion of rule of law, has responded to criticism of the government's new powers by saying parliament can revoke them any time.

There was no immediate response from the Hungarian government to a request for comment on Friday's resolution.

GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (Reuters) - Ecuadoreans who suffer chronic illnesses such as cancer and kidney failure are struggling to get treatment amid the coronavirus pandemic as basic supplies go short and hospitals suspend some services to reduce further infections, according to interviews with officials and relatives of patients.
The Andean nation's COVID-19 outbreak has overwhelmed the health system, in some cases leaving authorities unable to collect the bodies of the deceased and forcing the government to temporarily store corpses in refrigerated shipping containers. 
Ecuadoreans suffering kidney failure fear dialysis treatment centers will close for lack of supplies and because of coronavirus infections among patients and staff, particularly in the coastal city of Guayaquil, which has been the hardest hit.
""We are begging the government for help. Do not forget about us, please,"" said Victoria Haro, 55, a housewife who has gone to numerous dialysis centers to get treatment for her 69-year-old sister.
Cristina Freire, a spokeswoman for the country's dialysis treatment centers, on Tuesday said 100 people died over three weeks for lack of dialysis treatment, without offering details. 
Reuters was unable to independently verify the statement. 
Ecuador's health and interior ministries did not respond to multiple requests for comment on the deaths.
Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo on Thursday said the government plans to begin home delivery of medicine needed by patients with chronic diseases, and to pay for private hospital treatment for those who are critically ill.
""We are working to provide health care to patients with other types of illnesses that are not COVID-19,"" she said during a news conference.
Ecuador's private health clinics have for months complained that the cash-strapped government owes them millions of dollars for unpaid services.
Guayaquil's SOLCA cancer hospital, a private institution that receives support from non-profits, halted chemotherapy and radiation treatment for three weeks to prevent the spread of coronavirus, the hospital's medical director Guido Panchana said in an interview.
He said some cancer patients had died since the start of the epidemic, some in their homes, but declined to say how many.
Ecuador reported about 8,225 positive cases on Thursday, about 403 people dead and another 632 probable deaths from coronavirus in the country, according to official data.
Noris Arroyave, 31, spent weeks waiting in early morning lines to fill an oxygen tank for her diabetic father - despite having tested positive herself for coronavirus. Her father contracted pneumonia and died at home.

BERGAMO, Italy (Reuters) - For doctors in northern Italy, fighting what is still Europe's worst outbreak of COVID-19, the frontlines have moved beyond hospitals as special teams try to keep patients alive at home, away from the saturated wards where thousands have died.
For staff on the so-called USCA (Special Continuity Assistance Units) teams, it has been a draining struggle, initially hampered by a shortage of vital protective gear, that mixes emergency medicine with the shock of losing unprecedented numbers of patients.
""It was and still is a tough experience that will leave its mark on everybody,"" said Giulia Villa, a 33-year-old doctor in the northern town of Bergamo, where hundreds have died since the coronavirus outbreak emerged in a nearby town on Feb. 21.
""We gave everything we had and we are still trying to help people. We especially want to relieve the strain from hospitals by being able to treat patients at home,"" Villa said.
Accounting for half of the more than 22,000 people who have died from the coronavirus in Italy, Bergamo's home region of Lombardy on the border with Switzerland remains one of the worst affected zones in the world and its doctors have been under strain for weeks.
""We saw so many people who needed to be hospitalised very quickly but the problem was, the ambulance service just couldn't keep up,"" she said, struggling to control her emotions.
""There was a huge number of phone calls, unfortunately, to announce deaths which we just never had before. So we found ourselves more than treating patients, confirming many deaths at home.""
Lombardy is Italy's economic powerhouse with a hospital system to match any in Europe, but it came close to buckling as ambulances ferried in thousands of patients a day.
In a bid to relieve the pressure, authorities set up the USCA units last month, aiming to offer more specialised treatment than family doctors were able to provide, while keeping patients out of crowded hospitals.
Since March 19, when they went into operation, the units have carried out more than 1,000 home visits after initial problems getting enough masks and protective equipment for the medical staff and vital oxygen bottles for patients with severe respiratory problems. 
""At the beginning we had very (little) protective equipment, now we have enough. We have masks, we have glasses, we have everything now,"" said Roberto Moretti, the doctor in charge of primary health care in Bergamo.
For frontline medical staff like Villa, getting ready to make a home visit takes at least 15 minutes as she dresses in a full body suit with plastic covers for her hair and feet as well as gloves, a facemask and protective goggles.
Oxygen has also become easier to provide now that suppliers have begun shipping liquid oxygen.
But the personal toll has been enormous as the teams deal with sick and frightened people struggling for life or preparing to watch a family member die.
""No one is prepared for this but we took action immediately and certainly we had really low moments, moments of fear and discomfort,"" Villa said.

""But the wish to help and survive this awful situation was the strength that pushed us on every day to help people.""

Like many African nations, Rwanda has relatively few coronavirus cases so far - just 138 confirmed, with no deaths - but there are fears the pandemic could do far worse damage in the world's poorest continent in coming months. 
Rwanda has long aspired to be a regional technology hub, but its use of drones to combat the coronavirus is not unique.
From Indian slums to English countryside, a host of nations are deploying drones to publicize rules, check movements and even spray disinfectant.
Rehema Kanyana, a 50-year old Rwandan mother-of-four, said she had only left home once since the lockdown came into effect on March 21, to withdraw cash to take one of her children to hospital, but was struck by the strict enforcement.

""On the way to hospital, police stopped us like four or five times,"" she said. Staying at home was tough for many, who were short of food, she added, though state handouts were helping.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's absence from an important anniversary event this week rekindled speculation over his potential health problems, analysts said on Friday. 
North Korea on Wednesday marked the anniversary of the birthday of its national founder and Kim's grandfather, Kim Il Sung, as a national holiday known as the Day of the Sun.
Senior officials paid tribute to the embalmed body of Kim Il Sung enshrined in the Kumsusan Palace of Sun, state media KCNA said on Thursday. But did not mention Kim as part of the delegation, unlike the past. He was also absent from photos released by party mouthpiece Rodong Sinmun. 
His purported absence triggered speculation among experts that Kim, who is aged 36 and overweight, might be having health problems. 
A spokeswoman at Seoul's Unification Ministry, which handles North Korea affairs, said on Thursday it was aware that state media has not reported on Kim's visit but declined to provide any analysis. 
Cheong Seong-chang, a senior fellow at South Korea's Sejong Institute, said it was the first time in decades Kim's visit to the palace on that holiday was not reported state media since he took power in late December. 
""He has been going there on the birthdays of his grandfather and father to flaunt his royalty to them and sacred bloodline,"" Cheong said. 
""It is possible that there was a problem with his health or safety even if temporary, though it is difficult to assess how the situation might be."" 
Pyongyang fired multiple short-range missiles on Tuesday which Seoul officials said was part of the celebration. Such military events would usually be observed by Kim, but there was no KCNA report on the test at all. 
Kim was last publicly seen presiding over a meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's politburo last Saturday.

1482,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 08:25AM ET</span>","China says nearly 1,300 virus deaths not counted in Wuhan, cites early lapses","By Yawen Chen and Brenda Goh
BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Nearly 1,300 people who died of the coronavirus in the Chinese city of Wuhan, or half the total, were not counted in death tolls because of lapses, state media said on Friday, but Beijing dismissed claims that there had been any kind of cover-up.
The central city where the outbreak emerged late last year added 1,290 more fatalities to the 2,579 previously counted as of Thursday, reflecting incorrect reporting, delays and omissions, according to a local government task force in charge of controlling the coronavirus.
Reflecting the additional deaths in Wuhan, China revised its national death toll later on Friday up to 4,632.
The revision follows widespread speculation that Wuhan's death toll was significantly higher than reported.
Rumours of more victims were fuelled for weeks by pictures of long queues of family members waiting to collect ashes of cremated relatives and reports of thousands of urns stacked at a funeral home waiting to be filled.
""In the early stage, due to limited hospital capacity and the shortage of medical staff, a few medical institutions failed to connect with local disease control and prevention systems in a timely manner, which resulted in delayed reporting of confirmed cases and some failures to count patients accurately,"" state media cited an unidentified Wuhan official as saying.
Suspicion that China has not been transparent about the outbreak has risen in recent days as death tolls mount in many countries, including the United States, with President Donald Trump on Wednesday expressing scepticism about China's previously declared death figure of about 3,000.
""Do you really believe those numbers in this vast country called China, and that they have a certain number of cases and a certain number of deaths; does anybody really believe that?” he said.
'RESPONSIBILITY TO HISTORY'
Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Friday that while there might have been data collection flaws earlier during the outbreak, China has ""a responsibility to history, to the people and to the deceased"" to ensure numbers are accurate.
""Medical workers at some facilities might have been preoccupied with saving lives and there existed delayed reporting, underreporting or misreporting, but there has never been any cover-up and we do not allow cover-ups,"" he said. 
Wuhan's total number of cases was revised up by 325, suggesting that some of the new deaths had been recorded as cases but not confirmed as fatalities, taking the total number of cases in the city of 11 million people to 50,333, or about 60% of mainland China's total.
The topic ""Wuhan revises its death toll"" was one of the most read on China's Weibo microblogging platform, which is heavily moderated. 
Many commentators praised the government for admitting its mistakes and correcting them, although some still questioned the numbers and one urged other provinces to reassess their data. 
Doctors and government officials in Wuhan have been repeatedly questioned about the accuracy of the death toll by journalists on government-arranged trips.
CHAOTIC EARLY DAYS
Some of those officials acknowledged that people may have died without being counted in the chaotic early days of the outbreak, before testing was widely available.
""There couldn't have been many because that was a very short period,"" Wang Xinghuan, head of one of two field hospitals built for the outbreak, told reporters in Wuhan on April 12. He stressed that he was not speaking for the government.
It is not unusual in epidemics for case and fatality numbers to be revised after authorities carry out retrospective re-testing or reclassify the cause of infection or death.
The Spanish region of Catalonia on Wednesday announced an additional 3,242 coronavirus deaths since the start of the pandemic, nearly doubling its previous tally, citing a change in methodology to include data from funerary services on suspected and confirmed COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and private homes.
Before the revised Wuhan numbers were released, China said it had recorded 26 new cases of the coronavirus on Thursday, down from 46 cases a day earlier, according to the National Health Commission.
It brought the total number of cases in mainland China to 82,367. 
Of the new cases, 15 were imported infections, the lowest since March 17. The remaining 11 confirmed cases were locally transmitted, down from 12 a day earlier. The number of new asymptomatic cases increased to 66 from 64 a day earlier.
China does not include patients with no clinical symptoms such as a cough or a fever in its tally of confirmed cases.
No new deaths were reported.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 08:20AM ET</span>",Chinese and Malaysian ships in South China Sea standoff: sources,"By A. Ananthalakshmi and Rozanna Latiff
KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - A Chinese government survey ship is tagging an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia's state oil company Petronas in disputed waters in the South China Sea, three regional security sources said on Friday.
China's Haiyang Dizhi 8 entered waters near Malaysia on Thursday, according to ship tracking website Marine Traffic.
On Friday, it was close to the Petronas-operated West Capella, according to the security sources, who did not want to be identified because they were not authorised to talk to the media. One of the sources said a Vietnamese vessel was also tagging the West Capella.
The area is close to waters claimed by both Vietnam and Malaysia as well by China, through its sweeping claim to most of the South China Sea within its U-shaped 'nine-dash line' that is not recognised by its neighbours or most of the world.
The United States has accused China of taking advantage of the distraction of the coronavirus pandemic to advance its presence in the South China Sea.
On Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was conducting normal activities and accused U.S. officials of smearing Beijing.
A Malaysian security source said the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was flanked at one point on Friday by more than 10 Chinese vessels, including those belonging to maritime militia and the coast guard. That source also mentioned the Vietnamese vessel.
The Malaysian prime minister's office, the defense ministry and Petronas did not respond to requests for comment.
Zubil Mat Som, the head of Malaysia's maritime enforcement agency, confirmed that the Haiyang Dizhi 8 was in Malaysian waters, Malay-language daily Harian Metro reported. 
""We do not know its purpose but it is not carrying out any activities against the law,"" he said, according to the report. 
The foreign ministries of China and Vietnam did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Haiyang Dizhi 8 was 324 km (200 miles) off the Malaysian coast, within Malaysia's exclusive economic zone, Marine Traffic data showed. 
It was flanked by a Chinese coastguard vessel as it moved in a hash-shaped pattern consistent with carrying out a survey, as it did during a tense standoff in Vietnamese waters last year.
The West Capella was not visible on the tracking data, but the security sources said the vessel was in the area. The Asia Maritime Transparency Initiative, a Washington DC-based think tank, has signalled its presence there since October.
China has sent medical help to Malaysia, which has reported more than 5,000 coronavirus infections.
China claims almost all of the energy-rich South China Sea, also a major trade route each year. The Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and Taiwan have overlapping claims.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's overnight death toll from coronavirus was 585 on Friday, a rise from 551 the previous night but far off early April peaks as the country starts to loosen the terms of its lockdown.
Overnight figures of more than 900 were registered at the height of the outbreak in Spain, among countries worst-hit by the novel coronavirus which causes respiratory disease COVID-19.
Friday's numbers do not include suspected deaths from the virus, which the Spanish government reiterated it is not counting as part of overall numbers, in line with many other countries.
""Epidemiologically, it is important to maintain a common ... criteria so that everyone counts the same,"" Dr. Antoni Trilla, epidemiologist at Barcelona's Hospital Clinic and government adviser, wrote in La Vanguardia newspaper on Friday. 
The government has said it will seek to harmonise how it collects data from Spain's 17 autonomous regions after Catalonia started including suspected deaths from coronavirus on Wednesday, greatly increasing its tally.
Spain's regions collated their own figures until a state of alarm was declared in response to the coronavirus outbreak on March 14 and the government centralised the collection of data.
Spanish health emergency chief Fernando Simon has said the country is following World Health Organization guidelines by just including people proven to have contracted the coronavirus in the nationwide death toll.
Spain has begun to ease a strict lockdown imposed on March 14, opening up some sectors of the economy, including manufacturing, this week.
People are still confined to their houses except for essential outings like shopping for food and not even children are allowed out for exercise.
Catalonia's health department announced on Wednesday an additional 3,242 coronavirus deaths, nearly doubling its previous tally, as it included suspected and confirmed COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes and private homes for the first time.

These revised Catalan numbers have not been included in the official count.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The streets of Jerusalem's Old City were eerily quiet on Friday, after Greek Orthodox church authorities cancelled the traditional Easter procession along the Via Dolorosa amid a nationwide coronavirus lockdown.
In the morning a handful of Orthodox priests - some wearing black face masks to match their distinctive vestments - arrived at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, revered in Christian tradition as the site of Jesus' burial, crucifixion and resurrection.
The clerics were granted entry to the building, and soon afterwards the sound of prayers could be heard from within.
But there was no subsequent procession down the Via Dolorosa, as in normal years, along the route that Christians believe Jesus passed on his way to crucifixion.
The Holy Sepulchre was closed to the public last month amid precautions against the coronavirus. But small numbers of clerics have been permitted inside to celebrate the events of Holy Week.
The Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox churches share custody of the building with Roman Catholics, who celebrated Easter last week.

The Orthodox authorities are expected on Saturday to mark the ceremony of the Holy Fire, celebrating Jesus' resurrection. But the celebration will be very different from normal years, when the Holy Sepulchre is packed with pilgrims and worshippers.

PARIS (Reuters) - The French military has defended its handling of the spread of the coronavirus aboard its flagship aircraft carrier, after more than a third of sailors tested positive for the disease.
Nearly 700 out of 1,767 sailors in the carrier group that includes the flagship Charles de Gaulle have so far tested positive for the virus, a total expected to rise when results are finalised from a third of the tests. Twenty crew members are in hospital, including one in intensive care.
The rapid spread of the disease on board the French ship has raised questions similar those that arose from an outbreak on board the U.S. carrier Theodore Roosevelt, which led to the firing of a captain who had called for more help, and the resignation of the navy secretary who sacked him.
Several French media outlets have quoted crew members saying there was tension on board the French carrier as the disease spread, after it stopped last month in the French Atlantic Ocean port of Brest and was sent back out to sea.
On Friday, the military denied one report - from a crew member interviewed by France Bleu radio - who said the captain had offered to halt the mission in Brest, but the ministry had ordered the ship to keep sailing.
After the stop in Brest, the ship remained at sea for several more weeks until returning to its Mediterranean home port, Toulon, two weeks ahead of schedule, with 40 sailors on board already showing signs of COVID-19.
""Officially, I deny this information. It is false,"" Navy spokesman Eric Lavault told RTL radio late on Thursday, referring to the report that the military had rejected the captain's offer to end the mission early in Brest.
""People have to understand that it is out of question to put in danger the crew. Without a crew, it is nothing,"" he said.
""The command took all the protective measures and from the Brest stopover there were temperature checks twice a day and questionnaires to trace contacts. But this is not a cruise ship. It's a warship that wages war against Islamic State,"" he said.
Crew from the Charles de Gaulle, its planes and helicopters and the accompanying frigate Chevalier Paul are now in quarantine. The carrier is being disinfected.
France, the Western country with the most troops deployed on active mission abroad apart from the United States, has had to weigh the need to protect its soldiers and sailors from the disease against the desire to press on with missions. The army has already been forced to bring back some soldiers from operations in Africa after they tested positive for the virus.
The military is investigating how the coronavirus arrived on board the carrier. Officials say the stopover in Brest, which took place in the days just before France went into lockdown, may have been to blame.
Sailors were allowed to meet their families on land and were seen in restaurants and cafes before returning to the ship, although an initial plan to allow families on board was scrapped. Fifty new sailors also boarded the ship.

""I think we have to be careful before speculating. There are several possibilities, but the stopover in Brest springs to mind,"" Lauvaut said. Lavaut said a stopover in the Cypriot city of Limassol was also being investigated.

1487,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>","In Modi's India, virus fallout inflames divisions between Muslims and Hindus","By Alexandra Ulmer and Shilpa Jamkhandikar
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The purple ink stamped on Iqbal Hussain Siddiqui's hand by Indian health workers was supposed to ensure he stayed home under quarantine. 
But the 66-year-old Siddiqui, an egg seller in Mumbai's sprawling Dharavi slum, rubbed it off as best he could and went back to work. The mark would have condemned him to being stuck in an unventilated one-room home without a toilet.
It was also, he claimed, part of an effort by the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to target Muslims like him, using health workers to gather data on the community under the guise of containing the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Modi wants to make Muslims second class citizens,"" said Siddiqui, who was ordered to be quarantined after a neighbor tested positive for the virus. ""There is no one who is sick — it's all a lie."" 
His suspicions were echoed by a half-dozen other Muslims whom Reuters talked to in Dharavi, even though community leaders say they have been trying to convince people that the health workers are in the district to protect them from COVID-19.
As the coronavirus sweeps across India, Modi's government has responded by imposing a lockdown on the country's 1.3 billion people. As of Friday, India had announced 437 deaths from the disease. 
The coronavirus has also exacerbated festering divisions between the country's Hindus and its sizable Muslim minority, many of whom have seen their livelihoods threatened by the establishment of quarantine zones in densely-packed areas like Dharavi. There have been at least 71 confirmed cases in Dharavi.
A deep-rooted distrust of Modi by Muslims follows months of protests against a new citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims, and a crackdown by India in the Muslim-majority territory of Kashmir.
There is no official breakdown of coronavirus cases by religion. But many Muslims feel unfairly blamed for spreading the disease after a cluster emerged at a gathering of Muslim missionaries in New Delhi last month. Sensational news coverage about the event, fanned by some Hindu nationalist politicians, helped spur the trending topic ""Coronajihad"" on social media. 
The missionary gathering has been linked to at least 1,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, and more than 25,500 people connected to it have been quarantined.
Muslim leaders say a belief that the coronavirus is not real has spread in their communities, but that they have been working through mosques to change those perceptions.
""There is a strong feeling of distrust in the Muslim community towards the establishment,"" said Gyasuddin Shaikh, a politician with the opposition Congress party in Ahmedabad, the biggest city in Modi's home state of Gujarat, which was the scene of Hindu-Muslim riots in 2002. ""It took us a lot of time and effort to convince such people that the documents are needed for medical assistance."" 
Despite those efforts, public health experts warn that suspicions about the government's intentions in a community of around 200 million people could complicate India's push to stamp out the virus. 
A sense of isolation within the Muslim population ""does not enhance community participation and it drives disease underground,"" said Dr. Jacob John, professor of community medicine at the Christian Medical College in the southern state of Tamil Nadu. 
The health ministry and Prime Minister's Office did not respond to requests for comment.
    
""IRRESPONSIBLE EVENT""
The health workers who have fanned out across districts like Dharavi to identify and track cases have been a particular source of suspicion. Some Muslims believe they are secretly collecting data for a proposed national database aimed at identifying illegal immigrants, according to community leaders and interviews with residents. 
Many Muslims feel the database, the National Register of Citizens (NRC), could be used to render those without sufficient documentation stateless.
""We have to go and tell the community: 'Please, this has nothing to do with NRC. This is for your safety,'"" said Imtiaz Jaleel, a member of the All India Council of the Union of Muslims, an opposition party.
Most Muslim communities are supporting the authorities in their virus-containment efforts, said a senior health ministry official in the state government of Maharashtra, home to Mumbai. But in some cases, people sought in connection with the missionary gathering were allowed to hide in mosques, said the official, who asked to remain anonymous.
Maharashtra police have filed cases against more than 200 members of the missionary group, Tablighi Jamaat, for allegedly helping spread the disease, including by hiding in the mosques, a police official said.
Mujeeb ur Rehman, a Tablighi Jamaat spokesman, said some people had been stranded in mosques after the lockdown and were fearful of declaring themselves to authorities. 
Gatherings of the Tablighi - an orthodox proselytizing group - have been linked to major spreads of coronavirus cases across India, Malaysia and Pakistan.
Some health professionals say the Modi government overstated the impact of the group in India and that intensive testing of Muslims, at a time when few such checks were being carried out in India, unfairly suggested the community was disproportionately responsible for the disease's spread. 
New Delhi has pushed back against criticism that it is singling out Muslims. 
It is unrealistic to expect us to avoid denouncing ""such an irresponsible event"" merely out of ""political correctness"", Foreign Ministry Secretary Vikram Swarup said last week.
    
OUTRAGE ONLINE 
Inflaming the situation in India has been a spate of viral videos carrying false information. It is unclear who has been creating the videos.
Some videos depict Muslims attempting to spread the virus by spitting or blowing noses with currency notes.
Other fake reports circulating online are fomenting distrust about Hindus and the government. Some claim that Muslims are immune to the virus or allege they are the only ones being quarantined, said Pratik Sinha, co-founder of the fact-checking website Alt News.
""The process of building fear in a minority community happens in multiple ways: Through mainstream media, through constant attacks on social media, and then all you need is one video saying: 'You are being targeted,'"" said Sinha.
The government has ordered Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and the video app TikTok to remove users found to be spreading misinformation about the coronavirus, according to a letter seen by Reuters. 
Such messages ""have the potential for creating panic,"" the IT Ministry said in the letter. ""This effectively weakens the all-out effort being made by the Indian government for containing the coronavirus.""
A Facebook spokesperson said the company was taking ""aggressive steps to stop misinformation and harmful content."" TikTok referred Reuters to an April 3 statement which said it had removed thousands of videos spreading misinformation about the coronavirus in India. 
Many Muslims are also angry at what they say is the downplaying of clusters linked to Hindus. One reported case – the quarantining of 27,000 people linked to a Hindu man with the coronavirus who had hosted a gathering of around 1,000 people – has attracted particular attention.
Seated on a bench in Dharavi last weekend, Younus Ghouri, a Muslim taxi driver, became angry as he watched a Facebook video criticising what it said was the Indian media's sparse coverage of the incident. 

""Why is no one talking about that? They're just talking about what Muslims did,"" said Ghouri, 38.

1488,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 07:20AM ET</span>","At least 300,000 Africans expected to die in pandemic: U.N. agency","By Joe Bavier
JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic will likely kill at least 300,000 Africans and risks pushing 29 million into extreme poverty, the U.N. Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) said on Friday, calling for a $100 billion safety net for the continent.
Africa's 54 countries have so far reported fewer than 20,000 confirmed cases of the disease, just a fraction of the more than two million cases reported globally. But the World Health Organization warned on Thursday that Africa could see as many as 10 million cases in three to six months.
""To protect and build towards our shared prosperity at least $100 billion is needed to immediately resource a health and social safety net response,"" the UNECA report stated. 
UNECA is also backing a call by African finance ministers for an additional $100 billion in stimulus, which would include a halt to all external debt service.
The agency modelled four scenarios based on the level of preventive measures introduced by African governments. 
In the total absence of such interventions, the study calculated over 1.2 billion Africans would be infected and 3.3 million would die this year. Africa has a total population of around 1.3 billion.
Most of Africa, however, has already mandated social distancing measures, ranging from curfews and travel guidelines in some countries to full lockdowns in others.
Yet even its best-case scenario, where governments introduce intense social distancing once a threshold of 0.2 deaths per 100,000 people per week is reached, Africa would see 122.8 million infections, 2.3 million hospitalisations and 300,000 deaths.
Combating the disease will be complicated by the fact that 36% of Africans have no access to household washing facilities, and the continent counts just 1.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people. France, in comparison, has 5.98 beds per 1,000 people.
Africa's young demographic - nearly 60% of the population is below the age of 25 - should help stave off the disease. On the other hand, 56 per cent of the urban population is concentrated in overcrowded slums and many people are also vulnerable due to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malnutrition.
Africa imports 94% of its pharmaceuticals, the report said, noting that at least 71 countries have banned or limited exports of certain supplies deemed essential to fight the disease.
""In a best-case scenario ... $44 billion would be required for testing, personal protective equipment, and to treat all those requiring hospitalisation,"" it stated.
However, that is money Africa does not have as the crisis could also shrink the continent's economy by up to 2.6%.
""We estimate that between 5 million and 29 million people will be pushed below the extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day owing to the impact of COVID-19,"" the report said.
Nigeria alone will lose between $14 billion and $19.2 billion in revenues from oil exports this year. And the prices of other African commodities exports have plummeted as well.
Lockdowns in Europe and the United States also imperil Africa's $15 billion in annual textile and apparel exports as well as tourism, which accounts for 8.5% of Africa's GDP.

KIBBUTZ TZUBA, Israel (Reuters) - Israel is heading off shortages of disposable surgical masks during the coronavirus crisis by mass-producing washable versions sized to fit everyone from children to bearded men who shun shaving due to their religion.
As part of stepped-up precautions against the virus, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government on Sunday made it compulsory for Israelis to cover their mouths and noses while in public. 
But the global crunch on medical kit has made single-use masks scarce or overpriced. After sending Mossad spies to hunt for supplies abroad and permitting Israelis to opt for scarfs or other makeshift masks, the government turned to local expertise.
The result is a mask made of high-density cotton similar to bedsheet material, which can be disinfected with a 60 degree Celsius laundry cycle and reused, potentially for weeks.
Around 10 workshops - including in jails - on around-the-clock shifts have made the first million masks for the emergency services and high-risk groups, said Amit Ben-Kish, a manager of the project sponsored by the health and defense ministries.
While the state covered that initial cost, the plan is to produce further masks for sale in shops at around $2 each. 
""Each mask can be used tens of times. By buying five masks for less than $10, you are set for a few months,"" Ben-Kish said at a factory in Kibbutz Tzuba, between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
Behind him, a dozen teens on a volunteer year-off between high school and compulsory military service perched behind sewing machines that were set apart in deference to social distancing. They rattled off masks that were then stacked for sterilization and packing with multilingual instruction labels.
The masks' protection is comparable to paper surgical masks: more than improvised cloth, less than N95 filtered respirators.
""Another advantage of woven fabric masks is that they can be made in variable sizes. We already made masks for kids, youths and adults. One particular size - extra large - fits people with beards,"" Ben-Kish said.
Many of Israel's Jews and Muslims, and some Christian clergymen, wear beards as a mark of faith, and the mask order raised questions as to how facial hair would be accommodated.
Except for a blue police design, the masks come in white, said designer Rinat Peleg Hermoni. 

Some types of pigmentation can present a respiratory risk, she explained: ""And besides, white shows dirt clearly. It's a good reminder of when a wash might be past due.""

The mayor said that evidence from around the world was that face coverings help stop the spread of the virus. 
New York has ordered residents to wear masks or substitute face coverings when in any public situation that may not allow them to be at least six feet away from others.
""In those circumstances where its not possible for us to keep our social distance, think of public transport usage, think of when you're in a shop, we should be using non-medical facial coverings like bandandas, like scarves, like reusable masks,"" Khan told the BBC.
The United Kingdom's social distancing guidelines do not mention the wearing of face masks, but Khan said that should change.

Britain's lockdown was extended by at least three weeks on Thursday as its death toll rose to 13,729, and the opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has cautioned that the country risked becoming the worst hit in Europe.

SUIFENHE, China (Reuters) - As the coronavirus spread in Russia, a group of 500 Chinese residents of Khabarovsk city in the Far East decided to lock themselves inside an apartment block, imposing a regime of self-isolation that has been in place since April 1.
""Of course we are dying to go home,"" 50-year-old Liu Haijun, a native of the northeastern Chinese border city of Suifenhe, told Reuters by phone from the building called the Tianyu Guesthouse.
""But with the border closed and flights canceled, and rumors of people getting infected on the journey back, and because my business is here, we just have to stay put in Russia and keep ourselves safe,"" he said.
The worsening outbreak in Russia has forced the roughly 150,000 Chinese citizens living there to decide between sheltering in place or trying to cross back into China, where the coronavirus has been curtailed by drastic containment measures.
Thousands have opted to return home, including 2,443 at Suifenhe, bringing a wave of infections with them that forced authorities to close the border this month and put the city into virtual lockdown. Shutters were closed and doors bolted on most shops on Thursday.
Liu said that most Chinese people in Russia are acutely aware of how the epidemic ravaged the Chinese city of Wuhan. 
""But most Russians don't know this. They still go around not wearing masks, kissing and greeting. If one catches the virus, many will surely catch it too,"" said Liu, who has run a garment trading business in Russia for 23 years.
President Vladimir Putin ordered many Russians to work from home from April 1 and authorities have locked much of the country down, with people told to keep their distance from others and food stores imposing strict social distancing rules. Many Russians can be seen wearing masks, although many pharmacies say they have long run out of stock.
On Thursday, Russia reported 3,448 new cases, bringing the total to nearly 28,000.
Moscow has chafed at criticism from China over its handling of the virus. China's Global Times, run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, recently suggested Moscow had failed to do enough to halt the spread of the virus.
""We can hardly agree with such criticism,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.
China has barred entry to foreigners and is scrambling to intercept ""imported"" cases among returning Chinese. Shanghai authorities said this week that 60 people arriving there on an Aeroflot flight from Moscow last Friday have the coronavirus.
WUHAN-STYLE LOCK-IN
When the Chinese owner of the guesthouse in Khabarovsk proposed in a WeChat group that his residents undergo voluntary lockdown, nearly everyone went along with it, Liu said.
""The gates are electrically locked by the guesthouse owner. If you enter you cannot leave. If you leave you cannot return. We don't want anyone to bring the virus in,"" he said.
The set-up is similar to what happened in Wuhan, a city of 11 million.
Residents buy necessities at an on-site mini-mart. For anything else, the guesthouse owner takes orders and makes deliveries to the gate. 
Although not enforced by the guesthouse, residents follow the health tips encouraged in China - wearing masks and practising social distancing when strolling in the car-park.
Liu said that staff from the Chinese consulate in the city had visited recently to collect identification details and tell residents to be in touch if they need assistance. Local authorities had not been in touch, he said.
GETTING OUT
But Wang Jingwen, who had been working as a tour guide in St. Petersburg for two years, decided to leave because business was bad and she was not confident the Russian healthcare system could cope in the event of a massive outbreak of COVID-19.
In late March, she flew from St. Petersburg to Novosibirsk, and then to Vladivostok, where she joined other Chinese on a three-hour bus ride to Suifenhe.
""I travel frequently for work but this is the first time I was truly overjoyed to see the words 'China Customs',"" Wang, 33, told Reuters by phone.
At the Suifenhe checkpoint, she gave her travel history and health details and had a cotton swab stuck down her throat for testing. She was quarantined in a hotel for 14 days, reporting her temperature daily. 
After passing two nucleic acid tests, she was released and is now home in the southwestern city of Chengdu.
Liu, the garment trader, wants to go home too.
""My parents are old and ill. If someone is willing to take my stock for half the price, I would sell in a heartbeat to go home to them,"" he said.

1496,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 17, 2020 02:25AM ET</span>","Myanmar to free almost 25,000 prisoners in largest amnesty in years","(Reuters) - Myanmar will free almost 25,000 prisoners in an amnesty to mark the traditional New Year, the president's office said on Friday, its largest mass pardon in recent years.
President Win Myint said 24,896 people jailed across the country, including 87 foreigners, would be freed unconditionally “to bring delights to the citizens of Myanmar and taking into consideration humanitarian concerns”.
The president gave no details of the crimes the prisoners were convicted of.
Zaw Zaw, a spokesman for the prisons department, told Reuters by telephone the large number being released was not linked to concern about the coronavirus,
Myanmar has reported 85 cases and four deaths from the coronavirus, which emerged in neighboring China late last year and has spread around the world.
Crowds gathered outside Insein prison in the commercial capital of Yangon on Friday hoping to greet family members, despite a ban on gatherings to prevent the spread of the virus.
Last year, about 23,000 people were freed over several days in the annual amnesty, according to state media. More than 8,000 were released the previous year.
It was not immediately clear whether the release would include anyone convicted in connection with acts of dissent against the government. 
The prison department says there are no political prisoners in Myanmar but rights groups say dozens of people are in prison because of their political activity.
Asked if any such prisoners were among those being released, Zaw Zaw said the prison department did not put ""labels"" on freed prisoners. An official at Insein prison said he did not know if any activists or dissidents were being freed.
When Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi took power in 2016, after more than half a century of military rule, one of her first acts was to release hundreds of political prisoners.
""The government doesn't actually acknowledge political prisoners but we were asked for some lists and we gave a list of over 70,"" said Aung Myo Kyaw of the rights group Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).
""We still don't know if any of them are released,” he said.
More than 331 people were prosecuted in freedom of expression-related cases in 2019, according to human rights nonprofit group Athan.
Those behind bars include members of a satirical poetry troupe and students imprisoned last month for protesting against a government-imposed internet shutdown.
While the military retains extensive powers, activists say the civilian government has failed to use its overwhelming parliamentary majority to scrap repressive laws stifling dissent, tightening restrictions on civil society.
The AAPP says there are more than 92,000 people in Myanmar's over-stretched prison system, with some jails operating at double or triple capacity. So the number being released would represent more than a quarter of the prison population. 

The government has not released information recently about the prison population.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - A spate of suspected coronavirus deaths among workers for U.S. companies operating along the border in Mexico has triggered multiple protests in recent days, highlighting friction over which factories should remain open in the pandemic. 
At least four workers at American companies' factories in Mexican border towns died this week, companies and workers said on Thursday, adding to several factory worker fatalities apparently linked to cases of the new coronavirus since the start of April. 
Workers at Honeywell International Inc (NYSE:HON), Lear Corporation, Regal Beloit and Poly have all died in recent weeks, according to the companies.
Protests calling for safe conditions or shutdowns with full pay outside factories have taken place in border cities Mexicali, Matamoros, Reynosa and Tijuana after the Mexican government on March 30 ordered non-essential industries to suspend operations.
On Thursday, dozens of protesters demanded a Honeywell assembly plant in Ciudad Juarez be closed to prevent the spread of the virus after a colleague died.
""We want them to respect the quarantine,"" said Mario Cesar Gonzalez outside the Honeywell factory, which he said makes smoke alarms. ""The manager said that we are essential workers. I don't think an alarm is essential.""
Honeywell told Reuters its Ademco factory makes heating and ventilation controls for critical infrastructures such as hospitals and laboratories and said the worker died after being sent to self-quarantine on April 2. 
Also in Juarez, electric motor company Regal Beloit confirmed two workers died this week after being sent home in early April in compliance with measures to prevent the spread of the virus.
Car seat maker Lear confirmed ""several"" of its workers had died at a public hospital in the same city this month of respiratory illnesses.
In Tijuana, workers protested after the deaths of two colleagues employed by technology company Poly this week. The company, also known as Plantronics, told Reuters the workers died of unknown causes.
Lockdowns aimed at stopping the spread of the coronavirus are beginning to disrupt supply chains in the $1.2 trillion North American Free Trade Agreement region, with governments and companies disagreeing about which industries should operate. 
A report from labor rights group the Border Committee of Workers (CFO) on Wednesday said some companies sent employees home on half salaries. Mexico has not yet implemented a universal payment system for furloughed or laid-off workers, but gives some loan assistance.
The report also criticized conditions, saying some factories did not have soap in bathrooms or in dining hall sinks at the end of March. 
The government is investigating why 15% of companies with non-essential activities had refused to stop work, deputy health minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said on Wednesday, warning failure to comply could be a crime. 
""IN GREAT FEAR"" 
Although COVID-19 - the illness caused by the coronavirus - had not been confirmed as the cause of the death of its worker, Honeywell said the worker was turned away from the site after failing a medical screening. 
The company did not give the date of the death, but said it closed the factory two days for cleaning after the worker went into quarantine. 
Lear said in a statement to Reuters several employees at its Ciudad Juarez operations had died of complications from respiratory illness, but declined to say how many.
It said it halted all employee-related activities in the city by April 1. 
Poly, a California-based maker of communications gear, told Reuters one of the workers who died had not been at the plant in 30 days. 
However, Poly said it had suspended operations at the plant in Tijuana, a manufacturing hub across from San Diego that has registered 271 cases of coronavirus.
Poly said its products supplied essential government and healthcare businesses. Regal, which said its plant was also closed, described its products as essential too.
A 23-year-old Poly worker in Tijuana told Reuters she was told to stay home this week, but her husband is still going to work at another company that makes steel materials. 

""There's no use in me staying home, if he's still putting himself at risk,"" said the woman, who declined to be named, fearing retribution. ""We're having a really bad time. We're going to work in great fear.""

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Flights deporting Guatemalan migrants from the United States will again be temporarily suspended, Guatemala's foreign ministry said on Thursday, after a mass infection of the new coronavirus was reported on a recent flight.
The Associated Press reported 44 of 76 Guatemalan migrants who arrived in the country on a U.S. deportation flight on Monday subsequently tested positive for the highly contagious coronavirus that causes a respiratory illness.
When contacted by Reuters, the government did not immediately confirm the report, which cited an unnamed Guatemalan official.
A spokesman for the foreign ministry confirmed deportation flights have been temporarily suspended but gave no further details.
Later on Thursday, a spokesman for the presidency said Guatemala would test deportees again regardless of whether they had been tested before.
""Guatemala is working with U.S. authorities to evaluate the health status of Guatemalans returned in recent days,"" he added. 
Deportation flights had only started again on Monday after a five-day suspension. The health ministry says that in total, five deportees have tested positive for the virus since March.
Guatemala has so far registered 214 coronavirus cases and seven deaths.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) said it closely follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
""Currently, CDC is on the ground in Guatemala to review and validate the COVID-19 tests performed on those arriving from ICE Air flights,"" she said.
""Once results are available, ICE will determine whether to re-evaluate current medical procedures with CDC guidance to ensure that any newly necessary practices are implemented.""

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - A Brazilian tourist who made a pilgrimage to an abandoned bus made famous by the book and film ""Into the Wild"" has been rescued from the remote site outside of Denali National Park, the Alaska State Troopers said on Thursday.
The tourist, one of hundreds of visitors who have hiked out to the site where Christopher McCandless died of starvation in 1992, activated an emergency beacon after he ran out of food, the troopers said.
The troopers identified the hiker as 26-year-old Gabriel Dias Da Silva.
Da Silva was picked up by a trooper helicopter on Wednesday from his campsite near the bus, Peters said. He had been able to cross the river on the way to the bus, but conditions had worsened when he tried to return, Peters said.
""The river was open and raging. Apparently when he had headed out about a week ago, ice bridges were still up,"" she said.
The abandoned and rusted bus, which McCandless used as his final campsite, has become a shrine of sorts for fans of the book by Jon Krakauer and the 2007 movie that was based on it.
Dias Da Silva is the latest in a long list of hikers to the ""Into the Wild"" bus who have required rescue. In February, five Italian tourists, one with frostbitten feet, were rescued after hiking to the site.
Two of the treks have been fatal. Last summer, a woman from Belarus died after being swept away in the Teklanika River on her return from the bus. In 2010, a woman from Switzerland also died in the river in a similar incident.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - More than a thousand mainly Bolivian migrants are stranded near Chile's northern border after informal labor sources in their host country dried up but they were unable to return home because of shutdowns to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, refugee groups and both governments have confirmed. 
The migrants have been gathering for the past two weeks after Bolivia progressively tightened its border after allowing some returnees into quarantine within the country. 
Now, around 800 people are being housed in a disused school in the northern Chilean city of Iquique, while another 300 are waiting in a bus station in  Antofagasta  (LON:ANTO), another major city, Chilean authorities and refugee groups say, after several thwarted attempts to cross. Most are Bolivians, but some Peruvians are also seeking to return home.
Refugee groups say 250 more people are sleeping outside the Bolivian consulate in Iquique, and that more people are heading north from the Chilean capital Santiago.
On Wednesday the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights and former Chilean President Michelle Bachelet urged countries in Latin America to open their borders to their own nationals.
“Under international law, everyone has the right to return to their home country – even during a pandemic,"" she said. 
Bolivia's foreign ministry told Reuters on Thursday it would be making an announcement ""in the coming hours"" about the situation. 
Chile's foreign minister Teodoro Ribera said later on Thursday that Bolivia had agreed to reopen its border to some returnees on Saturday and Sunday. 
He said the two countries had negotiated that the migrants' time in the care of the Chilean authorities in Iquique and Antofagasta could be counted as quarantine and discounted from time they would spend under observation on the other side of the border before returning to their homes.
He said he hoped the measure ""would ensure that people entering Bolivia are not carrying coronavirus or risk generating a larger outbreak in Bolivian territory,"" he said in a statement sent to media. 
Hector Pujols, president of Chile's National Migrants Coordination Group, said before the development that it had appealed to the World Trade Organization to intervene since it has responsibility for migrant labor. 
""Without work or a means to live, people prefer to go back to their own countries but they can't do that either now, so it's a Catch-22 situation,"" he said. 
Jorge Corpus, a Bolivian man waiting in Antofagasta, told local television: ""It makes you feel very angry and impotent. It's beginning to look like we're never going to see our families or get back to Bolivia. We don't have any money left or anything to live on.""

1503,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 06:00PM ET</span>",Poor residents of Colombia's capital protest lack of aid during quarantine,"By Luis Jaime Acosta
BOGOTA (Reuters) - Residents in poor parts of Bogota, the Colombian capital, blocked roads on Thursday to demand authorities make good on promises of aid so they can survive a national quarantine designed to stop the spread of the coronavirus. 
The quarantine, now in its fourth week, is set to last until April 27.
President Ivan Duque and Bogota Mayor Claudia Lopez have announced millions of pesos worth of aid for the poorest members of society who lost their income due to the lockdown. 
Yet residents in the south of Bogota, which has a population of about 7 million people, said they still have not received any assistance. Many are going hungry because they cannot work in their usual informal jobs. 
""We are protesting because the aid hasn't arrived. There are elderly, handicapped and children. This is a peaceful protest,"" said Paula Andrea Quimbay, 23, who lives in a mountainside neighborhood where people blocked roads with stones. 
The government of Bogota has agreed to spend $55.6 million on healthcare, cash subsidies, food vouchers and shopping deliveries that have benefited more than 1 million families. But Lopez recognized delays in delivering help. 
In the nearby neighborhood of La Colombianita, protesters built barricades with large trash bins and burning tires. 
Lopez said some politicians, whom she did not name, were promoting the protests, but warned she would not be pressured by those who want to take advantage of the situation to push the mayor's office into delivering aid to those politicians' followers. 
""In this time of need Bogota will not return to politicking and clientelism under any circumstance, we aren't going to give into this pressure,"" she said, adding that aid would reach residents without any political interference. 
There was an attempt to loot a supermarket during the protests, said city police commander Oscar Gomez Heredia, requiring intervention by the feared ESMAD anti-riot police, who used tear gas to disperse the would-be vandals.
Protesters in the Brisas del Volador neighborhood denied being pressured by politicians and called for immediate aid.

""Please, help us, nothing has been resolved. We are forced to go and collect food that other people throw away,"" said a tearful Juan Carlos Rivera, 31, who earned a living by washing cars before the quarantine. ""Does that seem fair? It's not.""

1504,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 05:47PM ET</span>",Scattered protests push back on U.S. coronavirus stay-at-home orders,"By Michael Martina and Joseph Ax
DETROIT (Reuters) - As sweeping stay-at-home orders in 42 U.S. states to combat the new coronavirus have shuttered businesses, disrupted lives and decimated the economy, some protesters have begun taking to the streets to urge governors to rethink the restrictions.
A few dozen protesters, many with young children, gathered in Virginia's state capital of Richmond on Thursday in defiance of Democratic Governor Ralph Northam's mandate, the latest in a series of demonstrations this week around the country.
The protests have taken on a partisan tone, often featuring supporters of President Donald Trump, and critiquing governors whose shelter-at-home directives are intended to slow the spread of a pandemic that has killed more than 31,000 across the United States.
On Wednesday, thousands of Michigan residents blocked traffic in Lansing, the state capital, while protesters in Kentucky disrupted Democratic Governor Andy Beshear's afternoon news briefing on the pandemic, chanting ""We want to work!""
States including Utah, North Carolina and Ohio also saw demonstrations this week, and more are planned for the coming days, including in Oregon, Idaho and Texas.
The United States has seen the highest death toll of any country in the pandemic, and public health officials have warned that a premature easing of social distancing orders could exacerbate it.
Trump has repeatedly said he wants to ""reopen"" the economy as soon as possible and has clashed with governors over whether he can overrule their stay-at-home orders.
In Michigan, where Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer has imposed some of the country's toughest limits on travel and business, some protesters at ""Operation Gridlock"" wore campaign hats and waved signs supporting Trump.
Whitmer is considered a top contender to be the running mate of Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden when he takes on Trump in November's general election.
One of the organizers of the demonstration in Lansing, Meshawn Maddock, said she was frustrated that much of the media focused on a handful of protesters who gathered on the steps of the capitol, including militia group members and a man holding a Confederate flag who she said were not part of the rally.
She faulted Whitmer for dismissing the event as a partisan rally instead of engaging with the thousands of residents who Maddock said have legitimate questions about the governor's stay-at-home order.
""When I'm fighting to (help) a guy who cleans pools or mows lawns, or a women who wants to sell her onion sets or geraniums, I don't care whether they vote Republican, Democrat, or never vote at all,"" Maddock said.
Maddock, 52, is among seven board members of the Republican-aligned Michigan Conservative Coalition who organized the protest. She is also a board member of the pro-Trump political action committee Women for Trump, but said the Trump campaign had no involvement in organizing the protest.
""The Trump campaign has given me no messaging,"" she said. ""All I know is that I care about Michigan. I've lived here my whole life and I want to help workers get back to work.""
She said she had received calls from people in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Virginia and other states asking for advice on planning similar protests.
The political wrangling over the COVID-19 crisis has begun to take on familiar partisan battle lines. Democratic strongholds in dense urban centers such as Seattle and Detroit have been hard hit by the virus, while more Republican-leaning rural communities are struggling with the shuttered economy but have seen fewer cases.
Kenny Clevenger, 30, a realtor in western Michigan's Allegan County, where only 25 coronavirus cases have been identified, said the shutdown had put him out of business.
""Yes, this needs to be taken seriously, but it's being taken advantage of,"" Clevenger said. ""People believe Democrats are attempting to use this to undermine the economy, once again just attacking the president.""
Increasingly, Republican state lawmakers, including some in Texas, Oklahoma and Wisconsin, have begun putting pressure on governors to reopen businesses. Pennsylvania's Republican-led legislature passed a bill that would loosen restrictions, which Democratic Governor Tom Wolf was expected to veto.
Both Democratic and Republican governors have resisted calls to abandon distancing too quickly. On Thursday, five Democratic governors and two Republican governors in the Midwest, including Whitmer in Michigan, said they would coordinate efforts.
Stephen LaSpina, one of the organizers of a ""Stand Up to End the Shutdown"" protest set for April 20 at Pennsylvania's capitol in Harrisburg said that its sole goal was to get the economy running again by May 1. 

""We are really welcoming groups of all different backgrounds and demographics,"" said LaSpina, who lives near Scranton, and like many others who work in retail, said he had personally been affected by the shutdown. ""Anyone who has been impacted by this shutdown in a negative way is welcome and we want them to be heard regardless of their party affiliation.""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro fired his health minister on Thursday after butting heads over how to confront the new coronavirus, and a person familiar with the matter said the president would appoint oncologist Nelson Teich in his place.
Luiz Henrique Mandetta said on Twitter that Bolsonaro had told him of his dismissal.
The two have clashed for weeks over the need for widespread social isolation in the country to curb the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. The populist leader argues the measures are unnecessary and economically harmful, insisting the outbreak is being blown out of proportion.
Bolsonaro met with Teich, a candidate for the ministerial role in 2018, Thursday morning in a meeting kept off the official presidential agenda, two sources with knowledge of the meeting told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
Teich, now a medical consultant according to his LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile, has posted on social media defending many of the same positions Mandetta holds, including ""horizontal"" isolation of the whole population, which Bolsonaro opposes.
Bolsonaro has downplayed the threat of the coronavirus as a ""little flu,"" arguing that Brazil's economy must continue to run normally and defending the use of unproven drugs like hydroxychloroquine.
Mandetta said in a live webcast with health industry officials on Thursday that he expected to be fired by Friday, although he tried to minimize fears that his departure would disrupt efforts to battle the coronavirus pandemic. 
Mandetta said he would assist his replacement during the transition in the ministry.
""We have a prospect of change here in the ministry, it must be today or, at the latest, tomorrow, but this will finally happen,"" Mandetta said. ""Our focus is on the virus, and we will be very careful to support whoever comes here, we will not make any sudden movements.""
The Health Ministry's response to the epidemic was rated ""good"" or ""great"" by 76% of Brazilians surveyed by pollster Datafolha this month. Just 33% of those surveyed gave Bolsonaro the same ratings.

Brazil's death toll from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, climbed to 1,924 on Thursday, as confirmed cases rose to 30,425, Health Ministry data showed.

The donation announced by U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman follows years of aid cuts by President Donald Trump's administration to the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. 
""I'm very pleased the USA is providing $5M for Palestinian hospitals and households to meet immediate, life-saving needs in combating COVID-19,"" Friedman wrote on Twitter. 
""The USA, as the world's top humanitarian aid donor, is committed to assisting the Palestinian people,"" he added.
The $5 million will be international disaster assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development, according to the State Department's website. 
There was no immediate comment from the Palestinians. 
The Trump administration since 2018 has cut hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to the Palestinians. The cuts have largely been seen as a bid to pressure them back to the negotiating table in peace talks with Israel.
The Palestinians have boycotted Trump's peace efforts since 2017, accusing him of pro-Israel bias after he declared Jerusalem Israel's capital and later moved the American embassy there from Tel Aviv. 
Trump released his Middle East plan in January. Israel embraced it, while the Palestinians rejected it out of hand, in part because it endorsed Israel keeping its settlements in West Bank territory it captured a 1967 war.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of children could die this year due to the global economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic and tens of millions more could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the crisis, the United Nations warned on Thursday. 
The world body also said in a risk report that nearly 369 million children across 143 countries who normally rely on school meals for a reliable source of daily nutrition have now been forced to look elsewhere.
""We must act now on each of these threats to our children,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. ""Leaders must do everything in their power to cushion the impact of the pandemic. What started as a public health emergency has snowballed into a formidable test for the global promise to leave no one behind.""
The new coronavirus, which causes the respiratory illness COVID-19, first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. So far it has infected more than 2 million people - killing some 138,000 - in 213 countries and territories, according to a Reuters tally.
Compared with adults, children infected with the coronavirus are less likely to have symptoms and more likely to have a mild illness, U.S. and Chinese studies have found. 
But the U.N. report warned that ""economic hardship experienced by families as a result of the global economic downturn could result in an hundreds of thousands of additional child deaths in 2020, reversing the last 2 to 3 years of progress in reducing infant mortality within a single year.""
With businesses shut down and more than a billion people told to stay home to avoid spreading the virus, the International Monetary Fund has predicted the world would this year suffer its steepest downturn since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The United Nations said an estimated 42 million to 66 million children could fall into extreme poverty as a result of the coronavirus crisis this year, adding to the estimated 386 million children already in extreme poverty in 2019.
The U.N. report on children also said 188 countries have imposed countrywide school closures, affecting more than 1.5 billion children.

""The potential losses that may accrue in learning for today's young generation, and for the development of their human capital, are hard to fathom,"" it said. ""More than two-thirds of countries have introduced a national distance learning platform, but among low-income countries the share is only 30 percent.""

Emergency workers managed several days ago to contain an initial bout of fires that tore through forests around the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986. Ukrainian authorities have played down any radiation risk.
The state emergency service said three new fires had broken out but were ""not large-scale and not threatening"".
""The radioactive background in Kiev and the Kiev region is within normal limits,"" Volodymyr Demchuk, director of the Emergency Response Department, said in a video statement. 
He said more than 1,000 people were involved in trying to extinguish the fires. 
Emergency workers used planes and helicopters to put out the earlier blaze this week but heavy winds prevented them from doing so on Thursday, Deputy Interior Minister Anton Gerashchenko was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying. 
The April 26, 1986 Chernobyl disaster in then-Soviet Ukraine was triggered by a botched safety test in a reactor and sent clouds of nuclear material across much of Europe.
The plant and the abandoned nearby town of Pripyat have become a tourist draw, especially since a critically acclaimed U.S. television miniseries about the accident aired last year.
The Chernobyl site is currently shut as part of a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus pandemic.

""G7 leaders agreed to remain committed to taking every necessary measure to ensure a strong and coordinated global response to this health crisis and the associated humanitarian and economic calamity and to launch a strong and sustainable recovery,"" the White House said in a statement after a video conference call between the leaders.
""The leaders recognized that the G7 nations annually contribute more than a billion dollars to the World Health Organization (WHO), and much of the conversation centered on the lack of transparency and chronic mismanagement of the pandemic by the WHO. The leaders called for a thorough review and reform process,"" it said.
President Donald Trump announced earlier this week that the United States would suspend its funding to the WHO while it conducted a review of its handling of the pandemic. 
The decision prompted condemnation from world leaders.

Trump has sought to blame the WHO for mismanaging the crisis and not doing more to press China for transparency when the virus first took hold. The president has faced criticism for playing down the severity of the virus himself in its early stages. He has also been complimentary of Chinese President Xi Jinping's handling of the issue.

STIRING-WENDEL, France (Reuters) - The COVID-19 outbreak forced Shirley Lind to close the hairdressing salon she runs in a French town near the German border. She has instead been volunteering as a porter at her local hospital.
""I could not stand staying at home, doing nothing, going round in circles counting the losses,"" she said in her empty salon.
Lind is one of the millions of small business owners across Europe forced to pull down the shutters to comply with government movement restrictions because they do not fall into the category of essential services.
Stiring-Wendel, a former mining town of 11,000 people, offers a snapshot of the tough reality these businesses face.
Each morning in the town there is a flurry of activity as shoppers head to the pharmacy and the  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) supermarket to get essential supplies, but after 11 am (0900 GMT), its centre empties.
Lind, like other entrepreneurs who were deemed non-essential, put her two employees on furlough, the bulk of their salary is to be paid by the state. 
But with no money coming in, she worries about how she will pay bills on her salon and her mortgage. ""I'm crossing my fingers we can get through this,"" she said.
A short walk from her salon, past the church of Saint Francois, is the shop were Pierre Etienne Gry would normally be fitting hearing aids. 
The shop is closed but he does see people by appointment to repair broken hearing aids. He worries for his mostly elderly clients, the group hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
Directly across the street is Gregory Klein's optician. His business is at a complete halt and his six staff on furlough. 
Even though President Emmanuel Macron has said rent and utility bills owed by small companies will be suspended to help them stay afloat, Klein still has bills to pay and repayments to make on the loan he took out to buy the business.
""These things make me really question the future of my shop,"" he said, standing in front of a display of glasses in the empty business.
A four-minute walk west, along Cemetery Alley, is Nathalie Zitter's florist shop. When France's lockdown began, she had just invested in new stock for the spring gardening season, and the Easter holiday. Most of that, she said, had to be thrown away. 
Her shop stands across the street from the town cemetery, and she has watched, helpless, as burials were conducted without flowers or wreaths. 

""It's always better when there are flowers because that eases the pain a little bit,"" she said.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's border restrictions with the United States will remain in place ""for a significant time"" as the two nations fight the coronavirus outbreak, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday.
Washington and Ottawa agreed last month to clamp down on non-essential travel while allowing massive trade flows to continue across their long shared frontier.
""There's a recognition that as we move forward there will be special thought given to this relationship. But at the same time we know that there is a significant amount of time, still, before we can talk about loosening such restrictions,"" Trudeau told a daily briefing.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday told reporters the two nations were ""doing well"" and said, ""It will be one of the early borders to be released.""
The two nations' economies are highly integrated, and allowing trade to continue avoided major problems for the auto sector as well as the transportation of food and medicines.
Although Trudeau's government has enjoyed good relations with the Trump administration over the last 18 months, tensions still remain. Last month, Ottawa slammed a U.S. proposal to deploy troops along the border to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus, prompting Washington to drop the plan.
A total of 1,048 people in Canada had died from the coronavirus by 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), slightly less than 10% higher than the death toll a day ago, official data posted by the public health agency showed.
The total number of those diagnosed with the coronavirus had climbed to 28,899. The respective figures at the same time on Wednesday were 954 deaths and 27,540 positive diagnoses.
Medical officials now expect the death toll to be between 1,200 and 1,620 by April 21, Theresa Tam, the chief public health officer, told a briefing. 
She repeated comments she made on Wednesday about being cautiously optimistic the outbreak could be slowing down.
The Canadian government has already announced more than C$110 billion in direct spending on measures to help people and businesses deal with the economic damage from the outbreak.
Trudeau said Ottawa would expand loans to firms that paid between C$20,000 and C$1.5 million in total payroll in 2019, and also planned to help commercial property owners cut or even forgive rent to small businesses.

The Pacific province of British Columbia said it would reduce property taxes by 25% and allow municipalities greater flexibility in taking on debt.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths said on Thursday he expects the warring parties to formally adopt ""in the immediate future"" agreements on a nationwide ceasefire, key economic and humanitarian measures and a resumption of political talks.
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital Sanaa in late 2014. A Saudi-led military coalition in 2015 intervened in a bid to restore the government.
Griffiths told the U.N. Security Council he has been negotiating with the parties on the texts of his proposals for the past two weeks. ""We expect them to agree on and formally adopt these agreements in the immediate future,"" he said. 
He said the economic and humanitarian measures could include: release of prisoners and detainees, opening Sanaa airport, paying civil servant salaries, opening access roads, and ensuring entry at Hudeidah ports for ships carrying commodities that will help in the fight against COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus. 
""The conversations we had with the two parties, and our consultations with the Saudi-led Coalition among other international actors ... are continuous, detailed and constructive,"" Griffith said. 
He said ""good progress"" was being made and the United Nations was redoubling its efforts to bridge outstanding differences ""before we convene them at a meeting where ... these agreements will be tabled, confirmed - I hope - and published."" 
Griffith's latest push for peace for Yemen was sparked by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres's call last month for a global ceasefire so the world can focus on fighting the coronavirus pandemic. 
So far only one case of COVID-19 has been confirmed in Yemen, where around 80% of the population, or 24 million people, require humanitarian aid. 
But aid groups fear that could be a harbinger of a catastrophic outbreak given Yemen's shattered health system and widespread hunger and disease after five years of war in which more than 100,000 have been killed.
""Epidemiologists warn that COVID-19 in Yemen could spread faster, more widely and with deadlier consequences than in many other countries,"" U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the Security Council on Thursday.
He also warned that the world's largest aid operation needed money and that three-quarters of the United Nations 41 major programs ""will start closing down in the next few weeks if we can't secure additional funds."" 

""This means we will have to start eliminating many of the activities that may offer Yemenis' the best chance to avoid COVID-19,"" Lowcock said.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - In an air-conditioned government building in Mumbai, a dozen officials are glued to a giant screen showing live drone and CCTV footage of crowded slums, the frontline in the city's battle to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
When cameras captured dozens of shoppers thronging a market in Mumbai's low-income Dongri area last week, violating the countrywide lockdown begun on March 25, officials called in the police to disperse the crowd.
Twenty minutes later, the footage from Dongri showed only a handful of people still milling around.
To help enforce a lockdown in what is one of the most densely populated areas on earth, authorities are using drones, re-oriented traffic cameras, and heat maps, but these can fall short when it comes to maze-like slum alleys. 
""Hundreds will fall through the cracks, thousands. But as long as it is not in millions we are safe,"" Praveen Pardeshi, who heads the city's main civic body, told Reuters in an interview. 
Mumbai is home to around 12 million people, of which some 65% live in slums. A further six million people are estimated to live in peripheral districts.
Confirmed cases in the city have ticked up above 1,900, including 113 deaths, making up around 15% of India's more than 12,000 known cases.
Mumbai's Dharavi, often considered Asia's biggest slum with an estimated 1 million residents, has reported 71 cases and experts fear the number could climb quickly.
Authorities stress that part of Mumbai's high rates stem from more aggressive testing. The city has conducted 2,374 tests per million, versus 448 per million in capital New Delhi, according to a Mumbai government report reviewed by Reuters on Thursday. 
Around 82% of coronavirus patients in Mumbai are stable, with just 2% requiring critical care, the data shows. 
""If this percentage remains of stable cases, then we are through,"" said Pardeshi. 
Authorities have cordoned off parts of the slums, set up special fever clinics and created massive quarantine centres in a stadium and empty government buildings.
But the restrictions are hard to observe when living at such close quarter. On a recent afternoon in a narrow passage encumbered by goats and electrical wire, police officers pleaded with a dozen Dharavi residents to go home.
Asif Siddiqui, a construction shop worker who lives in a one-room apartment with six family members, stayed put.

""They ask us to keep one meter distance, but my home is two meters long. We are trying to co-operate, but it is impossible to stay home in a place like this,"" said Siddiqui.

1516,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 11:36AM ET</span>",Bangladesh coast guard rescues 396 Rohingya from drifting boat; 32 dead,"By Ruma Paul
DHAKA (Reuters) - At least 32 ethnic Rohingya died on a ship that drifted for weeks after it failed to reach Malaysia, Bangladesh coast guard officials said on Thursday, following the rescue of 396 starving survivors.
A human rights group said it believed more boats carrying Rohingya - a Muslim minority - were adrift at sea, with coronavirus lockdowns in Malaysia and Thailand making it harder for them to find refuge.
""They were at sea for about two months and were starving,"" a Bangladesh coastguard official told Reuters in a message, adding that the ship was brought to shore late on Wednesday.
The 396 survivors would be handed to the U.N refugee agency, said the official, who had initially said they would be sent to Myanmar. The official also revised the death toll to 32 from 24.
Video images showed a crowd comprised mostly of women and children, some stick-thin and unable to stand, being helped to shore. One emaciated man lay on the sand.
One refugee told a reporter the group had been turned back from Malaysia twice and a fight had broken out onboard between passengers and crew at one point.
Malaysian officials did not respond to requests for comment on reports that it had turned away previous boats from its waters.
​""We understand these men, women and children were at sea for nearly two months in harrowing conditions and that many of them are extremely malnourished and dehydrated,"" the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said. 
The agency was offering to help the government move them to quarantine facilities and would provide medical care, it said in a statement.
Media reports that the group was infected with the virus had not been substantiated, the UNHCR said.
In a separate case, Malaysia's navy on Thursday morning intercepted a boat carrying some 200 Rohingya refugees attempting to enter Malaysian waters.
The boat, which was spotted by an air force surveillance plane, was escorted out of Malaysian waters by two navy ships after being provided with food supplies, the air force said in a statement.
Buddhist-majority Myanmar does not recognise Rohingya as citizens and they face severe curbs on freedom of movement as well as access to healthcare and education.
Myanmar denies persecuting Rohingya and says they are not an indigenous ethnic group but immigrants from South Asia, even though many Rohingya are able to trace their ancestry back centuries.
More than a million live in refugee camps in southern Bangladesh, the majority having been driven from homes in Myanmar after a 2017 military crackdown the army said was a response to attacks by Rohingya insurgents.
Rights groups fear virus curbs across Southeast Asia could trigger a repeat of a 2015 crisis, when a crackdown by Thailand prompted smugglers to abandon their human cargo at sea on crowded, rickety boats.
Chris Lewa, director of the Arakan Project, said she believed several more boats were stranded.
""Rohingya may encounter closed borders supported by a xenophobic public narrative,"" she said in a message.
""COVID-19 cannot be used to deny access to territory to desperate refugees in distress. Another maritime crisis in the Andaman Sea, as in 2015, is unacceptable."" 
For years, Rohingya from Myanmar have boarded boats organised by smugglers in the hope of finding refuge in Southeast Asia, usually making voyages during the dry season from November to March, when the waters are calm.
Several boats were trying to reach Malaysian shores and monitoring had been stepped up, a police official in the northwestern state of Kedah told Reuters. 
A police official in southern Thailand said five boats carrying Rohingya had been spotted off the coast of Satun province late on Monday. 
People were smuggled out by boat and over land, said Kyaw Hla, a Rohingya from Sittwe in Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, where tens of thousands of Rohingya have been confined in camps since a bout of violence in 2012. 
""Within these eight years, there has been no progress, only degradation,"" he said by telephone. ""People can’t stand it. Since we are locked up and suffocated, people try to leave, of course.""
He added, ""If the coronavirus breaks out here, we’ll be as good as dead.""

1518,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 10:30AM ET</span>",Explainer: Who's WHO? The World Health Organization under scrutiny,"By Kate Kelland
LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) is in the spotlight as it champions the global fight against the new coronavirus but faces a funding freeze from U.S. President Donald Trump's government. 
Here are main features of the WHO and its work:
* What is it?
The WHO is an agency of the United Nations set up in 1948 to improve health globally. It has more than 7,000 people working in 150 country offices, six regional offices and its Geneva headquarters. 
Its director general - currently the Ethiopian Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus - is elected for a five-year term. Tedros' five-year term began on July 1, 2017.
* What does it do?
The WHO's stated aim is ""to promote health, keep the world safe and serve the vulnerable"". 
It has no power to impose health policies on national governments, but acts as an adviser and offers guidance on best practice in disease prevention and health improvement.
It has three main strands of work:
- aiming for universal health coverage in every country
- preventing and responding to acute emergencies
- promoting health and wellbeing for all
* What doesn't it do?
Like a lot of international institutions, the WHO suffers from false perceptions about its scope and resources.
The WHO is not ""the world's doctor"": it does not provide treatment or conduct disease surveillance - although it does advise national and international authorities on those matters.
It has no powers of sanction, and the information it collates and publishes is only as good as the data and expertise it gets from member states and its technical specialists.
* Is every country part of it?
The WHO has 194 member states: every country except Liechtenstein which is a member of the United Nations but not of its global health agency. They appoint representatives to The World Health Assembly, which convenes annually and sets WHO policies. These policies are implemented by the WHO's Executive Board, composed of members technically qualified in health. 
* Who pays for it?
The WHO's member states provide funding via two routes: assessed contributions and voluntary contributions. The WHO's budgets are biennial, spanning two years. Its 2020-2021 budget is almost $4.85 billion, up 9% from the previous two-year period.
Assessed contributions are calculated on the basis of a country's wealth and population, while voluntary contributions are often targeted by the donor at specific regions or diseases - such as polio, malaria, or infant mortality in poor areas.
Philanthropic foundations and multinational groups such as the European Commission are also major donors to the WHO.
The United States is the biggest overall donor and had contributed more than $800 million by the end of 2019 for the 2018-2019 biennial funding period. The Gates Foundation is the second largest donor, followed by Britain.
* What are seen as its major successes and failures?
The WHO is widely credited with leading a 10-year campaign to eradicate smallpox in the 1970s and has also led global efforts to end polio, a battle that is in its final stages.
In the past few years, the WHO has also coordinated battles against viral epidemics of Ebola in Congo and Zika in Brazil.
In the current COVID-19 disease outbreak, while many have praised the WHO's leadership, Trump has accused it of being China-centric and giving bad advice about the emerging pandemic. 
This week, Trump said the WHO had ""failed in its basic duty"" and announced a temporary halt to U.S. funding - a move that prompted condemnation from many world leaders. 

In the past, the WHO was accused of overreacting to the 2009-10 H1N1 flu pandemic and also faced widespread criticism for not reacting quickly enough to the vast Ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014 that killed more than 11,000 people.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - A series of video diaries based on the writings of Jewish teenager Anne Frank during her years hiding from the Nazis during World War Two have become a hit with young viewers, the Anne Frank House Museum said on Thursday.
The museum, which made the vlogs to commemorate 75 years since the end of the war in the Netherlands next month, said the 5- to 10-minute clips had been viewed more than 1.5 million times on YouTube.
Anne, who died of typhoid in the Bergen Belsen concentration camp in 1945 aged 15, is played by actress Luna Cruz Perez, who bears a striking resemblance to the teenager.
She talks to the camera about life, teenage insecurities and experiences based on excerpts from letters and diary entries.
""We go into hiding tomorrow, and I'm just scared,"" she tells the camera with tears in her eyes.
In the first episode, Anne shows her family and friends, and explains how life has changed since Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands and the family was forced into an attic annex in a house along one of Amsterdam's canals. 
Viewers experiencing lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic can more easily imagine what it must have been like to be forced to stay inside for long periods, Annemarie Bekker of the Anne Frank House said, describing its appeal to a new generation.
It ""will give you a better understanding of certain extracts from her diary,"" Bekker said. 
""This makes me think of the corona crisis. I also can't wait to see my friends, go outside and travel,"" Dutch viewer Alisa Charlier commented.
At the same time the context and background of Anne's story are very different: ""Anne Frank had to go into hiding for the sole reason that she was Jewish; her persecution, life in hiding, and eventual death were the result of deliberate human actions,"" Bekker said.
Anne and her family were discovered in 1944 after roughly two years in hiding. 

The diary, which has sold millions of copies in dozens of languages, was published two years later. The Anne Frank House Museum has been closed to visitors during the coronavirus crisis.

1520,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 10:15AM ET</span>",Nigerian security forces killed 18 people during lockdowns: rights panel,"ABUJA (Reuters) - Nigerian security forces killed 18 people in two weeks while enforcing lockdowns imposed to halt the spread of the new coronavirus, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) said.
Nigeria, sub-Saharan Africa's most populous country and biggest energy producer, has recorded 407 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 12 deaths from the highly contagious lung disease.
Lockdowns initially slated to last 14 days were put in place on March 30 in the southern commercial hub Lagos, neighbouring Ogun state and the capital Abuja. They were extended on Sunday by two weeks and other states, such as the northern economic hub Kano, have also imposed restrictions.
The NHRC, an independent body, said in a statement dated April 15 that there had been ""eight documented incidents of extrajudicial killings leading to 18 deaths"" between March 30 and April 13.
It said the killings were carried out by the Nigerian Correctional Service, the police force and army.
In response, a spokesman for the Nigerian Correctional Service said four inmates had died after violence broke out and left a number of prisoners and staff hospitalised. The rights commission report alleged eight deaths. 
The Nigeria Police Force and the Nigerian Army did not respond to phone calls seeking comment on the NHRC statement.
The statement said ""law enforcement agents extrajudicially executed 18 persons in the cause of the enforcement regulations"" related to lockdown measures.
""The report notes that most of the violations witnessed during the period arose as a result of excessive or disproportionate use of force, abuse of power, corruption and non-adherence to national and international laws, best practices and rules of engagement,"" the NHRC statement said.
The NHRC said it had received 105 complaints of alleged human rights violations in the first two weeks of the lockdown.
Nigerian police and the military have repeatedly been accused by rights advocates of using excessive force, but have consistently denied any wrongdoing. 
Last year the United Nations special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings also accused Nigerian security forces of using excessive lethal force. The police and military did not respond to those accusations.

The House of Commons Commission, which includes the Speaker, government and opposition representatives, agreed up to 120 lawmakers at any one time could take part in parliamentary proceedings via Zoom, while around 50 could remain in the chamber under social distancing guidelines.
The measures, which need the approval of lawmakers when they return on April 21, could see a pause on often rowdy sessions in parliament, where even the architecture of seating government and opposition parties opposite each other encourages confrontation.
""By initiating a hybrid solution, with steps towards an entirely virtual parliament, we are enabling members to stay close to their communities while continuing their important work scrutinising the government,"" said speaker Lindsay Hoyle, who chairs the Commission.
The government asked parliament to start its Easter break a week early last month, suspending sitting for at least four weeks as fears grew that politicians and staff were being put at risk from the spread of COVID-19 by continuing to work there. 
Several lawmakers and ministers have since either tested positive for the virus or self-isolated with symptoms, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson who is now recuperating at his country residence.
But opposition parties have called for parliament to return as soon as possible so that they can question ministers over the government's handling of the outbreak, which has killed more than 12,000 people in hospital.
If the ""hybrid parliament"" measures are approved, some lawmakers will be able to take part in Wednesday's Prime Minister's Questions, ask urgent questions and make points by videolink in the first two hours of each day.
Screens will be placed around the chamber to allow the Speaker and lawmakers in the chamber to see their ""virtual"" colleagues, who are expected not to display or draw attention to objects to illustrate the points they are making.
For those who have technical difficulties, the Commission said: ""It should be possible for them to be called later in the proceedings.""

If deemed successful, the House of Commons will consider extending the model to other debates.

PRETORIA/CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - South Africa, like many nations, has long viewed homelessness as an inevitable fact of modern life, but the coronavirus epidemic is offering an unexpected chance to give those on the streets a roof over their heads.
Thousands are being housed in sports stadiums, schools and other locked-down public spaces, partly to try to stop them contracting or spreading COVID-19, and the government says it wants to ensure they don't slip back though the cracks once the outbreak ends.
Yet not everyone thinks they will do better in the shelters the state has provided, with some saying what they are being offered is scarcely better than sleeping rough and others concerned the makeshift accommodation could become breeding grounds for infection.
Tsepang Motsepe, however, saw an opportunity to kick the heroin habit that made him homeless a decade ago.
The 31-year-old abandoned his law studies when his sponsor failed to pay the university bill, and then swiftly found that heroin ""stabilises your emotions.""
To feed his addiction, he was breaking into parked cars and sometimes robbing them. For food, ""the dustbins were there,"" he told Reuters outside a set of communal tents at the Lyttelton sports ground on the edge of the capital, Pretoria.
Many of his friends died of overdoses, HIV, or tuberculosis (TB), but Motsepe is now on state-provided methadone, a common heroin substitute. ""I see there are aspects of my life I need to change. I want to go back to my studies,"" he said.
He is one of around 15,000 people the social development ministry is housing in Gauteng, which covers both Pretoria and Johannesburg. Up to 2,000 others are in shelters in Cape Town. 
All had been screened for the coronavirus, authorities said, and Thabiso Hlongwane, ministry spokesman in Gauteng, said the province was rolling out testing. Meanwhile, beds in shelters were being kept one metre (three feet) apart and hundreds of bottles of hand sanitiser had been provided.
Jo Barnes, an epidemiologist Stellenbosch University, warned that, if it took hold, the coronavirus would ""spread like wildfire"" through any facilities that were not well managed.
'WE WANT TO GO HOME'
Hlongwane said the aim was to keep the homeless off the streets once the epidemic ended.
""Beyond lockdown, the programme will continue. Social workers are on board ... to reunite them with their families,"" he said.
Some may leave the programme well before then.
At Strandfontein sports ground in Cape Town, where huge, white tarpaulin marquee tents house around 1,500, some complained last week of cramped conditions and inadequate food.
Reuters saw police officers break up a protest as some inside tried to uproot the metal fencing, shouting - somewhat ironically - ""We want to go home!"". 
""If I have a chance I will run away from this place,"" said Marco Brown, 35, one of the people at the camp who used to bivouac under a bridge, adding he had received nothing to eat by 3 p.m.
Cape Town council said that, after some ""initial challenges"", services at Strandfontein were improving by the day.
Some homeless in the city want nothing to do with the shelters. 

""There are too many people inside. It's gonna be easy to get sick (there),"" Joseph, sleeping rough in the city park, told Reuters TV.

Albania has taken a hi-tech approach to monitoring a coronavirus lockdown in place since March 15, co-opting drones that were previously used to detect cannabis fields and speeding cars.
""Technology is helping us greatly in identifying persons who violate the quarantine. It has had great results,"" said policewoman Katerina Monguli, 23, who operates one of about 20 of the eyes in the sky being deployed in the capital.
Earlier in the day via its loudspeaker, her drone instructed people queuing outside a bank to stand further apart, and told a pedestrian to wait for a police patrol to check his status.
All residents, barring exempt categories such as truck drivers, are entitled to daily 90-minute windows for visiting shops, banks and pharmacies, and must apply for them on line. The period they chose is monitored via a government database.
""When we need groceries and other basic needs... it is very limited time but having in mind the difficult situation we all have to do our part,"" said Taulant Nukaj, 31, a marketing manager who has been working from home for over a month.
So far, the impact of the virus in Albania has been comparatively mild, with 518 confirmed cases and 26 deaths, and only a small minority of its 2.8 million population have been caught breaking the rules. 
Police have suspended around 1,800 driving licences and fined some 7,000 people 10,000 leke ($87) each for missing their time-slots, a police spokesman said.
The 900-gramme (2 lb) drones also help enforce Albania's 5:30 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. curfew.
""(It) can film persons even at night with its thermal camera, and it also has night lights,"" Monguli told Reuters TV.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Delivery services have become one of the few employment opportunities for Venezuelans living under a coronavirus quarantine in a country already struggling with a recession, hyperinflation and fuel shortages.
From merchants who once sold goods in shops to former taxi drivers who no longer have passengers, citizens desperate to put food on their tables are now delivering everything from meat and vegetables, to dog food and home decoration items. 
And unlike people in most other countries, Venezuelans making deliveries have to struggle with acute gasoline shortages that can require hours in line and, in some cases, have led workers to shun motorcycles and cars in favor of bicycles. 
""I was left without a job because of the quarantine,"" said Jesus Villamizar, 43, a motorcycle taxi driver who on Tuesday began making deliveries for a department store that also supplies food products. ""I have to find food for the home.""
Villamizar, a father of three, says he needs to make around 1 million bolivars ($7.50) per day to provide for his family in a country with annual inflation of 3,365%.
Venezuelan commerce association Consecomercio, which represents about 15,000 businesses, says it does not have an estimate of how many businesses have started using deliveries to replace in-person sales lost to quarantine. 
Consecomercio president Felipe Capozzolo said in an interview that such services are available only to ""two or three percent of the population,"" because products delivered to the home tend to be much more expensive than what the average consumer can afford.
In the northern city Valencia, Jose Luis Ortiz began doing shopping for friends and delivering the products to their homes to make up for lost income after his electronics equipment store was shut due to the quarantine. 
""I had to invent something to survive,"" said Ortiz, 37. 
Sergio Dos Santos, owner of a hamburger and hot dog shop in the southeastern state of Bolivar, said home deliveries had saved his business from going under even though few had used the service before the quarantine.
""We are living off delivery,"" said Dos Santos, 45, whose drivers charge two to five dollars for each dropoff.
Reinaldo Rodriguez, owner of a pizzeria and ice cream parlor in the town of San Felipe who also cycles as a hobby, has begun delivering food and medicine with 12 fellow cyclists - a service he markets over Instagram.

""People who think a businessman like myself can go for a long time without producing have never put themselves in my shoes,"" said Rodriguez, 34, who has four children 37 employees whose salaries he continues to pay. ""Venezuelan merchants only make it by selling every day.""

The cocaine, wrapped in 15 packages, was found in boxes full of face masks when a Polish-registered van bound for Britain was searched, the interior ministry said. A 34-year-old Polish man was arrested.
""This seizure is further evidence of the way criminal networks are attempting to exploit the coronavirus outbreak to their own ends,"" said Darren Herbert, the National Crime Agency's operations manager for the port of Dover.
""We are now investigating who was behind this attempt, but what is clear is that they have taken a substantial hit. At UK street prices, this haul might have raised more than 1 million pounds once adulterated and cut down – profit that they have now been denied.""
Ian Hanson, Border Force regional director at Coquelles, France, said such a seizure showed the lengths to which smugglers were willing to go.
Europe's cocaine market is worth more than $10 billion.
Global cocaine production rose to 1,976 tonnes of 100 percent pure in 2017 - the largest ever reported, according to the latest United Nations drug data. Production, mostly in Latin America, has risen 50 percent in the past decade.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Safari operator Pankaj Shah would normally be showing tourists around the beauty spots of his native Kenya. Instead, he is spearheading a volunteer effort to feed thousands of families left penniless when the new coronavirus devastated the economy. 
""One old woman told us she hadn't eaten for days - her sons had stopped supplying her because they have no work,"" he said, walking down a line of young men packing rice, flour, beans and long-life milk into boxes. 
Kenya reported its first case of the coronavirus on March 12. Schools closed the following week. Businesses shut, families left the capital and the casual work sustaining the vast majority of urban Kenyans dried up. 
The government offered tax breaks - little help to those too poor to pay taxes. Newspapers called for ""total lockdown"" and forgotten families in the slums began to starve and to seethe. 
""People were getting hungry and angry,"" Shah said. 
Someone had to act, he decided, and he asked a couple of friends to pitch in. A local school, shuttered by the virus, offered their premises as headquarters.
Kenya's Asian community - officially recognised three years ago as the nation's 44th tribe - rallied round. They brought cheques or truckloads of food or vegetables planted for export and now marooned by the lack of flights. The operation has been going daily for three weeks. 
Shah's volunteers, who call themselves Team Pankaj, have sent out 24,000 hampers since setting up on March 22, each with enough food to last a family of five for two weeks. 
He is asking wealthy Kenyans to donate 4,000 Kenya shillings each ($40) to fund the hampers - about the cost of two pizzas and a bottle of wine, he points out.
""I just need half the rich people here to care enough to fund a hamper,"" he says impatiently. 
His phone buzzes with community leaders, imams, church leaders and chiefs asking for help. Shah tests potential partners with a small distribution - say 100 boxes - and scales up if they handle it well.
Last week he sent two lorryloads of food to a distribution in the Deep Sea slum, where residents presented orange tokens and had their fingers inked before carting away the boxes and bags of vegetables. Volunteers helped pregnant women and those with babies.
Mary Wangui, 29, said she had been desperate. ""You can't hug a child to sleep when they are hungry,"" she said. 
Although Shah has never run any kind of aid operation before, he has a guiding spirit: Mother Teresa, whom he said he met more than three decades ago in Nairobi. 
A wheel spun off the Roman Catholic nun's ancient pickup truck and hit his new Mercedes, he said.
The accident brought an unlikely friendship between a ""young, wild"" businessman and the world famous missionary who cared for the poor, he said. He volunteered with her for three months, he said, and adopted a baby girl from one of her orphanages. 

""I think about what she would do,"" he says, after the coronavirus hit. ""That's the inspiration for the rest of my life.""

ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece is preparing for a muted Orthodox Easter this year after the authorities strictly forbade the traditional spirited celebrations of mass church attendance, firecrackers and large family gatherings.
Greece introduced a lockdown to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus four weeks ago, and so far the restrictions appear to have been effective. As of Thursday, officials reported 2,192 cases and 102 deaths, one of the lowest rates in Europe.
But compliance will be tested during the Easter celebrations in coming days, when hundreds of thousands of Greeks traditionally flock to churches and to their ancestral homes to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
""In the years that I have been alive I have never seen anything like it. We have been through wars - Churches were always open,"" said Bishop Ierotheos, spokesman of the Church, which has said it supports the measures. 
The authorities have imposed additional restrictions on gatherings and transit for the Easter period, which this year is from April 17-19. Extra controls will be in place at toll posts and ports, and only those with a permanent residency in the area will be allowed to travel to prevent trips to visit relatives or second homes in the countryside.
""This virus doesn't distinguish days, whether it's a celebration or not,"" said Nikos Hardalias, deputy civil protection minister.
CHURCHES SILENT
The Good Friday open-air procession behind the Epitaph, the symbolic body of Christ, will be held within Churches, and with no worshippers. Midnight mass on Saturday, where thousands normally gather to hear the liturgy of resurrection, will be behind closed doors.
""Church is not just a place....It's not just the walls and a roof, but a way of life,"" Bishop Ierotheos told Reuters.
""There is another way to meet God.""
Easter Sunday is normally a raucous affair with people up at the crack of dawn to prepare the barbecue for the sacrificial lamb, big neighbourhood parties with fireckrackers, and the occasional use of a shotgun to fire 'demons' out of the sky.
But even at home, parties must be kept indoors this year.
""Any celebrations must be confined to our homes. Any attempt at friendly gatherings, either on a rooftop, or gardens, could potentially be a new source of the virus,"" Hardalias said.
WHO'S UNRULY NOW?
Greeks have taken the lockdown and the extra measures in their stride. 
""It's one of the few times we have understood authority is doing something for the public good, and not against it,"" Professor Christos Kechagias, who teaches philosophy and epistemology at the University of Athens. 
""It's self preservation,"" he said. ""It's also important that a low-key scientist was picked to lead this crisis.""
Sotiris Tsiodras, the government's chief scientific advisor on the pandemic has been giving televised briefings every day at 1800 local time.

In an opinion poll reported by Greece's Alpha TV on Thursday, Greeks chose the unassuming, greying Harvard-educated 54-year old, a father of seven, as the most popular person in Greece.

Despite being locked out of the World Health Organization (WHO) due to the objections of China, which considers the island merely a Chinese province, Taiwan has been keen to demonstrate it is a responsible member of the international community. 
Taiwan is in the process of donating 16 million masks to countries hardest hit by the virus, including the United States and Europe, under the slogan ""Taiwan can help and Taiwan is helping"".
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Thursday the two million masks for Japan would go to front line medical workers.
""Taiwan and Japan share values and are close partners and important friends at all levels,"" it said.
Taiwan hopes to further strengthen cooperation with Japan, including in the research and development of vaccines and exchanges between medical experts, the ministry added.
Japan, like most countries, has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but the two have close unofficial relations. Japan ruled Taiwan between 1895 and 1945.
Japan has seen an accelerating infection rate in recent weeks, particularly in Tokyo. The government has responded by declaring an emergency in Tokyo and six other areas including Osaka, and a goal to cut interactions between people by 70 percent.

Japan, which tests only people with symptoms of the coronavirus, has so far recorded nearly 200 deaths and more than 9,000 infections, including passengers who caught the virus on a cruise ship.

GUANGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Huddled under a highway bridge with a small bag of belongings, a 19-year old student from Ivory Coast was desperately dialling his few contacts in China.
The student said he arrived in the southern city of Guangzhou last week, after completing his quarantine in another city, during a coronavirus clampdown that several African countries and Africans in Guangzhou say has unfairly targeted them.
""I really need help. I just don't want to sleep on the streets again,"" he said on Monday, asking not to be identified by name. 
He came to China to study the language but his university shut because of the coronavirus. Hotels kept turning him away, but later on Monday he said he had found one.
Several African ambassadors wrote to China's foreign minister last week, calling for the ""cessation of forceful testing, quarantine and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans"".
Ghana's foreign minister on Saturday called in China's ambassador to convey the government's concern.
China's foreign ministry said on Monday all foreigners are treated equally. But it also said virus controls on Africans would be lifted, apart from confirmed cases and those who have had close contact with them.
""African friends will be treated fairly, justly and amicably in China,"" the ministry said.
Many foreigners in China say they have faced suspicion as the country brought its own outbreak under control, only to see new cases brought from other countries. China has barred entry to most foreigners, and the vast majority of imported cases of the disease have come from Chinese nationals returning home.
In Guangzhou, a hub for African traders, authorities said on Tuesday that 111 Africans had tested positive for the coronavirus, while a total of 4,553 Africans had undergone testing since April 4, state media reported.
Several African residents said the black community was being unfairly targeted for stricter checks.
""If they do this to all foreigners, then it's not a problem, but it's only black people,"" Soumana Toudou, a garment trader from Niger, told Reuters by WhatsApp. He said he was undergoing his second 14-day quarantine because the authorities did not believe he had completed his first.
Such decisions are made at the local level and Reuters could not independently confirm this.
The scrutiny from the authorities had triggered hostility from Chinese residents, one student said.
""The selective testing has set the Guangzhou locals into panic, thinking black people are carrying the virus,"" he said. He declined to be identified.
A Communist Party social worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Monday that black people were specifically being made to enter a period of quarantine.
Last week, authorities announced that two neighbourhoods popular with Africans would be locked down to curb the coronavirus after five Nigerians tested positive.
On Monday, the U.S. consulate general in Guangzhou advised African-Americans, or those who believe Chinese officials may suspect them of having contact with African nationals, to avoid the city.
The provincial foreign affairs office provided no immediate comment to Reuters about complaints from Africans and embassies that Africans had been unfairly targeted.
ENGAGEMENT
China has stepped up its engagement with Africa in recent years, with state-owned companies building infrastructure and signing hundreds of deals across the continent. 
Guangzhou was home to 13,652 Africans in 2019 and about 351,000 Africans entered the city from abroad last year, official figures show.
Videos on social media in recent days showed what appeared to be Africans sleeping on Guangzhou streets after being evicted from their apartments. Reuters could not independently verify the footage.
Property agents near Guangzhou's Sanyuanli trading hub said such evictions of foreigners, including Africans, had contributed to a glut of empty apartments.
""For a white person, you can't rent around here now because of the virus, but you'll be welcome again in a few months,"" said one agent, referring to when the pandemic passes. She declined to give her name.
""But black people, no one will accept them.""
A spokeswoman for McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) in China apologised on Tuesday after staff at a Guangzhou branch forced black customers to leave.
The fast-food chain had temporarily closed the outlet while staff completed ""diversity and inclusion"" training, spokeswoman Regina Hui said in a statement.
The Chinese authorities now seem to be taking a more conciliatory stance. On Tuesday, media showed hazmat-clad personnel delivering food and flowers to Africans in home quarantine.
The chairman of the African Union, Moussa Faki Mahamat, was receptive, saying on Twitter on Monday he had spoken to Foreign Minister Wang Yi.

""He reassured me of measures underway in Guangzhou to improve the situation of Africans, in line with the strong and brotherly partnership between Africa and China.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - A former North Korean diplomat has won a parliamentary seat in South Korea's swankiest district, four years after fleeing a London embassy and defecting to the South. 
Thae Yong Ho was Pyongyang's deputy ambassador to the United Kingdom where he had managed secret funds for leader Kim Jong Un until he fled to the democratic, wealthy South in 2016. 
Thae, 55, won one of three constituencies in Seoul's glittering Gangnam district for the main opposition conservative party in Wednesday's parliamentary election, beating a former four-term ruling party lawmaker by nearly a 20% margin. 
""I was dearly afraid if the Gangnam residents would take a guy from the North,"" a smiling Thae said in an acceptance speech shared on his YouTube channel, as crowds of voters gathered in his campaign office, chanting his name and cheering. 
""But so many people here gave me strength - they held my hand, welcomed me to Gangnam and promised to vote for me,"" he said in a hoarse voice after weeks-long rallies.
Gangnam, a wealthy, conservative district known for its boutiques, high-end bars and luxury homes, shot to international renown through musician Psy's 2012 K-pop hit ""Gangnam Style"".
Thae, who had worked in South Korea as a foreign policy expert before launching a bid for parliament in February, is the first North Korean refugee to become a lawmaker representing a constituency in South Korea. Cho Myung-chul, a former North Korean professor, served in parliament from 2012-16 on a party endorsement but without any constituency. 
The election drew unprecedented levels of participation from North Korean defectors challenging what they saw as the flawed cross-border policy of President Moon Jae-in.
Defector groups have complained that Moon's administration cut funding, ignored human rights and suppressed anti-Pyongyang activism in favour of pursuing reconciliation with the Kim regime. 
Ji Seong-ho, a defector invited to Washington in 2018 to attend U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union address, was also elected to the parliament as a proportionate representative. 
'NO ROOTS'
But Thae's political foray was far from easy, facing a backlash from some citizens and even his party's campaign chief, Kim Chong-in, who said Thae was not suitable to represent the district because he had ""no roots in the South"".
Kim later apologised and endorsed Thae. 
""His landslide victory means the people of Gangnam didn't really care that he's a defector. They seem to believe that he's more loyal to the South, not the North,"" said Lim Seong-ho, a professor of political science at Kyung Hee University in Seoul. 
Critics also raised questions about Thae's wealth when he listed more than 1.8 billion won ($1.5 million) in assets. 
Thae has said he made the money giving lectures and writing books and papers, and paid more than 100 million won ($81,000) in taxes every year. 
His two memoirs were big hits. The first of them, in which he described how Pyongyang covertly amassed foreign currency via diplomatic missions as well as the duplicity of its denuclearisation commitment, sold more than 200,000 copies in South Korea and was published in several languages.
North Korea's state media has criticised Thae's defection, calling him a ""human scum"" and criminal who had embezzled state funds and sexually assaulted a minor. 
Thae has flatly denied those claims and vowed to continue his political activities even after police stepped up security due to safety concerns. 
""I had risked my life to come to the Republic of Korea seeking free democracy and values in market economy,"" Thae said. 
""I will solve regional issues with the market principles ... while pushing for North Korea policy that better reflects the reality there and matches the pride of the South Korean citizens.""

KUALA LUMPUR/HANOI (Reuters) - A Chinese government survey ship embroiled in a standoff with Vietnamese vessels moved south near Malaysia, shipping data showed Thursday, amid accusations that China is using the pandemic to assert its presence in the South China Sea. 
The Haiyang Dizhi 8 was spotted off Vietnam this week, returning after being closely tracked last year in the resource-rich waters, a potential global flashpoint as the United States challenges China's sweeping maritime claims.
The ship appeared to have started a survey in waters 352 kilometres (218 miles) off the coasts of Brunei and Malaysia on Thursday, according to data from Marine Traffic, a website that tracks shipping.
That appeared to be just north of Malaysia's exclusive economic zone (EEZ), near waters claimed by both Vietnam and Malaysia. 
A Malaysian coastguard vessel, the KM Pekan, is shadowing the Chinese ship, a Malaysian maritime source said, declining to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter.
The Haiyang Dizhi 8 had been flanked by as many as seven Chinese coastguard vessels that have since moved away, two sources familiar with the matter said. The Malaysian navy was monitoring the situation, one of the sources said.
The foreign ministries of Malaysia, Brunei and China did not respond to requests for comment. 
On Wednesday, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesman had said the ship was conducting normal activities and accused U.S. officials of using the South China Sea issue to smear Beijing. 
The presence of the Haiyang Dizhi 8 in the South China Sea comes amid movement curbs imposed by Southeast Asian countries to slow the spread of the coronavirus. 
The U.S. State Department had urged Beijing to focus on combating the pandemic and ""stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand its unlawful claims in the South China Sea."" 
China's U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" on its maps marks a vast expanse of the waters that it claims, including large expanses in the south that are also claimed by Malaysia, Vietnam and Brunei. 
Earlier this year, the Washington think tank Asian Maritime Transparency Initiative (AMTI) said China has maintained a near-constant presence in Luconia Shoals, off the coast of Malaysia’s Sarawak state on Borneo.
Last year, at least one China Coast Guard vessel spent weeks in waters close to an oil rig in a Vietnamese oil block, operated by Russia's Rosneft, while the Haiyang Dizhi 8 conducted suspected oil exploration surveys in Vietnam's EEZ.

New Zealand introduced its highest, level 4 lockdown measures in March, under which offices, schools and all non-essential services like bars, restaurants, cafes and playgrounds were shut down. A decision on whether to lift the lockdown would be made on April 20.
The measures were tougher than most other countries, including neighbouring Australia, where some businesses were allowed to operate.
Ardern said if New Zealand moves to the lower level 3 of restriction, it would permit aspects of the economy to reopen in a safe way but there will be no ""rush to normality"".
""We have an opportunity to do something no other country has achieved, eliminating the virus,"" Ardern said at a news conference.
New Zealand reported 15 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, taking the total to 1,401 in a nation of about 5 million people. There have been nine deaths. 
Ardern said under level 3, some people could return to work and businesses reopen if they are able to provide contactless engagement with customers.
Shops, malls, hardware stores and restaurants will remain shut but can permit online or phone purchases. 
Schools can open partially up to year 10 but attendance is voluntary, Ardern said, adding that for children who are able, distance learning is still the best option. 
Funerals and weddings will be able to go ahead, but limited to 10 people. But they can only be services and no meals, food or receptions can take place.
“By design, Level 3 is a progression, not a rush to normality. It carries forward many of the restrictions in place at Level 4, including the requirement to mainly be at home in your bubble and to limit contact with others,"" Ardern said.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - The lockdown of the Chinese city of Wuhan may have lifted, but Feng Jing keeps watching the 5,400 residents in the Tanhualin neighbourhood to see where they go and how they are feeling, guarding against the coronavirus creeping back.
Feng is the head of the neighbourhood's residential committee, among thousands tasked in late January with ensuring people in the city of 11 million stayed home to curb the spread of the virus.
A legacy of the Mao Zedong era, residential committees are staffed mainly by members of the ruling Communist Party and have been key to supporting epidemic control efforts as they kept locked-in residents fed and supplied, carried out regular disinfection operations, and looked after vulnerable people including the elderly. 
While the city has reopened shopping malls and allowed companies to resume work, residential committees have been ordered to keep a careful watch on households to help prevent the complete resumption of free movement. 
Wuhan was the epicentre of China's epidemic, and was where the outbreak first occurred. Haunted by what the city endured during the past few months, people have an abiding fear of a second wave of contagion, although new cases have slowed to a trickle in recent weeks. 
But, the prolonged vigilance and control over movement has also raised questions over how long the watch over people's lives could last and whether the city will truly return to normal. 
""We still don't let residents go out, only those who have resumed work can go out if they have a green health code,"" Feng, who runs a team of 14 community workers, told reporters last week during a government-arranged tour.
At that time, Tanhualin had been free of infections for 45 days. In all, the neighbourhood had counted 26 cases of the virus during the epidemic, the first one was identified in January.
Asked if her committee had relaxed its management since the lockdown ended, Feng was categoric in her response.
""Not at all!"", she said. ""Our residents are extremely united, extremely hardworking and are fighting side by side with us. They listen to all our arrangements."" 
KNOW EVERYTHING
The committees' work during the outbreak extended to keeping detailed records of residents' health, carrying out daily body temperature checks and making sure any slight discomfort, such as a cough or headache, is reported. 
They also played a key role in keeping a 24-hour watch on people trying to enter or leave their compounds, and assigning someone to accompany family members of deceased coronavirus victims on visits to lay ashes at cemeteries. 
Reuters reporters in Wuhan found that some compounds were more rigorously managed than others. 
Many residents also said they were happy to comply with the prolonged oversight, given that it had proven effective in controlling the spread of the virus. Still, some indicated they were growing weary of the intrusion.
""What I really want to say is, the lifting of the lockdown is not a true one, neighbourhoods are still imposing curbs, restricting people from going out,"" one resident posted on Weibo on April 13. 
Rising worries about asymptomatic cases and the possibility of a second wave of infections mean that the residential committees may maintain their vigilance for a while longer. 
Peng Jing, who runs the residential committee in the Shuianxingcheng neighbourhood, said it had immediately sprung into action after discovering an asymptomatic case on April 11, which prompted them to send the patient's mother quickly to a quarantine centre and notify the area's 11,000 residents. 
""We believe our government will notify us first thing when we can end the sealing off of the neighbourhoods,"" she said on Wednesday during a small government-organised group interview.

1540,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 16, 2020 12:05AM ET</span>","Israel's Netanyahu, Gantz miss unity deal deadline, deadlock persists","By Rami Ayyub
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz missed a midnight deadline to reach a unity government deal but agreed early on Thursday to continue talks. 
Even the medical and economic crises brought on by the coronavirus outbreak have so far failed to end an unprecedented political deadlock that has pushed Israel into three inconclusive elections in the last year, and perhaps now a fourth.
Gantz and Netanyahu have been negotiating a power-sharing deal that would keep the right-wing premier in office for another 18 months, Israeli media reported.
Under the arrangement, centrist former general Gantz would take over after that. 
Gantz, a relative newcomer to politics, was given the first chance to put together a government after the most recent election, in March.
President Reuven Rivlin, who is overseeing the talks, said on Monday that progress justified his decision to grant Gantz a two-day extension to hash out a deal with Netanyahu.
But Gantz's mandate expired at midnight on Wednesday after a last-minute attempt by the two leaders' envoys to clinch a deal. That complicates plans for economic recovery once the coronavirus outbreak is brought under control, and the country's stringent lockdown is eased.
Without a deal, it will be up to parliament to pick a candidate who would then have 14 days to form a government. Failure to do so would automatically dissolve parliament and trigger a snap election. 
Netanyahu and Gantz released a joint statement early on Thursday saying they would continue negotiations later in the day. Talks technically can continue until parliament is formally dissolved.
Gantz had previously said he would not serve in a government led by Netanyahu, who is facing indictment on corruption charges but denies any wrongdoing. The trial is due to begin next month.
But the enormity of the coronavirus crisis prompted Gantz to break his campaign promise and to consider a deal, a move that angered many of his anti-Netanyahu supporters.
The outcome appeared to weaken Gantz while strengthening Netanyahu, whose caretaker government is overseeing the country's response to the coronavirus crisis. 
A Monday poll from Israel's Channel 12 news said that if an election were held now, Netanyahu's Likud party would see a four-seat boost to 40 in the 120-member Knesset, while Gantz's weakened Blue and White party would win only 19.
The poll also found that some 64% of citizens were satisfied with Netanyahu's handling of the pandemic. 

Israel has reported over 12,500 COVID-19 cases and at least 130 deaths. Restrictions have confined most Israelis to their homes, forcing businesses to close and sending unemployment to more than 25%.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega appeared on Wednesday in a live broadcast on national television after being absent from public life for a month, raising questions about his health and whereabouts as the world reels from the novel coronavirus.
Ortega, a 74-year-old former leftist guerrilla with chronic illnesses, gave no explanation for his 33-day absence but said that the Central American country is dealing with the coronavirus outbreak responsibly. 
""We have not stopped working, because if the people do not work, they die,"" said Ortega. ""We are a country of working people, people that will not die of hunger.""
Ortega's health has been a closely guarded secret and his absence from public life led to speculation about it.
Over the years, Ortega has suffered two heart attacks and developed high cholesterol and other ailments, an official told Reuters last week. Since then, the president has been increasingly protective of his health, the official said.
Now in his second stint as president after orchestrating a constitutional change to allow for re-elections, Ortega said that Nicaragua has the lowest number of coronavirus infections, registering only nine cases and one person died.
""We have the capacity to attend to coronavirus patients,"" Ortega said.
Public health experts have questioned the accuracy of the official figures and urged the government to report how many people have been tested for the coronavirus. 

Nicaragua is one of the few countries that does not have social distancing measures, does not prohibit mass gatherings and has not canceled school and university classes as recommended by the World Health Organization.

1542,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 07:20PM ET</span>",Russia carried out anti-satellite missile test: U.S. military,"By Idrees Ali and Joey Roulette
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia carried out a test of an anti-satellite missile on Wednesday, the U.S. military said, calling it an example of the threats the United States faced in space. 
The move comes as officials have said that space will increasingly become an important domain for warfare, with the U.S. and other countries such as Russia and China stepping up their military postures in low-Earth orbit and near the moon. 
Experts say that anti-satellite weapons that shatter their targets pose a space hazard by creating a cloud of fragments that can collide with other objects, potentially setting off a chain reaction of projectiles through Earth orbit.
""The United States is ready and committed to deterring aggression and defending the nation, our allies, and U.S. interests from hostile acts in space,"" General John Raymond, the commander of U.S. Space Command, said in a statement.
Raymond added that the test was proof of ""Russia's hypocritical advocacy of outer space arms control proposals ... while clearly having no intention of halting their counterspace weapons programs.""
Russian airspace notices indicate the test was conducted around Wednesday morning. It did not appear that the mobile missile system was targeting any satellites in space based on public satellite data, according to analysts. 
The test was of Russia's new Nudol anti-satellite missile system, analysts projected, launching from the Plesetsk Cosmodrome about 800 km (497 miles) north of Moscow.
The U.S. military is increasingly dependent on satellites to determine what it does on the ground, guiding munitions with space-based lasers and satellites as well as using such assets to monitor for missile launches and track its forces.
The U.S. and China have carried out similar anti-satellite tests. In March, India launched the most recent anti-satellite missile test against a satellite in low Earth orbit, creating a field of impact debris whose fragments continue to orbit Earth today.

1543,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 06:20PM ET</span>","China may have conducted low-level nuclear test blasts, U.S. says","By Jonathan Landay
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China may have secretly set off low-level underground nuclear test explosions despite claiming to observe an international pact banning such blasts, the U.S. State Department said in a report on Wednesday that could fuel U.S.-Chinese tensions.
The finding, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, may worsen ties already strained by U.S. charges that the global COVID-19 pandemic resulted from Beijing's mishandling of a 2019 outbreak of the coronavirus in the city of Wuhan.
U.S. concerns about Beijing's possible breaches of a ""zero yield"" standard for test blasts have been prompted by activities at China's Lop Nur nuclear test site throughout 2019, the State Department report said.
Zero yield refers to a nuclear test in which there is no explosive chain reaction of the type ignited by the detonation of a nuclear warhead.
""China's possible preparation to operate its Lop Nur test site year-round, its use of explosive containment chambers, extensive excavation activities at Lop Nur and a lack of transparency on its nuclear testing activities ... raise concerns regarding its adherence to the zero yield standard,"" the report said, without providing evidence of a low-yield test.
Beijing's lack of transparency included blocking data transmissions from sensors linked to a monitoring center operated by the international agency that verifies compliance with a treaty banning nuclear test explosions. 
The 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) allows activities designed to ensure the safety of nuclear weapons.
A spokeswoman for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization, which verifies compliance with the pact, told the Wall Street Journal there had been no interruptions in data transmissions from China's five sensor stations since the end of August 2019 following an interruption that began in 2018.
The Chinese embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A senior U.S. official said the concerns about China's testing activities buttressed President Donald Trump's case for getting China to join the United States and Russia in talks on an arms control accord to replace the 2010 New START treaty between Washington and Moscow that expires in February.
New START restricted the United States and Russia to deploying no more than 1,550 nuclear warheads, the lowest level in decades, and limited the land- and submarine-based missiles and bombers that deliver them.
""The pace and manner by which the Chinese government is modernizing its stockpile is worrying, destabilizing, and illustrates why China should be brought into the global arms control framework,"" said the senior U.S. official on condition of anonymity.
China, estimated to have about 300 nuclear weapons, has repeatedly rejected Trump's proposal, arguing its nuclear force is defensive and poses no threat.
Russia, France and Britain - three of the world's five internationally recognized nuclear powers - signed and ratified the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which still requires ratification by 44 countries to become international law.
China and the United States are among eight signatories that have not ratified it. But China has declared its adherence to its terms, while the United States has observed a unilateral testing moratorium since 1992.

1544,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 05:07PM ET</span>",Mourning a 'supermom': U.S. health worker casualties mount in virus fight,"By Gabriella Borter and Kristina Cooke
NEW YORK (Reuters) - ""Home soon,"" Madhvi Aya texted from her hospital bed. ""Love you."" 
It was the last exchange she had with her only daughter, 18-year-old Minnoli. Three days later, Madhvi Aya died of COVID-19.
Aya, 61, was a physician assistant who had treated patients with the coronavirus. Then she became a patient herself.
She was admitted to the Long Island Jewish Medical Center on March 18 after being infected and died 11 days later. Her family believes she contracted the respiratory illness at her workplace - the emergency room at Woodhull Hospital in Brooklyn, New York.
She told her husband and daughter that she had treated infected patients while wearing only a surgical mask, which offers little protection from airborne infection. Woodhull hospital declined to comment on Aya's case or whether it had been able to provide its staff with enough protective gear amid widespread shortages nationally.
Aya is among 51 U.S. healthcare workers identified by Reuters as having died after being diagnosed with or showing symptoms of the virus. They include nurses, doctors and technicians who have died in the United States after contracting the disease, according to interviews with hospitals, union representatives and families and a Reuters review of local media reports and obituaries. 
There's no official tally of the deaths among U.S. healthcare workers, and the total could be much higher than the number counted by Reuters.
Minnoli is a freshman at the State University of New York at Buffalo with hopes of becoming a trauma cardiothoracic surgeon. She continued texting her mother for days after her death.
""I kept texting her wanting to believe it wasn’t true,"" Minnoli said. ""She deserved to live and see me graduate, and become a doctor, and get married and have kids.""
Aya became a physician assistant because she was determined to create a good life for her daughter. The job entailed 12-hour shifts in the emergency room of her Brooklyn hospital. 
Since March 1, when the first coronavirus case was confirmed in New York, 28,183 people have tested positive in Brooklyn, and 1,869 people have died, accounting for more than 28% of New York City's confirmed coronavirus deaths. 
RISKING THEIR LIVES
More than 28,440 people in the United States have died from COVID-19 so far. 
Of the 51 deaths among healthcare workers identified by Reuters, at least 16 were in New York, one of the hardest-hit states. At least seven were in Michigan, six in Florida, and six in New Jersey. 
At least 27 were nurses.
They include Patrick Cain, 52, an intensive care nurse in Flint, Michigan, originally from Canada. When he died, the hospital played “Oh Canada,” the national anthem, over the loudspeakers, according to another nurse at the hospital.
“Everyone knew then,” the nurse said. 
His obituary in the Flint Journal describes him as a passionate nurse who always advocated for patients. “He tended to those in need who were exposed to the coronavirus, which eventually took his life,” his obituary reads.
At least 10 of those who died were physicians or resident doctors. Florida doctor Alex Hsu’s daughter Dria described him as calm and reassuring, and said he made others feel heard and important. The 67-year old was the ""epitome of self-sacrifice and selflessness,"" Dria told Reuters.
""He is our hero,"" she said.
Emergency medicine doctor Frank Gabrin, who worked at two New York area hospitals and died from COVID-19 last month, said he believed he contracted the virus while he was forced to reuse the same n-95 mask because of a shortage, according to his best friend Debra Lyons.
""He said it was from having to wear the mask four shifts in a row,"" Lyons said in a phone interview. ""He got the kit the first night of his first shift, and he used the same kit for all four shifts, 12-hour shifts.""
At least five of the deaths identified by Reuters were hospital technicians, and at least four were EMTs. 
The youngest deceased healthcare worker Reuters found was just 20: Valeria Viveros, a nursing assistant in Riverside, California. At least 15 people were in their sixties, and 12 in their fifties.
A KISS BEFORE WORK
If Madhvi Aya was anxious about treating coronavirus patients without the recommended N-95 respirator mask, she never expressed it, said her husband Raj, a retired accountant.
She was an optimist who rarely called in sick or took a day off, Raj told Reuters.
Aya, who immigrated with her husband from India in 1993, awoke at 4 a.m. and would kiss her daughter on the forehead before she left for work.
Shifts in the emergency room were grueling. When Raj picked up his wife from work in the evening, she was usually quiet on the drive home. She would need to close her eyes for 15 minutes before they talked.
""The emergency room is like a war zone,” Raj said. ""Even though I was very close to her, she would never discuss it.""
She developed a cough and fever in mid-March. Raj convinced her to call in sick on March 14 and took her to Woodhull Hospital to get a coronavirus test.
At home, she soon needed Raj’s help to get dressed. She was too weak to get out of bed. Her fever persisted.
On March 18, she asked Raj to take her to Long Island Jewish Medical Center, the hospital closest to their home in Floral Park, Long Island. He waited outside in the car, unable to enter because of the hospital’s no-visitor policy. 
She was admitted. She got the coronavirus test result from Woodhull the same day: positive.
Minnoli returned home on March 20 after classes were moved online. She tried calling her mother for a week, but Aya was too weak to answer. 
""I'm still praying for you to come home safely to me. I need you Mommy,"" Minnoli texted on March 25. ""None of us can live without you. I believe in you, please fight back. You're so strong mommy. I love so much more than you can imagine.""
""Love you,"" her mother wrote back. ""Mom be back."" 
'MR. AYA, WE ARE SORRY'
Raj called the hospital every day for updates. He learned that Aya was getting intravenous fluids and oxygen. As the days passed, she began having more trouble breathing.
On March 28, the doctor treating Aya raised the possibility of intubation as a final attempt to raise her oxygen levels, Raj said. 
In her last texts to Raj on Saturday, she asked her husband to consult her brother, a doctor in India, on whether she should agree to being intubated. Raj read about intubation on the internet, contacted her family and consulted friends. 
They told him he needed to say yes, that intubation is a last resort.
The medical team tried to intubate her on Sunday, March 29. But during the process of inserting the breathing tube, doctors discovered blood clots in her lungs, Raj said. They tried to remove them but they were unsuccessful.
""Mr. Aya, we are sorry,"" said the person who called from the hospital to tell him his wife had died.
Aya's death was reported earlier today by The New York Times.
Woodhull Hospital spokeswoman Michelle Hernandez said Aya was one of three hospital staff members who had recently died, but she declined to say if the others had succumbed to COVID-19.
Two weeks after Aya's death, Minnoli sleeps downstairs in the living room to avoid her mother’s bedroom upstairs. She and Raj have lost the “supermom” who kept the family together, Minnoli said. They have also lost their health insurance and income. 
A friend has raised more then $46,000 for Raj and Minnoli through a GoFundMe campaign to cover their expenses. Several of Aya's coworkers and friends have contributed.
""Madhvi was more than just a colleague to me. She was a great friend and mentor,"" one wrote on the campaign page. 
""I will always remember you,"" said another. 
Each night in New York City, neighborhoods around hospitals cheer for healthcare workers to express gratitude for the risks they are taking to save lives. Minnoli watches videos of the applause on social media. 
“I can’t help but think, what about the ones who have fallen? What about the ones who are already dead?” Minnoli said. “She was a hero unnoticed.”

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Shoved to the ground, splashed with bleach or glared at on public transportation, health workers face a growing tide of hostility across Latin America for potentially spreading COVID-19.
For Sandra Aleman, a nurse in the city of San Luis Potosi in central Mexico, the attack began when a group of children sprayed juice and soda on her white uniform, shouting, ""It's Covid! Stay away from us!""
Aleman was then hit in the face by a woman who she believes was their mother, making her crumple to the ground. 
""Trying to defend myself for proudly wearing my white uniform, I broke two fingers on my right hand. I can no longer do my job,"" she told Reuters, adding that she had not, in fact, treated any patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus. 
Reuters spoke to 16 nurses and health workers with similar stories of hostility and aggression across Latin America, even as they are publicly lauded as heroes, fighting the virus with limited resources. 
So far, more than 72,000 people have been infected and 3,241 people have died from the pandemic in the region.
""We couldn't do anything without health workers,"" Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday, echoing other officials' condemnation of the attacks. 
""I respectfully urge the whole population to take care of health workers, to respect them, to love them."" 
Nurses represent 80% of the staff in Latin America's public hospitals, according to medical unions, making them indispensable in the response to the pandemic, which has infected more than 2 million people worldwide. 
In Colombia's capital of Bogota, home to nearly half of the country's 2,979 people with coronavirus, anesthesiologist Santiago Osorio, 36, said he can no longer use elevators or common areas at his apartment on orders from the building administration, which is concerned he could infect the neighbors. 
""I have to climb the six floors by stairs to get home,"" Osorio said. 
Maria Jose Colina, a doctor and spokeswoman for the Argentina Integral Network of Doctors, said several colleagues have received aggressive messages and comments, including threats, even at their homes. 
Obstetrician Leandro Goñi said neighbors near his Buenos Aires office said he should close because his practice was putting them at risk.
He responded with a letter outlining the precautionary measures he had taken, including only receiving women close to giving birth.
""I kept getting messages saying that they didn't care, that the letter didn't mean anything, that I had to formally close, and that if I didn't do it, they would use the force of the law to make me,"" Goñi said.
In some parts of Panama and Chile, drivers have banned nurses from public transportation. In areas where they allow them, other passengers often give them dirty looks and move away, medical groups say.
""COLLECTIVE PANIC""
Mexico's National Board to Prevent Discrimination said it has received 12 complaints from health workers related to coronavirus since March 19, nine of which reported discrimination, insults or threats.
Nurses and industry representatives believe many more incidents go unreported for fear of retaliation. 
Additionally Edith Mujica, president of the Inter-Institutional Commission of Nurses in the state of Jalisco in western Mexico, said at least six nurses have reported discrimination and aggressive behavior.
According to Mujica, neighbors of one female nurse threw bleach and water at her when she arrived home last month, saying it was so she could ""disinfect."" 
Mujica now recommends her nearly 18,000 members wear civilian clothes in public to avoid becoming targets.
Apart from health workers, discrimination has also affected people who acknowledge testing positive for the virus.
Television producer Rodrigo Fragoso in Mexico City said his neighbors started to splash bleach on his front door after he posted on social media that he had tested positive. They even stopped his family and friends from dropping off food and water, he said. 
Fragoso said he finally filed a complaint with authorities, and his neighbors apologized. 

""It was ignorance, worry and collective panic,"" he said. ""In a certain way, they wanted to protect their families, just in the wrong way.""

Libya mission said on Wednesday it was gravely concerned by reports of the sudden release of 401 prisoners and acts of retribution in west Libyan towns captured by forces of the internationally recognized government this week.
The statement came after forces aligned with the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) seized the towns of Surman and Sabratha on Monday, pushing back rivals loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar. 
Haftar and his Libyan National Army (LNA) have been trying to capture Tripoli for just over a year, escalating an on-off conflict between east and west Libyan factions that has increasingly drawn in foreign powers.
""UNSMIL (United Nations Support Mission in Libya) notes with grave concern reports of attacks on civilians, the Surman Prison break and release of 401 prisoners without adequate legal proceedings or vetting, desecration of corpses, retribution, including looting, robberies and torching of public and private properties,"" the mission said in a statement.
""UNSMIL is following up the above allegations, which if verified, would constitute grave violations of international human rights and humanitarian law.""
The GNA said inmates had left Surman prison after pro-Haftar forces were driven from the town and before GNA forces arrived. It has called on local police forces to return to work and prevent violations.
The GNA's justice ministry said 384 prisoners had escaped after a prison riot, and called for those who fled to hand themselves in. 
In Tripoli, heavy bombardment could be heard into the evening on Wednesday.
UNSMIL said it condemned LNA forces' ""indiscriminate bombardment of Tripoli with rockets, many of which have landed on civilian neighborhoods, resulting in casualties"".
It repeated calls for a humanitarian pause, at a time when the divided country is trying to contain its first cases of the new coronavirus.

PARIS (Reuters) - A diplomatic spat between France and China widened on Wednesday as members of the French Senate demanded answers at a hearing with the foreign minister as to why an article they said was fake and cast them in a bad light was still up on the Chinese embassy website.
The French language article, entitled ""Restoring distorted facts - Observations of a Chinese diplomat posted to Paris"", first appeared on Sunday, the latest in a series of posts and tweets by the embassy that has defended Beijing's response to the coronavirus pandemic, while criticizing the West's handling of the outbreak.
In the post, an unnamed diplomat suggests that careworkers in Western nursing homes - using the French term EHPAD - had abandoned their jobs, leaving residents to die. It came just days after France had raised its death toll substantially to include nursing homes.
The diplomat also suggested that some 80 French lawmakers had co-signed a disparaging statement about World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and had accused Tedros, an Ethiopian, of pro-Chinese bias.
""The WHO has been the subject of a real siege on the part of the Western countries, some even launching ad-hominem attacks against its Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus,"" the article on the website says.
""The Taiwanese authorities, supported by more than 80 French parliamentarians in a co-signed declaration, even used the word 'negro' to attack him. I still do not understand what could have gone through the heads of all these French elected representatives.""
Reuters could not find any evidence French lawmakers backed such a declaration nor that Taiwanese authorities used this word to insult Tedros.
The Chinese embassy posted a response on its website by its Foreign Ministry spokesman.
""We hope that there is no misunderstanding: the Chinese side has never made a negative comment on French management of the epidemic, and has no intention of doing so,"" it quoted spokesman Zhao Lijian as saying in a French translation.
The timing of the dispute is especially awkward for Paris, as it has ordered about 600 million masks from China to compensate for coronavirus-related shortages across the country and is still waiting for their delivery.
The French presidency and foreign ministry were initially cautious in their response to the article.
But on Tuesday after a growing clamor in France, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian summoned China's ambassador to stress his disapproval, while underscoring the good relationship he has with his Chinese counterpart.
""In the face of the virus and its consequences on our economies there is no place for controversy,"" he said.
However, during a parliamentary hearing with Le Drian on Wednesday, several senators expressed their dismay at the diplomat's comments. They denied such a declaration existed and demanded to know what the minister had told the envoy and why the article was still on the embassy's website. 
Le Drian sidestepped the questions, citing the remarks by China's Foreign Ministry spokesman on Wednesday. 
""You have a new brand of Chinese diplomats who seem to compete with each other to be more radical and eventually insulting to the country where they happen to be posted,"" said François Godement, a senior advisor for Asia at the Paris-based Institut Montaigne.
""These diplomats are behaving as if they were trolls, or bots, and putting outrageous texts on their own social media, which happen to be the embassy website, not quite necessarily noting the distinction between an official embassy website, which represents the government.""

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Some Canadian hospitals are collecting used N95 masks so that they can be decontaminated and worn again should new ones become impossible to find amid a global scramble for personal protective equipment caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The issue has become more pressing in Canada after the United States blocked some exports of protective gear. On April 5, Canada's chief medical officer, Theresa Tam, said hospitals should not throw away medical masks, including N95 respirators, because it may be possible to disinfect and re-use them.
The CHEO Research Institute in Ottawa is preparing to sterilize the masks with ultraviolet light for the CHEO pediatric health center.
""That transition from having masks to having no masks can happen very quickly, so having something in place now so we're ready is really important,"" said Katie O'Hearn, research coordinator at the institute.
So far the institute has looked into ultraviolet germicidal irradiation, and microwave and heat decontamination methods, but it is also studying chemical disinfectants, including vaporized hydrogen peroxide.
""We found that UV light could successfully remove viral pathogens from the mask,"" she said, while ensuring that they still fit properly on the face. If used masks are needed, the hospital could do UV decontamination in the microbiology labs, O'Hearn said.
CHEO, which is using about 250 N95 masks per day, currently has a sufficient supply of new masks, said its medical chief of staff, Lindy Samson.
U.S. President Donald Trump has directed federal agencies to use any authority necessary to keep highly sought-after medical supplies in the country, kicking off a diplomatic spat with Canada over N95 masks produced by 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co.
Canada's deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, has characterized the market for medical equipment as ""a Wild West,"" and the government is encouraging more domestic production of medical supplies.
Hospitals in New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Ontario and Saskatchewan are all collecting used masks and making plans to sterilize them should they run out of new ones. British Columbia's health authority is evaluating whether to do the same, Chief Health Officer Bonnie Henry has said.
Horizon Health Network in New Brunswick is in ""the very early stages of examining the feasibility of decontaminating and reusing N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Margaret Melanson, a vice president. 
Newfoundland's Eastern Health is developing a procedure to re-use N95 respirators. Saskatchewan's provincial health authority said it would partner with the University of Saskatchewan's Vaccine and Infectious Disease Centre to use vaporized hydrogen peroxide to decontaminate respirator masks. 
In Ontario, Toronto's Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is also collecting used masks and has done its own testing but not used them yet, a hospital spokesman said.
Toronto's Michael Garron Hospital is collecting goggles at the end of shifts and is looking at possible decontamination methods, while the city's University Health Network said it is saving personal protective equipment while it awaits the results of research.

All the health authorities and hospitals said they would need approval either from the province or the federal regulator to start using sterilized masks.

A Maltese commercial vessel rescued the migrants from an inflatable boat and handed them to Libya's coast guard, which brought them to a naval base in Tripoli where they were allowed to disembark after a delay of several hours, the International Organization for Migration said.
There has been uncertainty about whether migrants intercepted by Libya's coast guard would be able to dock in Tripoli. Last week, a group of about 280 migrants were prevented from disembarking overnight because of shelling in the port city. 
""We have no clarity as to the procedures that are followed or will be followed from now on,"" the IOM's Libya office said in an email.
Hundreds of migrants continue to attempt crossings from Libya towards Italy, though Italy has declared its ports unsafe in the coronavirus epidemic.
After a relative lull in crossings, numbers had started to pick up in the first two months of the year only to fall back in March as Italy was hit by the coronavirus. 
The group that disembarked on Wednesday were of Eritrean and Sudanese nationality, and included eight women and three children. They were taken to one of several detention centers in Tripoli, IOM said.
Fighting around Tripoli has intensified in recent weeks between forces allied to Libya's internationally recognized government and those fighting for eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, who launched an offensive to capture the Libyan capital just over one year ago.
Heavy bombardments could be heard near the center of the city on Wednesday.

SCANSANO, Italy, (Reuters) - Twelve-year-old Giulio Giovanni's studying place has a view many people would envy - the unspoiled countryside of rolling hills, vineyards and olive groves under a Tuscan sun. 
He would prefer to participate in classes over the internet from home - like his fellow classmates have to because of Italy's coronavirus lockdown - but the bucolic spot under a tree 1.5 km (one mile) away is the closest with a signal.
""On days when I have lessons I bring from home a table, a stool and my bag with the tablet and all the books that I need and then mum and I come up here in the car,"" Giulio said on Wednesday, which luckily was sunny with a gentle breeze.
His mother drives him to the spot outside the small Tuscan town of Scansano every day because the phone line at home has been out of order for months and there is no cell phone signal there.
""So, to take part in his lessons, we have to come up here where we can at least get the internet,"" she said, explaining that she uses her cell phone as a mobile hotspot.
""We set everything up and we are ready for our lessons,"" said Giulio, who is in the first year of middle school.
""I prefer being at school because at least there I'm with friends. Here I can see them but only via the screen. At least there I would see them in person,"" he said.
His mother said she is taking legal action against the phone company because it is taking them so long to fix the line at home.

Until then, she will continue to drive Giulio to the spot, where, while others might be tempted to enjoy nature's splendours, he taps on the ""classroom"" app on his tablet and starts his school day.

1553,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 01:10PM ET</span>",Potential Irish ruling partners would set up United Ireland unit,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's Fine Gael and Fianna Fail would set up a unit in the prime minister's office to ""work towards a consensus on a united Ireland"" if they are able to form a new government, according to an initial agreement between the two parties.
The leaders of the historic rivals agreed on Tuesday to govern together for the first time if they can get additional support to form a coalition, two months after an election now overshadowed by the coronavirus crisis.
The broad framework document the pair will use in talks with smaller parties -- a copy of which was seen by Reuters on Wednesday -- contained 10 ""missions"", one of which detailed their approach for what was described as ""a shared island"".
Under a 1998 peace deal that settled 30 years of sectarian violence in British-run Northern Ireland, Britain's minister for the province can call a referendum if it appears likely that a majority of those voting would seek to unite with Ireland.
The framework document said the two parties, which have swapped power since Irish independence in 1921, were committed to working with all traditions on the island and respect the principle of consent enshrined within the Good Friday Agreement. 
However it added: ""We will establish a unit within the Department of An Taoiseach (prime minister) to work towards a consensus on a united island ... examining the political, social, economic and cultural considerations underpinning a future in which all traditions are mutually respected.""
Both parties have said they would ultimately like to see the unification of the island, which was partitioned almost a century ago, but that now is not the time.
Fianna Fail's manifesto for the Feb. 8 election wanted such a unit to lead a formal study to set out how Dublin should approach the handling of any future referendum. Fine Gael made no specific commitments on preparations for a poll.
The pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein, which narrowly won the most seats at the election but has been ruled out as a partner by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, has pushed for a unity poll by 2025 and more significant preparations.
The two once dominant parties of Irish politics need the support of at least one smaller party or eight independent lawmakers for a majority in the fractured 160-seat parliament.
Two potential partners, the centre-left Labour and Social Democrat parties, were critical of the framework document on Wednesday but said they would study it in the coming days.

The Greens, the largest of the smaller groups with 12 seats, said it would consider the content and reply shortly. It has called for a temporary national government across parliament since the coronavirus outbreak.

1554,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 01:05PM ET</span>","Brazil health official quits, Bolsonaro expected to fire minister","By Lisandra Paraguassu
BRASILIA (Reuters) - A senior Brazilian health official resigned on Wednesday as expectations mounted that President Jair Bolsonaro would soon fire his health minister over disagreements on how to handle the coronavirus outbreak spreading across the country.
The Health Ministry confirmed the resignation of Wanderson de Oliveira, secretary of health vigilance, who had been leading the fight against the epidemic. In a note to his team seen by Reuters, Oliveira said his boss, Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta would likely be fired ""in coming hours or days.""
Mandetta told his aides on Tuesday evening that Bolsonaro is likely to fire him this week, according to two people familiar with the matter. The minister told his team he planned to remain in the job until Bolsonaro had chosen his replacement, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Bolsonaro and Mandetta have been at odds over the handling of the coronavirus epidemic for weeks, as the president played down the gravity of the outbreak, touted unproven drugs and attacked governors over lockdown orders.
Mandetta emerged from relative obscurity with technocratic daily briefings presenting the latest science, stressing the need for social distancing measures and earning praise from across the political spectrum.
The health ministry's response to the epidemic was rated ""good"" or ""great"" by 76% of Brazilians surveyed by pollster Datafolha this month. Bolsonaro got the same answers from just 33% of those surveyed.
More than 1,500 people have died of COVID-19 in Brazil, out of more than 25,000 confirmed cases of the respiratory disease.
After dodging what many expected would be a firing last week, Mandetta added to tensions in a Sunday TV interview. He urged the government to speak with a unified voice, effectively calling out Bolsonaro for downplaying the threat ahead of what may be the two toughest months for the outbreak.
Vice President Hamilton Mourao said on Tuesday that Mandetta had ""crossed the line"", but suggested he should not be removed immediately from office.

After days without commenting on Mandetta, Bolsonaro told supporters on his arrival to the presidential palace that he expected to ""sort out the health situation,"" without making a direct reference to his minister.

The sources said the SC Taipei chemical tanker had been sailing in international waters on Tuesday when it was stopped by Iranian authorities. 
""The vessel was approached 48nm (nautical miles) offshore Fujairah and hailed by four skiffs carrying armed Iranian coastguard personnel,"" British maritime security company Ambrey Intelligence said. 
""The vessel’s crew were ordered to lower the ladder and were then boarded. The vessel was later directed to Kooh Mobarak, Iran, but quickly released with crew and vessel now confirmed safe.""
Two other maritime security sources also said the vessel had been briefly detained in Iran before being allowed to sail. 
Iranian and Hong Kong officials could not be immediately reached for comment . The vessel's Singapore-based manager SC Shipping was also not immediately available.
The SC Taipei's last position on Wednesday was at anchor near to the United Arab Emirates with the UAE port of Fujairah listed as its destination, Refinitiv ship tracking data showed. 
The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) said on Tuesday that armed men had boarded an unnamed vessel at anchor in the Gulf of Oman but the ship was later released. 
The UKMTO said on Wednesday that Tuesday's episode was ""assessed to be an isolated incident of state-based intervention, with no wider threat to maritime shipping in the region"".
Last year Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) detained a Swedish-owned tanker which was held for weeks in Iran after Britain had earlier detained an Iranian tanker off the territory of Gibraltar.
Ambrey Intelligence said the IRGC had stepped up activity in recent weeks throughout the Strait of Hormuz, hailing ships via VHF radio systems and conducting brief interdictions. It added that such activity should be viewed in the context of ""domestic pressures related to sanctions"". 
The United States re-imposed tough sanctions on Iran in 2018 after Washington pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, raising tensions and hitting the Middle Eastern oil producer's economy.

1556,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 15, 2020 11:07AM ET</span>","Captain Tom, 99, raises $8 million with walk in his UK garden","LONDON (Reuters) - A 99-year-old war veteran has become a celebrity by raising at least 6.4 million pounds ($8 million) for Britain's health service with a walk around his garden in the coronavirus crisis.
Retired army captain Tom Moore, who has used a walking frame to move around since breaking his hip, has set himself the target of walking the 25 metres around his garden 100 times before his 100th birthday later this month. 
The story has lifted the hearts of a nation stuck in lockdown for the last month and weary of the relentless wave of grim news. So far, more than 12,000 people with COVID-19 have died in British hospitals, the fifth-highest total globally. 
Moore had originally aimed to raise 500,000 pounds but that target has been smashed as media attention from around the globe has zoomed in on his garden in Bedfordshire, central England.
His son-in-law Colin Ingram said Moore wanted to give something back after receiving such good care from the state-run National Health Service (NHS) when he broke his hip two years ago and in subsequent hospital visits. 
""It was literally just something we were doing in the garden to keep him walking on his recovery from his hip operation,"" Ingram told Reuters of how it started. 
""We said we'd give him a pound a lap, and thank goodness I didn't say I'd match any money he raised!""
Moore, pictured with his campaign medals from his time as an army officer in Asia in World War Two, has featured on UK news programmes and front pages, and his family are fielding interest from as far afield as the United States, France and Australia.
Raising money for the NHS has given Moore a new lease of life, said his son-in-law, and the veteran has no plans to stop, even though he is due to hit his 100-lap target on Thursday morning. 
""He's coming down in the morning sprightly and loving it. If the public wants to keep on donating then he'll keep on walking,"" Ingram said.

CORBEIL-ESSONNES, France (Reuters) - For French ambulance crew boss Fabrice Lancelot, the coronavirus crisis has delivered a small consolation: a new respect for health workers, even among notoriously impatient Paris motorists.
""I get the impression that there's a bit more respect on the roads,"" said Lancelot, crew boss with the UMPSA Pro private ambulance firm that has spent the past weeks ferrying patients around the southern suburbs of the French capital. Many have COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
""Definitely there's less traffic, so we get in the way less, but ... if someone cuts you up, or does not give way to you by mistake, they apologise by raising their hand. That's something we did not see before,"" he said.
The coronavirus death toll in France on Wednesday reached 15,729. With hospitals and clinics fighting to treat thousands of people with virus symptoms, French citizens have shown their support. Every night at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT), many Parisians step out on their balconies to applaud healthcare workers.
That sentiment has provided a much-needed morale boost for the ambulance crews in the suburbs of Paris. ""We feel appreciated more,"" said Jean-Manuel Robles, a crew member with the UMPSA Pro team.
On Tuesday, Robles and his colleagues were called out to see a 29-year-old woman who had tested positive for COVID-19. She had been told to recuperate at home, but was having respiratory problems, so dialled for help.
Before entering the woman's apartment building, Robles and his colleague, Najib Alouani, put on full protective gear: coveralls, masks, goggles and gloves.
They put the woman on a wheelchair, loaded her into the ambulance, and transported her to the Sud Francilien hospital for treatment. Afterwards, they stripped off their gear, disinfected, and got ready for the next callout.
Around two weeks ago, Robles and his colleagues were transporting some 10 people with COVID-19 symptoms a day. That number is now down by half, the crew said. 
But the weeks of working under pressure have left a mark and working out how to protect yourself from a highly contagious virus is a constant worry.
""It's something that weighs you down,"" Robles said.

But he said ordinary people's appreciation helped him get through. ""We see a bit more solidarity towards the ambulance crews,"" said Robles. ""It allows us, as professionals to have a little lift in our morale and to keep doing what we're doing.""

The ban took effect on March 13 and the Yangon Region COVID-19 Control and Emergency Response Committee said in a statement that David Lah and two other pastors had held services after that in Yangon and would be charged alongside one member of the congregation.
David Lah could not be reached for comment.
Ye Win Aung, the local government administrator for Yangon's Mayangone township, said he had been instructed by the committee to file the charges. The disaster management law under which charges have been filed could lead to a three-year jail term.
About 20 people connected to gatherings in early April later tested positive for the virus, Ye Win Aung said, and those included David Lah.
Reuters was unable to confirm this independently and a Health Ministry spokesman did not answer calls seeking comment.
Police in Yangon confirmed that charges had been filed against four people for holding religious gatherings at two police stations in the city. 
Christian and Muslim religious events elsewhere in the world have been triggers for the spread of the virus that has infected nearly 2 million people and killed nearly 130,000 worldwide.
Myanmar, which has reported 74 cases of the virus and four deaths, is a Buddhist-majority nation but Christians comprise about 6% of the population.

In a sermon posted online in late March, David Lah had told followers: ""If you hear the sermon of God, the virus will never come to you, I declare it with the soul of Jesus Christ.""

OSLO (Reuters) - Prime Minister Erna Solberg told Norwegian children on Wednesday it would take time for life to return to normal with the country, like others in Europe, preparing to reopen parts of society shut down by the coronavirus outbreak. 
She spoke at her second nationally telecast news conference held specially for children, with adults not allowed to ask questions, since the crisis began. At the first such briefing on March 16, Solberg told children it was OK to feel scared about the pandemic.
""It will still be a while before everything returns to normal. How long it will be, we don't know,"" she said, flanked by her ministers for education and for family. No children were present, in keeping with social-distancing rules.
""One of the things I miss the most is to give a good hug to my friends,"" Solberg told her young viewers. ""For now it is not possible with the rules to maintain distance that we have now. But other things will soon be possible."" 
The Nordic country will next week start reopening some public and private institutions after a month-long shutdown to help prevent a spread of the novel coronavirus. 
Nurseries will reopen on April 20 and primary schools from first to fourth grades from April 27.
Most Norwegian children are at home, mostly barred from meeting friends and relatives, especially elderly ones seen as most vulnerable to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.
""I want to thank all of you who have studied at home, who have helped out with looking after your little brother, or your big brother, who have helped Mum and Dad, and helped me, to make the days go well with the special rules we have now,"" Solberg told her young viewers.
She then answered questions posted via the children's TV programme NRK Super. They included: ""Why is it safe for younger children to go to school but not for the older children?""; ""When can I give hugs to my friends again?""; or ""Can I visit my Granny and my Granddad in Germany this summer?"" 
Solberg also said children's street parades in several cities had to be cancelled, including the biggest one in Oslo reviewed by King Harald on Norway's national day, May 17.
""There won't be big processions this year. We can't have that,"" Solberg told the children, hastening to add that efforts were continuing to find other ways to celebrate.

Norway has reported a total of 6,677 COVID-19 infections and 130 deaths to date.

China has disputed the findings of the U.S. government-funded study and said it will do its utmost to guarantee a reasonable discharge of water to the Mekong basin countries of Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam.
The study, by research and consulting company Eyes on Earth Inc., said that according to satellite data 11 Chinese dams held back water at a time when China had higher-than-average levels - while levels downstream were at their lowest in over 50 years.
The Mekong River Commission (MRC), an inter-governmental body that works with the governments of Laos, Thailand, Cambodia and Vietnam in managing the Lower Mekong basin, said the study did not prove that the withholding of water caused the drought.
But its secretariat said it sought more information from China as well as a more formal working relationship.
""China, as an MRC dialogue partner, has provided its water level and rainfall data during flood season, from only two of its stations on the upper Mekong,"" it said in response to Reuters questions. ""The MRC has attempted to acquire dry season data from China, but no agreement has yet been reached.""
None of the governments in the downstream countries responded to a Reuters request for comment. Water flow on the Mekong is a sensitive topic in relations with China, the region's dominant power.
In Thailand, the hashtag #StopMekongDam was trending on Twitter on Wednesday as a result of the new report.
Activists said the study confirmed their suspicions.
""We cannot just sit around and wait for China to say when they are releasing the water from their dams; Mekong countries need to have a say on this too,"" said Niwat Roykaew, an environmental activist in northern Thailand.
China has no formal water treaties with the lower Mekong countries and shares only limited information.
In Cambodia, Hok Menghoin of the NGO Forum on Cambodia said the report would at least help downstream governments to press their case in their discussions with China.
""China's actions must go well beyond periodic releases of water,"" said Pianporn Deetes, a Thai activist for the International Rivers pressure group.
""There needs to be long-term change in dam operations to prioritize the ecosystem services vital to the livelihoods of downstream communities"".

Washington, which has been challenging China's growing influence in Southeast Asia, has said Beijing essentially controls the Mekong.

Another group of 50 children is expected to fly from Athens to Germany on Saturday, and 20 more will head to Switzerland at a later date. Greece hopes to relocate some 1,600 unaccompanied minors in the coming months.
At least 5,200 migrant children from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and African countries currently live in Greece, many of them under harsh conditions in camps on islands in the Aegean. 
Deputy migration minister Giorgos Koumoutsakos said that although the number of children was small, it sent a strong message for others to follow the example set by Luxembourg.
Greece, he said, is having to bear a disproportionate share of the refugee burden.
""Greece faces a crisis within a crisis; migration and the pandemic together,"" he told state broadcaster ERT. ""The combination makes an already difficult situation even more so, and more complex.""
Having imposed a lockdown early on, Greece has weathered the coronavirus pandemic relatively well compared to many other European countries, with 2,170 confirmed cases and 101 deaths to date. 
But its economy, which had been emerging from a decade-long recession following a debt crisis, is expected to suffer badly from a collapse in tourism bookings.
Human Rights Watch, an advocacy group, called on Greece this week to release all unaccompanied minors, saying their detention in overcrowded camps or in police cells heightened the risk of them contracting COVID-19.
Hundreds of thousands of migrants and refugees fleeing conflicts and poverty in their countries used Greece as a springboard towards other European countries in 2015 and 2016, when an EU-brokered accord with Turkey all but halted the flow. 
Turkey now hosts about 3.4 million refugees and migrants, while Greece has about 120,000 who are waiting for asylum applications to be processed. Many of them are in overcrowded camps on five islands in the Aegean Sea, where aid groups say living conditions are dire.

About a dozen European nations have expressed a willingness to take in a number of them on a voluntary basis, including Italy, Finland, Serbia, Ireland and Portugal, Greek officials say.

Japan, which tests only people with symptoms of the coronavirus, has so far recorded more than 8,000 infections with nearly 200 deaths.
Reports in Japanese media citing an undisclosed health ministry projection said fatalities could reach the 400,000 mark without mitigation measures. It also estimated that as many as 850,000 people could need ventilators.
Japan has seen an accelerating infection rate in recent weeks, particularly in Tokyo. The government has responded by declaring an emergency in Tokyo and six other areas including Osaka, and a goal to cut interactions between people by 70 percent.
The measures include a request that people isolate and businesses close, although there are no fines or penalties to force compliance. The government spokesman, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, urged people to do everything in their power to help the government reach its target.
Japan's capital reported more than 125 new cases on Wednesday, according to public broadcaster NHK.
A lawmaker, Takashi Takai, was forced to resign from the main opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan on Wednesday, after media reported he had visited a bar in Tokyo's Kabukicho red light district despite the call to stay at home.
As Suga was calling for cooperation, his boss Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was coming under pressure to add a 100,000 yen ($935) payment to every citizen on top of a $1 trillion economic stimulus package that includes a 300,000 yen payment to households whose income has fallen because of the pandemic.
""I've urged the prime minister to make a decision and send a strong message of solidarity to the public,"" Natsuo Yamaguchi, head of the Komeito party, the junior partner in the ruling coalition, told reporters after meeting Abe.
Other allies calling for action include Toshihiro Nikai a leading member of Abe's ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Speaking at his regular afternoon briefing, Suga said the government would consider further measures, but that for now it wanted ""to extend help to households most affected.""
Japan said on Wednesday that the number of foreign visitors in March plummeted by 93 percent compared to last year. Abe has identified tourism as an economic growth driver. 
The U.S. military extended a public health emergency to all of its bases in Japan. Since April 6, the emergency had applied only to the eastern Kanto region which includes Tokyo. 
That health emergency, which affects the largest concentration of U.S. military personnel in Asia, will remain in effect until May 15, more than a week beyond the planned May 6 end of the Japanese government's emergency declaration. It gives commanders the authority to enforce compliance with health measures on anyone accessing U.S. bases, including thousands of local residents who work as engineers and service personnel.
Abe will decide this weekend whether to extend the Japanese government's emergency declaration after consulting with medical experts, according to two sources familiar with the matter who spoke to Reuters.
A key metric will be if new daily infections in Tokyo can be kept to around a hundred, the sources said. They asked not to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's military will investigate an incident in the easternmost region of Papua in which two men were shot dead, it said on Wednesday, after rights activists and a family member said the men were wrongly identified as separatist rebels. 
Separatist conflict has simmered in the former Dutch colony since it was controversially incorporated into Indonesia after a widely criticized U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. 
The men were killed at a river near the Grasberg mine, the world's second-biggest copper mine operated by an arm of miner Freeport-McMoRan Inc, after security forces mistook them for members of the Free Papua Movement, rights activist Patris Wetibo said. 
Demi Bebari, the father of one of the dead men, a 19-year-old student, said the two had gone fishing to find food because the nearby markets had been closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.
""My son was in an area for fishing, not for military operations,"" he told Reuters, adding that the men were only carrying rudimentary fishing gear.
Papua military representative Dax Sianturi confirmed there had been a fatal incident on Monday near the Grasberg mine and said it was under investigation.
Papua police chief Paulus Waterpau said he had visited the family, along with the military commander, to offer condolences.
""The plan is, after the funeral, we will question members of the task force that directly faced the two victims,"" Waterpau added.
Human rights lawyer Veronica Koman urged Indonesia to withdraw troops from some areas after a recent escalation of violence, saying separatists had offered a ceasefire because of the pandemic.
""West Papuans have been saying 'We are more scared of the bullets than the coronavirus',"" she told Reuters.
President Joko Widodo has worked hard to boost development and build infrastructure in Papua since he was elected in 2014, but has faced criticism for failing to adequately tackle accusations of human rights abuses. 
Violence has picked up around the Grasberg mine in recent months, and some analysts say the independence movement has gained momentum under the Widodo government. 
Monday's shooting comes after a New Zealand man who worked at the Freeport mine was shot dead last month in an attack claimed by separatists that also wounded six.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's most senior official in Hong Kong said on Wednesday the city should work to introduce national security legislation ""as soon as possible"" as violent protests last year had undermined its rule of law, prosperity and stability.
Luo Huining, chief of the Liaison Office and the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-ruled city, made the remarks during a speech commemorating China's National Security Education Day.
In some of his strongest comments since taking office in January, Luo said national security was an obvious shortcoming in the former British colony and criticised what he described as foreign forces interfering in Hong Kong's affairs. 
""If the ant-hill eroding the rule of law is not cleared, the dam of national security will be destroyed and the wellbeing of all Hong Kong residents will be damaged,"" Luo said. 
""There's a need to put effort into maintaining the national security legal system and enforcement system as soon as possible.""
Previous attempts to draft a new national security law for Hong Kong, known as Article 23, were met with mass protests in 2003 and abandoned.
Hours after Luo spoke, China's State Council said it had removed Yang Jian from his post as vice-director of Hong Kong's Liaison Office, turning the spotlight on management changes among Beijing's top representatives in the city.
BROAD FREEDOMS
Hong Kong returned to Beijing in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that guarantees it broad freedoms not seen in mainland China, and its high degree of autonomy is widely seen as key to its prosperity as an international financial hub.
The Hong Kong Bar Association on Tuesday called on Beijing to exercise restraint in its comments on affairs in Hong Kong, warning that its views could be perceived as interference.
In a special report published on Tuesday, three of Hong Kong's top judges told Reuters that the independence of the city's judicial system is under assault from the Communist Party leadership in Beijing. The judiciary, they said, is in a fight for its survival.
Anti-government protests escalated in June last year and evolved into a broad pro-democracy campaign, with many activists also angry about what they see as Beijing's tightening grip over the city.
China denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.
While the coronavirus outbreak and social distancing restrictions aimed at stemming it have seen a lull in protests in the past few months, the unrest posed the biggest political challenge to Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Hong Kong's Secretary for Security John Lee, speaking at the same event as Luo, expressed concern over ""homegrown terrorism"" in the city, while police chief Chris Tang said violent protests would not be tolerated.

PARIS (Reuters) - A year on from the inferno that gutted Notre-Dame de Paris and stunned the world, the cathedral's great bell will ring out on Wednesday evening, as a mark of the building's resilience and that of the medics battling France's coronavirus epidemic.
The bourdon bell has sounded just once since April 15, 2019, when the blaze broke out that consumed the spire and the roof and, officials say, came within half an hour of burning the 850-year-old cathedral to the ground.
It will toll at 8 p.m. (1800 GMT), coinciding with the hour when Parisians applaud from their windows and balconies in tribute to the frontline staff risking their lives to treat COVID-19 patients. 
The outbreak has killed close to 16,000 in France.
""The restoration of Notre-Dame ... is a symbol of the resilience of our people, of their capacity to overcome hardships, and to recover,"" President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday.
He reiterated a promise to rebuild Notre-Dame within five years, though the works to ensure the cathedral is structurally sound are running months behind schedule, delayed first by winter storms and by now the pandemic.
""Our objective is to prepare the cathedral for mass on April 16, 2024,"" Jean-Louis Georgelin, the retired army general leading the restoration project, told Reuters. 
""Of course, that doesn't mean everything will be finished."" 
But the cathedral's southern belfry where the 13-tonne bell - cast in 1681 and the second biggest in France - is housed, is structurally undamaged.
It is traditionally rung for major religious celebrations, papal visits and presidential funerals, and has sounded once since the fire, in September, in a tribute to former president Jacques Chirac who died that month.
On Wednesday evening, two bellringers will set it in motion again. ""We will ring the Bourdon,"" Georgelin said.

Special forces in the western state of North Rhine-Westphalia made the arrests near the cities of Essen and Duesseldorf and raided properties in the area.
Prosecutors suspect the four men, with a fifth who has been in detention for the last year, of being in contact with leading members of Islamic State in Afghanistan and Syria and of receiving instructions from them.
""Targets for the attacks were supposed to be institutions of U.S forces in Germany or even individual people,"" said prosecutors in their statement.
""In particular, they planned a murder attack on one person who had made public comments that they viewed as being critical of Islam,"" the prosecutors added.
The prosecutors said they believed the suspects had already carried out surveillance of the targeted individual and were procuring weapons, ammunition and components for a bomb.
Prosecutors identified the suspects as Azizjon B., Muhammadali G., Farhodshoh K. and Sunatullokh K., in line with German privacy rules. The fifth man who is already in detention was identified as Ravsan B.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese city of Osaka has issued an urgent plea for citizens to donate plastic raincoats to hospitals running short of protective gear for staff treating coronavirus patients, with some doctors resorting to wearing garbage bags.
Japan last week imposed a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other areas, including Osaka, but the number of cases has continued rising to total around 8,200, with 166 deaths.
By Wednesday afternoon there were nearly 900 cases in Osaka city and the prefecture that surrounds it, making it the second hardest-hit after Tokyo, media said.
Desperately trying to bridge the gap in supplies of protective gowns for its hospitals, a notice on the Osaka city web site said any color and style of raincoat was acceptable, including ponchos, as long as they were meant for adults.
Ichiro Matsui, Osaka's mayor, told a gathering in the city on Tuesday that medical facilities were running dangerously short of all sorts of protective gear.
""Some people are even wearing garbage bags,"" he said.
""We ask anybody who has unused plastic raincoats in their house, or who might have a stockpile of them, to please get in touch.""
Japanese medical workers have been warning for weeks that the medical system could soon be pushed to the brink, with nurses telling Reuters they were unsure whether their hospitals had enough advanced personal protective equipment such as N95 masks and plastic gowns. Some in Tokyo said they had been told to reuse masks.
Health Minister Katsunobu Kato met with industry leaders last week, pressing them to ramp up production of masks and other key medical supplies.
Amid the shortage, social media users said they were starting to receive the reusable cloth face masks that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe pledged to send two weeks ago to every household in Japan, a plan widely ridiculed on social media.
Under the hashtag ""Two Masks"" - a reference to the number of masks being distributed to each household regardless of the number of residents - many Twitter users said they appeared too small for adults to use and were a waste of tax money when other things, such as subsidies, were needed.
Abe is under growing pressure to do more, including issuing a blanket payout to all citizens, as some other countries have done.
""Can you pay your rent with these? Or your water bill, or your electric bill?"" wrote a Twitter user with the handle ""Kayase.""
""Anybody pleased to be getting these masks must not have any other problems.""

The study comes as more than 2,200 people died in the United States from the outbreak on Tuesday, a record, according to a Reuters tally, even as the country debated how to reopen its economy. The overall death toll in the U.S. from the virus stands at more than 28,300 as of Tuesday.
""Intermittent distancing may be required into 2022 unless critical care capacity is increased substantially or a treatment or vaccine becomes available"", the Harvard researchers said in findings published Tuesday in the journal Science.
Giving examples of South Korea and Singapore, the researchers wrote that effective distancing could reduce the strain on healthcare systems and enable contact tracing and quarantine to be feasible.
The study acknowledged that prolonged distancing would most likely have profoundly negative economic, social, and educational consequences.
The study added that even in the case of ""apparent elimination"", SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should still be maintained, as a resurgence in contagion may be possible as late as 2024.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that infections had ""certainly"" not yet peaked. Nearly 2 million people globally have been infected and more than 124,000 have died in the most serious pandemic in a century. 
The epicenter has shifted from China, where the virus emerged in December, to the United States, which has now recorded the most deaths.

Lopez Obrador's approval rating dropped to 46.5% in a daily survey by pollster Mitofsky, versus about 80% early in his term, as the sheen wears off promises to tackle graft and prioritise the poor that brought him a landslide election win in 2018. 
""I am leaving the MORENA bench over differences of opinion,"" Lily Tellez, who represents the northern state of Sonora, said on Twitter. ""I am now a senator without a party."" 
A senate spokeswoman said Tellez was the first senator to leave MORENA, which Lopez Obrador created as opposition for Mexico's largest parties, including the long-ruling centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
MORENA was registered in 2014, and, along with its allies, took a majority in Congress when Lopez Obrador came to power. 
Tellez, a former news host on television channel TV Azteca, had previously survived an internal attempt to remove her from MORENA over concerns that she did not share party principles.
MORENA's senate leader, Ricardo Monreal, said he had defended her from the ouster, and was sorry to see her go.
""She has voluntarily decided, but we're staying firm, because this is a long fight,"" he said on Tuesday.
Morena and its allies still have comfortable majorities in both houses of congress. 
Late last month, Tellez lashed out on Twitter at Lopez Obrador after he shook hands with the elderly mother of convicted drug kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman in an encounter caught on video. 
""This handshake is an offense to the victims of narco-trafficking and to Mexico's armed forces,"" she said, calling the images hurtful and concerning. 
A poll from newspaper El Financiero showed support for MORENA, never as popular as Lopez Obrador himself, slipped to 18% in March from 33% in January.

The UN's Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the world truce on March 23, warning that in war-torn countries, health systems have collapsed and the small number of health professionals left were often targeted in the fighting.
Macron said President Xi Jinping of China, U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson had all confirmed to him they would back the plea.

A raid on the Canberra home of News Corp (NASDAQ:NWSA) editor Annika Smethurst last year, one of two Australian Federal Police (AFP) raids on the media within a week, caused a firestorm of criticism by the country's media chiefs, although law enforcement authorities said the searches were justified.
The Smethurst raid, which involved officers sifting through her clothes drawers, according to media reports, followed a Sunday Telegraph article that said intelligence agencies wanted to carry out surveillance by accessing people's emails, bank accounts and text messages.
After a legal challenge to the warrant's validity, a seven-judge bench of the country's highest court said the document should be quashed since it did not spell out the suspected offence ""with sufficient precision"" and misstated the relevant law.
However, the judges were split on whether the AFP should return a seized USB stick with information from her smartphone, with only three saying the law enforcement agency should do so.
The mixed ruling brought cautious support from press freedom advocates, who welcomed the hurdle to police seizing information given to a reporter in confidence. But they noted the technical grounds for the decision.
""The raid was an attack on the public's right to know what our governments do in our name,"" said Marcus Strom, federal president of the Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance, which represents journalists.
""The warrant has been quashed on a technicality, but the powers that enabled the raid remain,"" he added in a statement.
Peter Greste, an Australian journalist who has become a press freedom advocate after being imprisoned in Eygpt, said in a tweet that the High Court had given ""a technical ruling that said the AFP messed up writing the search warrant"".
""The court did not address press freedom issues. The judgment underscores once again the need for robust protection for press freedom in Australian law,"" Greste's tweet said.
The AFP said in a statement that it would consider and act in accordance with the High Court ruling but declined to comment further.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Koreans began going to the polls on Wednesday to elect members of parliament, wearing masks and plastic gloves as part of strict safety measures in one of the first national elections held amid the coronavirus pandemic. 
About 14,000 polling stations were open at 6 a.m. (0900 GMT) around the country after disinfection, and voters were required to wear a mask and have a temperature check upon arrival. Anyone whose temperature was higher than 37.5 Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) was led to a special booth. 
All voters must use hand sanitizer and plastic gloves when casting ballots and maintain 1 metre (40 inches) distance between each other. 
The election is set to decide control of parliament and shape President Moon Jae-in's ability to push through his agenda in the final two years of his administration, including looser fiscal policy aimed at creating jobs, raising the minimum wage, and continued re-engagement with North Korea.
Globally, South Korea was one of the first countries to hold a national election since the coronavirus epidemic began, while many others postponed votes. 
""I had worries as the election was not delayed, but having come here and seen for myself, I felt it's good we did vote as planned, and people are taking greater caution about distancing and restraining themselves even more,"" Choi Sun-hwa, 56, told Reuters outside a polling station in Hongje-dong, central Seoul. 
Once grappling with the first large outbreak outside China, South Korea has largely managed to bring its cases under control without major disruptions thanks to a massive testing campaign and intensive contact tracing.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 27 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday, bringing the total infections to 10,564. The daily tally has hovered around 30 over the past week, most of them from overseas travellers. 
But authorities have warned that infections could resurge at any times, calling for special caution on Election Day. 
As of 9 a.m. (1200 GMT), voter turnout was 8%, about 0.9% points higher than in the last parliamentary election in 2016, according to the National Election Commission. That excludes nearly 27% of the 44 million registered voters who took part in early voting last weekend. 
Among them were about 2,800 coronavirus patients, for whom the NEC allowed voting by mail and set up special polling stations for early voting.
More than 13,000 in self-quarantine have signed up to vote and will be allowed to do so after other voters leave at 6 p.m. (2100 GMT)

The election campaign has taken on a different look, with candidates wearing masks and bumping fists instead of pressing the flesh and mass rallies.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean court on Tuesday ratified a three-year prison sentence handed to Cristian Labbe, a former aide to dictator Augusto Pinochet, for torturing a detainee in 1973.
Labbe, 71, a far-right politician who served as mayor of a Santiago suburb until 2012, was convicted in September of torturing 26-year-old student Harry Cohen in a town in southern Chile in the early days of military rule.
The Temuco Court of Appeals in the south of the country rejected an appeal by Labbe against his conviction, and ordered the state to pay compensation of about $35,000 to the victim.
Labbe was among a number of former members of Pinochet’s notorious DINA secret police who were prosecuted under a drive during the presidency of Michelle Bachelet to bring more of those accused of human rights abuses during the dictatorship to trial.
During Pinochet's 1973-1990 rule, some 3,000 people died or were disappeared, while 28,000 were victims of torture, including Bachelet.

Trump, who is head of the G7 this year, had planned to hold this year's summit at the presidential retreat of Camp David, Maryland, in June, but moved it to a virtual setting due to the virus.
The Group of Seven nations consists of the United States, France, Britain, Italy, Canada, Japan and Germany, and all seven of them have been hit hard by the virus.
Trump spoke with French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday about the G7 teleconference and ""efforts to defeat the coronavirus pandemic and reopen world economies,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was released from a London hospital this week after treatment for the virus, which left him in the intensive care unit for several days.
""Working together, the G7 is taking a whole-of-society approach to tackle the crisis across multiple areas, including health, finance, humanitarian assistance, and science and technology,"" Deere said.
The Thursday session is a follow-up to a March 16 video conference, the first time G7 leaders had met in that format, to go over efforts to defeat the coronavirus.

Egypt has been fighting an Islamist insurgency in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula since the ouster of Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in 2013 following mass protests against his rule.
The military and police launched a major campaign against militant groups in 2018, focusing on the Sinai Peninsula as well as southern areas and the border with Libya.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Environment Minister Ricardo Salles has fired the country's top environmental enforcement officer, according to a government notice published on Tuesday, after a news program broadcast a dramatic raid on illegal mining in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest.
The move appears to be the latest attempt by the government of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro to defang the federal environment agency Ibama, which serves on the frontlines of Brazil's fight against deforestation. 
Fantastico, a news program on Brazil's largest broadcaster Globo, accompanied a team of agents from Ibama on raids against miners who were illegally working inside indigenous reservations. It aired on Sunday.
The program included an interview with a man who had illegally claimed land in an indigenous reserve, saying he expected the government to later legalize his ownership.
Four people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Salles fired Ibama's head of enforcement, Olivaldi Azevedo, in direct response to the broadcast, which was regarded as critical of the government.
Four other leaders of the enforcement team who reported to Olivaldi are also expected to be fired or resign following his departure, according to one of the sources, who did not wish to give their names as they were not authorized to speak to the media.
Destruction of the Amazon has spiked since Bolsonaro entered office last year, with environmentalists blaming his calls to develop the rainforest for encouraging miners and loggers. 
Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon is up 51% in the first three months of the year, compared to the same period a year ago, according to government data.
One of the sources said tensions had been building since last year between Salles and Azevedo, as the minister had been pushing for staffing changes on the enforcement team but Azevedo had refused. 
""There had been friction for some time,"" the person said. ""There was pressure to change the enforcement team.""
Salles, Azevedo and Ibama did not respond to request for comment. A representative of the Environment Ministry confirmed the firing but did not comment beyond what was contained in the brief notice in the government gazette on Tuesday.
Reuters previously reported the Bolsonaro government's efforts to restrict the resources and enforcement powers of Ibama, including moves to intimidate those who do not comply.
Bolsonaro hand-picked Salles to head the Environment Ministry that oversees Ibama.
The broadcast also included images of agents burning mining equipment. Last year, Bolsonaro denounced such practices, saying agents should not be instructed to destroy machinery.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump announced a loan program on Tuesday with the aim of making as many as 60,000 ventilators available to help coronavirus patients.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic erupted, the need for ventilators has skyrocketed to aid patients struggling to breathe. Trump and his coronavirus task force have fought to find enough of the machines to help people survive.
Trump met healthcare executives to discuss what the White House called the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve plan.
It is a public-private partnership in which major healthcare systems will agree to supply unused ventilators to make sure there is a steady supply of the machines in virus hot spots, the official said.
""We're preparing ventilator capacity for any and all scenarios. Initiatives like the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve will help us to achieve that goal. We need ventilators but now we're pretty well stocked,"" he said.
Trump said private industry will produce more than 32,000 ventilators by the end of May and 150,000 by the end of the year. The United States might be able to help appeals for the machines from Italy, France and Spain, he said.
The White House found that as many as 60,000 ventilators in hospitals across the country were not being used and contacted the American Hospital Association and major healthcare suppliers to come up with a lending program ""so that those that are not in use can be moved over to hospitals when they need them,"" a senior administration official said.
In order to gain access to the supply, a healthcare provider must agree to donate ventilators when a hospital in a hot zone needs them, the official said.
The official said 20 health systems have already agreed to participate and under the program at this point 4,000 ventilators will be made available.
Representatives from the American Hospital Association and a variety of healthcare company chief executives were on hand for the White House event.

""President Trump worked with governors to make sure that every American who needed a ventilator received a ventilator, and this historic public-private program ensures that will continue to be the case,"" said White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, one of the architects of the plan.

Tara Reade, who worked briefly as a staff assistant in Biden's Senate office from December 1992 to August 1993, told the New York Times, the Washington Post and other news outlets that Biden pinned her against a wall in 1993 and reached under her shirt and her skirt.
A campaign spokeswoman for Biden, the former vice president, said in a statement on Tuesday that the accusation was false.
""He firmly believes that women have a right to be heard – and heard respectfully,"" the spokeswoman, Kate Bedingfield, said. ""Such claims should also be diligently reviewed by an independent press. What is clear about this claim: It is untrue. This absolutely did not happen.""
Reuters was unable to reach Reade or a representative for comment on Tuesday or to identify a lawyer representing her. 
Reade filed a police report in Washington, D.C., last week about the accusation, according to news reports, although the statute of limitations for prosecution has expired.
In response to a request from Reuters citing the reported incident number, the city's police department released a one-page document that did not include Reade's name and said only that ""Subject-1"" reported on April 9 that ""Subject-2"" sexually assaulted her in 1993. Reade told NBC News she was ""Subject-1"" and Biden was ""Subject-2.""
Several outlets that have published Reade's account in recent days, including the Times and the Post, interviewed a friend who said Reade told her about the alleged assault at the time. Another friend told the Times that Reade told her in 2008 about a previous traumatic incident involving Biden. Reade's brother also confirmed parts of Reade's account to The Intercept and the Post.
The newspapers interviewed numerous people who worked in the office with Reade and had no recollection of any such incident or similar behavior on Biden's part.
Reade, 56, was one of eight women who last year came forward to say Biden had hugged, kissed or touched them in ways that made them uncomfortable, though none accused him of sexual assault. She publicly accused him of the assault on a podcast in March.
At the time of the women's statements last year about behavior that made them uncomfortable, Biden, who had yet to launch his presidential bid, released a video promising to be ""much more mindful"" of people's personal space.
Biden, 77, is preparing to challenge Republican President Donald Trump, 73, in the Nov. 3 presidential election.
Trump has faced accusations of sexual assault and misconduct from more than a dozen women. He denies them all.
Reade told reporters she complained about harassment, though not sexual assault, at the time to three of Biden's Senate aides. The Biden campaign released a statement from one, Marianne Baker, who said she never received any report of inappropriate behavior in nearly 20 years of working for Biden.

The Post and Times interviewed the other two aides, both of whom said they had no recollection of Reade's complaint.

(Reuters) - As coronavirus infections exploded in New Orleans, state and local officials repeatedly told the Trump administration that its new drive-through testing effort wasn’t going well. Those tested often waited more than a week for results, and local officials had no information on who had been notified by a federally contracted call center, according to emails between local and federal officials reviewed by Reuters.
As deaths mounted, local officials requested details on the notifications as they increasingly fielded calls by those left in limbo - including health workers. But Washington officials largely brushed off their concerns, according to the correspondence, which has not been previously reported.
Frustrated city officials started their own operation to notify people after the state began receiving test results on March 26, nearly a week after testing started. One big problem: The lab initially sent many results with no phone numbers to reach those tested.
The delays and confusion created new problems for local officials managing the crisis in one of America’s emerging hot spots. As of Tuesday, Louisiana had more than 21,500 confirmed cases, including more than 1,000 deaths. Timely test results are crucial to containing the virus and enabling essential workers such as doctors and nurses to stay safely on the front lines. The problems in New Orleans underscore the challenges the Trump administration faces in ramping up testing nationwide in hopes of reopening the U.S. economy.
On March 25, city health director Jennifer Avegno sent one of the many requests for information to federal officials.
“We are receiving many calls today from citizens who went through the drive through testing in the earliest days and have not gotten a call,” she wrote. “Can you update us on how many results have been received, turnaround times, and how many individuals have been contacted?”
Kristina Harder, an official at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) who was working with the federal call center, did not address the information request and instead suggested telling people to be patient. “The call center should be contacting those folks who were at your sites in the beginning days,” she wrote. “I hope this is helpful!”
Harder did not respond to a request for comment.
A day later, Avegno forwarded a doctor’s plea to the Trump administration’s new testing czar, Brett Giroir, and other federal officials. “I’m just looking to get my results,” the surgical resident at Tulane University had written.
HHS never provided an accounting of who the call center had notified, city and state officials told Reuters.
In a statement, HHS called the drive-through sites “a profound success” with more than 77,000 people tested nationwide. HHS didn’t address specific questions about problems with the operation in Louisiana or elsewhere. The agency said delays in getting results and notifying patients were resolved and results were now being given within three to five days.
Lisa Miles, a spokeswoman for the company running the federal call center - Maximus Inc. - declined to comment and referred questions to HHS.
In interviews, Louisiana officials said they welcomed the federal testing program despite the problems. About 13,000 people were eventually tested over a three-week period.
“Even though there are issues with the processing, it has significantly contributed to our ability to understand and map this disease,” Avegno said.
A QUESTION OF PRIORITIES
In mid-March, President Donald Trump tapped Giroir, an HHS assistant secretary, to oversee testing nationwide, including the initiative for drive-through operations that would expand to more than 40 sites, including three in the New Orleans area. U.S. officials were eager to show progress after widespread problems with a defective government test kit that delivered inconclusive results, hindering the public-health response for weeks.
On March 14, federal officials reached out to Louisiana leaders about hosting testing sites, records show. Two days later, a top Louisiana health official questioned whether drive-through centers were a wise use of scarce testing supplies and protective gear. Alexander Billioux, a Louisiana Department of Health assistant secretary, emailed Giroir and suggested the limited supply of test swabs might be better used at hospital labs that were prioritizing tests for health workers, hospitalized patients and nursing home residents. A drive-through wouldn’t help those people, he told Giroir. He also asked for an estimated wait time for results.
Giroir wrote back that he expected a 48-hour turnaround time but said he made no guarantees.
On March 20, the first two drive-through sites opened in the New Orleans area. The people tested were told their results should be available in three to five days and advised to call the state health department if they didn’t hear from the federal call center within a week.
On March 23, Joseph Kanter, an assistant state health officer and emergency physician, asked how the call center would share notification details with state authorities in an email to Erica Schwartz, the U.S. deputy surgeon general who served as the ordering physician for drive-through tests.
“We will need to know which patients remain without knowledge of their results,” Kanter wrote.
Schwartz replied that “the call center will not communicate to the state or local health department,” without explaining why. She recommended that the state “go through their normal processes to contact patients with positive results,” a statement that confused state and local officials - who at the time had no test results and had been instructed that the call center would handle all notifications.
Schwartz did not respond to a request for comment.
MISSING PHONE NUMBERS
On March 26, Billioux emailed Harder at HHS about the high volume of people calling the state for results. He asked for a phone number that people could use to reach someone at the federal level or at Laboratory Corporation of America (NYSE:LH) Holdings, or LabCorp, the company processing the New Orleans tests.
A few hours later, LabCorp sent state officials their first batch of results - but with no corresponding phone numbers for many of those tested, according to the email from Billioux to Harder. Harder replied that she would notify LabCorp and noted “a similar problem receiving partial data in the beginning days.”
That’s when the state transferred the testing data to the city, which on March 28 assigned eight people to field calls and reach out to those tested, which included efforts to track down the people whose information arrived with no phone numbers. As of Monday, the city health department said it still awaited results from LabCorp on about 1,000 tests, some of which have been pending for as long as 10 days.
LabCorp spokesman Mike Geller said the company has faced unprecedented demand during the pandemic but now targets delivering results in four to five days. “We understand how disconcerting it is to not receive test results in a reasonable time frame,” he said.
Avegno told Reuters that relying on the federal call center was untenable. “We were getting flooded with calls from residents, and we had nothing to tell them,” she said. “It’s important to have a local point of reference ... residents want to hear from someone to walk them through a positive or negative test.”
Last week, the Trump administration said it was encouraging state and local officials to take over many of the drive-through sites. Some local officials expressed concern about losing federal funding and testing supplies. At a White House press briefing on Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence said the administration would continue to partner with states “to the extent that they prefer us to be part of it.”
Valerie Arkoosh, chair of the Montgomery County commission outside Philadelphia, said she was surprised by the federal announcement and reached out to Giroir and Schwartz to secure an extension of federal funding until May 30. Arkoosh said her testing site also had trouble getting information from the federal call center and that she’s awaiting results from LabCorp on more than 400 tests.
“They were both supportive and helpful,” Arkoosh said of Giroir and Schwartz. “But we are pretty busy here, so it would have been great not to go through all that.”
Louisiana officials said they are looking into moving drive-through operations to other areas of the state that have less access to testing.

“Everything with COVID-19 has been difficult. I don't necessarily put the fault on anybody's lap,” Billioux said. “The most important thing from our perspective is that we have more and more testing on the ground.”

1586,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 03:40PM ET</span>",EU to limit export control of virus protection gear to just masks,"BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission plans to narrow controls on the export of coronavirus protective equipment to just a single product - masks - as well as exempt the countries of the western Balkans from the restrictions.
The EU executive, which overseas trade policy for the 27 EU member states, set out a draft regulation on Tuesday to apply for 30 days from April 26. The adjustments were designed to meet the EU's global commitments in tackling the COVID-19 pandemic.
The bloc's current restrictions apply to protective spectacles and visors, face shields, protective garments, gloves, as well as mouth and nose masks.
These products can only be exported to a non-EU country with an authorization granted by individual EU countries. The restrictions were due to run from March 15 to April 25.
The restrictions came in after a number of countries, including France and Germany, introduced their own export controls, angering fellow members such as Italy that were most in need of such equipment. The EU-wide controls on exports outside the European Union have largely restored flows of protective equipment within the bloc.
Some EU countries have nevertheless maintained export bans on certain medicines. 
The EFTA nations - Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland - as well as various overseas countries and territories were subsequently exempted from the controls.
The European Commission said this exemption would now extend to the western Balkan countries - Albania, Bosnia, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Kosovo.
EU countries should also authorize exports of masks in the form of emergency humanitarian aid, it said.
The controls would only in future apply for masks as these were the only category of protective equipment for which export authorization was deemed necessary to secure an adequate supply for Europeans.
The Commission said its new law would oblige EU countries to consult with it when assessing whether to issue an export authorization. The Commission would issue an opinion within 48 hours. 

EU countries will be required to report to the Commission on authorizations granted with a view to coordinating efforts to match supply and demand in the European Union.

Gilberto Aparecido dos Santos, aka ""Fuminho,"" had been on the run for more than 20 years until his capture in Maputo on Monday, and was one of Brazil's ""most-wanted"" fugitives, Brazil's federal police said in a statement. 
""The prisoner was considered the largest supplier of cocaine to a gang operating throughout Brazil, as well as being responsible for sending tonnes of the drug to several countries,"" the statement said. 
His capture in Africa is a sign of the PCC's growing international network. Originally formed as a prison gang in Sao Paulo, the PCC has become Brazil's largest criminal organization and is increasingly moving cocaine overseas, especially to Europe and Africa. 
In March, Reuters reported that Brazil has become one of the top suppliers of cocaine to Europe, transforming the country's role in the trans-Atlantic drug trade.
In its statement, Brazil's federal police said the operation to catch dos Santos also involved the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Department of Justice and the Mozambique police. 
The federal police also accused dos Santos of allegedly financing a rescue plan for PCC boss Marcos Willians Camacho, or ""Marcola,"" who is in a federal jail in Brasilia. The alleged plan prompted Brazilian authorities to heighten security at the jail in February, the statement said. 
Local media has reported that dos Santos was Camacho's ""right-hand man.""

1588,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 02:20PM ET</span>",Pakistan clerics call for lifting of congregational prayer limits,"By Syed Raza Hassan
KARACHI, Pakistan (Reuters) - Prominent clerics are demanding the lifting of restrictions on congregational prayers at mosques in Pakistan, which has recorded 5,837 coronavirus cases and 96 related deaths.
Tuesday's call in a joint statement by clerics and leaders of religious parties in the world's second largest Muslim country, said prayers were essential for Muslims and should be allowed as long as safety measures were observed.
Their demand came despite Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan saying he would meet religious scholars to discuss the restrictions on congregational prayers which were imposed last month and imposed a limit of five people gathering together.
""Restriction of three or five people at mosques is not proving practical, those who are sick, elderly should not come to mosques,"" Mufti Taqi Usmani, one of the top clerics in Pakistan, told a media briefing in Karachi. 
The congregation restriction has provoked a backlash in Pakistan, with attacks on police for a second straight week last Friday as they attempted to halt prayers at a mosque in Karachi
A policewoman was injured and in the earlier clashes police fired shots in the air to disperse demonstrators.
Khan announced a 14-day extension of a national lockdown on Tuesday, but said the government would make selective exemptions for essential industries to curtail rising unemployment.
Health experts have warned that congregations pose the biggest threat to Pakistan's limited healthcare resources and infrastructure, which will crumble under the weight of a wide-spread outbreak of the coronavirus.
Usmani told the news briefing that carpets should be removed from mosques and floors should be wiped with disinfectants, sanitizers should be placed at the entrance of the mosques, and that people should maintain distance while offering prayers.
The clerics issued their statement despite an assurance from Khan that he would meet with religious scholars to work out a collective strategy for congregations with the advent of the holy month of Ramadan, when mosque attendance usually spikes.
""Now, the lockdown will not be applicable on mosques, Friday and Ramadan prayers will be held at mosques,"" Mufti Muneeb-ur-Rehman, another cleric, told reporters on Tuesday.
Ramadan involves extra nighttime prayers for Muslims.

1589,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 02:00PM ET</span>",Turkey repeats working group offer to U.S. to solve row over Russian defense purchase,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Turkey on Tuesday repeated an offer to the United States to establish a technical working group including NATO to help solve a dispute over Ankara's purchase of Russian missile defenses that angered Washington.
Ties between the NATO allies were badly strained last year when Turkey bought Russian S-400 defense systems, prompting Washington to threaten sanctions and to suspend Turkish involvement in its F-35 jet program.
The United States says the S-400s are not compatible with NATO systems and threaten the stealth capabilities of its  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-35 jets. Turkey rejects this and says the S-400s will not be integrated into the alliance's defenses.
Before the outbreak of the coronavirus shifted focused away from the issue, Ankara's bilateral ties with Moscow took a heavy blow over Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's military offensive on northwestern Syrian town of Idlib.
In early March as fighting between Syrian government forces and the Turkish military and allied Syrian rebels intensified, Ankara sought help from the United States to give it ammunition as well as humanitarian assistance for hundreds of thousands of civilians fleeing the battle.
Since then, both Turkey and the United States have largely kept silent on the S-400 issue. Turkey had previously said it would make the Russian missile defense systems operational in April but so far there has been no sign of such a move.
Speaking at a virtual Atlantic Council event, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Turkey's stance on how to solve the issue had not changed.
""We offer the U.S. to establish a technical working group with NATO's inclusion and NATO can lead this technical working group actually. And this offer is still on the table,"" he said.
He also added that Turkey was still willing to purchase Patriot batteries if it had a good offer. Washington has repeatedly said it was unwilling to provide Patriots to Turkey unless it returned the S-400s.

Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan visited Washington last November and met with U.S. President Donald Trump and agreed him with about setting up a working group but the effort made little progress.

1590,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 01:40PM ET</span>",Turkish minister's resignation exposes tensions in Erdogan's AKP,"ANKARA (Reuters) - The political fallout from Turkey's rushed coronavirus lockdown at the weekend has exposed tensions at the top of President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party after he rejected the resignation of his interior minister.
Suleyman Soylu submitted his resignation on Sunday after authorities gave just two hours' notice for a 48-hour curfew in Turkey's main cities, causing chaotic scenes as crowds of people rushed to the shops to stock up on supplies.
His resignation statement prompted a wave of support on social media for Soylu, who is known for his hawkish stance on security and is popular with party supporters, and Erdogan swiftly announced that the minister would stay in place.
As a prominent member of Erdogan's cabinet, Soylu is seen by some party members as a potential rival to the president's influential son-in-law, Finance Minister Berat Albayrak, and view the weekend events through that prism.
""It is no secret now that there has been a struggle and some issues between Albayrak and Soylu for some time,"" one AK Party official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
""Soylu's ... resignation was an explosion from all this build-up.""
By offering to take individual blame - even though the lockdown was approved by Erdogan - and then winning a public endorsement from the president, Soylu has strengthened his own position, the official said.
The government has played down suggestions of division.
""Our president has rejected our interior minister's resignation ... Nobody can axe our unity and solidarity,"" presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said on Monday.
PURGE
Since being appointed interior minister four years ago, Soylu, 50, has led a crackdown in which tens of thousands of people have been detained on suspicion of links to a network accused of being behind a failed 2016 military coup.
The purge alarmed Turkey's Western allies and rights groups who say it was indiscriminate and disproportionate. Ankara says it was a necessary response to security challenges it faced domestically and from across its borders with Syria and Iraq. 
""Soylu's relentless work and success in the battle against terrorism has been recognised by the people, the support base and the party,"" the AK Party official said.
""No matter what anyone says, he has power and that power was really consolidated with the resignation issue.""
Losing Soylu would have dealt a blow to the AK Party, said a second party official.
""Soylu is one of the important centres of power within the party... The battle for power within the party has changed as of Sunday. But these have started becoming damaging images for the AK Party,"" the official said.
The Islamist-rooted AK Party, which has ruled Turkey since 2002, has seen two of its founder members break away in the past year to establish rival parties, and any internal party dissent would pose an additional challenge to Erdogan.
Erdogan was re-elected president in 2018, under a new executive presidency which granted him sweeping powers, but his party suffered defeat last year in municipal elections in the country's two largest cities, Istanbul and Ankara.

New presidential and parliamentary elections are not scheduled until 2023.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The leaders of Irish rival parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael agreed on Tuesday to govern together for the first time if they can get additional support to form a coalition two months after an election since overshadowed by the coronavirus crisis.
Fierce rivals on the centre-right, the two dominant parties have swapped power throughout the nation's history since emerging from opposing sides of Ireland's 1920s civil war but their combined support has diminished in recent years 
No longer able to command a majority together, they need the support of at least one smaller party or eight independent lawmakers to control the fractured 160-seat parliament.
The two parties said in identical short statements that the leaders had agreed the framework document and would brief their respective parties on Wednesday.
In an internal email to Fine Gael lawmakers seen by Reuters, party chairman Martin Heydon said the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to forming a majority government of three or more parties with ""an equal partnership between Fine Gael and Fianna Fail at its centre.""
Leo Varadkar's caretaker government has imposed a series of restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus but no new legislation can be passed until a new government is formed and selects the remaining members of the upper house of parliament. 
The parties negotiating teams struck the broad agreement on Monday after a month of on-off talks. It includes the need for a national economic recovery plan to overcome the coronavirus lockdown of the country, a source familiar with its contents told Reuters. [L5N2C12W8]
Both parties refuse to govern with the left-wing, pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein party, which surged to 37 seats in the February election, the same number held by Fianna Fail and two more than Fine Gael's 35.
That leaves the Green Party, which has 12 seats, and the centre-left Labour and Social Democrat parties, with six seats each, as the only viable partners. All three have so far shown little enthusiasm to join such a coalition.
A number of the 20 independents in parliament - many of whom are ex-Fine Gael and Fianna Fail members - are willing to join and would likely number enough to reach a majority. 
However, senior Fine Gael members, including Varadkar and his acting finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, have suggested the participation of a third party could be a precondition of Fine Gael continuing in office.
""It will be odd,"" Acting Employment Affairs Minister Regina Doherty of Fine Gael told national broadcaster RTE when asked about the prospect of sharing power with their bitter rival.

""But what I know about Irish people is we tend to set aside our differences when there's a bigger issue at hand.""

Retired captain Tom Moore, who has used a walker to move around since breaking his hip, said he was grateful to the National Health Service (NHS) for the treatment he received in the past and wanted to do something in return.
Britain's state-funded NHS is under severe strain as it treats large numbers of people suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.
The death toll from COVID-19 in British hospitals reached 11,329 on Monday, the fifth highest globally.
Medics have been widely praised for their bravery and professionalism during the crisis, including by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who recovered from the virus after being treated by the NHS in a London hospital.
""The more it (money) comes in the better, because when I was in hospital with my hip and then with my head, the service I got ... was absolutely unbelievable,"" Moore said, as the tally from his fundraising campaign kept rising. (https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/tomswalkforthenhs)
""At all times they were so good, so cheerful, so friendly.""
Pointing to the campaign medals pinned to his jacket, he added: ""Fortune favours the brave, and that's what they are, they're brave.""
The veteran, who served in Asia during World War Two, had a message of hope for his compatriots.
""That's the way I think I've always looked at things: tomorrow will be a good day,"" he said.
Moore, who turns 100 on April 30, had hoped to raise 500,000 pounds, but has more than quadrupled that, and he intends to carry on.

""I shall continue up and down here after my birthday. I'll keep on going whilst people are still contributing to the National Health Service.""

1593,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 11:18AM ET</span>",Mexico president challenges critics to vote him out early,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Tuesday offered to bring forward a referendum on his presidency to June 2021 from 2022 as he sought to silence mounting criticism from businesses and the opposition of his record in power.
In recent days, critics of Lopez Obrador's management of the economy, his security record and handling of the coronavirus pandemic have urged voters to take advantage of a so-called recall referendum on his presidency in 2022 to vote him out.
Lopez Obrador, who won election by a landslide in 2018, proposed the referendum and initially wanted to hold it on the same day as mid-term legislative elections due in June 2021.
However, the opposition balked at that and managed to force him to move the planned vote into the spring of 2022. Now that the president's popularity has fallen sharply, critics have seized on the referendum as a means of kicking him out early.
Never shy of scrapping with his adversaries, the leftist Lopez Obrador challenged them to put their grievances to the public by moving the recall vote to when he first proposed it.
""I'm offering them to bring forward the date. That we don't wait until 2022 for the recall vote, that we take advantage of the (mid-term) elections by holding it the same day,"" he told reporters at a regular government news conference.
Lopez Obrador, 66, took office in December 2018 with his approval ratings as high as 80% in some polls. But his popularity has tumbled in recent months and a daily survey by polling firm Mitofsky now puts his approval rating at 46.5%.
Mexico slipped into a mild recession last year, dragged down by a slump in investment precipitated in particular by concerns about the president's readiness to allow major contracts signed under the previous government to be called into question.

And despite Lopez Obrador's pledge to reduce record levels of gang-fuelled violence plaguing the country, homicides crept up to new highs in 2019.

IDLIB, Syria (Reuters) - A single machine at Mohamad Shahim Makki's medical centre in Idlib province, part of Syria's last rebel stronghold, is the only alarm that will sound when the coronavirus strikes a population of millions of the world's most vulnerable people.
Makki's Epidemiological Surveillance Laboratory has the only device in areas outside of Syrian government control equipped to run a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect the virus. 
As of a few days ago, just 120 tests had been carried out on just 300 samples.
While all have been negative so far, doctors and relief agencies fear that crowded camps for displaced people, and medical facilities ravaged by years of war, would make any contagion rapid and lethal.
Samples have begun to come into the lab faster, with 5,000 received in the last two days, though it is not yet clear how many of them can be processed or how quickly.
The machine ""is not sufficient to serve all these people, so there is pressure on the device. And since it is the only one, strict criteria are being used to select samples,"" said Makki. 
Northwest Syria is the last part of the country still held by fighters trying to overthrow president Bashar al-Assad. It is home to more than 3 million people, most of whom fled other parts of Syria in a civil war that began nine years ago.
""If corona spreads in the northwest it will be a catastrophe. The number of deaths will be very big and infections will be huge, in the hundreds of thousands,"" Ahmad al-Dbis of the U.S.-based medical charity UOSSM, which operates in opposition territory, told Reuters last month.
Plans to equip other centres with PCR test devices have been slowed by their high cost and the training needed to run them.
""In the liberated areas we have major weaknesses in the health sector because of the war and because of the systematic targeting of hospitals and health centres,"" said Makki.
The government, backed by Russia and Iran, launched a push earlier this year to capture Idlib, sending hundreds of thousands of residents fleeing, many of them people who were already displaced.
In recent days thousands of Syrians have begun to leave camps near the Turkish border, some wary of the virus reaching tightly packed quarters, choosing instead to return to Idlib after a ceasefire struck last month that has restored calm.

In the rest of Syria, Damascus has reported 25 coronavirus cases and two deaths in government-held areas. It has shut businesses, halted flights, and imposed a curfew to curb the spread of the virus.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The Hong Kong Bar Association on Tuesday called on Beijing to ""exercise restraint"" in its comments regarding affairs in the Chinese-ruled city, warning that its views could be perceived as interference in the global financial hub. 
The association, which represents around 1,500 barristers in the former British colony, made the statement a day after the Liaison Office, Beijing's top representative office in Hong Kong, welcomed an appeal court ruling that upheld the constitutionality of the city's colonial-era Emergency Regulations Ordinance.
During the height of anti-government protests in October, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years, allowing her to enact a new regulation banning face masks. 
The appeal court said last week that while a blanket government ban on face masks was unconstitutional, it had the right to bar them at unlawful assemblies.
The barristers also highlighted a statement by Beijing on Monday warning that pro-democracy lawmakers who filibuster meetings in Hong Kong's Legislative Council could be guilty of misconduct in public office. 
In a special report published on Tuesday, three of Hong Kong's top judges told Reuters that the independence of the city's judicial system is under assault from the Communist Party leadership in Beijing. The judiciary, they said, is in a fight for its survival.
The Bar Association said comments by the State Council's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office (HKMAO) and Liaison Office that touch on affairs administered by the territory's Basic Law, or mini-constitution, ""could easily be perceived as interference in contravention of the principle of one country, two systems.""
Hong Kong returned to Beijing in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula that grants it British-style rule of law until 2047, and its high degree of autonomy is widely seen as key to its prosperity as an international financial hub.
Protests that escalated in June last year grew increasingly intense, powered by a broad perception that Beijing is meddling improperly in Hong Kong's affairs and by complaints of police brutality. 
Beijing denies interference in the city's affairs and the police said they exercised restraint amid increasing violence. 
Democrats slammed the comments by the HKMAO and Liaison Office, ratcheting up a war of words. 

Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday evening, leader Carrie Lam rejected claims that Beijing had interfered in the city's affairs and said it was normal for the central government to ""express its concerns"".

Malta's Foreign Minister Evarist Bartolo has written to the EU's external relations representative Josep Borrell warning that the situation is becoming unsustainable, days after the Mediterranean island closed its ports to migrant boats.
""Migrant detention camps are overflowing, and according to a number of credible reports, thousands of migrants are either escaping from, or being allowed to leave these camps,"" he said in a televised address on Tuesday.
""In this horrific context, there are all the ingredients for a major humanitarian disaster waiting to happen, as desperate people look to the Mediterranean Sea as their only escape.""
Both Italy and Malta, the two EU countries at the frontline of the migrant crisis from North Africa, closed off their ports to new arrivals last week saying the coronavirus pandemic made it impossible to deal with them safely.
However, there has been concern that unrest in Libya, combined with the dire conditions in its detention centres, could push many refugees to attempt the dangerous sea voyage.
The most recent figures from UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency, show Italy has seen 3,229 arrivals this year, while 1,135 have arrived in Malta.
Bartolo said Malta was calling for an EU package of at least 100 million euros in food, aid, medical supplies and equipment.
""Alleviating or at least minimising the difficult circumstances that migrants are living in will be an incentive for them to stay, rather than risk their lives in the Mediterranean Sea at a time of crisis, and with very limited rescue options,"" he said.

Mnangagwa, who was speaking at his farm after touring Gweru city in central Zimbabwe, told state broadcaster ZBC the statement, which circulated on social media last week and was immediately denied by the government, was fake.
""That is absolutely nonsense, I have never made such a statement,"" Mnangagwa said.
""If we catch this person it must be exemplary and they must go in for at least at level 14, which is 20 years imprisonment. That, I think we need to demonstrate that we don't want false news to be circulated.""
The southern African nation last month published lockdown regulations, which included jail terms of up to 20 years for people who spread falsehoods regarding the outbreak. 
National police spokesman Paul Nyathi said more than 5,000 people had been arrested for venturing outside their homes without permission. 
Mnangagwa said his cabinet would meet this week to decide whether to end, adjust or extend the 21-day lockdown.
The authorities have said three people have died and 17 people have been infected in the country of 15 million people. Just over 600 people had been tested by Monday night.
In the past week, Zimbabwe has deployed the army to help the police enforce the restrictions. 
The Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) group said this had resulted in an increase in cases of residents being beaten by security forces for defying the lockdown.
Police spokesman Nyathi said police had not received any official complains of abuse from residents.
ZLHR has approached the High Court on behalf of two Zimbabweans who said they were abused by security forces. 
""This application seeks an order to protect residents from heavy-handed action by police and soldiers who are invading peoples homes/yards and assaulting people ordering them to stay indoors,"" ZLHR said in a statement.
Zimbabwe's security forces have a history of using heavy handed tactics when enforcing the law and against opponents of the government.
In an editorial on Monday, the state-owned Herald newspaper criticised the police for harassing journalists doing their work during the lockdown, including forcing some to delete pictures and video that captured abuses by security forces.

Nyathi said he was not aware of the incidents.

1598,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 07:38AM ET</span>",Special Report: Hong Kong judges battle Beijing over rule of law as pandemic chills protests,"By Greg Torode and James Pomfret
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The independence of Hong Kong's judicial system is under assault from the Communist Party leadership in Beijing, senior judges in the city told Reuters, posing the gravest threat to the rule of law since Britain handed its former colony back to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
Even as the novel coronavirus has brought the protests in Hong Kong to a near standstill, the struggle rages on over the future of China's freest city. Three of Hong Kong's most senior judges told Reuters that the independent judiciary, the cornerstone of the city's broad freedoms, is in a fight for its survival.
Beijing's effort to hobble the judiciary is multi-pronged, according to more than two dozen interviews with judges, leading lawyers and diplomats in Hong Kong. The state-controlled press on the mainland has warned Hong Kong judges not to ""absolve"" protesters arrested during last year's demonstrations. 
Judges and lawyers say there are signs Beijing is trying to limit the authority of Hong Kong courts to rule on core constitutional matters. And people close to the city's top judge, Geoffrey Ma, say he has to contend with Communist Party officials pushing Beijing's view that the rule of law ultimately must be a tool to preserve one-party rule.
That tension flared into view last September when Ma spoke at the International Bar Association conference in Seoul about the rule of law, including the extensive human rights protections built into Hong Kong's legal system. Judges must not be influenced by ""extraneous factors such as politics,"" Hong Kong's chief justice said.
As Ma finished, said three witnesses, a representative from AllBright Law Offices, a leading mainland Chinese legal firm that co-sponsored the lunch event, rushed to the podium to object to what he said was a ""political"" speech by the chief justice. Amid gasps and snorts of derision, the man was escorted from the microphone, the witnesses said. AllBright did not respond to questions.
Some in the city's legal establishment are now bracing for the possibility that China will begin to meddle in the appointment of new judges, following objections by some pro-Beijing lawmakers in Hong Kong to two recent appointments on the top court. With the search currently underway for at least one new justice for the top court, the three judges who spoke to Reuters said they feared vacancies could create an opening for Beijing.
Any intervention in the selection process, said one of the justices, would likely spark resignations on the bench. 
""We're worried that they are losing patience, and will find ways of tightening the screws,"" the judge said, referring to the Beijing leadership. 
""We know from our interactions with senior mainland judges that they just don't get Hong Kong at all,"" said the justice, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""They always want to know why Hong Kong is so confused and chaotic, and not 'patriotic.'""
A spokesman for Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam said the central government in Beijing had ""time and again made it clear"" that it would continue to fully implement the ""one country, two systems"" principle guiding Hong Kong's autonomous relationship with its Chinese sovereign. Beijing, he added, was committed to the Basic Law, the city's mini-constitution that protects its rights and freedoms.
The Chinese authorities did not respond to questions from Reuters.
MASS PROTESTS
Deepening concern over Beijing's meddling in the affairs of Hong Kong fueled the mass protests that erupted last year. The unrest was set off by a perceived assault on the judicial system: The city's government proposed a bill that would have allowed for the extradition of defendants to mainland China, where the courts are tightly controlled by the Communist Party. 
The government ultimately withdrew the bill as the protests mushroomed, but by then opposition to the legislation had escalated into a broad movement for greater democracy.
The demonstrators have occasionally focused their anger on the courts, which are handling the cases of thousands of protesters who face criminal charges. Late last year, some demonstrators lobbed petrol bombs outside the entrance to the Court of Final Appeal and the High Court building.
A Reuters poll in March showed that even with the protests dying down amid the pandemic, support for the demands of pro-democracy protesters has grown. Backing for universal suffrage in Hong Kong, for instance, rose to 68% from 60% in December. Support for the protests remained strong, at 58% compared with 59% previously.
Beijing denies intervening in the running of Hong Kong. It has blamed ""Western forces"" for spurring unrest in the city. Still, many residents fear that the ""one country, two systems"" formula, agreed when the city was handed over to China by Britain in 1997, is being further eroded.
Responding to questions from Reuters, a judiciary spokeswoman said Ma ""would not offer any comment.""
The judiciary is now at the heart of the battle over Hong Kong's autonomy. These conflicts are playing out largely behind the scenes in the rarefied atmosphere of the city's judicial corridors. 
With their horse-hair wigs and ceremonial robes, Hong Kong's judges symbolize one of the core promises of the handover: the right to a fair trial and equality under the law, all administered by an independent judiciary.
Such rights, a British legacy, do not exist on the mainland. Yet they are written into the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution.
Those rights have long been touted, frequently by the Hong Kong government, as the bedrock beneath one of the world's most important financial cities. Significantly, they include the right of Hong Kong's chief justice to appoint foreign judges.
But the Basic Law contains a caveat: Ultimately, the rulings of Hong Kong's top court, the Court of Final Appeal, can be re-interpreted by the standing committee of the National People's Congress, China's parliament. 
Beijing last used that power in late 2016 to effectively bar several pro-democracy lawmakers from taking office. The three judges who spoke to Reuters said they feared China would begin to wield this power more frequently, potentially undermining the city's courts.
In November, a Hong Kong court overturned a government emergency ban on protesters wearing masks to obscure their faces. The next day, state news agency Xinhua quoted a spokesman for a body attached to the standing committee saying that Hong Kong courts had no power to rule on the constitutionality of the city's laws.
The announcement was swiftly condemned by local lawyers, and local and foreign academics. The Hong Kong government partially won an appeal last week against the November decision.
THE MESSAGE TO HONG KONG
China's state-controlled media weighed in as protests intensified last year. The Global Times, a tabloid published by the Communist Party's People's Daily, wrote in a November commentary: ""The rule of law can save Hong Kong, but the premise is that the rioters must be punished."" It added: ""Just like the rioters, the judges and lawyers who absolve rioters of their crimes will be despised.""
Writing in a Communist Party journal last year, Chinese leader Xi Jinping explained his view on the rule of law. The ""socialist rule of law must adhere to the party's leadership,"" he wrote in the journal, Qiushi, which means ""Seeking Truth."" China, Xi said, ""must not copy"" other countries, nor follow Western-style ""judicial independence.""
China's leaders have made their expectations of Hong Kong clear. Last year in Beijing, Vice Premier Han Zheng publicly told the city's chief executive, Carrie Lam, that stopping the violence was the ""common responsibility"" of her government, the legislature and the judiciary. 
In so saying, Han blurred the lines of Hong Kong's separation of powers - a check on the state that doesn't exist on the mainland.
And this month, a top Chinese official in Hong Kong wrote about the need for ""strengthening"" the city's legal system to ""safeguard"" China's national security.
Under their oath of office, Hong Kong's judges must steer clear of the political fray. Following Han's remarks, though, one justice used his ruling on a matter related to the protests and freedom of the press to stress the doctrine of separate powers.
""As an aside,"" Justice Russell Coleman wrote two days after Han's remarks, ""I do not think any judicial officer in Hong Kong requires anyone, whether from in Hong Kong or beyond, to tell him or her how to perform his or her role as part of the independent judiciary.""
The judiciary said Coleman had no comment.
""The rule of law and an independent judiciary are constitutionally protected by the Basic Law,"" Lam's spokesman said.
Some in Hong Kong believe Beijing will struggle to bring the city's judicial system to heel.
""The roots of the common law run deep in Hong Kong and will not be easily uprooted, so I think China can only ultimately take a gradual approach, despite the rhetoric,"" said Simon Young, a barrister and professor at the University of Hong Kong's law school. ""Those values are entrenched through the system.""
Young was encouraged by what he said were the robust public defenses of the city's judicial system being mounted by Hong Kong's top judge, Ma, as well as Coleman and others.
A retired senior judge, speaking on condition of anonymity, said while the mainland is clearly trying to pressure Hong Kong's judiciary, it doesn't amount to an existential threat to the rule of law. The test, the former judge said, would be if the legal system succumbed to these pressures. ""I have not seen that.""
'SPEAKING UP FOR THE RULE OF LAW'
Ma, 64, became chief justice of the Court of Final Appeal in 2010 after a long career as a barrister and a High Court judge. Amid the drama that's shaken his city in the past year, he has forcefully defended judicial independence.
Concluding his speech in Seoul last year, Ma told the audience: ""Speaking up for the rule of law as it is properly understood is very much a part of what a lawyer should be doing. Look within yourselves and ask whether you are prepared to stand up and be counted.""
At a public appearance in January in Hong Kong, Ma again addressed judicial independence. He repeatedly told reporters he could not discuss the political or even the legal questions raised by the statements of the leadership in Beijing. 
But he did note: ""The powers of the courts, by the way, are stated in the Basic Law. Hong Kong is to have independent judicial power, and those words mean exactly what they say.""
Ma went further. ""Judges don't look at the litigant's background nor his political stance,"" he said. ""Destroying the rule of law is when the court thinks not everyone is equal before the law, and that some are more equal than others.""
Several friends and former colleagues of Ma say he is showing signs of strain from the job, including having to continually defend the integrity of the courts. 
This was evident, they say, when Ma appeared at the January event, a start-of-the-year gathering of judges, leading lawyers and senior government officials and diplomats. 
Ma confirmed that it would be his last time opening the annual event and that he would be retiring in January next year, when he turns 65, forgoing his option of an extension.
By then he would have served more than a decade as chief justice. Ma is only the second person to serve in the position since the 1997 handover. 
His successor will be Justice Andrew Cheung, who sits on the Court of Final Appeal and whose appointment was announced in March.
The judiciary said Cheung had no comment for this article.
Some people close to Ma say that while he hasn't been pushed to leave, the constant battle to safeguard the judiciary has worn on him. His job includes dealing with visiting mainland judges and briefings from locally based Chinese officials, which can be tough going, these people say.
While they apparently know better than to meddle in individual cases, say the people close to Ma, the Chinese judges and officials constantly seek to push Beijing's ""patriotic"" agenda by stressing the importance of the judiciary in defending China's sovereignty and national security.
""I know he tires of the apparatchiks whose Communist Party mantra has no room for even starting to grasp the separation of powers that exists in Hong Kong, or the real meaning or value of judicial independence,"" said one person who knows the chief justice. ""Sometimes he stops engaging … and simply tries to talk football.""
APPOINTING NEW JUDGES
Ma is looking forward to a rest, and having time to indulge in his lifelong passions for cinema, cricket and England's Manchester United football team, say those who know him.
Hong Kong born and British educated, Ma mixes easily in international legal circles as he recruits judicial talent from abroad, foreign envoys and judges say. His ability to continue to attract leading foreign judges to serve on Hong Kong courts is a source of pride for him.
The Court of Final Appeal currently has 23 judges, of whom 15 are foreigners. Many are from the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia. All serve as non-permanent members on the court, which means they are called on periodically to sit on cases. Their presence stems from an arrangement established at the handover that has become an entrenched part of the city's judicial system.
All cases reaching Hong Kong's highest court, the Court of Final Appeal, including key constitutional and human rights matters, are generally adjudicated by a panel of five judges. This includes the chief justice, three permanent judges and one non-permanent judge.
Ma is now leading the hunt for at least one new member on the highest court in his statutory role as head of a committee that handles judicial appointments.
The selection body, known as the Judicial Officers Recommendation Commission, comprises judges, senior lawyers and prominent community figures as well as a government representative, the secretary for justice. They are barred by law from talking about their work. Any key documentation they use is hand-delivered across the city.
""The question is whether outside forces will try to meddle"" when decisions need approval, said a person with direct knowledge of the panel's secret deliberations, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ""I have to have faith the system will work, but it hangs by only a convention.""
The appointments must be approved by city Chief Executive Carrie Lam and the legislature. Traditionally, they have been approved with little fuss. But some of the commission's last significant appointments encountered rare scrutiny in 2018, when some pro-Beijing lawmakers questioned the candidacies in the legislature, as well as the selection process itself.
Brenda Hale, then president of the British Supreme Court, and Beverley McLachlin, former Chief Justice of Canada, were the first women to be appointed to Hong Kong's highest court. Pro-Beijing legislators questioned whether they were too socially liberal for Hong Kong, based on their past rulings.
The judiciary said Hale and McLachlin had no comment.
The appointments were eventually approved, but the message had been sent - Ma and his successors could expect future fights over appointments, particularly of foreign judges. ""That was a shot across the bows,"" said one of the three senior judges who spoke to Reuters. ""We all heard it.""
Another of the justices told Reuters he is concerned that a generational shift underway on the bench could leave it starved of judges strong enough to withstand meddling in the years ahead.

""Pressures will build on the new judicial leaders,"" the judge said. ""Some of us doubt that they will be able to withstand those pressures as previous generations have done. We just have to hope they can,"" the judge said. ""The rule of law will depend on it.""

1599,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 07:30AM ET</span>",Human Rights Watch warns against Polish abortion debate,"WARSAW (Reuters) - Human Rights Watch, one of the world's largest human rights groupings, on Tuesday accused the Polish government of taking advantage of the coronavirus lockdown to debate new limits on abortion and sexual education.
The ruling conservative Law and Justice (PiS) party had abandoned its previous attempts to tighten abortion rules following massive public protests.
Now a number of citizens' initiatives are set for a first reading on parliament's agenda for Wednesday and Thursday, including one that could criminalise sexual education activities and another on new rules on abortion.
""The chaos and anxiety surrounding COVID-19 shouldn't be used as a distraction from harmful attempts to push through dangerous legislation,"" Hillary Margolis, senior women's rights researcher at Human Rights Watch, said. 
""The Polish government's focus during the pandemic should be to protect people's health and rights, not diminish them.""
Staunchly Catholic Poland has some of the toughest abortion rules in Europe, with the procedure allowed only in the case of some foetal abnormalities, rape, incest or a threat to the mother's health.
The PiS has also spoken out against sexual education, arguing attempts to teach young people about sexual orientation and gay rights could threaten Polish culture and should be blocked wherever possible.
The ""Stop Abortion"" project, which proposes banning abortion when prenatal tests show serious, irreversible damage to the foetus, was first submitted to parliament in 2018.
""I believe that killing disabled children is simply murder. If legislation on this will cross my desk, I will certainly sign it into law,"" Poland's President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, told Polish Catholic news outlet Niedziela https://www.niedziela.pl/artykul/51434/Prezydent-Aborcja-niepelnosprawnych-to earlier this month when asked about the abortion restrictions project.
A PiS spokeswoman and spokesman did not respond to Reuters' requests for comment.
Poland's constitution allows citizens to submit legislative proposals if they can gather 100,000 signatures.
The proposals on abortion and sexual education were submitted to the parliament during the last term and must be discussed by May, according to parliamentary rules. 

It is unclear if restrictions on public gatherings will be lifted by May. Polish government officials said on Tuesday that they plan to relax some of the coronavirus limits, likely for shops first, on April 19.

In a statement the Kazakh ministry said the article titled ""Why Kazakhstan is eager to return to China"" and published on privately-owned Chinese website sohu.com ""runs counter to the spirit of permanent comprehensive strategic partnership"" officially declared between the two countries. 
The ambassadorial summons is an unusual move since the neighbouring countries usually avoid criticising each other. The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
The article retells in brief the history of Kazakhstan, noting that leaders of many Kazakh tribes had pledged allegiance to the Chinese emperor.
It also states that Kazakhstan had historically been part of China's territory and Kazakhs ""do not have too many complaints"" about being repeatedly invaded by China.
China is a major investor in oil- and metals-rich Kazakhstan and is one of the main markets for its exports, dominated by commodities. Kazakhstan also makes money from Chinese goods carried across its territory to Europe.
But Sino-Kazakh ties have been strained by Beijing's de-radicalisation campaign in its western Xinjiang province, where the United Nations estimates over a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps. 
China has denied the camps violate the rights of ethnic minorities and says they were designed to stamp out terrorism and provide vocational skills.
The Chinese policies have affected ethnic Kazakhs living in Xinjiang, but the Kazakh government has not criticised the campaign and has chosen instead to seek the release of those who had Kazakh citizenship or were seeking it.

The new leader will be in pole position to run as chancellor in the next federal election as Merkel has said she will not seek a fifth term at the head of Europe's biggest economy. 
The party had already cancelled a special congress in April to pick a leader and Kramp-Karrenbauer was quoted by dpa news agency as saying it looked increasingly likely that the decision would not take place until a regular conference in December.
""My impression is that the nearer we get to the summer break with a possible special party conference, the less the need for a conference that will take place just a few weeks before the normal one,"" Kramp-Karrenbauer told dpa.
So far, the top contenders to lead the party are former Merkel rival Friedrich Merz, popular on the right of the party, and Armin Laschet, the premier of Germany's most populous state. Foreign policy expert Norbert Roettgen is an outsider.
Kramp-Karrenbauer said preparations for the December conference were going ahead.
""We hope of course the situation will develop in such a way that we can have the regular party conference in December in Stuttgart,"" she told dpa.
Although the new CDU leader would be a favourite to run as chancellor in the next election, due by Oct. 2021, Bavaria's conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) has to agree and may even prefer its own leader, Markus Soeder, to be the candidate.

Kramp-Karrenbauer, Merkel's protege, said in February she would step aside after a scandal over over a regional branch of the CDU breaking a post-war taboo and voting with the far-right to elect a state leader from a third party.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) plane carrying aid to cyclone-struck Vanuatu turned around and returned home on Sunday as a Chinese plane with medical equipment was already on the airport's tarmac, Vanuatu airport officials said.
The decision to return to Australia, some 2,000 km (1,240 miles) away was made despite being cleared by air traffic control to land and comes amid increasing rivalry between Australia's and China's aid programmes in the Pacific.
A plane from China, carrying medical equipment donated by Guangdong province to fight the coronavirus, had landed at the airport in Port Vila on Saturday.
""The Chinese plane was at one end of the runway. There was still 2,000 metres of runway available,"" Jason Rakau, chief executive of Airports Vanuatu, told Reuters.
""We gave clearance to land. They were circling.""
A spokesman for Australian defence minister Linda Reynolds did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
An RAAF plane did arrive on Monday, delivering relief supplies, including shelter kits, blankets and solar lanterns, as part of a A$4 million ($2.6 million) relief package, Australia's High Commission to Vanuatu said in a statement.
Jonathan Pryke, director of the Pacific Islands Program at the Lowy Institute, an Australian foreign policy think tank, said the airport incident was ""bizarre"".
""Coordination is critical. When you're both trying to help, even if you're not going to work together, at least don't get in each other's way,"" Pryke told Reuters.
""The good news is the supplies from Australia did get there, just a tad later."" 
Tropical Cyclone Harold made landfall on April 6, destroying over 1,000 schools and 90% of homes in the worst-hit area of Sanma, the United Nations said. Local media reported two people were killed.
Australia, traditionally the largest aid donor to the Pacific islands, is seeking to step up its engagement with the region out of concern it risks being overshadowed by Chinese aid and financial support.
Vanuatu has closed its borders to stop the spread of coronavirus, and aid arriving from China and Australia has been handled by staff wearing personal protective equipment. 
Vanuatu's acting prime minister, Charlot Salwai, said the rapid testing equipment that arrived from China was urgently needed by hospitals, local media reported.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Social media anger from Chinese nationalists over a Thai internet model's comments has set off a regional storm uniting pro-democracy campaigners against pro-Beijing cyber-warriors, with insults and mocking memes flying back and forth.
The quarrel, which has seen Southeast Asian internet users join forces with those in Taiwan and Hong Kong, has highlighted old tensions between China and its smaller neighbours fanned by the emergence of the new coronavirus.
Political analysts and activists said the online row, which started at the weekend, was unique in volume and regional spread at a time when ever more of life has been forced online.
""This is the first transnational geopolitical Twitter war Thais have engaged in,"" said Prajak Kongkirati of Bangkok's Thammasat University. 
""We see people questioning China's actions and influence ... The celebrity issue is the tip of the iceberg.""
Related Twitter hashtags generated more than two million tweets and trended globally. A fan page for the main hashtag, #Nnevvy, has more than 63,000 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) followers.
""Nnevvy"" is the social media moniker of internet model Weeraya Sukaram and the dispute began after she was accused of sharing a Thai Twitter message questioning whether the coronavirus originated in a Chinese laboratory.
Furious Chinese netizens then said she had once appeared to suggest, in a post on Instagram, that Taiwan was not part of China. Beijing says the self-ruled island is an indivisible part of its territory. 
Weeraya did not respond to requests for comment and neither of the messages was visible on her accounts.
Further fuelling the fire, Chinese accounts then accused Weeraya's boyfriend, Vachirawat Cheevaari, of having once liked a post that identified Hong Kong as a country - again a no-no for Beijing. 
Despite his apology, they called for a boycott of his hit TV show. 
Related hashtags on Chinese microblogging platform Weibo resulted in more than 4.64 billion views and 1.44 million posts.
Comments on Twitter were mostly posted in Chinese, Thai and English, though some were in Malay and Tagalog.
In the face of the pro-China barrage, support rallied for the Thai celebrities from anti-Beijing activists and politicians - including Hong Kong pro-democracy campaigner Joshua Wong and a Taiwan mayor.
'PAN-ASIAN SOLIDARITY'
Wong posted a photo watching Vachirawat's show and urged Hong Kong to ""stand with our freedom-loving Thai friends"".
""Perhaps we can build a new kind of pan-Asian solidarity that opposes all forms of authoritarianism!"" he wrote.
Thai pro-democracy student activist Netiwit Chotiphatphaisal said he and Wong had been in touch and that Thais were uneasy over growing Chinese influence since a 2014 coup in Thailand, whose leader, Prayuth Chan-ocha, won a disputed election last year.
""The hashtag provided an opportunity to speak up,"" Netiwit told Reuters.
Meanwhile, some users in the Philippines took on the hashtag to attack Chinese action in the disputed South China Sea.
China's foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the implications of the social media quarrel.
Twitter is blocked in China and only accessible for those using virtual private networks or with official approval. 
Social media consultancy Drone Emprit found that automated bot accounts were using the #Nnevvy hashtag but it did not say where they came from. Reuters found that several pro-China accounts had been created in the last few days and only contained comments on the dispute.
""While #Nnevvy started off as an intense overnight Twitter war between Thailand and China, it's now turned into meaningful diplomatic engagement with Hong Kong and Taiwan,"" said Tracy Beattie of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
Insults from Chinese nationalists against Thailand's government and king were laughed off by Thai campaigners who themselves attack the administration as undemocratic. The king has faced unprecedented online criticism recently despite a penalty of up to 15 years in jail for anyone insulting him.
Thailand's government was aware of the social media battle between Thai and Chinese accounts and it urged Thai internet users to express themselves within reason, said deputy government spokeswoman Ratchada Thanadirek.
Thai posters, using one well-known internet meme, labelled a menacing character as Chinese people trying to hurt Thai people's feelings by insulting their country. A nonchalant character was described as Thai people who have been insulting their country for years.
Meanwhile, Thai users mocked China for authoritarian rule and likened President Xi Jinping to Winnie the Pooh - a comparison that is banned in China.
""Thailand is poor, but China is Pooh,"" read one viral tweet.

On a lighter note, another meme celebrated Thailand, Hong Kong and Taiwan as a ""Milk Tea Alliance"" because of a shared fondness for the iced drink.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea launched multiple short-range anti-ship cruise missiles into the sea and Sukhoi jets fired air-to-surface missiles on Tuesday as part of its ongoing military exercises, South Korea's military said.
The missile tests came on the eve of a national holiday in North Korea to celebrate the birthday of Kim Il Sung, the founder of the country and grandfather of the current leader, Kim Jong Un. 
Launched at around 7 a.m. (2200 GMT), the anti-ship missiles plunged into the sea more than 150 kilometres (93 miles) off the east coast town of Munchon, while the Sukhois carried out firing tests, officials at South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) told reporters. 
The JCS gave no indication of how many missiles were fired, but said a detailed analysis of the launches was being conducted together with U.S. intelligence. 
The latest tests were part of wintertime drills the North has been carrying out in recent weeks after coronavirus concerns caused delays, a South Korean military official told Reuters. 
""There has been an increase in air force activities which we think was intended to make up for the lack of winter training that they would've otherwise wrapped up in late March,"" the official said. ""And they usually hold military events around the April 15 birthday."" 
The official noted that the North used a similar anti-ship cruise missile in June 2017, the last time it was known to have tested such a weapon. 
North Korea has been conducting weeks of military drills, including several launches of short-range ballistic missiles. Last month, it fired nine ballistic missiles in four rounds of tests, according to analysts.

On Sunday, North Korean state media reported leader Kim Jong Un had visited an airbase and observed drills by the country's fighter jets and attack aircraft.

Environmental activists had warned on Monday that the fire, near the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in 1986, posed a radiation risk.
Chernobyl tour operator Yaroslav Yemelianenko, writing on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), had described the situation as critical, saying the fire had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat, two kilometres from where ""the most highly active radiation waste of the whole Chernobyl zone is located"". 
But Ukrainian authorities said on Tuesday that though they had registered short-term spikes in Caesium-137 particles in the Kiev area to the south of the plant, radiation levels remained within normal limits overall and did not require additional protection measures. [L5N2C1279]
""There is no open fire,"" the Interior Ministry said in a statement. It added that there was ""a slight smouldering of the forest floor"" however.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has promised transparency on the issue and will meet the head of the emergency services later on Tuesday. ""Society must know the truth and be safe,"" he said in a statement late on Monday.
The fire, one of several which followed unusually dry weather, began on April 3 in the western part of the exclusion zone and spread to nearby forests.
Police say they have identified a 27-year old local resident who they accuse of deliberately starting the blaze. 

It remains unclear if the person, who has reportedly confessed to starting a number of fires ""for fun"", is partly or fully responsible.

MADRID (Reuters) - For Susana Cristo and other parents of autistic children, Spain's strict coronavirus lockdown is proving especially harrowing and has led to insults, harassment and even fines.
Unlike most Spaniards right now, autistic people are legally entitled to go for walks, but the government only specified this a week after declaring its state of emergency, and both police and civilians are often unaware of the situation.
""The neighbours in the surrounding tower blocks insult us, take photos,"" said Cristo, 36, describing the times she and four-year-old Olivia have ventured into the garden of their apartment building in Madrid. ""One even called the police.""
Physical stimulus is vital for the wellbeing and cognitive development of people with autism, who struggle to grasp symbolic and imaginary concepts.
""It's very difficult because autism is an invisible disability,"" said Beatriz Garcia, communications technician for Spain's Autism Confederation. ""People don't think you could be walking around for health reasons.""
Over a month into one of Europe's strictest quarantines, Spain started easing its near-total shutdown on Monday for businesses as the pace of new infections slowed, but tough restrictions remain in place for most people.
Spain has reported more than 17,000 coronavirus deaths, one of the highest fatality rates in the world.
DISRUPTED ROUTINES
The country has an estimated 450,000 people with autism.
""One woman shouted at us from her balcony that she too would like to walk around with her boyfriend,"" said 22-year-old Irene Donoso, who is now scared of accompanying her autistic younger brother Marco on his daily walks in their Madrid neighbourhood.
""Marco is tall, healthy-looking. Wearing masks, you can't necessarily tell that we're siblings, that he's different,"" said Donoso, explaining that disruptions to their routine can prompt autistic people to withdraw into themselves.
Spain's Autism Confederation launched a platform on March 26 where autistic people, their relatives and carers can report incidents arising from the state of emergency.
Almost 40% of the incidents registered so far involved authorities questioning or penalising autistic individuals for being outdoors, as well as harassment from civilians.
Restrictions on movement have interrupted - and potentially endangered - learning progress for young children with autism.
Thanks to in-person therapy, Olivia went from struggling to communicate with signs to speaking her first words, and from chronic disordered sleep to sleeping 10 hours every night.
Now, under lockdown, her troubled sleeping is back.
""This confinement is ruining the fruit of years of work, therapy, effort and personal resources,"" said Cristo.
""For Olivia, processing the world through her senses is fundamental. If I open the window, she sticks her little arms out.""
Marco Donoso, 20, enthusiastically attended a professional integration course at Madrid's Down's syndrome association, but online meetings don't capture his attention, his sister said.
For relatives, the confinement is forcing hard choices between continuing professional activity and preserving hard-won progress in their loved ones' cognitive abilities.

""We'll hold on as long as we have to,"" said Cristo. ""If three children are spared harassment because people read our story, I'll be happy.""

1608,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 03:30AM ET</span>",Taiwan's largest airline in the spotlight over China name confusion,"By Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's largest carrier, China Airlines, has become the latest focus of political angst on the island about identity and its relationship with China amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The issue of how self-ruled, democratically governed Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own, relates to China has shot back into the political arena since the virus began spreading around the world.
Taiwan's official name is the Republic of China, a throwback to the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949, when the Nationalist government fled to the island after losing to the Communists, who established the People's Republic of China.
Although the word ""Taiwan"" features prominently on Taiwanese passports, its largest carrier retains the name China Airlines. Some politicians in Taiwan say that has caused confusion, particularly when the airline delivered face masks to Europe.
Pictures of boxes with large Taiwan flags on them being offloaded from a China Airlines freighter last week in Europe kicked off the renewed debate.
""When China Airlines delivered materials this time, the whole world thanked Taiwan,"" Premier Su Tseng-chang said on Tuesday. ""But because China Airlines has the word 'China' on its fuselage, some countries, people and pictures mistakenly thought that China had sent them the masks, causing us a lot of grief.""
The small New Power Party, which shares the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party's (DPP) support for Taiwan's formal independence, called on parliament to remove or make much smaller the English word ""China"" from the airline, and to add the word ""Taiwan"".
""Even Taiwan's democracy and freedom may be misinterpreted by the international community as coming from China because of the big (word) 'CHINA,'"" it said.
China Airlines, majority owned by the government and often confused with China's flag carrier, Air China, said it had received ""lively"" feedback about the issue.
""It is now in the process of being studied and discussed internally with an open mind,"" it said in a statement to Reuters.
Premier Su, however, signalled that a name change was not imminent, and that China Airlines should focus on putting ""more Taiwan symbols"" on its aircraft.
""As for the long-term name change of China Airlines, it may not be so simple, as it involves flight rights and other factors,"" he added.
China Airlines' name has been debated before. Any name change would be fraught with difficulties, and it is unclear how China might react.
The idea might also be unpopular domestically.

In 2018, voters defeated a referendum calling for the island to enter future Olympic events as ""Taiwan"" rather than the current compromise name, ""Chinese Taipei."" Many Taiwanese worried the move would anger Beijing and jeopardise the island's place in the games.

1609,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 14, 2020 02:30AM ET</span>",Chinese ship returns to waters off Vietnam amid virus 'distraction' charges,"By Khanh Vu and James Pearson
HANOI (Reuters) - A Chinese ship embroiled in a standoff with Vietnamese vessels last year has returned to waters near Vietnam as the United States accused China of pushing its presence in the South China Sea while other claimants are pre-occupied with the coronavirus.
Vietnamese vessels last year spent months shadowing the Chinese Haiyang Dizhi 8 survey vessel in resource-rich waters that are a potential global flashpoint as the United States challenges China's sweeping maritime claims. 
On Tuesday, the ship, which is used for offshore seismic surveys, appeared again 158 km (98 miles) off Vietnam's coast, within its exclusive economic zone (EEZ), flanked by at least one China Coast Guard vessel, according to data from Marine Traffic, a website that tracks shipping.
At least three Vietnamese vessels were moving with the Chinese ship, according to data issued by the Marine Traffic site.
The presence of the Haiyang Dizhi 8 in Vietnam's EEZ comes towards the scheduled end of a 15-day nationwide lockdown in Vietnam aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus. 
It also follows the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat near islands in the disputed waters this month, an act that drew a protest from Vietnam and accusations that China had violated its sovereignty and threatened the lives of its fishermen. 
The United States, which last month sent an aircraft carrier to the central Vietnamese port of Danang, said it was ""seriously concerned"" about China's reported sinking of the vessel.
""We call on the PRC to remain focused on supporting international efforts to combat the global pandemic, and to stop exploiting the distraction or vulnerability of other states to expand its unlawful claims in the South China Sea,"" the U.S. State Department said in a statement, referring to China.
'BASELESS'
The Philippines, which also has disputed claims in the South China Sea, has raised its concerns too.
On Saturday, China's Global Times, published by the official People's Daily newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party, said Vietnam had used the fishing boat incident to distract from its ""ineptitude"" in handling the coronavirus.
Vietnam's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters for comment. 
Helped by a mass quarantine and aggressive contact-tracing, Vietnam has recorded 265 cases of the novel coronavirus and no deaths. Nearly 122,000 coronavirus tests have been carried out in Vietnam.
China and Vietnam have for years been at loggerheads over the potentially energy-rich waters, called the East Sea by Vietnam. 
China's U-shaped ""nine-dash line"" on its maps marks a vast expanse of the waters that it claims, including large parts of Vietnam's continental shelf where it has awarded oil concessions. Malaysia and Brunei claim some of the waters that China claims to the south.
During the standoff last year, at least one China Coast Guard vessel spent weeks in waters close to an oil rig in a Vietnamese oil block, operated by Russia's Rosneft, while the Haihyang Dizhi 8 conducted suspected oil exploration surveys in large expanses of Vietnam's EEZ.
""The deployment of the vessel is Beijing's move to once again baselessly assert its sovereignty in the South China Sea,"" said Ha Hoang Hop, at the Singapore-based ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.
""China is using the coronavirus distraction to increase its assertiveness in the South China Sea, at a time when the U.S. and Europe are struggling to cope with the new coronavirus.""

1610,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 10:16PM ET</span>","Promising 'better days,' Macron extends France's lockdown until May 11","By Michel Rose, Matthias Blamont and Sudip Kar-Gupta
PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday announced he was extending a virtual lockdown to curb the coronavirus outbreak until May 11, adding that progress had been made but the battle not yet won.
Following Italy in extending the lockdown but announcing no immediate easing of restrictive measures as in Spain, Macron said the tense situation in hospitals in Paris and eastern France meant there could be no let-up in the country. 
Since March 17, France's 67 million people have been ordered to stay at home except to buy food, go to work, seek medical care or get some exercise on their own. The lockdown was originally scheduled to end on Tuesday. 
""I fully understand the effort I'm asking from you,"" Macron told the nation in a televised address at the end of the lockdown's fourth week, adding the current rules were working.
""When will we be able to return to a normal life? I would love to be able to answer you. But to be frank, I have to humbly tell you we don't have definitive answers,"" he said.
Schools and shops would progressively reopen on May 11, Macron said. But restaurants, hotels, cafes and cinemas would have to remain shut longer, he added. International arrivals from non-European countries will remain prohibited until further notice.
Macron, whose government has faced criticism over a shortage of face masks and testing kits, said that by May 11, France would be able to test anyone presenting COVID-19 symptoms and give nonprofessional face masks to the public.
Macron also said he had asked his government to present this week new financial aid for families and students in need.
NOT PREPARED
Acknowledging his country had not been sufficiently prepared early on to face the challenges posed by the outbreak of the new coronavirus, Macron appeared to seek a humble tone in contrast to the war-like rhetoric of his previous speeches.
""Were we prepared for this crisis? On the face of it, not enough. But we coped,"" he said. ""This moment, let's be honest, has revealed cracks, shortages. Like every country in the world, we have lacked gloves, hand gel, we haven't been able to give out as many masks as we wanted to our health professionals.""
The French, long accustomed to being told their high taxes paid for the ""best healthcare in the world,"" have been dismayed by the rationing of critical drugs, face masks and equipment and have watched with envy the situation in neighbouring Germany.
Macron's acknowledgment of the shortcomings was broadly well-received.
""It's not every day you hear a president offer a mea culpa and dare say 'we have no definitive answers.' Reassuring and necessary sincerity,"" analyst Maxime Sbaihi of the think tank GenerationLibre said.
After a relentless increase until the first week of April, the number of patients in French hospitals' intensive care units has started to decline, prompting health authorities to call a plateau in the epidemic.
But if French hospitals are just about coping, helped by a massive effort to transfer patients by plane, helicopter or even high-speed train from hospitals in the east and Paris to the west, nursing homes have been overwhelmed.
By Monday, the coronavirus had claimed 14,967 lives in France, the fourth-highest death toll in the world, with more than 98,076 confirmed cases, according to official figures.

""We'll have better days, and we'll return to happy days,"" Macron said.

1611,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 07:05PM ET</span>","Israel's Netanyahu, Gantz say near unity deal to end political deadlock","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his main rival Benny Gantz were nearing a deal on Tuesday to form a national emergency government to battle the coronavirus crisis and end the country's unprecedented political deadlock.
Gantz's 28-day mandate to put together a ruling coalition after last month's inconclusive election was due to expire at midnight, but President Reuven Rivlin, who is overseeing the coalition talks, extended it for two days.
Rivlin did so, his office said, ""on the understanding that they are very close to reaching an agreement.""
Gantz and Netanyahu met overnight in a last-ditch effort to settle their differences. Afterwards they issued a joint statement saying they had made ""significant progress."" The two are set to meet again with their negotiating teams later in the morning.
The impasse, after national elections in April and September 2019 and again last month, raised the prospect of a fourth ballot, complicating any plans for economic recovery once the coronavirus outbreak eases.
Without a deal, it will be up to parliament to pick a candidate who would then have 14 days to form a government. Failure to do so would automatically trigger a snap election.
""Netanyahu, this is our moment of truth. It's either a national emergency government or, God forbid, a fourth election which would be expensive and, in this crisis period, gratuitous,"" Gantz said late on Monday in broadcast remarks.
Gantz said the enormity of the coronavirus emergency had caused him to break a campaign promise not to sit in a government with Netanyahu, who has been indicted on corruption charges.
Netanyahu, who has headed successive caretaker administrations during the political stalemate, denies the charges.
In his own televised statement, the veteran premier imposed a ban on inter-city travel for the final days of the Passover holiday this week to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
Restrictions already in place have confined most Israelis to their homes for weeks, forcing many businesses to close and sending unemployment soaring to more than 25%.

Netanyahu said his cabinet could formulate an ""exit strategy"" as soon as this weekend, though he cautioned restrictions on the economy and education would be eased gradually and that there would be no full return to routine before a coronavirus vaccine is discovered.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - A city government in the central Argentine province of Cordoba has dug around 250 graves, anticipating a death toll increase from the coronavirus pandemic, even as a nationwide lockdown appears to be flattening the rise in new cases.
Gravediggers at the cemetery in San Vicente on the outskirts of the provincial capital now plan to add a further 250 burial plots in the coming days, the local union that represents the workers who carried out the job told Reuters.
""They went from digging five or six pits per day, which is the usual amount, to digging more than double that,"" said Damián Bizzi, press secretary of the Union of Workers and Municipal Employees of Córdoba.
The labor underscores how countries are bracing for worst-case scenarios and to keep up with the impact of the pandemic, which has led to over 1.8 million confirmed infections globally and caused at least 115,242 deaths.
Argentina itself moved aggressively to combat the spread of the virus, with a nationwide lockdown in place since mid-March. Its closed borders helped to slow the rise in confirmed cases, which now include over 2,200 reports with 95 deaths. (Graphic: https://reut.rs/2yucH11)
The major province of Cordoba, which is the second most populous after Buenos Aires, has reported at least 206 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and five deaths, making it the most impacted region after the province of Buenos Aires and the capital city of the same name.

(Reuters) - Rescue workers and homeowners across the U.S. South on Monday sifted through what remained of hundreds of structures destroyed by a series of tornadoes that killed at least 26 people, as the deadly weather system churned up the East Coast.
Nearly 51 million people from Florida to New England were in the path of the system, with National Weather Service forecasters warning of strong winds, torrential rain and possibly more tornadoes on Monday afternoon. 
The system had already spawned about 60 reported tornadoes that left a path of destruction from Texas to the Carolinas on Sunday and Monday, the weather service reported. 
Powerful winds in the upper atmosphere combined with a strong cold front to make the system particularly dangerous, said weather service meteorologist Aaron Tyburski. 
""This was very typical of the spring season - definitely not something out of the ordinary - but it is very active,"" he said. 
At least 11 people were killed in Mississippi, eight in South Carolina, six in Georgia and one in Arkansas in the storms, local media and state officials reported.
Five of the people who were killed in Georgia were in two Murray County mobile home parks that were leveled as tornadoes rolled through the area, Murray County Fire Chief Dewayne Bain told a Fox News affiliate in the region. 
Among the dead in Mississippi were Lawrence County Sheriff's Office Deputy Robert Ainsworth and his wife, Paula. 
""Robert left this world a hero, as he shielded Mrs. Paula during the tornado,"" the sheriff's department said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Local media across the region showed images and video clips of homeowners and rescue workers picking through piles of rubble as flattened homes, overturned vehicles and downed power lines covered the landscape.
""It just tore everything. Everything's gone,"" Latesha Dillon, whose brother was killed in Walthall County, Mississippi, told a local ABC affiliate. 
Firefighters in Orangeburg County, South Carolina, found a handful of people trapped in two homes on Monday, the Times and Democrat, the local newspaper, reported.
In Upson County, Georgia, 65 miles (105 km) south of Atlanta, homeowner Paul McDaniel and his wife raced to an interior part of their home as a reported tornado rolled through their neighborhood early on Monday. 
""I heard it and grabbed her and we ran into the hall and ... it was something like I never heard before,"" McDaniel told a Fox News affiliate in the region. 

Nearly 580,000 million homes and businesses in North and South Carolina, Arkansas, New York and Virginia were without power on Monday, Poweroutage said.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>",Forces aligned with Tripoli government advance along west Libyan coast,"CAIRO (Reuters) - Forces aligned with Libya's internationally recognized government seized two towns west of the capital Tripoli on Monday after heavy clashes and drone strikes, military sources and residents said.
If held, the towns of Surman and Sabratha would represent a significant gain for forces trying to fight off a year-old campaign against Tripoli by rivals loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar.
It could also relieve some pressure for the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA), which has been struggling with water and power cuts in recent days on top of the loss of revenue from blockaded oil ports in the east.
Libya has been split into rival factions based in Tripoli and the east since 2014, each with parallel sets of institutions. Over the past year fighting has escalated and drawn in greater foreign involvement as Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) attacked the capital.
On Monday, residents and military sources from both sides said GNA-aligned forces had taken full control of Surman, about 60km (37 miles) west of Tripoli, and Sabratha, just west of Surman. The area has been a hub for migrant smuggling and Islamist militants in recent years. 
Videos circulating online showed dozens of GNA fighters shooting in the air near a roundabout in central Sabratha.
The city's pro-LNA municipal council said dawn drone strikes had killed and wounded a number of fighters. ""The sound of the drones above the city was like a beehive,"" said one resident. ""There were many air strikes."" 
Prisoners were freed from a security building in Surman, according to an LNA military source. 
Fractured ground forces have struggled to make breakthroughs around Tripoli, often relying on help from foreign fighters and drones. The LNA has received backing from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, and Russia, according to U.N. experts and diplomats, while the GNA is supported by Turkey.
Recent calls for a ceasefire to let the divided country try to counter the spread of coronavirus failed to halt the violence. Libya has so far reported 25 coronavirus cases, including one death. 
In Tripoli on Monday, loud explosions and heavy artillery fire could be heard across the city throughout the day. On Sunday there were heavy clashes south of Misrata, a major base of military support for the GNA.
Power supplies to western areas have been cut since Thursday, when a gas valve was shut in what the National Oil Corporation called an ""illegal closure"".
Water supplies to the capital, turned off by an armed group last week, have been switched back on after mediation by local elders, a senior official for Libya’s Great Man Made River, Ahmad al-Deeb, told Reuters.

KIEV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - A huge forest fire in Ukraine that has been raging for more than a week is now just one kilometre from the defunct Chernobyl nuclear power plant and poses a radiation risk, Greenpeace Russia warned on Monday, citing satellite images.
Ukraine's Emergency Situations Service said it was still fighting the fires, but that the situation was under control.
Video footage shot by Reuters on Sunday showed plumes of black smoke billowing into the sky and trees still ablaze, with firefighters in helicopters trying to put out the fires.
Aerial images of the 30 km (19 mile) exclusion zone around the plant, site of the world's worst nuclear accident in 1986, showed scorched, blackened earth and the charred stumps of still smouldering trees. 
The Emergency Situations Service said radiation levels in the exclusion zone had not changed and those in nearby Kiev, the Ukrainian capital, ""did not exceed natural background levels"".
Greenpeace Russia said the situation is much worse than Ukrainian authorities believe, and that the fires cover an area one thousand times bigger than they claim. 
On April 4 Ukrainian authorities said the blaze covered an area of 20 hectares, but Greenpeace cited satellite images showing it was around 12,000 hectares in size at that time.
""According to satellite images taken on Monday, the area of the largest fire has reached 34,400 hectares,"" it said, adding that a second fire, stretching across 12,600 hectares, was just one kilometre away from the defunct plant. 
Ukrainian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment on those claims.
Rashid Alimov, head of energy projects at Greenpeace Russia, said the fires, fanned by the wind, could disperse radionuclides, atoms that emit radiation.
""A fire approaching a nuclear or hazardous radiation facility is always a risk,"" Alimov said. ""In this case we're hoping for rain tomorrow.""
Chernobyl tour operator Yaroslav Yemelianenko, writing on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), described the situation as critical.
He said the fire was rapidly expanding and had reached the abandoned city of Pripyat, two kilometers from where ""the most highly active radiation waste of the whole Chernobyl zone is located"". He called on officials to warn people of the danger.
Satellite images taken by NASA Worldview and seen by Reuters showed the two fires had extended far into the exclusion zone.
The fires, which follow unusually dry weather, began on April 3 in the western part of the exclusion zone and spread to nearby forests.
Police say they have identified a 27-year old local resident who they accuse of deliberately starting the blaze. 

It remains unclear if the person, who has reportedly confessed to starting a number of fires ""for fun"", is partly or fully responsible.

Reuters was unable to independently confirm deaths in the village of Kyauk Seik in Ponnagyun township. A government spokesman did not respond to phone calls seeking comment. 
""There is fighting going on in northern Rakhine but no such incident of shelling a village. We haven't received confirmation of civilian casualties so far either,"" army spokesman Major General Tun Tun Nyi told Reuters by phone.
Myanmar's armed forces have been battling the Arakan Army (AA), a rebel group seeking greater autonomy for the western region, for more than a year. Clashes in Rakhine and neighboring Chin states have escalated in recent weeks, leaving dozens dead and thousands displaced.
Tun Maung, a Ponnagyun lawmaker, said he visited Kyauk Seik and that eight people had died. A local government official in the village, Tun Aye, gave the same death toll. Both said villagers blamed the army for the shelling.
Thar Doe Maung, a Kyauk Seik resident, said the shelling had killed three of his nephews.
The AA said in a statement there had been no clashes between the military and its fighters in the area on Monday and blamed government troops for the shelling.
Journalists are blocked from travelling to most of central and northern Rakhine.
Countries including the United States and Britain have called for an end to fighting in Rakhine, not least to help protect vulnerable communities from the coronavirus pandemic. Myanmar has reported 52 cases of COVID-19 and four deaths.
The AA declared a month-long ceasefire for April along with two other ethnic armed groups, citing the pandemic. The army rejected the plea, with a spokesman saying a previous truce declared by the government went unheeded by insurgents.

The talks between U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad and his Taliban counterparts follow the Kabul government's freeing of some 300 insurgent prisoners and the first release by the insurgents of government detainees.
A dispute over prisoner releases, an increase in Taliban violence and other issues have stalled the U.S.-led effort to end America's longest war and decades of strife in Afghanistan.
A State Department statement issued on Monday said that Khalilzad departed for Doha on Sunday. He was to meet on Monday with Taliban representatives ""to discuss current challenges in implementing the U.S.-Taliban Agreement,"" it said.
The Feb. 29 deal for a phased U.S. troop withdrawal called for the freeing of up to 5,000 Taliban detainees and up to 1,000 government prisoners as a prelude to a March 10 opening of peace negotiations between the Taliban and an Afghan delegation that included Kabul officials.
The Taliban, however, demanded that Kabul release all 5,000 detainees at once before they would attend the talks, a demand rejected by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, whose government was not a party to the deal.
Ghani ordered a phased release of 1,500 Taliban prisoners, of whom some 300 have been freed since Wednesday.

On Sunday, the insurgents announced that they turned 20 government prisoners over to the International Committee of the Red Cross in Kandahar. The head of the ICRC's Afghanistan office confirmed the releases, the first by the insurgents since the signing of the U.S.-Taliban deal, on Twitter.

The centre-right parties, rivals who have alternated in power throughout the nation's history but have never formed a coalition together, need the support of at least one smaller party or eight independent lawmakers to reach a majority.
The pair's negotiating teams were due to finalise a joint paper setting out broad policy goals on Monday.
""I do understand that that document is effectively complete and has gone to both my party leader and the leader of Fianna Fail to review,"" Acting Health Minister Simon Harris of Fine Gael told a news conference.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese business leaders, labour unions and doctors joined forces on Monday to pressure the government to reinforce public health measures in order to allow for a gradual loosening of the nationwide lockdown imposed over the coronavirus pandemic.
In a letter sent to Prime Minister Antonio Costa and President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, the 167 signatories urged the government to make the use of face masks compulsory and install contactless dispensers with hand sanitiser in public spaces.
""The planning for the phasing out of the lockdown will demand additional containment measures to prevent new outbreaks that could lead to intermittent lockdown periods... It is urgent to increase public health containment measures,"" they wrote.
Then the state of emergency should be gradually lifted, allowing the economy to return to normal levels of activity, they said. 
Portugal has so far reported 16,934 coronavirus cases, with 535 deaths, far below levels seen in neighbouring Spain. The president has said he will propose extending the national lockdown, currently in place till April 17, to May 1.
In their letter, the signatories asked the government to test all suspected coronavirus cases within 24 hours of the first symptoms and introduce the widespread use of serological tests across the country to detect disease-fighting antibodies. 
One of the proposed measures calls for the health authority to request from telecom operators the contact details of users infected with the coronavirus over the last 14 days. Based on geolocation data, authorities will then alert users who have been in the proximity of the infected person about the contagion risk via text message or phone call.
""TEST MORE""
Health Minister Marta Temido told a news conference on Monday that the priority was to ""test more"", adding that a total of 179,000 coronavirus tests had been conducted since the beginning of March in the country of 10 million people. 
""We've had encouraging results in the way we managed the pandemic,"" Temido said. ""Right now we have to take small but safe steps.""
Authorities said Portugal's low case tally did not mean restrictions could be eased quickly.
Jorge Roque da Cunha, head of the Independent Union of Doctors, also questioned the reliability of official figures.

""There are failures in the reporting of cases,"" he told the Observador newspaper. ""It is not possible, in one week, that the whole region of Lisbon and Vale do Tejo only report 15 new cases.""

The suggestions, by the National Academy of Sciences Leopoldina, will play a prominent role in considerations this week for a possible loosening in movement and social distancing rules in place since around mid-March.
The advice from the academics comes as the daily figure for new infections in Germany has slowed but is still in the thousands of people.
""Although the pandemic will continue to shape economic and social life for months to come, it is necessary to...develop criteria and strategies for a gradual return to normality,"" the academy wrote.
Merkel, who has said the academy's position paper will be important for her determination on the path forward, will discuss the recommendations with her cabinet on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, she will hold a video conference with the state governors to discuss a possible path out of the lockdown and how to manage the recession it is expected to cause.
Senior politicians have begun debating a potential easing of restrictions as the number of new infections and deaths declines in Germany, which has weathered the pandemic better than Italy, Spain and France.
But the export-driven economy - Europe's largest - has been hit hard and may contract 9.8% in the second quarter, its top economic research institutes said. That would be the biggest contraction since records began in 1970 and more than double the decline seen during the global financial crisis in 2009.
The academy also said that masks should be obligatory in certain areas, such as on public transport. It said children should return to school as quickly as possible, but recommended differentiating them by grade level.
Over the Easter weekend, Armin Laschet, conservative governor of the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, sent recommendations from an expert panel from his own state to Merkel and his fellow premiers. He has stressed the importance of easing restrictions.
Speaking to broadcaster ZDF on Sunday evening, Laschet said that small retailers, for example, could potentially reopen following the model in place for bakeries with only two customers at a time.
""Why shouldn't this also work for other shops,"" he said, calling for ""a responsible return to normalcy"".
Other politicians, like Dietmar Woidke, governor of Brandenburg, have called for a more cautious approach to avoid the risk of negating the work Germany has done to combat the virus.

The current restrictions, which include limiting public gatherings to two individuals, are to remain in place until April 19.

India and Pakistan have accused each other of mortar and artillery shelling along the de facto border known as the Line of Control (LoC) that divides the disputed Kashmir region. The sporadic exchanges began on Saturday.
The two South Asian nuclear powers both claim the Kashmir region in full, but rule only parts, and often accuse each other of breaching a 2003 ceasefire pact by shelling and firing across the LoC.
The Pakistani foreign ministry said in a statement that Islamabad had summoned an Indian ministry official to lodge a protest over ceasefire violations by Delhi.
Kashmir remains divided between the two countries since they won independence from British rule in 1947. The neighbours have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir. 
India said at the weekend that Pakistani shelling had killed three civilians, while the Pakistani foreign ministry said Indian firing had killed the child and wounded four others.
""This year, India has so far committed 749 ceasefire violations to date,"" the ministry said, and it condemned the targeting of innocent civilians.
Tension between the two countries was renewed when New Delhi withdrew the autonomy of its part of the Kashmir region in 2019 and split it into territories federally administered by India. Until then, it had had autonomy over all matters except defence, communications and foreign affairs.
India accuses Pakistan of training and sending militants across the border to launch attacks and support a Kashmiri separatist movement against Indian rule.

Pakistan denies giving material support to militants in Kashmir but says it provides moral and diplomatic backing for the self-determination of Kashmiri people.

1624,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 06:21AM ET</span>",To Belgrade and beyond: Beijing exports China model of virus management,"By Keith Zhai and Aleksandar Vasovic
SINGAPORE/BELGRADE (Reuters) - Last month, six Chinese medical professionals stepped off an Air Serbia jet in Belgrade to a red-carpet welcome from President Aleksandar Vucic and an array of cabinet ministers. After elbow-bump greetings, Vucic kissed Serbia's flag, then China's.
In Serbia, one of Beijing's closest European allies, and a handful of other friendly countries, China is providing on-the-ground guidance to help battle the coronavirus that has swept around the world.
The outreach is part of a wider push by Beijing to assert global leadership in battling COVID-19 after facing criticism from Washington and elsewhere that it fumbled its early response to the outbreak, believed to have originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
These efforts by Beijing come as western governments, already wary of China's rising influence around the world, including through its Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, are struggling with their own mounting coronavirus death tolls.
They are part of a long-running effort by China to strike a benevolent posture abroad to offset worries about its growing economic and military might, while presenting alternatives - such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank it set up in 2016 - to Western dominance of global institutions.
""There is no doubt that China will use the COVID-19 outbreak to further what China views as acting in its own national interest,"" said Gordon Houlden, a former Canadian diplomat and the director of the University of Alberta's China Institute.
    ""That will include pushing its own governance model, in this case its methodology of epidemiology,"" he said.
That methodology is based on the aggressive and comprehensive approach China took to combat the virus, including the lockdown of Wuhan, and the know-how it has built as the first country to suffer an outbreak of the disease.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian, at a press conference on Thursday, said the aim of sending medical teams was to share China's experiences combatting the virus, not to export its governance model abroad.
In addition to Serbia, Beijing has sent medical teams to Cambodia, Iran, Iraq, Laos, Pakistan, Venezuela and Italy, the only G7 nation to join the Belt and Road Initiative and which has been devastated by the coronavirus. Last week, a 12-member Chinese medical team arrived in the Philippines to aid in the fight against the virus.
The outreach is on top of the donation or sale of supplies to some 90 countries, including rivals such as the United States, as well as numerous videoconferences with countries and international organisations to share its know-how, according to the China International Development Cooperation Agency.
""We hope that other countries will not repeat China's tragedies,"" Peng Zhiqiang, a specialist from the Guangdong Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and head of the Chinese team in Serbia, said by phone from Belgrade.
'TRUST CHINESE EXPERTS'
Chinese medical teams are advising some host countries on building makeshift hospitals - evoking the 1,000 bed hospital China built from scratch in eight days in Wuhan - and rolling out virus management measures similar to those that helped it slash new infections at home, according to Peng and Liang Wenbin, a member of a Chinese team sent to Cambodia last month.
Those practices include the quarantine or isolation of people with mild symptoms to curb the early spread of the virus, methods of treating complications and widespread temperature checking for entry into public places.
On the Chinese team's advice, Serbia began quarantining people with mild symptoms and deploying troops to build field hospitals for patients with mild symptoms. 
Serbian officials said they welcomed the input, which they say has helped slow the spread of the virus.
""We changed our approach, and with the support of Chinese experts, we went for more widespread testing,"" said a source close to the Serbian presidency, who was not authorised to speak with media and declined to be named.
""Chinese doctors have welcomed the measures taken by Serbia, and we have embraced the Chinese model, which is to reach and treat as many people as possible - all who are infected,"" the person said.
QUARANTINES AND VISA CURBS
In Cambodia, which has been a loyal supporter of Beijing in Southeast Asia, the issuance of visas for international visitors was sharply curtailed at the suggestion of the team. The country is bracing for an influx of returnees for the Khmer new year this month.
Cambodia is also considering the team's advice to refit hotels and schools for possible quarantine of returnees, said Liang, the member of the Chinese team. 
""The latest restrictions to limit the mobility of personnel and to ban foreigners from coming to the country are the control measures China used,"" she said.
The Cambodian government did not reply to requests for comment.
'THANK YOU, BIG BROTHER XI' 
Despite its medical outreach efforts, China has faced sharp criticism in Washington and elsewhere for suppressing early information on the virus and downplaying its risks. 
""I am sceptical that many countries will soon forget China's early missteps that contributed to the global spread of the virus,"" said Ryan Hass, a senior Asia director in the Obama administration's National Security Council who is now at the Brookings Institution.
The response to the outreach from China in countries like Serbia, however, has so far been positive.
In Belgrade, the Chinese team visited a memorial to those killed in 1999 when American bombs hit China's embassy there in what Washington apologised for as an accident. 

After the team's arrival, a placard was mounted on a central Belgrade street with a picture of China's leader and big letters in Chinese and Serbian: ""Thank you, big brother Xi"".

1625,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 13, 2020 05:45AM ET</span>",China denies city discriminating against 'African brothers',"BEIJING (Reuters) - China dismissed on Monday allegations leveled by African and U.S. diplomats that foreigners of African appearance in the city of Guangzhou were being subjected to forceful testing for coronavirus, quarantine and ill treatment.
""We do not have discrimination in China against African brothers,"" Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a daily news briefing, accusing the United States of trying to exploit the issue to harm Beijing's relations with African nations.
A group of African ambassadors in Beijing had written to China's State Councilor Wang Yi drawing attention to the discrimination that Africans were encountering in Guangzhou, capital of the southern Guangdong province, after which the U.S. consulate in the city also issued an alert to citizens. 
The alert advised African-Americans to stay away from the Guangzhou metropolitan area, warning that the city's authorities had told bars and restaurants to refuse to serve people who ""appear to be of African origin"" and launched mandatory tests and self-quarantine of anyone with ""African contacts.""
Denying any such discrimination, the foreign ministry spokesman reiterated that China treats all foreigners equally. 
""It is irresponsible and immoral for the U.S. to sow discord,"" Zhao said. ""Its attempt to drive a wedge between China and Africa will never succeed.""
The ambassadors' note highlighted a number of reported incidents, including that Africans were being ejected from hotels in the middle of the night, having their passports seized, and threatened with revocation of visas, deportation or arrest.
Ghana's foreign minister and the leader of Nigeria's lower house of parliament have also separately met with the Chinese ambassador to their respective countries last week about the reports of mistreatment of Africans in Guangzhou. 
Zhao did not directly comment on the ambassadors' note, but said Guangdong has rolled out ""new measures"" and that Beijing is working with the relevant African nations to resolve the issue. He did not elaborate on what the new measures were.
Having largely stamped out in-country transmission of the coronavirus, authorities in China are worried that one of the biggest risks of a second wave in the epidemic stems for infected people coming from abroad.
Imported cases of the virus have largely involved Chinese citizens returning home, rather than foreigners. On Sunday, China reported 108 new cases - the most in almost six weeks. Over 90% were imported cases, of which Chinese returning from Russia accounted for about half.

As Spain enters its second month of lockdown, some businesses that cannot operate remotely, including construction and manufacturing, were allowed to reopen on Monday, sparking criticism from some regional leaders who fear a resurgence of the outbreak. 
However, the majority of the population are still confined to their homes, while shops, bars and public spaces will remain closed until at least April 26.
Interior minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Cadena Ser radio station that Spanish police started handing out millions of masks early in the morning across regions that are not observing a public holiday. ""The health of workers must be guaranteed. If this is minimally affected, the activity cannot restart,"" he said.
One company reopening, Burgos-based industrial group Nicolas Correa, said it would take measures to prioritise the health of its staff.
""We will continue to work in shifts, with staggered entries and exits to avoid concentrations of staff,"" it said, adding that all workers would be provided with protective equipment. 
Reuters TV footage showed only a few commuters coming in and out of the main entrance of Madrid's usually bustling Atocha train station. Road traffic was light too, with mainly public buses passing by, in contrast to the customary morning jams seen just a month ago.
Spain's cumulative death toll from the coronavirus rose to 16,972 on Sunday with confirmed cases totalling 166,019 although the lockdown restrictions have helped slow a spiralling death rate that reached its peak in early April. 

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Sunday the decision to restart some sectors of the economy was taken after consulting a committee of scientific experts and any further winding down would depend on gains made against the virus.

Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures last week in response to the coronavirus outbreak. While many businesses in Tokyo and elsewhere are now shut, most convenience stores have stayed open as they are considered essential.
There are around 58,000 convenience stores throughout Japan. Most are open 24 hours and sell everything from pre-made bento lunches to beer and neckties. They also offer package delivery and bill payment services.
""I actually feel safer,"" said 53-year-old restaurant owner Isao Otsuka, who was shopping at one of the roughly 150 7-Eleven stores, mainly in Tokyo, that have installed the transparent plastic curtains. 
7-Eleven's owner, Seven & i Holdings, has asked convenience store workers to wear masks, check their temperatures, wash their hands frequently and sterilise surfaces.
The new coronavirus spreads from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth via coughing or sneezing, according to the World Health Organization. Scientists have also said the virus can remain infectious in droplets in the air for hours and on surfaces for days.

Japan had recorded 7,411 cases of infection and 138 deaths from the virus as of Monday, public broadcaster NHK said, with more than 2,000 cases in Tokyo, a sharp rise from late March.

HO CHI MINH CITY (Reuters) - A Vietnamese entrepreneur in Ho Chi Minh City has invented a 24/7 automatic dispensing machine providing free rice for people out of work following an ongoing nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Vietnam has reported 262 COVID-19 cases, and no deaths so far, but as a result of a 15-day social distancing programme that began on March 31 many small businesses have been shuttered and thousands of people temporarily laid off from work.
Nguyen Thi Ly's husband was among those who have lost their job. 
""This rice ATM has been helpful. With this one bag of rice, we can have enough for one day,"" said the 34-year-old mother of three children. ""Now, we only need other food. Our neighbors sometimes gave us some leftover food, or we have instant noodles."" 
The machine distributes a 1.5kg (3.3lb) bagful of rice from a small silo to waiting workers, many of whom are street sellers or people who earned a living from cash-in-hand jobs like housekeeping or selling lottery tickets.
Hoang Tuan Anh, the businessman behind the idea, had initially donated a batch of smart doorbells to hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City before turning his technological expertise to food distribution.
Similar 'rice ATMs' have been set up in other big cities like Hanoi, Hue and Danang, according to state media. 
Employees monitoring the rice ATM declined to comment, but Anh told state media he wanted people to feel they still had access to food and resources, despite the current economic difficulties they found themselves in.
""I refer to this machine as a 'rice ATM' because people can withdraw rice from it, assured that there are still good people out there who want to give them a second chance,"" he said.
While many in the Communist-ruled country can rely on a social safety-net, and the government has introduced a stimulus package designed to help society’s most vulnerable, some people living on the margin, like Ly and her family, have not received enough support.

""I read about this rice ATM on the internet. I came to check it out, and couldn’t believe it came out for real. I really hope the sponsors would keep doing this until the end of the pandemic,"" said Ly, adding that her family's biggest problem was now paying their rent.

Photos released by state news agency KCNA on Monday showed hundreds of lawmakers sitting in close proximity to each other with no masks or other visible anti-infection measures.
North Korea has said it has tested at least 700 people and has put more than 500 in quarantine, but has no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, the World Health Organization (WHO) told Reuters last week.
""The state emergency anti-epidemic campaign will continue to be intensified to prevent the spread of COVID-19, with a priority given to the life and safety of the people,"" said a report submitted to the Supreme People's Assembly (SPA), according to KCNA.
North Korea took swift steps to prevent the spread of the virus, including blocking nearly all travel with neighboring China and Russia, suspending international tourism and imposing long quarantines on thousands of people, including foreign diplomats.
The SPA meeting came a day after leader Kim called for “more thorough state measures” to protect citizens from the fast-spreading coronavirus.
The supreme assembly meets once a year to adopt the state budget and to exercise its constitutional mandate to approve key appointments and legal amendments, though Kim holds near absolute power in the country. Personnel changes also take place in the meeting.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan Cardinal Baltazar Porras led Easter Mass on Sunday from an empty church, offering a sermon that was broadcast over Instagram to hundreds of people quarantined in their homes because of the coronavirus pandemic. 
Standing before 510 empty seats at the Immaculate Heart of Mary church in the upscale El Rosal neighborhood of Caracas, Porras' prayers were transmitted by three church associates who among them held four cellphones and a small tablet computer. 
A similar trend has taken place in many parts of Latin America, which has one of the world's highest concentration of Roman Catholics, as social distancing measures have made traditional church services impossible.
""I'm like a little kid with a new toy,"" Porras, 75, said of the newfound use of social media. 
""I've seen the enormous possibilities that this offers us, with a few simple cellphones,"" he said in an interview at the church, a modern building with an angular roof and decorated with statues of saints and purple-trimmed tapestries of Jesus.
He and other church leaders were preparing another Instagram broadcast in which they planned to make virtual contact with a cardinal in Peru.
Venezuela has been under quarantine for a month. President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday extended the measure for another 30 days to prevent the spread of the disease.
Sofia Fernandez, 58, a lawyer, watched the Mass with her husband, Raul Rodriguez, a management consultant and retired navy officer, in her Caracas apartment on a phone set up on a coffee table next to a wooden crucifix. 
""Receiving Mass on the phone is something that has allowed us to deepen our knowledge of the faith,"" said Fernandez, donning a white face mask.
Authorities last week allowed a limited version of the Nazarene of St. Paul procession, a religious parade through Caracas that emerged after a statue of Christ was credited with helping end a scurvy epidemic in 1696.
In Argentina, many parishes have held Mass and even choir performances online in the week leading up to Easter.
The Rev. Guillermo Marco, a priest at San Lucas parish in Buenos Aires that mostly serves university students, said the virtual Mass had expanded his reach since the city went into lockdown a few weeks ago. 

""I have more people connected for this type of Mass,"" said Marco, a former spokesman for Buenos Aires Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio who in 2013 became Pope Francis. ""What it gives them is a word of consolation, of encouragement for their spirit.""

The government confirmed it no longer required that particular model, known as BlueSky.
""We are no longer supporting the production of the BlueSky device following a reassessment of the product's viability in light of the ever developing picture around what is needed to most effectively treat COVID-19,"" said a spokesman for the Cabinet Office, which is coordinating ventilator orders.
""We are continuing to work at unprecedented speed with a number of other manufacturers to scale up UK production of ventilators,"" the spokesman said.
The government has appealed to industry to come forward with new models of ventilator that could be produced on a large scale at short notice to help the National Health Service deal with a surge in patients infected with the new coronavirus.
More than 30,000 ventilators in total have been ordered from various consortia of firms from sectors including aerospace, engineering and Formula One.
The source, who did not wish to be named because they were not authorised to disclose sensitive details to the media, said the group involved in the BlueSky project had been preparing to deliver thousands of units.
The source said the reason given by the government to the BlueSky team for cancelling the order was that while the overall number of new UK coronavirus infections was slowing, cases seen in hospitals were more complex than expected.
With several projects competing for the same components, which are in limited supply, the government decided to prioritise more sophisticated devices and cancel the BlueSky order with immediate effect, the source said.
The government is going ahead with the production and delivery of other devices as part of its initiative with industry. The first paraPac devices from  Smiths Group  (LON:SMIN) were delivered to hospitals on Sunday.

Other devices are currently going through testing, including newly designed products. The government has said it will confirm orders once the new devices pass approvals and have confirmed delivery schedules.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - The most powerful medicine being used to bolster the morale of New York area healthcare workers at the epicenter of the U.S. novel coronavirus crisis may well be music.
Daily infusions of upbeat songs from The Beatles' classic ""Here Comes the Sun"" to the theme from the hang-tough movie ""Rocky"" are being pumped through hospital public address systems to boost the spirits of nurses, doctors and support staff.
About 545,000 people were diagnosed with COVID-19 in the United States as of Sunday, and roughly 21,600 have died of the highly contagious illness.
A 4:30 p.m. daily dose of Australian pop singer Starley's ""Call On Me"" has given strength to staff at one of Mount Sinai's hospitals in New York City, who clap as a growing number of patients are discharged from the overwhelmed facility across the street from Columbia University.
""Some people would say to accept their fate. Well if this is fate then we'll find a way to cheat,"" Starley sings. ""You know you can call on me, if you can't stop the tears from falling down."" 
In New Jersey, the ""Rocky"" theme song filled the air at St. Joseph Regional Medical Center in Paterson when Dr. James Pruden, the hospital's director of emergency preparedness, was discharged last week as he recovered from the virus, rolling in his wheelchair past cheering staff. 
On New York's Long Island, the joyful ""Here Comes the Sun"" blasts overhead on the public address system at Mount Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside every time a COVID-19 patient is discharged.
In Detroit, one of the newest U.S. hot spots for the fast-spreading disease, a Beaumont Health nurse said the 1969 Beatles hit was played not just when patients are discharged but each time they are taken off a ventilator to breath on their own.

Reverend Jim Cawthon, 46, said he expects hundreds to spend Easter services in their cars in the megachurch's parking lot, watching the proceedings on big outdoor screens and listening to its broadcast over local radio.
More will likely watch online, which Cawthon said should be easier as the church recently upgraded its video and internet systems.
""Just prior to this all going crazy, we were already set us up,"" Cawthon said. ""It's all about the cross and celebrating Easter even in a pandemic.""
Some older adults in retirement communities are celebrating Holy Week by playing music and video broadcasts of services. Some communities are holding contests, asking residents to decorate golf carts for Easter and leave them parked outside for judging, instead of holding annual golf cart Easter parades.
Curtis James, a youth pastor at the Tate Springs Baptist Church in Arlington, Texas, dreamed up the idea of holding a safe Easter egg hunt for children with the online videogame Minecraft. Other churches have joined in as the plan has garnered national attention.
The Home Moravian Church in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, has held a sunrise Easter service for almost 250 years, weathering even the Revolutionary and Civil Wars, as well as the two World Wars. But for the pandemic, the service is canceled and will be replaced by an online and locally broadcast service with just a preacher and few choir and band members providing music.
A handful of churches have bucked social distancing rules aimed at slowing the disease's spread and plan to go on with services on Sunday, with some pastors predicting divine protection from the disease.
Most Catholic dioceses across the United States have shut down all in-person worship services. 
Archbishop Jose Gomez of the Los Angeles diocese wrote to priests and parishioners across the nation online to hold steadfast.
""Future generations will look back on this as the long Lent of 2020, a time when disease and death suddenly darkened the whole earth,"" he wrote, referring to the 40 day period that precedes Easter. ""This Holy Week will be different. Our churches may be closed but Christ is not quarantined and his Gospel is not in chains.""
In Columbus, Georgia, the St. Anne Catholic Church found a unique way to fill up its pews for Easter Sunday.
More than 650 parishioners of the 1,500 member congregation sent in ""selfie"" photos of themselves that the priests taped to the pews, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported.
""Now we look out and see faces,"" pastor Robert Schlageter told the newspaper.
Most United Methodist churches plan to close their doors and stream services on social media.
Allen Newton, an assistant district superintendent in the Alabama-West Florida United Methodist Foundation, which oversees 569 churches, has said in media interviews that he is disappointed.

""To preach on Easter Sunday is the pinnacle of the year for a pastor,"" he told the Tennessean newspaper. ""To not be able to do that weighs heavy on us.""

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 12, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Taiwan says Chinese carrier group drills close to island,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Chinese naval flotilla led by the country's first aircraft carrier passed by the eastern and southern coasts of Taiwan on Sunday to carry out drills, the island's defence ministry said, in the latest uptick in military tensions.
Democratically-ruled Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory, has complained of an increased Chinese military presence near the island in the past few weeks, and has told China is should be concentrating on fighting the new coronavirus rather than menacing the island.
Taiwan's Defence Ministry said the Liaoning, China's first operational aircraft carrier, and five accompanying warships passed first through the Miyako Strait, located between Japan's islands of Miyako and Okinawa, to the northeast of Taiwan, on Saturday.
On Sunday, the carrier group sailed in waters on Taiwan's east coast and then into seas to the south of Taiwan, carrying out exercises, the ministry added in a statement.
Taiwan's armed forces monitored the carrier group's progress throughout and ""completed relevant actions in response to ensure national security and protect regional peace and stability"", it added, without elaborating.
Taiwan typically scrambles fighter jets in response to Chinese manoeuvres.
There was no immediate response from China's Defence Ministry.
China's two aircraft carriers are no strangers to the waters around Taiwan.
In late December, shortly before presidential and parliamentary elections in Taiwan, China's newest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, a move condemned by Taiwan as attempted intimidation.
The U.S. military has also been active in waters near Taiwan recently.
A U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Friday, the same day that Chinese fighter jets drilled in waters close to the island.

Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue and a potential military flashpoint. China has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Clad in protective masks and gloves, a few dozen pious Orthodox Christians prayed for health on Sunday at the Bulgarian capital Sofia's expansive Saint Nedelya Cathedral, in one of the few nations where churches are open over the Easter holidays.
While most Bulgarians stayed home out of fear of the coronavirus pandemic, Spaska Gentcheva, a 48-year-old lawyer, said she was thankful to be allowed to attend the Palm Sunday service.
""We took a decision in my family,"" Gentcheva told Reuters. ""One family member would visit the church today and the rest are staying at home, keeping in mind the (coronavirus) measures.""
In an effort to contain the spread of highly contagious new disease, Sofia has closed schools, restaurants, bars and banned access to parks and inter-city travel. Bulgaria has reported 669 cases of the virus and 28 deaths.
But it has allowed public access to churches, unlike neighbouring Greece and Romania, also predominantly Orthodox Christian. The same rules will apply next Sunday, when the Orthodox world celebrates Easter. 
The Bulgarian Orthodox Church has agreed not to hand out blessed branches, a popular Palm Sunday custom, and has pledged to disinfect places of worship regularly, while the government urged people to celebrate from home. 
The willow branches are typically placed on the church altar, where a priest blesses them, and later woven into a wreath hung at home as a symbol of health and protection from evil.
The decision to keep churches open has sparked an intense debate on social media in Bulgaria, where many attend Easter services but are not regular churchgoers.
Many fear churches will become centres of contagion and pose risks to the most vulnerable - the elderly - jeopardising the collective effort to contain the disease.
Churches in the largest Orthodox country, Russia, were open on Sunday but the Russian Orthodox Church ordered temples in Moscow and the surrounding region to close their doors for ""big numbers of people"" during the Holy Week on April 13-19.
For Martin Zhekov, a Sofia fashion hairdresser, attending church on Palm Sunday was a need he could not brush aside.
""The church always gives solace, especially in these troubling times,"" he told Reuters. ""Nothing is like it used to be and nor will it be any time soon.""

Elsewhere, on what was Easter Sunday for other Christian denominations, Pope Francis delivered his Easter message to Roman Catholics from a empty St. Peter's Basilica in Rome, while just a handful of clerics gathered at Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the traditional site of Jesus' death and resurrection that is normally packed with pilgrims.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea called for tougher and more thorough countermeasures to keep citizens safe from the fast-spreading coronavirus at a meeting where leader Kim Jong Un presided, state media said on Sunday.
North Korea continues testing for the virus, with more than 500 people in quarantine, but has no confirmed infections yet, a country representative of the World Health Organization told Reuters this week.
The Korean Central News Agency said the virus had created obstacles to work on the economy, but the North had enforced consistent and compulsory ""strict top-class emergency anti-epidemic measures"" to maintain a stable situation.
At a meeting on Saturday, the political bureau of the central committee of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea adopted a resolution to take ""more thorough state measures"" to protect people's lives and safety against the pandemic, KCNA added.
It also aimed to step up emergency services nationwide against the outbreak and push ahead with economic construction, increasing the national defence capability and stabilising people's livelihoods this year, the agency said.
But state media photographs showed that none of those at the meeting, including Kim, wore masks or sat unusually far apart from each other.
Neighbouring South Korea reported 32 new infections by the end of Saturday, taking its tally to 10,512, with three more deaths for a total of 214, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
KCNA said part of Saturday's agenda was to have been presented to a meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, initially set for Friday, but it was not clear if the larger body had already met, or if not, when it is scheduled to do so.
Kim Yo Jong, Kim Jong Un's sister and a senior government official, was elected an alternate member of the Political Bureau, KCNA added.
In a separate report on Sunday, KCNA said Kim Jong Un expressed satisfaction at a drill of North Korea's pursuit assault aircraft that he oversaw, but suggested important tasks to ""further enhance combat efficiency"".
Agency photographs of the event showed some military officials wearing masks at the airfield, but not Kim.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - With Jerusalem under lockdown over coronavirus, Easter Sunday was marked at the traditional site of Jesus' death and resurrection by just a handful of Christian clerics.
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, normally packed with pilgrims, was closed to the public last month due to COVID-19, amid similar restrictions affecting sites sacred to Jews and Muslims.
After walking through a deserted Old City bathed in early morning sunlight, a purple-robed Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the Vatican’s apostolic administrator in the Holy Land, spoke briefly outside the church:
""Easter is a time for life. Despite the sign of death we are seeing everywhere, life will prevail, as long as someone is giving life out of love for the others. Happy Easter,"" he said, before entering the ancient sandstone building.
Carrying a face mask and flanked by aides, Pizzaballa then conducted a service with a small number of Roman Catholic clergymen.
COVID-19 has killed more than 100,000 worldwide. It has infected nearly 11,000 in Israel, with 103 fatalities, and there have been 268 cases and two deaths in the Palestinian territories.
Passover and Ramadan also fall this month, but this year Jerusalem is all but empty.
The Church of the Holy Sepulchre, on the site where Christians believe that Jesus spent his last few hours, is the focus of celebrations of Easter, the most important festival in the Christian calendar.
Tens of thousands of pilgrims usually walk the Via Dolorosa passing the 14 Stations of the Cross marking events leading up to Jesus' burial.
The church has reopened for Holy Week services attended only by senior clerics of the denominations who share custody of the site, the Greek Orthodox, Armenian and Roman Catholics.

Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter a week later, including the ceremony of the Holy Fire, which symbolizes the resurrection of Jesus after his death on the cross.

Clear blue skies lured people to popular areas across the territory over the long Easter weekend and many of them were without surgical masks. People in the city of 7.4 million have made a point of wearing masks in the past months.
""We always stay at home and it is quite boring,"" said Banny Mak, 24, a local resident.
""We are social animal(s), we need to go out for some fun. I think with proper protection (for) ourselves and to protect other people. I think it is already ok to go out.""
Hong Kong has recorded 1,005 cases of COVID-19, which has killed four people in the city.
It banned public gatherings of more than four people for 14 days from March 29, after recording the biggest daily increase in new COVID-19 infections, and later extended that restriction until April 23.
Police have been visible in some of the popular sites, although there were no signs or reports of arrests in a city where pro-democracy activists who clashed with security forces regularly last year have paused their demonstrations.
While Hong Kong, along with Singapore and Taiwan, have been held up as examples in their efforts to curb the coronavirus, the widespread flouting of social distancing rules over the weekend threatens to derail the city's efforts so far.
""I was a little bit scared when I was on the MTR (metro)... there were so many people,"" said resident Irene Chong, 24. ""I (am) concerned, but I wear mask and bring alcohol (disinfectant) and stuff.""
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Saturday, the Chinese-ruled city's leader Carrie Lam urged citizens to comply with social distancing orders in restaurants and said the government would ramp up checks.
""But the most important thing is that customers oblige by the rules. I hope everybody will feel at ease when eating, and go home early,"" she wrote.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - With the coronavirus capsizing Easter traditions, Australians and New Zealanders spent Sunday attending church services virtually, setting up camps in backyards and where the law and weather allowed – with physically distanced walks on beaches.
The pace of new coronavirus infections has slowed significantly in both countries in recent weeks, with New Zealand amidst wide-ranging lockdown measures and Australia's rigid enforcement of social-distancing rules.
According to Australia's health ministry, the number of new confirmed cases rose on Sunday by 51, the slowest rate in a month, to 6,289, while there have been 59 deaths. 
In New Zealand, the number of recovered cases of COVID-19 continues to be higher than the number of new infections, with 14 new cases on Sunday bringing the total to 1,049. Four people have died so far. 
""There is no place in the world I would rather be than Australia at the moment,"" Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said at a televised briefing on Sunday, urging, however, not to become complacent.
""We must maintain our strong position of social distancing.""
The popularity of New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison has risen, with both leaders hailed for their steps to contain the spread of the virus.
Unusually hot temperatures of near 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) in Western Australia have pushed people to the beach this weekend, but police said that physical distancing was respected. 
With the majority of beaches closed to the public, however, and public gatherings over two people banned, Australians have been forced to become creative, with widespread local media reports of families setting up camps in their backyards.
Churches and synagogues across Australia have offered their services online, as places of worships have been closed due to the pandemic.
On Sunday, with Victoria extending its state of emergency for another four weeks, 112 Australians and New Zealanders from the Greg Mortimer cruise ship that had been moored off Montevideo in Uruguay, landed in Melbourne. Some 60% of passengers on the ship tested positive for coronavirus. 
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg told ABC television that while there will be an uptick in unemployment and a hit to the economy because of the virus, it would be ""very dangerous"" to move ahead of medical advice and ease restrictions.
The government committed on Sunday more than A$18 billion ($11.2 billion) to universities this year, with Education Minister Dan Tehan saying prices for some short courses will be slashed to enable people to ""binge on studying"".

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged people to ""not yield to fear"" and focused on a ""message of hope"" as he led an Easter eve Mass in an empty St. Peter's Basilica on Saturday amid the coronavirus pandemic and called for an end to wars.
The vigil, which normally takes place in a church packed with about 10,000 people, was attended by only about two dozen, including a few altar servers and a smaller-than-usual choir. Because of the coronavirus outbreak, it was scaled back to eliminate several traditional features, such as the baptism of adult converts and a long procession up the main aisle of Christendom's largest church.
Francis drew a comparison between the Gospel account of the women who found Jesus' tomb empty on the day Christians believe he rose from the dead and the uncertain state of the world today because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""Then too, there was fear about the future and all that would need to be rebuilt. A painful memory, a hope cut short. For them, as for us, it was the darkest hour,"" Francis said in his homily.
In countries around the world Catholics followed the papal service or Masses said by priests in their own empty churches and broadcast on television or over the internet.
""Do not be afraid, do not yield to fear: This is the message of hope. It is addressed to us, today. These are the words that God repeats to us this very night,"" Francis said.
He encouraged people to be ""messengers of life in a time of death,"" again condemning the arms trade and urging those better off to help the poor.
""Let us silence the cries of death, no more wars! May we stop the production and trade of weapons, since we need bread, not guns,"" Francis said.
""Let the abortion and killing of innocent lives end. May the hearts of those who have enough be open to filling the empty hands of those who do not have the bare necessities,"" he said.
All of the pope's Holy Week activities were modified, taking place with no participation by the public. 
It will be the same for the culminating event on Easter Sunday, when Francis says Mass and delivers his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) blessing and message.

The Easter Sunday Mass usually attracts up to 100,000 people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ). This year, it will be held inside the church with a symbolic congregation of fewer than 20 people.

A 28-day mandate to put together a governing coalition, following an inconclusive March 2 election, expires on April 14. Gantz, an ex-armed forces chief who heads the centrist Blue and White party, asked President Reuven Rivlin for a 14-day extension to the mandate.
Gantz had run on a promise not to serve in a government with Netanyahu, citing the prime minister’s indictment on corruption charges. Netanyahu denies those charges. 
But in a reversal that dismayed many of his supporters, Gantz said the coronavirus crisis had made a national emergency government with Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud party an imperative.
""The political, health and social crisis have brought me to the decision that even at a heavy political and personal price, I will do all I can to establish a government with the Likud,"" Gantz wrote in a letter to the president, published by his party.
Rivlin gave no immediate word on whether he would grant more time to Gantz, who in his letter said the two political rivals appeared close to a final agreement. 
According to Israeli media reports, the parties have already agreed on a power-sharing deal in which Netanyahu would serve as prime minister for 18 months, after which Gantz would take over. Israel has held three inconclusive elections since last April.

With more than 10,000 reported cases of COVID-19 and 101 deaths, Israel's tight restrictions on movement aimed at curbing the coronavirus spread have forced many businesses to shut down and have sent unemployment rates soaring to about 25%.

""Having to tell you that we cannot bring our schools back for the remainder of this school year is painful, but I can also tell you it is the right thing to do,"" he told a news conference. 
De Blasio had ordered public schools shut beginning March 16 to curb the spread of the disease, with an initial goal of reopening by April 20. But the mayor said it soon became clear that goal was unrealistic as the city emerged as a major U.S. coronavirus hot spot. 
A few hours later, New York state Governor Andrew Cuomo pushed back on the mayor's announcement, saying there had been no decision on school closures. 
Cuomo said de Blasio could not unilaterally close New York City's schools without coordinating with the rest of the metropolitan area, and insisted the decision to reopen New York schools rested with him.
""It is my legal authority in this situation,"" the governor said in response to a reporter's question about whether closing schools in New York City fell under his authority over the city's mayor. 
The contrasting messages sowed confusion among some educators.

KABUL (Reuters) - The commander of U.S. forces in Afghanistan met Taliban leadership in Doha to discuss the need to reduce violence in the war-torn country, spokesmen for both sides said on Saturday, as continued clashes threaten to derail a fragile peace process.
The meeting between Taliban leaders and General Scott Miller, commander of U.S. forces and the NATO-led non-combat Resolution Support mission in Afghanistan, took place on Friday night. It came as the insurgent group accuses U.S. forces of breaching an agreement signed between the two sides in February. 
""General Miller met with Taliban leadership last night as part of the military channel established in the agreement,"" a spokesman for U.S. Forces in Afghanistan told Reuters. ""The meeting was about the need to reduce the violence,"" he said.
The February pact between the United States and the Taliban, under which international forces will withdraw in phases in exchange for Taliban security guarantees, is the best chance yet of ending the 18-year U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan.
The spokesman for the Taliban's political office in Doha also said on Twitter that the meeting discussed implementation of the agreement.
The Taliban last week accused U.S. forces of supporting Afghan security operations in some parts of the country, and warned that such support could jeopardize the agreement.
The spokesman for the U.S. forces described the latter's actions as defense of Afghan forces.
The Taliban are to sit for negotiations with an inclusive Afghan delegation as part of the agreement, but a prisoner exchange preceding the talks has hit snags. 

The Afghan government released a total of 200 Taliban prisoners on Wednesday and Thursday, but the insurgent group had walked away from the exchange process saying its demand on who was to be released first was not met.

1659,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",Congo governor condemns rising insecurity at mines in gold province,"JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Illegal mining and trading are fuelling worsening violence on mine sites, the governor of Democratic Republic of Congo's gold-rich Ituri province said, after armed robbers killed four people, including three Chinese nationals, at a gold mine.
The attack occurred around 0100 on the morning of April 5 at a gold site mined by the COMIDI cooperative in Irumu, 62km (39 miles) from the provincial capital Bunia, the governor said. 
It was first reported by China's official Xinhua news agency on Monday.
""We can only condemn in the strongest terms these awful acts which add to the list of thousands of victims of armed bandits in our province,"" Governor Jean Bamanisa Saidi said, in a letter seen by Reuters dated April 8.
President Felix Tshisekedi is trying to restore stability to Congo's eastern borderlands, a tinderbox of conflict among armed groups over ethnicity, natural resources and political power.
Gold is mined by artisanal mining cooperatives, typically using rudimentary tools and techniques, in Ituri, which borders Uganda and South Sudan.
Governor Bamanisa Saidi said most cooperatives and mining companies in the province do not report production figures, and minerals are illegally marketed, causing ""massive fraud"" of huge quantities of minerals.
Measures to curb the coronavirus worldwide have disrupted the supply chains artisanal gold miners depend on and dried up funding, causing local gold prices to slump to discounts of as much as 40% to the world price.
In one area of Ituri, 79 out of 85 gold trading houses have shut down because they have no one to sell to, research by Canadian natural resources NGO IMPACT found.
This presents an opportunity for illicit gold buyers capable of buying low and selling high, and is likely to fuel insecurity in DRC, IMPACT said.
""Various armed groups and political elites will begin competing for preferential access to these outside buyers but also for control of new territory (and mine sites),"" IMPACT executive director Joanne Lebert and consultant Alan Martin wrote in a report on Friday.

The nationwide call for citizens to stay home in the evenings follows the declaration of a state of emergency in Tokyo and six other prefectures last week. 
Abe has been gradually tightening guidance, seeking to lessen the impact on the economy as it is hammered by the pandemic, leading to criticism that he has been too slow to act and risks having the virus spread out of control.

Tokyo, the current center of Japan's coronavirus outbreak, identified more than 190 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, topping Friday's record high of 189 cases, NHK said.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 11, 2020 12:55AM ET</span>",Australia's Cardinal Pell urges Christians to embrace suffering: paper,"MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Suffering should be embraced and redeemed through service even when a result of a miscarriage of justice, Australia's Cardinal George Pell, who spent 404 days in jail before his sexual abuse conviction was overturned this week, wrote on Saturday. 
Reiterating his innocence, the highest-ranking Roman Catholic cleric to have been jailed in the church's child sex abuse crisis urged Christians to help those suffering during the coronavirus pandemic.
""Christians see Christ in everyone who suffers — victims, the sick, the elderly — and are obliged to help,"" Pell wrote in his Easter message in the Weekend Australian, accompanied by a photograph in which he wears his cardinal's robes. 
""I have just spent 13 months in jail for a crime I didn't commit, one disappointment after another (...) But with every blow it was a consolation to know I could offer it to God for some good purpose, like turning the mass of suffering into spiritual energy.""
A powerful government-appointed inquiry in 2017 found widespread instances of child abuse, often covered up, in several thousand Australian institutions, more than half of them religious.
""The sexual abuse crisis damaged thousands of victims,"" Pell, who was acquitted by the High Court on appeal, wrote in his piece. ""From many points of view the crisis is also bad for the Catholic church, but we have painfully cut out a moral cancer and this is good.""
He added, ""So, too, some would see COVID-19 as a bad time for those who claim to believe in a good and rational God."" 
Although fewer than a quarter of Australians declare themselves Catholic, the church has weathered the abuse scandals with the closure of a few parishes and its schools still enroll a fifth of all Australian students, government data shows. 
Before walking free on Tuesday, the 78-year-old Pell, a former Vatican treasurer and a polarizing figure in Australia for his conservative views, was serving a six-year sentence for sexually assaulting two teenaged choirboys in the 1990s.
""Everyone is confronted with a couple of questions,"" Pell wrote. ""What should I do in this situation? Why is there so much evil and suffering? And why did this happen to me? Why the coronavirus pandemic?""

1662,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 10:20PM ET</span>",U.S. Navy destroyer transits Taiwan Strait on same day as Chinese drills,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - A U.S. Navy guided-missile destroyer sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Friday, the U.S. and Taiwan militaries said, the same day that Chinese fighter jets drilled in waters close to the democratically-ruled island.
China, which considers Taiwan its own, has been angered by the Trump administration's stepped-up support for the island, such as more arms sales, U.S. patrols near it and a visit to Washington by Vice President-elect William Lai in February.
Taiwan and China are also embroiled in a bitter spat about the former's lack of membership of the World Health Organization during the coronavirus outbreak, because of objections by Beijing, which views it as merely a Chinese province.
The U.S. Pacific Fleet named the ship that sailed through the Taiwan Strait as the Arleigh Burke-class USS Barry.
""Barry is forward-deployed to the U.S. 7th Fleet area of operations in support of security and stability in the Indo-Pacific region,"" it said in a brief statement on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page on Saturday.
Taiwan's defense ministry said its armed forces monitored the ship as it sailed south through the waterway. It described the U.S. ship as being on an ""ordinary mission"".
Also on Friday, Taiwan said Chinese H-6 bombers and J-11 fighters again carried out drills above waters to its southwest. Taiwan's air force kept close watch, the ministry added.
Taiwan has repeatedly complained of China continuing to apply military pressure during the virus crisis.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial and diplomatic issue and Beijing has never ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. The narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the island from China is a frequent source of tension.
The U.S. navy has been stepping up patrols through the Strait, with its last less than a month ago, prompting China to say the United States was playing a dangerous game with its support for Taiwan.
The United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, but is the island's most important international supporter and main source of arms.
In January another U.S. warship sailed through the Strait less than a week after President Tsai Ing-wen won a landslide re-election on a platform of standing up to China.

""The pandemic hit us at a critical moment, when we were trying to get ahead after a very tough economic crisis,"" Moreno added in a televised speech. ""It hit us without a cent in the state's accounts.""
Ecuador reported more than 2,196 new infections in one day on Friday, raising the total number to 7,161. Some 297 have died and another 311 were likely killed by the virus, according to official data.
The government has said deaths could reach 3,500 due to the outbreak in the province of Guayas, where the epicenter of the country's outbreak is located, which accounts for 70% of infections.
The humanitarian assistance account will be funded, in part, by a contribution of five percent of profits from companies that earned more than a million dollars. The money will serve to finance smaller companies that require capital.
The other funds will come from a progressive contribution based on workers' monthly income for nine months. The contribution will be for those who earn more than $500 per month.
""So those who earn less, pay less and those who earn more, pay more. With their contribution, we will be able to protect almost two million poor families in Ecuador,"" Moreno explained, indicating that the resources will be managed outside the government.
The fall in oil prices and the pandemic have created liquidity problems for the country, which is also facing a crisis in its oil sector due to the rupture of two pipelines.
Moreno added that he will send the National Assembly a package of reforms to avoid evictions due to delays in paying rent, health coverage in social security and the expansion of unemployment insurance.
He also announced the country would receive new multilateral financing to grant credit to companies that need liquidity under special conditions, without detailing the amounts.

Moreno reiterated his strategy to restructure external debt, which he said exceeds $65 billion dollars, and will include an agreement to reduce payments, without giving further details.

Pompeo must within seven days ""initiate a plan to impose the visa sanctions"" if the Homeland Security Department determines a country not accepting returnees is delaying or impeding operations ""necessary to respond to the ongoing pandemic.""

The Trump administration implemented new border rules on March 21, citing the coronavirus pandemic.
Under those rules, U.S. officials can quickly remove people without standard immigration proceedings. Overall, U.S. border officials have expelled nearly 7,000 migrants to Mexico since the new procedures took effect, Reuters reported this week.

Trump has made restricting immigration a central goal of his administration.

An armed group on Monday stormed a control station at Shwerif, stopping water from being pumped and threatening workers, the Great Man Made River Project, which supplies water to much of Libya, said in a statement. 
The armed group is seeking to use the water cut-off as pressure to force the release of detained family members, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Yacoub El Hillo said in a statement. 
The supply has been cut to more than 2 million people in Tripoli and nearby towns and cities. 
Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA), has been under assault for a year by the eastern-based Libyan National Army of Khalifa Haftar. 
An escalation in fighting since mid-March has involved intense bombardment, particularly in the south of the city near the front lines, with projectiles hitting a hospital. 
The warfare has hindered efforts to prepare Libya's already tattered health system for an outbreak of the coronavirus, with 24 cases confirmed in the country. State efforts to slow the spread of the disease have included a curfew. 
Electricity supply has also been repeatedly cut in Tripoli and some other areas over the past week. 
""At this moment when Libya is fighting the threats of the COVID-19 pandemic, access to water and electricity is more than ever life saving, and such individual acts to collectively punish millions of innocent people are abhorrent and must stop immediately,"" Hillo said.

1666,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 06:49PM ET</span>","Empty churches, food drive mark start of Easter weekend in coronavirus-hit U.S.","By Gabriella Borter and Liz Hampton
NEW YORK (Reuters) - As American Christians began Easter weekend under threat of the coronavirus, political leaders and health experts on Friday cautioned the faithful not to gather in churches or relax social distancing practices.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert and other health officials pointed to declining rates of coronavirus hospitalizations and need for intensive care - particularly in hardest-hit New York - as signs that social distancing measures are paying off.
""Now is no time to back off,"" Fauci told CNN on Friday. ""The virus will decide"" when the country can reopen, he added.
Those measures continue to take an enormous toll on the economy - some economists are forecasting job losses of up to 20 million in April - raising questions about how long business closures and travel restrictions can be sustained.
However, were U.S. officials to lift shelter-in-place orders after 30 days, the nation's death total could reach 200,000, the New York Times reported, citing new projections from the departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services. An influential university model this week had lowered the U.S. death projection to 60,000 if social distancing continued. 
The United States has by far the world's most confirmed coronavirus cases, at more than 485,000, with over 18,100 deaths. Only Italy has had more fatalities.
After three days of record daily death rates, New York state's COVID-19 tally was 777 on April 9, down from 799 deaths a day earlier, Governor Andrew Cuomo reported on Friday. But New York's intensive care unit admissions declined ""for the first time since we started this journey,"" he said.
In Michigan, more than 200 people died from COVID-19 in the last day. ""We are not out of the woods yet,"" Governor Gretchen Whitmer said.
At his daily White House briefing, however, President Donald Trump said he was getting fewer calls from governors urgently seeking equipment and help.
Meanwhile, with more than 90% of the country under stay-at-home orders, the holiest weekend on the Christian calendar began with services livestreamed or broadcast. Many churches sat empty on Good Friday, when they would typically be overflowing with worshippers.
""We gather normally at Easter to worship. We gather for children's Easter egg hunts, for family meals, with friends. We can't do any of that this year,"" said New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy at his daily coronavirus briefing.
Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot, on CNN, also urged people not to attend church. ""You can express your faith in lots of different ways, but it can't be by congregating.""
Churches are devising different ways to reach the faithful. One megachurch in South Carolina is turning to the model of once popular drive-in movies, with services shown on a big screen and broadcast via radio to worshippers in their cars. 
A handful of holdout U.S. churches plan to hold in-person services on Easter Sunday, saying their right to worship in person outweighs public health officials' warnings that they may be spreading more than just the Gospel by holding large gatherings.
""Satan and a virus will not stop us,"" said the Reverend Tony Spell, pastor of the evangelical Life Tabernacle Church near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He expects more than 2,000 to gather at his megachurch on Sunday.
FOOD DRIVE DRAWS THOUSANDS
Friday also ends another week of missed paychecks for millions of Americans, with restaurants, businesses, entertainment venues and schools shuttered across the nation.
In Los Angeles, some 5,000 families waited at the city's Forum arena to pick up food in a Good Friday donation drive.
“This is slated to be our biggest distribution to date,” said Michael Flood, head of the LA Regional Food Bank. ""It's continuing to demonstrate just how many families and individuals the current economic conditions have hit.""
New York plans to open coronavirus testing sites in five minority neighborhoods to improve testing in a population that has been hit disproportionately hard. Several U.S. states have reported COVID-19 deaths among blacks and Hispanics far higher than their portion of the population.
""African Americans comprise 70% of the deaths but only comprise about 33% of the state's population,"" said Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, whose state has reported 755 deaths.
Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) said it would work with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to create contact tracing technology that alerts people when they have been in close proximity with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19, the sometimes deadly respiratory illness caused by the virus.
Another group pummeled by the virus are prison inmates with hundreds of infections and several deaths reported among inmates in Chicago, New York and Louisiana.
New Jersey's Murphy said he signed an executive order to expedite parole for inmates who pose a low public risk.
Despite some reasons for optimism, healthcare workers in New York and other coronavirus hotspots have seen a wave of demoralizing deaths this week. 
Emily Muzyka, a nurse at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, has held patients' hands through final breaths in the past, but things have changed.
""If I have to do that now,"" she said, ""it will be through gloves.""

Announcing the reward, the U.S. State Department said Kawtharani had ""taken over some of the political coordination of Iran-aligned paramilitary groups"" formerly organized by Soleimani, an Iranian Revolutionary Guard commander killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad in January.
""In this capacity, he facilitates the actions of groups operating outside the control of the Government of Iraq that have violently suppressed protests, attacked foreign diplomatic missions, and engaged in wide-spread organized criminal activity,"" it said in a statement.
The State Department said it was offering the sum for information on Kawtharani's activities, networks and associates as part of an effort to disrupt the ""financial mechanisms"" of the Lebanese-based Hezbollah.
Kawtharani was branded a global terrorist by the United States in 2013, accused of funding armed groups in Iraq and helping transport Iraqi fighters to Syria to join President Bashar al-Assad's effort to put down a revolt against his rule.
Reuters reported in February that according to two Iraqi sources and a senior Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim leader, Kawtharani for now was seen as the most suitable figure to direct Iraqi militias until a permanent Iranian successor could be chosen, although he did not have Soleimani's clout.
""Kawtharani has connections with the militia groups,"" the Shi'ite leader said. ""He was trusted by Soleimani, who used to depend and call on him to help him in crises and in meetings in Baghdad.""

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Istanbul, Ankara and other major Turkish cities locked down for two days from midnight on Friday to combat the spread of the coronavirus under an Interior Ministry order, as the country's death toll from the pandemic rose above 1,000.
The restrictions were imposed in 31 provinces across the country and scaled up existing curbs, under which people under the age of 20 and over 65 have been told to stay at home. [nL8N2BR6WH]
Ankara has also halted all international flights, restricted domestic travel, closed schools, bars and cafes, and suspended mass prayers. But people have still been going to work to sustain economic activity.
""We urge all citizens who live in these 31 provinces to comply with this weekend's lockdown without panicking,"" the country's communications director Fahrettin Altun wrote on Twitter.
He called on people to maintain their social distance in the brief time before the lockdown went into effect. However, soon after news of the move emerged, many people left their homes to buy food and drink in the country's commercial hub Istanbul, a city of 16 million people.
Earlier on Friday, before the lockdown was announced, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca had urged people to resist the temptation to leave their homes during the weekend as the weather warms.
Confirmed cases of COVID-19 increased by 4,747 and 98 people died in the last 24 hours, bringing the total death toll to 1,006, Koca said. [I7N29F02Q]
Detailing specifics of the lockdown in a subsequent statement, the Interior Ministry said bakeries, pharmacies and health facilities would be among places excluded from the ban, enabling people to meet essential needs.
Strategic energy companies, distribution firms and some petrol stations would also be allowed to keep operating and people working in such places were exempted from the lockdown, it said.
""It is essential that all other citizens remain in their homes aside from the specified exemptions,"" the statement said.
The new curbs, which extended across provinces from Istanbul and Kocaeli in the northwest to Diyarbakir and Van in the southeast, will remain in force until midnight (2100 GMT) on Sunday, the ministry said.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday that the number of coronavirus patients in intensive care units across the state dropped in the last day, offering a glimmer of hope that the surge in critical care hospitalizations might be leveling off.
Cuomo said there were 17 fewer patients in the state's intensive care units on Thursday than a day prior. This was the first time that group of patients has decreased in a day since the outbreak took hold and a sign that social distancing measures are successfully reducing the virus' spread. 
New York, the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States, has recorded 7,844 deaths from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, nearly half of the total across the United States.
""What we do will affect, literally, life and death for hundreds of people,"" Cuomo said during a media briefing, adding state officials were ""cautiously optimistic"" because of the lowering of some hospitalization trends.
""Keep doing what we're doing. Stay home because that works. We are flattening the curve,"" he said.
There were 290 new hospital admissions in a day, above the 200 admitted a day earlier but far less than just over a week ago when more than 1,400 New Yorkers were hospitalized for the coronavirus in a day, Cuomo said.
The number of deaths in New York per day from coronavirus continues to hover in the high 700s, with 777 deaths recorded in the last day compared to 799 a day prior.
While New York has tested some 390,000 people for the coronavirus, more than any other state, Cuomo said the limited availability of testing could delay the reopening of businesses and travel. 
The federal government should use the Defense Production Act to increase U.S. testing capabilities, he said, adding New York, Connecticut and New Jersey would join any effort to get testing ""up to scale.""

""We need an unprecedented mobilization where the government can produce these tests in the millions,"" Cuomo said.

Costa questioned whether ""there is anyone who wants to be left out"" of the EU or the 19-member euro zone.

A prison guard was attacked during the incident and has since been hospitalised, the regional office of the Federal Penitentiary Service said in a statement on Friday. 
""Currently the situation in the facility is under control,"" it said. 
A video shared by Russia's Investigative Committee on YouTube on Friday showed flames towering over several smaller buildings at the prison, Penal Colony 15. In another clip it showed hundreds of prisoners, surrounded by guards, gathered outside a main building of the prison.
It was unclear what set off the fire.
The violence broke out on Thursday evening after a prisoner, who was being held in an isolation cell after violating prison rules, refused to allow guards to conduct a search, the Irkutsk region penitentiary service said in its statement.
""Convicts in neighbouring isolation cells began breaking security cameras lenses and using the shards of glass to cut their forearms,"" the service said.

The main instigators of the riot, around 16 or 17 people, have been blocked off in one building, Interfax cited the source as saying. 
""Work is undergoing to render them not dangerous,"" the source was quoted as saying. ""Three buildings are currently on fire. Staff are trying to put them out.""
It was unclear if the fire was still raging on Friday evening.

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's anti-graft agency has criticised a letter from a powerful U.S. senator questioning the return to Nigeria of more than $300 million in funds looted by former military ruler General Sani Abacha.
The dispute, relating to a tri-partite agreement signed in February between the United States, the British dependency of Jersey and Nigeria, casts doubt on the extent to which the United States will aid efforts to move cash back to the West African country.
Abacha ruled Africa's largest oil producer from 1993 until his death in 1998. Corruption watchdog Transparency International estimates he stole as much as $5 billion of public money during that time, though he was never charged with corruption while he was alive.
Nigeria has been working with governments worldwide in recent years to help repatriate some of the funds stolen by Abacha and boost its finances.
President Muhammadu Buhari has also made tackling corruption a priority since taking office in 2015. Endemic graft among the political elite dating back decades has left most Nigerians mired in poverty, despite the country being Africa's biggest economy.
U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley earlier this month wrote to the head of the U.S. Justice Department's anti-money laundering unit asking for proof that funds returned to Nigeria would go toward infrastructure projects, as its government has stated. 
Grassley accused Ibrahim Magu, head of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and Attorney General Abubakar Malami of using their roles as an ""enforcement arm against anyone voicing opposition to Buhari's government.""
The EFCC, in a statement issued on Friday, said it ""would not be dragged into any controversy over an allegation that has no fact or any iota of proof.""
""The Commission remains focused on its mandate against economic and financial crimes and will not be deterred by spurious allegations from individuals with hidden agenda,"" EFCC spokesman Tony Orilade said in the statement.
Grassley said ""it seems odd that the (U.S.) DOJ would help facilitate the payment of $320 million to the Nigerian government without first insisting on proper safeguards to prevent the further misuse of funds.""
""Given all these circumstances, it is critical for Congress to understand what steps the United States government is taking, before it helps transfer hundreds of millions of dollars to Nigeria, to ensure that the money is not fuelling more corruption and government abuses.""

A spokesman for Malami also rejected Grassley's allegations, and said the government's anti-corruption battle was ""impartial, objective and non-discriminatory.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - When U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper rang his South Korean counterpart this week, he pressed for a deal quickly on defense cost-sharing that President Donald Trump expects will translate into much higher contributions from Seoul.
But current and former U.S. officials say privately there appears to be little hope of clinching a new agreement in the coming days, and some wonder about the coming weeks and months. 
Trump, they say, already rejected what was probably Seoul's best offer ahead of its mid-April parliamentary elections - an increase of at least 13% from the previous accord, two of the officials said.
That offer and decision to reject it by the U.S. president, the details of which have not been previously reported, leaves the United States and South Korea at an impasse, even as outbreaks of the coronavirus threaten to undermine U.S.-South Korean military readiness for any potential conflict with North Korea.
But experts on the U.S.-South Korean relationship say the greater risk is damaging the alliance, born out of the Korean War, which still remains popular in South Korea. 
Some 28,500 American troops are deployed to South Korea, in what is seen as a deterrent to Pyongyang that also sends a message to China about U.S. influence and capability in Asia. 
Trump's view that wealthy South Korea, which has an economy larger than Australia's, is taking advantage of the United States is increasingly being met in Seoul by a perception that Washington has become a transactional partner with unreasonable demands.
""The current gridlock is there because they made excessive demands in the first place,"" said one South Korean official with knowledge of the talks.
Trump's decision to reject the South Korean offer came last week after consultations with Esper and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, officials say. It followed months of intense negotiations that saw South Korea eventually propose to pay more money than ever before as part of a new Special Measures Agreement (SMA). 
But Seoul's proposed increase was far below even the substantially lowered expectations of the Trump administration, who had initially sought an exponential increase to as much $5 billion from the roughly $900 million South Korea agreed to in the last one-year, cost-sharing agreement.
""That's not a small amount of money even if we did offer a 13 percent hike,"" the South Korean official said, adding that while it fell short of the $5 billion floated by the United States, ""to us, that was a non-starter in the first place.""
Esper and Pompeo argued that South Korea was paying for no more than a third of the costs most directly associated with the stationing of U.S. forces on the Korean Peninsula, not to mention other American military and intelligence assets associated with its defense.
""We were very disappointed that we couldn't get to something that was mutually acceptable,"" one of the U.S. officials said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
In one sign of just how fraught the negotiations had been at their start, Reuters has learned that South Korea last year actually presented an offer to cut its contribution.
The proposal on Nov. 19, which has not been previously reported, offended the U.S. delegation in Seoul, which cut short the talks, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The South Korean official denied a proposed cut but could not recall the exact reason for the abrupt U.S. move.
The standoff raises a long unanswered question about what the United States might do, if anything, should South Korea fail to make an offer acceptable to Trump, who has made no secret of his displeasure at the cost of deploying troops overseas. 
The Pentagon declined comment on the talks, referring queries to the State Department, which is leading the negotiations. The State Department and White House also declined comment on the closed-door discussions. 
Trump administration officials stressed that talks were ongoing.
""The President has been clear in the expectation that our allies around the world, including South Korea, can and should contribute more,"" one of the officials said, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
PRESSURE OF CORONAVIRUS 
What was meant to be the final phase of negotiations in mid-March came even as the United States imposed dramatic travel restrictions over the coronavirus that made all but the most essential engagements off-limits.
That raised questions about whether in-person talks between the U.S. and South Korean delegations to be held in Los Angeles would go ahead. But they did. 
South Korean negotiators obtained travel waivers and made their way to the city, the first U.S. official said.
When Seoul finally delivered its offer, it was underwhelming, according to multiple accounts of the conversations. Still, there was some hope that - given the urgent U.S. and South Korean focus on COVID-19 - the deal might be good enough.
""The one thing that gave everybody some wiggle room was COVID, right? ... So there's a public opening. And we don't do the deal,"" said a former U.S. official familiar with the discussions.
""This was the time,"" the former official said.
South Korea, held up as a model for containing the pandemic, has said it would make available test kits to the United States and help testing of U.S. troops in South Korea.
Democratic Congressman Eliot Engel, who leads the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said on Twitter that Trump should be working with allies on COVID-19 and should not ""extort friends.""
The first U.S. official said it was highly unlikely an agreement would be reached before South Korea's April 15 parliamentary elections.
    The official said there was concern that this could go well into summer and come closer to November's U.S. presidential election, perhaps making Trump less amenable to lowering his demands. 
FURLOUGHS
    One of the most tangible results of the breakdown in the talks has been the roughly 4,000 South Korean workers on U.S. bases furloughed as a result of the failure to reach a deal by an April 1 deadline. The United States says it needs the South Korean cost-sharing contributions to help pay their wages.
Abraham Denmark, a former U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for East Asia, said this was the first time furloughs had been carried out since the alliance was created in 1953. 
But the impact has not been as visible as it might have been in South Korea, in part due to the coronavirus - which has hampered the furloughed workers' ability to gather in public to protest.
Son Gio, secretary-general of the (U.S. Forces Korea) Korean Employees Union, said his group was staging daily one-person protests near bases and in front of the U.S. embassy ""because of a (government) ban on demonstrations.""
The top U.S. commander in South Korea, U.S. Army General Robert Abrams, released a statement https://www.usfk.mil/Media/News/Article/2132718/usfk-cdr-addresses-furloughed-korean-national-employees, calling the furloughs ""an unfortunate day for us."" He added that they were ""unthinkable"" and ""heartbreaking.""
Still, the furloughs have not had as much impact on bases as they might have, in part because Esper authorized Abrams to retain essential South Korean workers tied to life, health, safety, and minimum readiness. The bases are also less active, given coronavirus-related closures.
That raises questions about whether the United States and South Korea, which are more focused on the coronavirus than cost-sharing talks, will feel pressure to resolve the matter quickly.

""Unfortunately it seems like this just could drag on,"" said Bruce Klingner, a South Korea expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation think-tank.

CHENNAI (Reuters) - Six people were missing after a fly ash dyke gave way at a coal-fired power plant in the Singrauli district of India's Madhya Pradesh state on Friday, a local official told Reuters.
It was the third such incident in the district in a year, the official said.
Five villagers and a worker at the site owned by Reliance Power were swept up in a flow of fly ash which travelled at least six kilometres, swallowing up whole agricultural fields along the way.
Fly ash is a powdery byproduct of burning pulverised coal.
""The sludge flowed from the dyke and then mixed with a stream, which carried it further,"" said K.V.S. Chaudhary, the top local official in the Singrauli district.
Another local official, who was not authorised to speak to the media, said ""strict action"" would be taken against Reliance Power in line with environmental laws, but did not elaborate.
The 4,000 megawatt (MW) plant was running at full capacity and was not expected to shut, he said.
It was not clear how the dyke broke and Reliance Power said it was investigating the causes of the incident, adding the plant would continue to operate normally independent of relief operations.
Local media reported a fly ash dyke break at a plant operated by Essar in August and another run by NTPC Ltd in October.

Bolsonaro, 65, a far-right former army captain, says the isolation measures mandated by state governors and his own public health officials are an unnecessary drag on the economy. Bolsonaro's popularity has fallen during the coronavirus crisis, with a growing number of Brazilians angered by his stance toward a disease he calls a ""little cold."" 
On Friday, a national holiday in Brazil, Bolsonaro went to a military hospital, before stopping at a pharmacy and then visiting one of his sons in a residential building, according to TV images and press reports. 
At one of the stops, he was greeted by supporters who snapped photos and called his name. However, he was also subjected to criticism, with some Brasilia residents banging pots and pans in anger. 

Critics say that Bolsonaro's stance is chipping away at social distancing measures across Brazil. On Thursday, Reuters reported that lockdowns in Brazil's largest cities to slow the coronavirus outbreak are beginning to slip.

Nay Myo Lin, the editor-in-chief of Voice of Myanmar, was charged under sections of the Terrorism Act last week by a court in the second largest city, Mandalay, over a March 27 interview with the AA, which is waging a war in the conflict-torn western Rakhine region.
Mandalay police declined to comment on his release when contacted by phone. Reuters was unable to contact the court for comment. A government spokesman declined to comment.
The government declared the AA a terrorist group last month after more than a year of intense fighting against the organization, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine majority and seeks greater autonomy for the region. 
In the March 27 article, the group’s spokesman gave his views about the designation.
Nay Myo Lin told Reuters that police had told him they would not prosecute the case under the Terrorism Act, but that he had been asked to sign an agreement vowing to cooperate with any further questioning and had done so.
Myanmar’s army has filed several cases in recent years against reporters and news organizations covering the conflict in Rakhine, where about 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a military crackdown in 2017.

Myanmar’s army filed a criminal complaint against Reuters in early March over a story about the conflict in Rakhine. It later said it would withdraw the complaint.

So far two vending machines have been installed in Warsaw and five in Krakow and there are plans to install several dozen or maybe even several hundred more in the next two weeks, according to the Polish Vending Association, which launched the initiative. 
From April 16, all Poles will be required to cover their mouth and nose in public spaces, health minister Lukasz Szumowski said on Thursday as the government extended lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus.
The masks on sale in the vending machines are priced at 8.8 zlotys ($2.11) apiece.
Poland has reported 5,742 cases of the coronavirus, and 175 deaths. On Thursday the government said businesses will remain locked down until April 19 and limits for schools, as well as rail and air transport, will be extended for another two weeks.
Aleksander Wasik, head of the Polish Vending Association, which represents vending machine makers and distributors in Poland, said he wanted to make sure that his employees keep their jobs. He used his industry contacts to get the machines up and running to provide what is most needed during a pandemic: protective equipment. 
""What happened just now is a massive blow to everyone. Many (vending machine) operators became depressed because they were already seeing the possibility of bankruptcies,"" he said. 
The initiative is applauded by the customers.

""I think if it lasts any longer, this whole state of the epidemic, it would come in handy, I see a lot of people coming, there's interest,"" said Pawel Kasprzycki, 67, who bought a mask at one of the vending machine's in Warsaw.

1680,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 11:42AM ET</span>","In epicentre of French virus outbreak, medical workers believe peak has passed","By Tangi Salaün
PARIS (Reuters) - As head of the urgent cases team in the Mulhouse ambulance service, Marc Noizet has been at the eye of the coronavirus storm that swept through this eastern French city. In the past few days, he has noticed a change.
""Things are getting better,"" he said of the region around Mulhouse, the epicentre of France's deadliest outbreak. His crews are being called out to fewer coronavirus-related cases. ""That allows the staff to rest a bit, to take a breath.""
Public health officials in the Grand-Est region, near France's border with Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg, say it is premature to say the crisis is over, but they believe they have passed the peak of the epidemic.
The virus hit the region earlier and harder than anywhere else in France, in large part because of a five-day prayer gathering at an evangelical church in Mulhouse where dozens of worshippers were infected.
The more positive trend now could provide a roadmap for how other regions and countries still in the thick of the outbreak will eventually emerge.
The number of people in intensive care units in the Grand-Est region being treated for coronavirus is ticking down; as of Thursday it was 937 people, 13 fewer than a day earlier. That was the sixth consecutive day the figure had fallen.
The total death toll has kept rising this week, but the rate of increase has slowed. On the worst day of the outbreak, April 3, 141 people died. On April 9, 82 people died.
""We can say that we passed the peak,"" said Laurent Tritsch, chief doctor of the fire and rescue service in the Lower Rhine, part of the Grand-Est region.
France as a whole has more than 86,000 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and has registered more than 12,210 deaths, the fourth highest death toll in the world after Italy, Spain and the United States.
TURNING POINT
For weeks, the number of new critical cases in the Grand-Est region was rising faster than beds were becoming available. Hundreds of sick people were evacuated by train, plane and helicopter to be treated in other parts of France or Europe.
According to Tritsch, whose service helps transport sick patients to hospital, the graph inverted on March 28, when new intensive care beds coming on stream outstripped the increase in critical cases.
On April 6, a medically-equipped French air force Airbus A330 stood on the tarmac at Luxembourg airport. Next to it were five ambulances that had brought coronavirus patients from the eastern French city of Metz. The pilot's mission was to fly them to the Czech city of Brno, where they were to be treated.
But the pilot received an order to abort the mission. French officials had decided there were spare intensive care beds in the Grand-Est city of Nancy, so the evacuation was no longer needed, according to a French government source.
Though a turning point has been reached, no one in the region is celebrating. Healthcare workers are exhausted after a month on constant duty, many of their colleagues are sick, and the virus could come back if restrictions on movement are relaxed, medical professionals say. 

""We're not crying victory,"" said Fabien Trabold, chief doctor of the Upper Rhine fire and rescue service.

1681,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 11:35AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Amneal running out of hydroxychloroquine raw material due to Finnish restrictions,"By Michael Erman and Anne Kauranen
NEW YORK/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Amneal Pharmaceuticals could soon run out of the raw ingredients to make more of the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine that has been touted as a potential treatment for COVID-19 because Finland is keeping the drug for domestic use, according to the generic drugmaker's chief executives.
Amneal has committed to producing about 20 million hydroxychloroquine tablets by mid-April, but will face challenges making any more after that because of difficulties acquiring active pharmaceutical ingredients from its supplier in Finland, co-CEOs Chirag and Chintu Patel said in an interview.
""As the demand has increased all across the globe... the Finnish government has put out an emergency order to prioritize their domestic use for local needs,"" co-CEO Chintu Patel said in an interview on Tuesday.
Hydroxychloroquine is a decades-old drug promoted by many, including U.S. President Donald Trump, as a potential weapon against COVID-19. It has become a standard of care in areas of the United States hit hard by the pandemic, even though doctors prescribing it have no idea whether it works.
Demand for the drug has soared worldwide and some countries, like India, have placed restrictions on its export. Amneal currently manufactures hydroxychloroquine in India and the brothers said the company was working with India to provide an exception to ship its finished product to the U.S.
Finland has not yet issued any bans or restrictions on drug exports, according to the Finnish medicines agency Fimea. 
But even under normal circumstances, Finnish law requires pharmaceutical companies to commit themselves to fulfilling national needs first. Because the demand for hydroxychloroquine and its active agents has surged in Finland, Finnish makers have less to export, Fimea said.
""The increased national need may impact the schedules of export deliveries, even if no export restrictions have been issued by the government,"" Fimea Director Johanna Nystedt said in an email. ""Surely every country hopes to obtain more hydroxychloroquine at the moment and therefore its makers’ order books are certainly full.""
The Finnish government, on the basis of the state of emergency it has issued, is preparing an amendment which if adopted would allow restricting exports of certain medicines.
Orion Corp and its subsidiary Fermion are the two Finnish companies that make hydroxychloroquine and its raw materials. Fermion is Amneal's supplier, according to a source familiar with the matter.
Orion said in a statement that securing its own raw materials from abroad is challenging and it would be pleased if it could deliver more.
""Finnish authorities have far-reaching rights to intervene in the operations of the actors in our field of business. In the exceptional situation Finland’s needs have priority,"" Orion said. ""Demand for the agent in question (API) is heavy around the world at the moment but unfortunately we cannot respond to the demand commensurately.""
Amneal said it is working to source the raw materials elsewhere, and is trying to get its Brookhaven, NY, manufacturing site FDA-approved to make more products, including hydroxychloroquine. Amneal has said it is donating more than 6.5 million of the tablets to New York, Texas, Louisiana and hospitals across the country.
Chintu Patel said he believes the supply issues will ease up in two or three months. 

""There are multiple suppliers, but worldwide demand, so people are allocating their inventory and we are in the process of qualifying more than one supplier so we can do what we can to help in this crisis situation,"" he said.

Lopez Obrador told a regular government news conference that he spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday and asked him to sell Mexico 10,000 ventilators and 10,000 monitors to care for coronavirus patients.
""I told him that we know the very difficult situation they are going through, the lack of ventilators in general,"" he said. ""But I also expressed to him that they have more options. They have more plants, more technological development, and they have more economic resources.""
Lopez Obrador said Trump promised to consult with his administration and respond to the request on Friday.
Several large U.S. companies produce medical equipment and supplies in Mexico, taking advantage of lower manufacturing costs.
The Mexican leader ended the news conference early to hold a call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. Lopez Obrador said he would thank the Chinese president for the medical equipment China has already sold to Mexico and discuss the need to acquire more devices to avoid shortfalls.

On Tuesday, a plane with 10 tons of gloves and masks from China arrived in Mexico, and another aircraft with more medical equipment was expected to arrive on Friday.

PARIS (Reuters) - In a nursing home in Paris, bodies have been left decomposing in bedrooms and the smell of death seeps under doors after the coronavirus spread through the overwhelmed facility, according to a care worker there.
The employee at the Jardin des Plantes home, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject, told Reuters some 30 residents - about a third of all the elderly being cared for at the facility - had died since the outbreak struck.
With the city's undertakers swamped by the wave of COVID-19 deaths sweeping the capital, some corpses had laid in body bags for several days, the care worker said.
""The smell passes under the doors and permeates through the walls,"" the care worker said.
""Families would call in the morning, and we'd tell them things were fine. By the evening their relative would be dead and we wouldn't even have had the time to inform them,"" the care worker added, describing how staff had been overrun.
The nursing home is run by Paris City Hall. A spokesman confirmed that the number of deaths had risen above the 21 initially reported on April 7, but could not give a precise figure.
City Hall had been alerted that some corpses were festering inside bedrooms, the spokesman said. Immediate measures had been taken ""to limit as far as possible this situation"", he added.
The nursing home declined to comment.
All of France's care homes are locked down, their 1 million residents in isolation on government orders and cut off from their families.
From Italy to the United States, such homes have emerged as a vulnerable frontline in the global pandemic, with COVID-19 most lethal to the elderly.
PARTIAL DATA
In France, nursing homes do not have to relay data on COVID-19 deaths to the health authorities.
The country's death count has surged after it began including numbers supplied voluntarily from homes last week, with a third of the 12,210 COVID-19 fatalities nationwide occurring in nursing homes.
A spokeswoman for the regional ARS health authority in the greater Paris area said Jardin des Plantes was among the 40% of France's 7,400 homes that had not passed on the information.
The care worker said that the home's 80 staff had lacked face masks, gloves, gowns and shoe covers when the coronavirus first hit. High levels of absenteeism left workers overstretched before reinforcements arrived, including student nurses.
The nursing home declined to respond to questions about protective gear, which has been in short supply in many medical facilities and care homes across the world, particularly in the early stages of the coronavirus crisis.
The Paris City Hall spokesman said the municipality provided all its staff, including those working in homes, with masks.
Earlier this week, as the death toll inside the home rose, all of its surviving residents and staff were tested for COVID-19 after the health ministry changed its protocol.
Previously, as France ramped up testing capacity, the guidance was that the first two suspected cases be assessed.
Asked if the testing had come too late, the City Hall spokesman said the municipality was taking its cue from the ARS.

""We're approaching the peak so this is a crucial time,"" he said. ""We're not too late.""

GOESCHENEN, Switzerland (Reuters) - A road under the Alps to the sunny south of Switzerland normally jammed with holiday-makers was deserted on Friday as police warned drivers against travelling to the region worst hit by the new coronavirus pandemic.
Officers stopped all vehicles heading towards the Gotthard Tunnel after the government appealed for people not to travel over the Easter weekend to stem transmissions of COVID-19, the highly contagious lung disease caused by the virus.
Ticino, bordering Italy, is beloved by the Swiss for its lakes and Mediterranean climate, with many having second homes in the southern canton. But Ticino has been hard hit by the outbreak, suffering 18% of the country's COVID-19 deaths, and its businesses, restaurants, bars and hotels have closed.
Although the Gotthard tunnel has not been closed and driving to Ticino is not illegal, every car heading there has been stopped, with officers from the cantons of Uri and Ticino speaking to the occupants. 
All have been handed notices saying: ""It is not the right time to visit Ticino,"" and ""You are a burden for the infrastructure and are endangering yourself and others including health workers."" 
Normally 18,000 cars per day travel south on the motorway, causing tailbacks of up to 15 kilometres. This has been reduced to a trickle, police said, with the number of drivers down by 90%.
""We are very pleased with the operation so far,"" said Reto Pfister, commander of Uri Police, told Reuters. ""The main success has been people not deciding to travel at all.
""Around 98% of the people travelling south have a good reason to go to Ticino - because they live there or have family there or very important business. Only a very few people are traveling south for holidays in Ticino or to have fun.""
Around 300 cars were stopped on Friday, with police telling the occupants about the dangers of going to Ticino and how going there made it harder to contain the virus, Pfister said.
""Everyone understands why we are stopping them,"" said Pfister. ""One car even decided to turn around and go back after we spoke to them today so the message is getting through.""
Police will publish details on Monday on how many cars they stopped during the operation.

WARSAW/KRAKOW, Poland (Reuters) - Poland's ruling nationalists held scaled-down events on Friday to commemorate the 10th anniversary of a plane crash in Russia that killed top politicians and military officers, and they renewed criticism of Moscow's handling of the disaster.
Senior officials laid wreaths at a monument in the capital Warsaw to honour late president Lech Kaczynski who died in the crash, walking in single file and guarded by police wearing surgical masks to protect them from the coronavirus pandemic.
The crash in thick fog near Smolensk in western Russia was Poland's worst air disaster since World War Two and stunned the country. It also deepened political divisions and revived suspicions about Russia, Warsaw's former Cold War master.
President Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling Law and Justice Party (PiS) which was founded by Kaczynski and twin brother Jaroslaw, expressed regret that the coronavirus outbreak in Poland made it impossible to mark the tragedy properly.
Many Poles, including Duda, suspect that the crash was not caused by pilot error, as concluded in an official investigation by Poland's previous centrist government, but by foul play.
""After 10 years, it's difficult to say anything or predict whether the case can ever be resolved,"" Duda said in Krakow after visiting Kaczynski's grave in a crypt in Wawel cathedral.
""We don't have basic evidence, the wreckage is still in Russia, the black boxes are still in Russia.""
Poland's foreign ministry said in a statement that it had renewed demands that Moscow returned the wreckage of the ageing Tupolev aircraft.
""There are no provisions in international law that allow Russia to withhold Polish property,"" it said.
Russian authorities said on Friday there was no evidence of an explosion on board the plane, as some in Poland allege.
Russia's Investigative Committee said in a statement that crew errors led to the accident.
""The aircraft collided with a tree trunk at a height of about 11 meters,"" it said. ""As a result of the detachment of part of a wing, the aircraft began to rotate and after a few seconds fell to the ground in an upside down position.""
PiS has used the crash as a central plank of its campaign against the centrist opposition, the Civic Platform (PO), which ruled Poland for eight years until 2015. 
It believes the party, led then by former European Council President Donald Tusk, obstructed the probe into the disaster.
Several officials from the prime minister's office at the time of the crash were also sentenced in 2019 for neglect of duty when organising the flight.

Tusk, who now heads the centre-right European People's Party, a pan-European umbrella group, accuses PiS of fomenting hatred towards his supporters and exacerbating political rifts in Poland.

MOSCOW/PRAGUE (Reuters) - Russia has told the Czech Republic to hand over the statue of a prominent Soviet military commander that was dismantled in Prague last week despite Moscow's protests, escalating a rancorous diplomatic dispute over the issue.
The statue to Marshal Ivan Konev, who led Red Army forces during World War Two that drove Nazi troops from Czechoslovakia, is reviled by some in Prague as a symbol of the decades of Communist rule that followed the war.
But in Moscow Konev is lionised by authorities as a war hero, and the removal of his statue was cast as a diplomatic insult and part of what Russia sees as a dangerous attempt to rewrite history.
The statue to Konev, who also played a leading role in crushing the 1956 Hungarian uprising and building the Berlin Wall in 1961, was taken down on April 3 by municipal Prague authorities who said they planned to put it in a museum.
But Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has appealed to Czech Defence Minister Lubomír Metnar to intercede, the Russian defence ministry said, asking that the statue be sent back to Moscow.
Russia would be prepared to pay for transport or any other costs, the ministry said.
""We expect information from you about the place and time of its handing over,"" Shoigu said in a defence ministry statement late on Thursday.
The Czech Foreign Ministry said it was up to the Prague district municipality where the statue had been located to decide what to do. 
""If the municipality decides to give it to the Russian authorities - that is up to them to decide,"" a spokeswoman said.
The Czech Defence Ministry and Prague city hall could not immediately be reached for comment. 
The statue has for years been the centre of controversy in Prague. It has been repeatedly vandalised and moves by municipal authorities to cover it up with tarpaulin sparked anger among local pro-Russian residents.
Ahead of the 75th anniversary of the end of World War Two, the Soviet military campaign has become a highly sensitive subject for Moscow.
President Vladimir Putin has accused Russia's detractors of diminishing the Soviet war effort and its huge loss of life, and said Moscow must defend itself from what he has called the rewriting of history.

Separately, Shoigu on Wednesday appealed to Russia's Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, to criminally prosecute any foreign officials responsible for taking down statues honouring Soviet citizens.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - For more than a thousand Pakistani students stranded in the Chinese province of Hubei a gruelling lockdown lifted this week, but they must now decide whether to try to return to their home country where cases of coronavirus are rising rapidly.
Mir Hassan, a PhD computer architecture student in Wuhan, is desperate to get home to his mother after his father died in February from a heart ailment, their last contact him pleading for his son to come home. 
""I want to go home because this is my motherland ... every day I call my mother she is crying,"" he said.
In Pakistan, cases are increasing, standing at more than 4,000 on Friday with 66 deaths as the country implements lockdown measures and experts warn that crowding, poverty and weak healthcare infrastructure cause challenges throughout South Asia.
In spite of the risks, many students say they would like to return home and are looking at options for commercial flights or government repatriation. 
Pakistan since February has ignored Hubei-based students' pleas to leave China as many other countries flew their citizens out. A foreign ministry spokeswoman said that it was reviewing flight operations for places where Pakistani citizens were stuck around the world and said students in Wuhan had been ""very patient and brave"" during the lockdown.
Hassan said that the lockdown had taken a deep psychological toll, which, combined with his father's death plunged him into distress.
""Staying in one room, anxiety grows, depression also,” he said, adding that they felt full of joy at the new prospect of going outside in Wuhan but that psychological challenges lingered. 
Hafsa Tayyab, a Pakistani medical student in Wuhan, said she was hoping commercial flights would open mid-April and she would get on the first one she could back to Pakistan.
""I would like to go. Firstly, I will be with my family in this critical situation, secondly being a (medical) student I would like to serve my country,"" she said. ""It's more stressful for me to stay here while my family is in a critical zone.""
But other students, many of whom had young children, are considering staying put as they perceive the situation in Pakistan was likely to deteriorate and Chinese authorities now have a system for quashing the outbreak.
Muhammad Wasim Akram, whose wife is studying in Hubei had originally been desperate for her to return. Recently, they discussed the situation and decided she should stay put.
""We both decided that she won't return back until the situation comes under control (in Pakistan),"" he said.
Despite the weeks of challenges Hassan said that he hoped that citizens in his home country learned from Wuhan's lockdown. 
""I would like to say to Pakistani people ... to stay home and maintain social distancing. It is a hard time for everyone but after this hard time we have a lot of happiness. We are alive.""

BISCHWILLER, France (Reuters) - The Skype call had to be rebooted, but after several attempts Danielle Martin, a 71-year-old locked down inside a French retirement home, could finally see her niece Nathalie via the tablet propped up in front of her wheelchair.
""There you go, now I can see her,"" the pensioner said to Emilie Neumann, an employee at the home whose job since the coronavirus outbreak involves compering video calls between residents and their families.
Old people are especially vulnerable to the coronavirus - in France to date there have been 4,166 deaths related to the disease in retirement homes - and so the homes have been banning visitors and confining residents to their rooms.
That has left elderly people cut off from the social and family ties that they depend on for psychological wellbeing, medical professionals say.
Before the outbreak, Danielle Martin's niece would visit her twice a week at the ""Jardins D'Emeraude"" retirement home, a unit of the Bischwiller Hospital, in eastern France.
Once visits and socialising were banned, the pensioner's days felt emptier. ""I can have a siesta and watch TV. There's nothing else to do,"" she said.
In the meantime, worried relatives were bombarding the home with phone calls seeking updates on their relatives, according to Magaly Haeffele, the director of the facility.
The home needed a better solution. After putting out a request, they received tablets and smartphones from local charities and donors, and installed Skype and WhatsApp applications so they could be used for video calls.
To help residents and their relatives with unfamiliar technology, staff members were re-assigned from their regular roles, and volunteers were drafted in to help too.
""It allows us to keep up the morale for our residents and for our staff, who can sometimes see the distress of a resident who is unable to be in touch with those people close to them,"" said Haeffele.
The video calls are no less important for relatives, staff said.
In their Skype call, Martin and her niece talked about the weather, caught up on family news and discussed the shortage of some fresh produce in stores. But her niece said it was not the content of the conversation that mattered.

""I see her face, if she's pale. I know my aunt. When I look in her eyes, I can see if she's well, if she's ill,"" she told Reuters. ""When I see her smile, I'm happy.""

1689,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 06:25AM ET</span>","Some defiant U.S. churches plan Easter services, ignoring public health guidelines","By Rich McKay
(Reuters) - A handful of holdout U.S. churches plan to hold in-person services on Easter Sunday, saying their right to worship in person outweighs public health officials' warnings against holding large gatherings during the coronavirus outbreak.
Most U.S. churches are expected to be closed on Sunday, and a broad majority of observant Americans are expected to follow authorities' recommendations to avoid crowds to limit the spread of the potentially lethal COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.
But not all of them.
""Satan and a virus will not stop us,"" said the Reverend Tony Spell, 42, pastor of the evangelical Life Tabernacle Church near Baton Rouge, Louisiana. He expects a crowd of more than 2,000 to gather in worship at his megachurch on Sunday.
""God will shield us from all harm and sickness,"" Spell said in an interview. ""We are not afraid. We are called by God to stand against the Antichrist creeping into America's borders. We will spread the Gospel.""
The COVID-19 pandemic has claimed more than 14,700 lives across the United States and infected more than 431,700 people, with officials predicting the worst is yet to come.
Major U.S. religious institutions, including Roman Catholic dioceses and major Protestant denominations, will hold religious services online as well as through local broadcast radio and television, with just a handful of ministers and priests preaching sermons and reading liturgies to rows of empty pews.
Indeed, some major religious-liberty legal advocacy groups, whose mission is to challenge restrictions on freedom of religion, have not raised objections to the closures, saying churches have been treated the same as other major institutions and that safety comes first.
In Idaho, Ammon Bundy, who has led multiple standoffs against authorities in acts of protest against the federal government, plans to gather hundreds of people for an Easter observance, in defiance of public health advice, according to multiple media reports.
Another holdout church, the evangelical Cross Culture Center in Lodi, California, about 70 miles (110 km) southwest of San Francisco, plans another service even after its members found their church doors locked against them last weekend.
Lay preacher Jon Duncan, 43, who has led the evangelical center for more than 10 years, said that under city orders, his landlord changed the locks and shut them out Sunday morning.
Lodi police officers was standing by the door, because they were defying both local and state ""stay-at-home"" orders and a court order from the San Joaquin County Public Health Services.
Instead, Duncan held brief curbside prayers with his congregants as they showed up for the 11 a.m. service.
""It is disappointing because we have a valid lease, but we won't be stopped,"" he said. ""God commands us to meet and that's what we're going to do Easter.""
Duncan expects he and his flock of about 80 regular attendees will be locked out on Easter too, so he has picked an alternate site to meet. He and his attorney declined to disclose the new location to the public for fear of becoming a spectacle instead of a holy service. 
The church's attorney, Dean Broyles, has lodged a complaint against the city, and implored California's governor in a letter to lift the ban on large church gatherings.
Duncan said he is steadfast in his decision.

""We don't believe our rights are eroded by a virus,"" he said. ""We will stand together before God even against the gates of hell.""

Irish Health Minister, Simon Harris, has said he expects to be advised on Friday to keep the current restrictions in place for ""a period of weeks"" after citizens were ordered late last month to stay home until at least Sunday.
Prior to that, Ireland had banned all non-essential travel within the country and shut clubs, gyms, and hairdressers. Other retailers like DIY stores were allowed to remain open and people could travel beyond the current 2-km radius limit from their house and visit family, once they maintained social distancing. 
""We are conscious of the fact that the restrictions are very difficult for people and not sustainable in the long term,"" Cillian De Gascun, chair of the coronavirus expert advisory group, told national broadcaster RTE.
""What we would hope to do is be able to lift those, within the next perhaps couple of weeks... I think what we would like to try and do is offer people a bit more movement outside the house, there may be an opportunity to open more of the retail services closed formally a couple of weeks back. In essence, it would be looking in reverse from how they were implemented.""
Confirmed cases in Ireland rose to 6,574 on Thursday, with 263 deaths, but the average day-on-day case growth has fallen to 9% from 15% a week ago and officials said a stabilisation in intensive care admissions was encouraging.
De Gascun reiterated the view of many of the top officials advising government that the growth rate of new cases needs to drop to zero alongside a continued fall in the reproductive rate - the number of people who become infected from each positive case - before restrictions can be eased.
Officials have said testing and contact tracing also need to be scaled up first. De Gascun, who is the head of the National Virus Reference Laboratory, said he expected testing capacity to increase dramatically over next 7-10 days.

All of the country's parliamentarians, including President Mokgweetsi Masisi, had been asked to quarantine for 14 days and be tested for the coronavirus, after a health worker screening lawmakers for the virus herself tested positive.
Some members of parliament had since breached quarantine by going to supermarkets, ""spreading the risk"", a statement posted on the government's official Twitter account said.
""This is regrettable and the public is informed that the MPs have been removed from home quarantine and will be quarantined under government supervised quarantine,"" said the statement, from Malaki Tshipayagae, director of health services at the ministry of health.
It did not disclose the number of lawmakers involved or who they were. 
Lawmakers were given the option to self-isolate at home or to be taken to facilities designated by the government after the nurse who had screened them tested positive. 

Botswana has reported 13 coronavirus cases and one death.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - On a sombre and quiet Good Friday in Jerusalem, the Vatican's apostolic administrator in the Holy Land called for prayer for people suffering and dying from the coronavirus. 
""We are celebrating Good Friday, the commemoration of the death of Jesus, under very difficult circumstances,"" Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa said outside Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre, revered as the site of Jesus' crucifixion, burial and resurrection.
He spoke briefly to Reuters before entering the sandstone church's giant front doors. The church was closed to the public weeks ago, but was opened on Catholic Good Friday specifically for his entry for prayers and a service attended by a few clerics.
COVID-19 has infected over 10,000 in Israel, with 92 fatalities. There have been 263 cases and one death in the Palestinian territories, mostly in the occupied West Bank. 
Jerusalem residents are locked down in their homes for all but essential activities, which do not include religious ceremonies.
The Christian denominations that share custody of the Holy Sepulchre face closures unprecedented in living memory, as do Jewish and Muslim leaders in a city that has sites sacred to all three faiths. 
Passover, Easter and Ramadan all fall this month, with Catholics celebrating Good Friday today, and Easter Sunday on April 12.
Death has surfaced itself all over the world, Pizzaballa said, ""so it is important ... in this place, where this (Jesus's crucifixion) happened that we can pray (and) commemorate (it)"".
Pizzaballa called on people ""to be united in the heart, in the prayer, with all those who are suffering and dying.""
He then entered the church, its large doors swinging shut behind him. 

Soon afterwards, the piercing sound of singing and prayers emerged from high up in an ancient courtyard atop the Holy Sepulchre, where a church was first built in the fourth century.

1693,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 02:10AM ET</span>",China to ease internal migration curbs this year to lift virus-hit economy,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China will loosen residency rules this year to make it easier for people in rural areas to move to small cities, in an effort to ease labour shortages and boost consumption in an economy jolted by the coronavirus crisis.
China will completely abolish household registration permits for cities with populations of less than 3 million for all out-of-towners, its top economic planner said on Thursday.
Such permits, known as ""hukou"", have been used to control internal migration in China since the 1950s. The easing of such controls would help bridge labour shortages in hundreds of small cities in various stages of developing new industries. 
An influx of rural workers would also help boost urban consumption, particularly through purchases of homes, previously denied to out-of-towners due to their rural ""hukou"" status. 
China aims to turn 100 million rural people into urban dwellers, the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said in a statement on its website.
As of last year, China had 848 million urban residents, or 60.6% of the country's entire population. 
For bigger cities, or those with populations of more than 3 million, restrictions should be removed for certain groups of people, such as migrant workers with stable jobs in cities and college students from rural areas, the state planner said.
The government will also make efforts to ensure rural workers living in cities have access to basic public services, such as education, healthcare and housing services, according to the statement.
Analysts expect a deep first-quarter economic contraction in China due to the coronavirus outbreak.
""The further relaxation of urban residency permits... especially at present, is of great significance to boost investment, consumption, and enhance the resilience of economic and social development after the outbreak,"" state media quoted Feng Kui, an expert with China's Urban Reform and Development Centre, as saying.

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam is challenging China's dominance of coronavirus diplomacy with the donation of medical supplies to Europe and Southeast Asia and even winning plaudits from U.S. President Donald Trump for a shipment of protective suits.
China is looking to burnish its credentials as a responsible power by sharing expertise and donating masks and other protective equipment to countries seeing a surge in cases and to repair an image dented by the disease that originated there late last year.
Vietnam, despite its lack of resources compared with its giant neighbour, has donated 550,000 face masks to France, Germany, Italy, Spain and Britain, and 390,000 to neighbouring Cambodia and 340,000 to another neighbour, Laos.
It has also capitalised on the U.S. government's purchase of 450,000 made-in-Vietnam DuPont (NYSE:DD) hazmat suits by expediting the shipment of the protective equipment, and using it to highlight its medical donations in public statements and state media.
Trump thanked ""our friends in Vietnam"" on Thursday for that shipment.
Helped by a mass quarantine and aggressive contact-tracing, Vietnam's health ministry has recorded 255 cases of the novel coronavirus and no deaths.
Vu Duc Dam, a deputy prime minister who has been widely praised for his role in leading the campaign against the coronavirus, said on Monday the outbreak was under control.
The next day, state media showed photos of European ambassadors receiving boxes of masks from Vietnam's foreign ministry in a ceremony showcasing the donation.
""Vietnam appears to have gained in confidence by managing to deal successfully with the coronavirus,"" said Carl Thayer, an expert in Vietnam's diplomacy at the Australian Defence Force Academy in Canberra.
""While Vietnam is bracing itself against a second wave of the virus it is also beginning to look ahead to a revival of economic activity,"" Thayer said.
Key to spurring that activity will be a much-anticipated EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA), said Thayer, which Vietnam's rubber stamp National Assembly will ratify later this month.
AID 'WHERE IT COUNTS'
There are now 40 firms producing 7 million fabric masks a day in Vietnam, the government said on Thursday. An additional 5.72 million surgical masks can be produced daily, it said.
Vietnam is not the only country keen to show that it is able to offer its support to the world, however.
Taiwan, which China claims as its sacred territory and locks out of most global organisations, is donating 16 million masks, mostly to Europe and the United States, earning the diplomatically isolated island rare prominence on the world stage.
The government of Taiwan, which like Vietnam has managed to keep its tally of coronavirus cases low, with just five deaths, has not drawn a direct link between its virus diplomacy and that of China, but has been keen to show how ""Taiwan can help"", especially as it can make more than 13 million masks a day.
South Korea has also won attention for its campaign against the virus and on Thursday it hosted an online presentation outlining its containment measures for about 400 health officials and experts from 13 countries, including the United States, Mexico, and Italy.
""We've been getting requests from many countries for us to share our know-how,"" a South Korean foreign ministry official told Reuters. 
Vietnam has also not explicitly compared its virus diplomacy to China's but it was quick to send supplies to old allies Laos and Cambodia, where its influence has waned in recent years while China's has surged.
Even though Vietnam needs similar equipment in its own efforts against the virus, it has made donations to neighbours with large Vietnamese communities ""on the basis of traditional friendship and relations"", foreign ministry spokeswoman Le Thi Thu Hang told Reuters.
Vietnam could also be pushing the quality of its medical supplies in light of mounting returns to China of faulty equipment, said Thayer.
Vietnam's biggest listed firm, Vingroup, said last week it would start producing up to 55,000 ventilators a month, including for foreign markets.

""Vietnam cannot hope to match China in the volume and dollar value of its aid but Vietnam can provide assistance where it counts,"" said Thayer.

1695,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 10, 2020 12:40AM ET</span>","China says Taiwan attacks on WHO are 'venomous', aimed at independence","BEIJING/TAIPEI (Reuters) - China has accused Taiwan of ""venomously"" attacking the World Health Organization (WHO), seeking independence and conniving with internet users to spread racist comments, after the agency's chief said racist slurs against him had come from the island.
Taiwan, claimed by China as its sacred territory, has responded angrily to WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus's assertion that ""racist slurs"" against him had originated in Taiwan, and demanded he apologize saying the accusations are nonsense.
Taiwan's exclusion from the WHO, due to China's objections, has infuriated the Taipei government during the coronavirus outbreak.
Taiwan says it has been unable to get timely information and that Taiwanese lives have been put at risk. The WHO denies this.
In a statement late on Thursday, China's Taiwan Affairs Office took aim at the ""Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) authorities"", referring to Taiwan's ruling party and the usual wording Beijing uses for the island's democratically elected government.
""The DPP authorities are unscrupulously using the virus to seek independence, venomously attacking the WHO and its responsible people, conniving with the green internet army to wantonly spread racist comments,"" it said. ""We strongly condemn this.""
Green is the DPP's party colour. China believes the DPP is seeking Taiwan's formal independence, but President Tsai Ing-wen says they are already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
However, Taiwan's Justice Ministry said on Friday that Twitter posts purported to be from Taiwanese people apologising to Tedros for being racist about him, were actually posted by people in China.
""There is a concern it is a deliberate operation by overseas forces,"" the ministry's Investigation Bureau said.
""Falsely claiming to be Taiwanese and openly admitting to racist attacks on WHO Director General Tedros and begging forgiveness seriously damages our country's international reputation,"" it added in a statement.
Some Twitter users have begun using the hashtag in English #ThisAttackComesFromTaiwan to tweet out the positive things that come from the island, including its democratic system and being the first place in Asia to legalise same-sex marriage. 
""Our assistance to allies in Central America has arrived safely. The people of Taiwan are proud to help friends in time of need,"" Foreign Minister Joseph Wu tweeted using that hashtag, above a picture of supplies to fight the coronavirus being offloaded from an aircraft.
Taiwan says China also continues to apply military pressure during the virus crisis.
On Friday, the island's Defence Ministry said Chinese H-6 bombers and J-11 fighters again carried out drills near Taiwan, above waters to its southwest. The ministry said Taiwan's air force kept close watch.

It said the decision had been taken because its resources were stretched by the enforcement of measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus, as well as the risk that the migrants themselves may be carrying the virus.
The announcement came 24 hours after Italy closed its own harbors, saying its ports could not longer be considered safe because of the pandemic.
""It is in the interest and responsibility of such people not to endanger themselves on a risky voyage to a country which is not in a position to offer them a secure harbor,"" Malta's government said.
The decision by Italy and Malta came as the German Sea-Eye migrant aid group said its rescue vessel Alan Kurdi had picked up 150 people from two wooden boats off the coast of Libya on Monday. With the two closest European countries closed, it is unclear where they will be taken. 
The Maltese government said that over the years Malta had been under immense pressure and had rescued thousands of migrants ""with little tangible help"".
The government also published a statement it is sending to the European Commission, explaining the situation.

""In the light of the magnitude of these pressures, it is considered that the Maltese authorities are not in a position to guarantee the rescue of prohibited immigrants on board of any boats, ships or other vessels, nor to ensure the availability of a ‘safe place’ on the Maltese territory to any persons rescued at sea,"" the statement read.
