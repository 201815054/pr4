SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian officials declared a state of emergency for the capital city of Canberra and surrounding regions on Friday, as soaring temperatures and strong winds threatened to propel a large bushfire beyond the control of firefighters.
Andrew Barr, Chief Minister for the Australian Capital Territory (ACT), said the decision to declare the first state of emergency since fatal wildfires in 2003 indicated the potential danger over the weekend.
Officials said an uncontrolled fire in the ACT's south, on the doorstep of Canberra, had grown to 185 sq km, almost 8% of the territory's land mass.
""This fire may become very unpredictable. It may become uncontrollable,"" Barr told reporters in a televised briefing. ""The combination of extreme heat, wind, and a dry landscape will place suburbs in Canberra's south at risk.""
Australia's federal parliament is located in Canberra, which is also home to several government and independent institutions as well as national museums. Four people died and almost 500 homes were destroyed in the 2003 Canberra fires.
The state of emergency declared on Friday will run for 72 hours, giving authorities greater powers to order evacuations, close roads and take control of private property.
Heatwave conditions are also expected to sweep through Victoria and New South Wales states over the weekend, where some 80 fires are burning. 
In neighboring New Zealand, where smoke from the Australian blazes has turned glaciers brown, firefighters were battling to contain around 25 fires that spread rapidly to cover around 100 hectares on the South Island. Heatwave conditions were also forecast for much of the country over the weekend.
Australia has been battling bushfires across its east coast that have killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals since September. Around 2,500 homes have been destroyed as more than 11.7 million hectares (117,000 sq km) have been razed.
Key events on Friday in the bushfire crisis:
** There were 58 active fires in NSW state, 20 in Victoria and 22 in South Australia.
** Temperatures across NSW and Victoria states were forecast to reach 40 degrees Celsius (104 degree Fahrenheit) on Friday.
** The Australian Energy Market Operator, attempting to prevent supply shortages, urged people in Victoria to restrict energy use on Friday evening when demand is expected to peak because of unusually high humidity.

** Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who critics say has not done enough to address the impact of climate change, on Friday pledged funding for emissions reduction projects as part of a A$2 billion ($1.37 billion) package to increase gas supplies in NSW.

Last week, Trump appeared to play down the injuries, saying he ""heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things,"" prompting criticism from lawmakers and a U.S. veterans group.
Of the 64 service members who have been diagnosed, 39 had returned to duty, the military said.
""I've had the chance to speak with the president; he is very concerned about the health and welfare of all of our service members, particularly those who were involved in the operations in Iraq, and he understands the nature of these injuries,"" Esper said during a news conference on Thursday. 
Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the service members suffering from traumatic brain injuries had been diagnosed with mild cases. He added the diagnosis could change as time went on. 
Pentagon officials have said there had been no effort to minimize or delay information on concussive injuries, but its handling of the injuries following Tehran's attack has renewed questions over the U.S. military's policy regarding how it deals with suspected brain injuries.
""(Traumatic brain injury) manifests itself over time. ... I still believe that morning there were no casualties reported,"" Esper said.
Since 2000, about 408,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury, according to Pentagon data.
Iran fired missiles at the Ain al-Asad base in Iraq in retaliation for the U.S. killing of a top Revolutionary Guard general, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport on Jan. 3.

The missile attacks capped a spiral of violence that had started in late December. Both sides have refrained from further military escalation.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro visited a hospital in Brasilia on Thursday night, leaving without speaking to reporters, with a source familiar with the matter saying the president had felt discomfort in his abdomen.
The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a medical team was weighing whether to replace mesh that was put in Bolsonaro's abdomen to treat a prior hernia.
Government representatives could not be reached for comment on the reason for the visit.
Bolsonaro, 64, was stabbed by an attacker on the campaign trail in 2018 and has repeatedly sought follow-up treatment for the injury and related issues.
He has undergone four surgeries since the attack, with the most recent operation using the mesh to correct a hernia in the area where he was stabbed.
Thursday's hospital visit was not on Bolsonaro's official agenda for the day, which was set to end after he visited the state of Minas Gerais where heavy rains and flooding last week led to the deaths of more than 50 people."

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson will hail Brexit day on Friday as ""the dawn of a new era"" and pledge to unite Britain in an address to the nation which he hopes will draw a line under years of angry debate over the European Union.
On the day the United Kingdom ends its more than 40-year membership of the EU, Johnson, the face of the Brexit campaign, wants to avoid seeming triumphalist. 
He says he will celebrate ""respectfully"" to mark the country's most significant geopolitical shift since World War Two, one that has also left deep wounds.
When Britain leaves, little will change immediately. Johnson has until the end of the year to negotiate a new trade and future relationship deal with the bloc -- something that the EU has repeatedly warned will not be easy. 
But on Friday Johnson, who gambled with his reputation and future career by backing the Leave campaign in 2016, will toast Britain's much-delayed departure with his team at his Downing Street residence, shunning some more extravagant parties planned in the capital by Brexit supporters.
He will also be keen to move the debate on, to concentrate on meeting election pledges to help voters in more deprived regions of Britain that secured his governing Conservative Party a landslide victory in December. Some in his team joke that the word ""Brexit"" will be banned after Friday.
""This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act,"" Johnson will say in a television address due to be aired late on Friday.
""This is the dawn of a new era in which we no longer accept that your life chances -- your family's life chances -- should depend on which part of the country you grow up in. 
""This is the moment when we begin to unite and level up,"" he will say, according to extracts released by his office.
GETTING BREXIT DONE
After years of political wrangling in the wake of the June 2016 EU referendum, Johnson won December's election by winning over many voters who traditionally supported the opposition Labour Party with the simple message ""get Brexit done"".
With a large majority of 80, the prime minister now has more freedom to mould Britain's agenda than any Conservative government since the days of Margaret Thatcher in the 1980s.
But he also inherits a country where arguments about whether to stay in or leave the EU have divided towns, villages, friends and families for more than three years, and where many people increasingly distrust politicians.
While wanting to celebrate Brexit, Johnson is also fearful of alienating the millions of Britons who supported staying in the bloc, especially in Scotland and Northern Ireland. 
Nationalists in Scotland are increasingly pressing for a new independence vote there, while the Brexit saga has fueled talk in Northern Ireland of reunification with EU-member Ireland.
European Union chiefs vowed on Friday to find new ways of working together with Britain ""as allies, partners and friends"". 
Johnson also wants to try to draw a line under the decades of painful battles over Europe within the Conservative Party which contributed to the downfall of four of his predecessors - Thatcher, John Major, David Cameron and Theresa May.
Instead, he will focus on boosting funding for, and delivering infrastructure projects to, northern and central England, where thousands of Labour supporters switched to vote Conservative, often for the first time. 
""Our job as the government -- my job -- is to bring this country together and take us forward,"" Johnson will say.

  ""And the most important thing to say tonight is that this is not an end but a beginning ... It is a moment of real national renewal and change.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump promised on Thursday during a speech in Michigan to reverse course on some deportations of Iraqi Christians whom his administration sought to remove earlier in his term, but gave no specifics.
Trump said during an event at an auto parts manufacturer in the city of Warren that his administration would grant an ""extension"" to Iraqi Chaldean Catholic immigrants, a group that has been targeted for immigration enforcement during his presidency.
""We're going to make sure that we do everything we can to keep people who have been good to this country out of harm's way,"" Trump said. ""When I get back, we're going to give those who need it an extension to stay in our country.""
Trump hopes to be reelected in November and Michigan, which he won narrowly in 2016, could be a competitive battleground during the campaign.
Trump launched a broad immigration crackdown after taking office that included arrests of Iraqi Chaldean Catholics with outstanding deportation orders in the Detroit area, some of whom had lived in the United States for decades.
Some of the arrests took place in Michigan's Macomb County, which Trump won by 53.6 percent in 2016 with the support of many in its Iraqi Christian community.
Federal immigration authorities previously had been unable to remove the Iraqi immigrants because the government in Baghdad would not accept them. But Iraq agreed in 2017 to accept U.S. deportees as part of a deal to remove it from the Trump administration's travel ban list.
Advocates have argued the Iraqi Christians deported to Iraq could be targeted in that country as a religious minority. They also contend some face deportation because of old or relatively minor criminal convictions.
In a case that received widespread media attention last year, a 41-year-old Iraqi national who had lived in the United States for most of his life died after being deported to Iraq.
The man, Jimmy Aldaoud, suffered from mental health issues and diabetes, and his family said at the time that he died because he could not get access to care in Iraq.
Trump told the crowd in Warren he had discussed the issue of Iraqi Christians with lawmakers during the flight from Washington, but did not give more details.
The White House said five Republican lawmakers from the state attended the event, which focused on the new North American trade agreement.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

Barbosa, 46, previously served as a presidential adviser on human rights and international affairs. He studied law at Sergio Arboleda University alongside Duque, who included him in a list of three nominations presented to the court, which unanimously selected him for a term of four years.
The new attorney general replaces Nestor Humberto Martinez, who resigned in May last year.
Martinez resigned in protest after a special court charged with prosecuting war crimes denied U.S. extradition of a former leader of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who had been accused of drug trafficking.
Barbosa formerly served as a legal adviser for a number of public and private organizations, where he assisted on human rights. He was also a professor in several universities in Bogota.
Attorney general is one of the most important positions in Colombia. The attorney general leads investigations against corruption, drug and arms trafficking, murders and kidnappings, among other areas."
6,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 04:49PM ET</span>",Colombia rejects Venezuelan proposal to resume diplomatic relations,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia rejected a proposal to resume diplomatic relations with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government on Thursday, amid a dispute over a fugitive former Colombian congresswoman who was captured in Venezuela.
Maduro abruptly cut diplomatic relations with neighboring Colombia last February after Colombian President Ivan Duque helped Venezuelan opposition politicians deliver humanitarian aid to their crisis-stricken country.
Colombia, like the majority of Western democracies, recognizes Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country's legitimate president.
""We see little possibility to provide consular and other services in Venezuela, plainly and simply because of the constant aggressions doled out by the dictatorship against many countries that have rejected it,"" Duque told journalists Thursday.
Maduro proposed the resumption of consular relations between the countries on Wednesday, as Colombia seeks the extradition of former Colombian congresswoman Aida Merlano. Merlano was detained in January in Venezuela's Zulia state, which borders Colombia, four months after she escaped custody in Venezuela.
The former lawmaker, imprisoned in Colombia for buying votes in 2018, made a dramatic escape by lowering herself by rope from a second-floor orthodontist's office last October. She fled on the back of a motorbike.
Maduro and officials in his government said on Wednesday that Merlano had told them stories of corruption among Colombia's political class, hinting they could reveal them. Merlano was charged by a Venezuelan court with identity theft, using fake documents and conspiring to commit crimes.
""They shouldn't mock the laws and institutions that would see Aida Merlano deported, so that she can face the full weight of Colombian law,"" Duque said. ""She is a criminal and we hope she will arrive in our country to be judged and sentenced in accordance with the crimes she has committed.""
Colombia asked Guaido to secure her extradition this week. The opposition leader committed to doing so, but he has no control over Venezuela's police or judiciary."
7,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 04:37PM ET</span>","In Brussels, a quiet last nod for Brexit and a rainy 'au revoir'","By Marine Strauss and John Chalmers
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Brexit cleared its last formal hurdle in Brussels on Thursday, setting Britain's Jan. 31 exit from the European Union in stone, but it was an unceremonious moment and a party in the heart of the EU's capital to say ""au revoir"" was a rain-drenched washout.
The 27 EU member states that Britain will leave behind at midnight in Brussels on Friday approved the withdrawal agreement reached last October after more than three years of tortuous negotiations.
Their green light came by so-called ""written procedure"", shorthand for an email from each member state.
That stood in stark contrast to the emotion and drama that gripped the European Parliament's vote on the historic agreement on Wednesday, as British Brexit Party lawmakers cheered and waved mini Union Jack flags, while others wept over Britain's departure from the EU after nearly half a century of membership.
Britain will no longer be an EU member state from Saturday, and it will be considered a third country.
However, it will enter a transition period until the end of December that is meant to give citizens and businesses time to adapt. During the transition, Britain will continue to apply EU laws but will no longer be represented in EU institutions.
A concert organized by the city of Brussels to celebrate its friendship with Britain got off to a miserable start on Thursday as rain lashed the majestic Grand Place.
Tourists scurried across the square as music blared before a light show that would project the colors of the Union Jack onto buildings. There was a London black cab on display and a traditional British red telephone booth that had to be covered over with plastic sheeting because the rain was leaking through.
Nearby, the famous statue of a little boy urinating – the Manneken Pis – had been dressed in a Union Jack waistcoat.
Despite the cold and wet weather, a more raucous party, called by British Green EU lawmaker Magid Magid via Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), took place later in the day at the bar-lined Place Luxembourg, a few steps from the EU parliament, where young people working for EU institutions regularly meet on Thursday nights for drinks.
""I am sad, but also it is good that Brexit is finally done, they've taken so long,"" said Tomaso, 25, an Italian assistant to a member of the European Parliament.
Tomaso, who studied in Britain and has a girlfriend there, came to show support to his British colleagues, many of whom lost their jobs as assistants as British MEPs returned home.
Among the Brits at the event at Place Luxembourg, the mood was somber.
Amy, 23, a Briton working for a nongovernmental organization in Brussels, expressed sadness and added that she was worried she would no longer be able to stay in Belgium.
""It all happened because there was a lot of fake news, disinformation, a sense of trying to regain an empire,"" she said, ""but now there isn't anything we can do about it, it's happening.""
""UKmissEU""
Brexit Day will be more muted in Brussels than across the Channel, where its supporters in London's Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) will celebrate their triumph 3-1/2 years after a referendum in which Britons voted to leave the EU. 
A Union Jack in the building of the European Council in Brussels will be lowered at 7 p.m. local time (1800 GMT) on Friday, and put away with the flags of non-EU countries. 
""They have to keep them in case (UK Prime Minister) Boris Johnson ever wants to come here,"" said an EU official, who declined to be named. 
The European Parliament plans to place one of its British flags in the House of European History, a nearby museum that recounts the history of Europe since 1789. 

At the UK's Representation Office in Brussels, the EU flag will be lowered at the end of the working day on Friday. On Saturday the name plate outside the building will be replaced, and it will now be known as the UK Mission to the European Union, which some have already dubbed ""UKmissEU'.

The plan is to hire 10,000 new soldiers in the coming months to ""allow our armed and security forces to be much more present in quantity and I hope in quality in areas where they were not,"" Cisse said.
He did not say how much the increase would cost or how the arid West African country would pay for it when military costs already take up a significant part of the budget.
It was also not clear how it would lure people into an army whose troops are frequently killed in attacks by Islamists.
The army declined to say how many troops it has now, but the World Bank estimated there were 18,000 armed forces personnel in 2017.
Former colonial power France intervened in 2013 to drive back militants who had seized northern Mali in 2012, but groups allied with al Qaeda and Islamic State have sprung back.
Much of central and northern Mali is largely lawless, and groups use the area as a base from which to launch attacks across neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso.
France has 4,500 troops in Mali and the wider Sahel and local international forces have also teamed up to contain the problem, but attacks have continued.
About 20 soldiers were killed in a pre-dawn attack on an army camp in the center of the country on Sunday and 24 others were killed when militants attacked a patrol in the north in November.
France warned on Monday against possible U.S. troop cuts in West Africa, worried about the impact on logistical support and intelligence gathering."
9,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 04:19PM ET</span>",Mexican leader plays 'matador' to manage Trump migration charge,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Days after Donald Trump entered the White House in 2017, Mexico's Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador stood on U.S. soil and likened the American's treatment of migrants to Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews.
That was then.
Since assuming the Mexican presidency 14 months ago, the leftist Lopez Obrador has thrown huge resources behind Trump's goal of cutting illegal migration from Central America. And he speaks publicly of the ""friendship"" binding him to his U.S. counterpart.
Threatened with tariffs by Trump, Lopez Obrador has sent thousands of National Guard troops to police Mexico's borders. The result, according to Washington, is a more than 70% drop in migrant detentions on the U.S.-Mexico frontier since last May.
Since Lopez Obrador agreed in June to tighten the border, tensions have eased. But Trump still says Mexico must pay for his planned border wall and he has used ongoing gang violence to press for more cooperation on migration and security.
""He's like a matador facing Trump who's like a bull that charges you at will,"" said Lorenzo Meyer, a historian at the Colegio de Mexico and friend of Lopez Obrador.
""It's against the nature of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador to be so polite, but he doesn't have another (option).""
A history buff fond of making references to foreign invasions of Mexico, Lopez Obrador must walk a fine line to keep Trump at bay while protecting his image as a pugnacious patriot reclaiming his country for the poor and downtrodden.
That Lopez Obrador would help a U.S. leader widely reviled in Mexico for describing its people as rapists and drug-runners during his 2015-16 election campaign, sits uneasily with both supporters on the left and critics on the right.
""(It's) submission and political obedience, not free self-determination,"" said Enrique Vidal of human rights group Fray Matias de Cordova, who watched the National Guard rounding up a caravan of Central American migrants on Mexico's southern border last week to avert a fresh conflict with Trump.
Critics of Lopez Obrador say yielding to Trump has only encouraged him to demand more. Some argue Mexico should have called Trump's bluff on his tariffs threat because of the damage it would also have done to U.S. economic interests.
In February 2017, Lopez Obrador addressed Mexicans in Los Angeles and likened the Trump administration to the regime of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler for its attitude to migrants.
But his National Guard is now widely viewed as a de facto wall against migrants reaching the U.S. border, prompting Trump to claim this week that his border wall ""is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by Mexico.""
Lopez Obrador sidestepped the question when asked to respond to Trump at a news briefing on Wednesday, casting criticism of his migration policy as an attempt by adversaries to draw him into a dispute with the United States.
""Listen: love and peace, they can try and prod us all they like, but we won't take the bait,"" he said.
Pollsters say the Mexican leader is getting away with his volte-face so far, taking the public with him on his tougher approach to migrants, whom he has depicted as victims of unscrupulous traffickers.
A July survey in newspaper Reforma showed 55% of Mexicans favored deporting Central American migrants back home."

WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Thursday said it will allow Russian, Chinese and European companies to continue work at Iranian nuclear sites to make it harder for that country to develop a nuclear weapon, drawing ire from Iran hawk Republicans.
But it has also imposed sanctions on Iran's Atomic Energy Organization (AEOI) and its chief, a move described by the entity's spokesman as sign of Washington's ""despair"" who said Tehran's civilian nuclear work would continue full force.
The Trump administration, which in 2018 pulled out of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran, will let the work go forward by issuing waivers to sanctions that bar non-U.S. firms from dealing with the AEOI.
The waivers’ renewal for 60 days will allow nonproliferation work to continue at the Arak heavy-water research reactor, the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the Tehran Research Reactor and other nuclear cooperation initiatives.
There had been a great deal of lobbying in Washington to stop the latest waivers as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to exert more pressure on Iran. A Western diplomat said there was initial disagreement between the U.S. State Department and Treasury but the latter won.
""We will closely monitor all developments in Iran's nuclear program and Secretary (Mike) Pompeo can end these projects as developments warrant,"" Brian Hook, U.S. special representative for Iran, told a news briefing.
The moves come weeks after the United States and Iran came to the brink of war. Washington killed Iranian military commander Qassem Solemani, the mastermind of Iran's control over Iraq, in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3.
Under the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for the lifting of economic sanctions that had crippled its economy.
Trump unilaterally abandoned the deal in May 2018, and reimposed U.S. sanctions in a “maximum pressure” campaign designed to force Iran to return to the negotiating table.
Washington in November terminated the sanctions waiver related to Iran’s Fordow nuclear plant after Tehran resumed uranium enrichment at the underground site.
""There was a difference of opinion between the U.S. Treasury and State Department. The Treasury won,"" the Western diplomat said. ""There is an appetite for more sanctions, so this was a surprise; but others argue that these waivers are vital to ensure nonproliferation."" 
MORE SANCTIONS
The United States on Thursday also placed Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the AEOI, and the organization itself under U.S. sanctions, Hook said.
The decision to sanction Salehi and the AEOI would have an impact on Iran's civilian nuclear program because it has operational control over the program, including purchasing parts for nuclear facilities.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio expressed discontent over the waiver renewal. ""While I am glad to see new sanctions imposed against Iran’s Atomic Energy Organization and its chief, the administration should terminate the controversial sanctions waivers on Iran’s civil nuclear program and exert maximum pressure on the regime in Tehran,"" he said in a statement.
Last week three Republican senators known to be close to Trump - Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Ted Cruz of Texas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina - had called for the remaining civil nuclear waivers to be rescinded. ""Enough is enough,"" the senators and Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney said in a joint statement.
The diplomat said the United States had likely opted to extend the Bushehr waiver because the Russian company targeted also provides nuclear fuel to U.S. facilities, causing a potential sanctions headache for the administration.
""Imposing sanctions ... is a political game played by Washington. These sanctions have no value and are childish measures,"" AEOI spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told Iran's Fars news agency.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The United States' new ambassador to Russia urged Moscow on Thursday to release a former U.S. Marine accused of spying, and said Russian investigators had failed to present credible evidence to back up their case. 
Days after starting as U.S. ambassador, John Sullivan accused Russian authorities of ""shameful treatment"" of Paul Whelan, who was detained by security agents in a Moscow hotel room on Dec. 28, 2018 and accused of espionage. 
Whelan, 49, denies the charges against him and holds U.S., British, Canadian and Irish passports. At court hearings over the past year, he has said he is being ill treated.
The case, in which Whelan be jailed for 20 years if he is found guilty, has strained U.S.-Russian ties that are already under pressure from an array of issues including the conflicts in Ukraine and Syria and election-meddling allegations. 
On Thursday, Sullivan visited Whelan in Moscow's Lefortovo prison. It was one of the ambassador's first public appearances since he presented his credentials at Russia's Foreign Ministry on Jan. 21. 
""It's time for this nightmare to end, and for Paul to go home,"" Sullivan said in comments published by the U.S. embassy on social media. 
""[His] case has gone on far too long. Investigators have shown no evidence – zero. Russian authorities show no credible justification for isolating Paul, and refuse to allow Paul to get proper medical attention. This is shameful treatment.""
Russia's Foreign Ministry has dismissed Whelan's allegations of ill-treatment and accused him of trying to stir up noise around his case.
Moscow says Whelan was caught red-handed with a computer flash drive containing classified information. Whelan says he was set up in a sting operation and had thought the drive, given to him by a Russian acquaintance, contained holiday photos.

Previous efforts to secure Whelan's release, including an appeal in December, have been ignored.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO director-general, announced the decision after a meeting of its Emergency Committee, an independent panel of experts, amid mounting evidence of the virus spreading to some 18 countries.
Tedros told a news conference in Geneva that recent weeks have witnessed an unprecedented outbreak which has been met by an unprecedented response.
""Let me be clear, this declaration is not a vote of no confidence in China,"" he said.
""Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems,"" he added.
The WHO panel, chaired by Didier Houssin of France, is composed of 16 independent experts.
Twice last week the experts had decided not to declare an emergency while they sought more information from China and awaited evidence of confirmed person-to-person spread of the virus in other countries, so as to meet their criteria for a global emergency.
The declaration of a global emergency triggers recommendations to all countries aimed at preventing or reducing cross-border spread of disease, while avoiding unnecessary interference with trade and travel.
 It covers temporary recommendations for national health authorities worldwide, which include stepping up their monitoring, preparedness and containment measures.
Although the WHO has no legal authority to sanction countries, it could ask governments to provide scientific justification for any travel or trade restrictions that they impose in the event of an international emergency."

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Illegal armed groups are still recruiting children in Colombia, subjecting them to sexual abuse and using them as cannon fodder in armed conflict, humanitarian groups said on Thursday.
""In Colombia the recruiting and use of minors is a common and systemic practice which changes to meet the new demands of the armed conflict,"" said Olga Silva of Humanidad Vigente, which published a report along with Oxfam and Benposta Nacion de Muchachos. The groups form part of the observatory for the protection of rights and welfare of children (OPROB).
Violence declined after a 2016 peace deal the Andean country signed with rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), ending that group's part in more than five decades of conflict that killed more than 260,000 people.
The deal allowed some 13,000 former rebels to rejoin society, yet the report noted that armed groups including dissidents of the FARC who rejected the accord are still recruiting children and adolescents.
""Threats, false promises of better conditions, the groups' presence in schools and the absence or weakness of the government has led to thousands of children joining the ranks of armed groups,"" Silva said.
Last week a report by Human Rights Watch said children as young as 12 were being recruited by armed groups in the east of the country.
According to OPROB, between 2017 and 2019 there were 311 cases of recruiting minors in five of Colombia's 32 provinces. The National Liberation Army (ELN) accounted for the majority of cases, with 182, followed by FARC dissidents with 82.
""The study established that sexual violence is directly linked with the armed conflict, a situation that puts children who are used by armed groups at high risk,"" the report said.
The investigation also decried the presence of a high number of Venezuelan minors working to produce coca, the main ingredient of cocaine, along Colombia's border with Venezuela.
According to official numbers, between 1985 and 2019, more than 7,400 minors were victims of forced recruitment, while 16,249 were killed during the armed conflict."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed two pieces of legislation on Thursday seeking to rein in President Donald Trump's ability to deploy U.S. forces to fight abroad, as some lawmakers fume over his failure to fully inform them about his strategy toward Iran.
The Democratic-led House voted nearly along party lines to pass one measure that would prohibit military action against Iran without congressional approval. It also voted to repeal the 2002 Authorization for the use of Military Force for the war in Iraq, which presidents have long used to justify a range of military actions.
""The Constitution gives Congress, not the president, the power to declare war. And with President Trump taking steps toward dangerous conflict with Iran - without any consultation with Congress - we need to reassert the responsibility given to us,"" Democratic Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, said in support of the legislation.
The vote for the first measure was 228 to 175, as four of Trump's fellow Republicans joined Democrats in backing the bill and three Democrats joined most Republicans in voting no.
The vote for the second was 236 to 166, with 11 Republicans voting yea and two Democrats voting nay.
The future of the legislation was uncertain in the Republican-led Senate, where an effort to pass an Iran-related war powers resolution has been stalled during Trump's impeachment trial.
Trump took to Twitter on Wednesday to express opposition,
""With Votes in the House tomorrow, Democrats want to make it harder for Presidents to defend America, and stand up to, as an example, Iran. Protect our GREAT COUNTRY!"" he wrote.
Many members of Congress, including some Republicans, have been pushing the administration for more information about the killing this month of top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad's airport. [L1N29C1XS]
Trump did not inform Congress about the drone strike until after it took place and then, according to many lawmakers, his administration held back too much information about the reason for the strike and its legal justification."

The man, who is serving a life sentence for murder and was out on parole, opened fire and injured two police officers and a villager near Farrukhabad in western Uttar Pradesh, PV Ramashastry, the Additional Director General Of police said.
""He had called the children on the pretext of a birthday party and held them hostage. He opened fire on villagers,"" Ramashastry said.
The man had invited some children and women of Farrukhabad, saying he was throwing a birthday party for his daughter. He held the invitees hostage at gunpoint after they reached his house. The man's motive is not clear, nor is the number of women and children.

A team of counter terrorism forces along with local police are trying to rescue the hostages, police said.

17,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 01:46PM ET</span>",A gunman shoots at New Delhi protesters,"NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The protests outside New Delhi's Jamia Millia Islamia University on Thursday started out small and relatively low-key - another show of anger by students who oppose a citizenship law they say discriminates against Muslims.
But that quickly changed when a young man brandishing a rudimentary pistol appeared on the road between around 1,000 protesters and dozens of riot police facing them.
Waving the small handgun in the air, he taunted the demonstrators, and as both protesters and police converged towards him to try and calm the situation, he fired a single shot at a man later identified as Shadab Farooq.
Farooq was wounded in his hand, police said.
""As the protests started, there was no immediate threat so I was moving towards the police line and it was just like a regular day,"" said Danish Siddiqui, Reuters' chief photographer in India who took several pictures of the gunman.
""When I saw he was carrying a gun, I quickly moved to one side,"" he added.
One close-up photograph captures the man pointing the gun towards protesters as he steps backwards. A line of riot police look on about 50 meters behind him.
In the melee after the shot was fired, Siddiqui also photographed the injured protester as well as the gunman, who identified himself on social media as ""Rambhakt Gopal"", being brought under control by police.
Reuters could not immediately ascertain if that was his real identity.
Siddiqui has covered dozens of such demonstrations that have convulsed the country for more than a month. At least 25 people have been killed in clashes with police since early December.
Thursday's incident - the first known case where a civilian has shot at protesters in the capital - raised fresh fears that Indians could take the law into their own hands as supporters and opponents of the legislation grow increasingly polarized.
The Citizenship Amendment Act, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government has pushed through parliament, fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from three neighboring countries.
Its opponents say it discriminates against India's sizeable Muslim minority of 180 million people and violates its secular constitution.
Modi has rejected the protests, and members of his party and its affiliates have painted the protesters as anti-nationals.
Minutes before firing, the gunman had uploaded posts onto his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) profile saying this will be his ""final journey"" and urging readers to ""remember his family"".
He had also posted photos of himself posing with a gun and he is seen wearing a saffron T-shirt, the color of Hindu nationalists.
Facebook later said it had taken down the gunman's account. Police said they had detained the suspect but gave no further details.
The injured man, Farooq, was in hospital receiving treatment for his wound, according to a friend with him who declined to be identified. The friend said Farooq was not able to answer questions.

Following the shooting, the number of protesters swelled to several thousand, and scuffles between them and several hundred police officers broke out.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Jair Bolsonaro fired his deputy chief of staff for the second time this week, after the official used a Brazilian Air Force plane to fly from Davos, Switzerland, to New Delhi last week.
The costly trip has drawn extensive public criticism amid mounting allegations of corruption by Bolsonaro's administration. 
Bolsonaro first fired the official, Vicente Santini, on Tuesday when he returned from a state visit to India, calling his use of the plane ""completely immoral."" Santini was reassigned to another position by Chief of Staff Onyx Lorenzoni.
After heightened public outcry, Bolsonaro told reporters on Thursday he was firing Santini definitively and said that the main policy area run by Lorenzoni´s office, the Investment Partnerships Program (PPI), would be moved to the Economy Ministry.
Loss of authority over this key program, aimed at drawing local and foreign investors into infrastructure projects, marks a fall from grace for Lorenzoni. He was one of the first lawmakers to back Bolsonaro´s presidential bid, but has been unable to muster support in Congress for many of the administration's policies, including a bid to restructure the government.
Santini flew from the World Economic Forum in the Swiss Alps on an Air Force Legacy executive jet to join Bolsonaro´s visit to India, even though such flights are reserved for ministers and other higher-ranking authorities. The scandal adds to speculation Lorenzoni will be dropped from Bolsonaro's Cabinet, which political analysts have been predicting for months.
According to the Estado de S.Paulo newspaper, the flight cost Brazilian taxpayers 740,000 reais ($177,000), not welcome news for a government that says it is committed to fiscal belt-tightening and fighting corruption. Only two other aides were on the plane, the paper reported. 
Bolsonaro, a far-right leader elected in 2018 on a pledge to clean up Brazilian politics, has been hurt by accusations his tourism minister committed electoral fraud and a money-laundering investigation into his son, Senator Flavio Bolsonaro, a former Rio de Janeiro state lawmaker.
The PPI program has been reassigned to Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, who is working to speed up the privatization of state companies, reduce the government´s budget deficit and restore confidence in Brazil´s finances.
The Economy Ministry´s Privatization Secretary Jose Salim Mattar will be running the program, starting Monday, government sources said.

""We have a plan to start proceedings on site,"" Abdulkarim Omar, the representative of the foreign relations committee of the administration that runs the northeastern quarter of Syria, told reporters in Helsinki after meeting with Finland's foreign minister Pekka Haavisto.
Fearing a public backlash, many European countries have refused to repatriate their nationals who traveled to Syria to join Islamic State and who are now being held captive by local authorities since IS lost its last territory in Syria in March last year.
A full international ""ad hoc"" tribunal has previously been ruled out, as such a body could take years to establish and was unlikely to get U.N. Security Council backing.
The Kurdish-led local authorities had proposed setting up a local tribunal in March last year. Omar said now the aim was to begin proceedings within three months.
""The crimes have been committed there so the evidence and the witnesses are also there,"" he said.
Europeans comprise a fifth of the roughly 10,000 Islamic State fighters held captive in Syria by Kurdish militias.
Omar said he had asked Finland and other countries for support for the process, adding that all countries would be invited to participate if they wanted.
""Especially European countries have not been willing to take their citizens back, and from our perspective that is extremely wrong,"" Omar said, adding that living conditions in the region were difficult after years of conflict.
Finland has so far repatriated two orphans from the al-Hol camp, where some 70,000 wives and children of Islamic State fighters are being held but it has no plans to bring any fighters home.
Finland's foreign minister Haavisto was not immediately available for comment."

MANAGUA (Reuters) - About 80 armed men killed six indigenous people on an isolated Nicaraguan nature reserve in an attack linked to raging land disputes, the indigenous Mayagna community said on Thursday, with 10 other Mayagnas kidnapped in the raid.
The men stormed a Mayagna commune about 500 kilometers (310 miles) north of capital Managua, deep in the north-central Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, the second-largest rainforest the Americas after the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).
The raiders were part of a group of ""settlers"" in the area who do not belong to the indigenous communities that make up about 14% of Nicaragua's 6.2 million people, according to a Mayagna lawyer from the region.
""They wanted to subjugate the men and shot to death six people,"" Mayagna lawyer Larry Salomon told Reuters by phone, saying the attack occurred in the Alal de Sauni As community.
Animosity has been growing over the past decade between Nicaragua's native people and the ""settlers,"" who come to indigenous areas in search of cheap, fertile land, as well as timber and gold, according to activists.
""This is a land conflict. They want our lands for cattle farming and to destroy our forests,"" Salomon added.
Salomon said a delegation made up of Nicaraguan army, police and the municipal government was on the way to the reserve to investigate the attack.
The government did not respond to a request for comment.
With only about 30,000 people spread across the country, Mayagna make up about 0.5% of Nicaragua's population.
The Mayagna have been complaining since 2014 about living under siege from armed groups who are seizing their lands, and last year their leader said his people are facing an existential risk.
""They're exterminating us little by little and the state is doing nothing,"" Gustavo Lino, the highest-ranking Mayagna leader, said last year.
Nicaragua had been a world leader in the granting of land rights to native peoples. Indigenous communities gained autonomy in 1987 over their ancestral lands and a law was introduced in 2003 to allow indigenous people to apply for land titles.
But indigenous communities have more recently criticized the government for not doing enough to protect them and their way of life.
The Bosawas Biosphere Reserve, renowned for its biodiversity, is a treasure-trove of rare and endangered species. It hosts one of the world's last populations of Baird's Tapir and Central American Spider Monkey, according to the United Nations."

Protesters attacked more than 20 police stations through the night and early morning, shouting in rage, throwing Molotov cocktails and lighting some on fire, leaving one dead and 46 police injured, according to official reports.
Several Santiago metro stations and bus lines were shut down overnight, though most had reopened in the early hours Thursday.
""Without a doubt, this was the most violent day of 2020,"" regional police chief Enrique Bassaletti told reporters early Thursday, warning that it harkened back to the ""worst moments"" of the previous October.
Chile's police force, known as the Carabineros, came under fire after protests in Chile broke out in late October last year. Several human rights groups accuse security forces of violations from rape to torture and undue force.
The 2019 protests, the most violent since the country's return to democracy in 1990, plunged Santiago and much of Chile into chaos. Vandals burned downtown buildings, rioters looted hundreds of grocery stores and military tanks took to the streets for the first time since the dictatorship of strongman Augusto Pinochet.
Anger erupted again in Santiago earlier this week when a police truck allegedly ran over and killed a fan of local soccer team Colo-Colo as he left a stadium following an evening match.
Police arrested the driver of the truck and said they are investigating the incident.
Fellow soccer fans called for a mass protest this Friday evening in a central Santiago square to commemorate the death.
Though violence had largely subsided in recent weeks, scattered incidents across Santiago and Chile point to lingering tensions."

The United States did not have Patriot air defenses deployed to al-Asad air base in Iraq, where at least 11 of Iran's ballistic missiles struck, killing no one but triggering massive blasts that caused traumatic brain injury among U.S. forces. 
""We need the permission of the Iraqis,"" Esper told a news conference. He said securing their permission was one factor slowing the repositioning of the air defenses. He said the U.S. military was still deciding on more tactical issues, such as where best to place the defenses.
Tehran had been expected to retaliate against the United States over the killing of a top Iranian general, likely using ballistic missiles. 
But in the days prior to the Iranian strikes, the Pentagon had expected Tehran more likely to target U.S. positions in countries other than Iraq, since Tehran counts influential allies in Baghdad. 
The United States had moved Patriot batteries last year to Saudi Arabia, for example.
Thanks to U.S. intelligence, the Pentagon gained hours of warning time that allowed it to move troops to bunkers that were strong enough to prevent loss of life or limb when the Iranian missiles struck, U.S. officials say. 

The bunkers were not designed to prevent the traumatic brain injuries from the massive blasts. The injuries so far have been categorized as ""mild.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Norway's national economic crime unit raided the local office of international shipping company Teekay Offshore this week on suspicion of illegally exporting waste, the agency, known as Okokrim, said on Thursday.
In recent years, courts in Europe using tougher regulations have fined shipping companies for transporting hazardous waste for disposal in cases that have added to complexities for seaborne transporters often operating in several jurisdictions.
Maria Bache Dahl, acting senior public prosecutor with Okokrim, said authorities had carried out a search of Teekay Shipping Norway's office in the southern city of Stavanger on Tuesday, questioned witnesses and ""seized potential evidence"". 
""Teekay Shipping Norway AS is suspected of illegal export of waste, in the form of the shuttle tanker Navion Britannia. The ship sailed from Norway in 2018, and reached Alang, India in July 2018,"" Dahl told Reuters in an emailed statement.
""The investigation will focus on whether the export was in violation of Norwegian and EU regulations of waste export.""
Bermuda headquartered Teekay Offshore confirmed in a statement that the vessel was part of their fleet and their office had been raided.
The company said the vessel had been sent to an Indian yard in 2018 for recycling in full compliance with the requirements and standards of the Hong Kong convention.
""As a responsible operator, we are open and transparent about our practices and have nothing to hide,"" Teekay Offshore said. ""We have followed all rules and regulations in the related export and recycling processes.""
The Hong Kong convention lays down requirements for the safe and environmentally friendly recycling of ships and the disposal of hazardous materials.
Okokrim's Dahl said Norwegian police had not yet reached a conclusion over whether the vessel must be considered as waste before sailing from Norway.
""In our experience, the scope of the investigation of Teekay Shipping Norway AS will necessitate months rather than weeks of investigation before we will be able to conclude on whether to charge or acquit the company,"" Dahl said.
The majority of the world's aging ships are broken up on beaches in Bangladesh, Pakistan and India.
Campaigners have said that in many yards workers still cut up ships with little more than their hands and blowtorches, with parts and pollutants dropping directly onto the sand. They say they have continued concerns over safety at the sites.

CAIRO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The United Nations said on Thursday it was suspending operations at a refugee center in Libya's capital because it could become a target while the U.N. envoy said a truce brokered by Russia and Turkey was holding ""only in name"".
Artillery exchanges in Tripoli have significantly increased in recent days, U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame told the Security Council in a briefing, causing an increase in civilian casualties due to indiscriminate shelling.
Since Jan. 12, when forces aligned with Tripoli's internationally recognized government and eastern based rivals led by Khalifa Haftar conditionally agreed to a truce, more than 110 violations had been recorded, Salame said.
Libya's conflict has escalated since Haftar launched an offensive on Tripoli in April, upending U.N.-led peace plans. International powers have supplied arms and air power, though there has been a lull in air strikes since Russia and Turkey called for a truce starting Jan. 12, and international powers met in Berlin on Jan. 19 trying to broker a ceasefire.
Haftar has received support from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Russia and Egypt, while Turkey has recently stepped up its backing for the Tripoli government.
U.S. Ambassador Kelly Craft told the Security Council that ""regrettably the promise of the Berlin conference is already under threat"". It was ""past time"" for those violating an arms embargo ""to face real consequences"", she warned, without giving details.
The 15-member U.N. Security Council has been negotiating a British-drafted resolution to endorse the outcomes of the Berlin conference, but it was not immediately clear when the text could be put to a vote.
The U.N. says arms and fighters have continued to pour into Libya despite pledges in Berlin to uphold the arms embargo, while clashes have picked up on the ground with at least 18 civilians killed and three wounded in and around Tripoli since Jan. 6.
""With recent developments on the ground, I regret to report that the truce holds only in name,"" Salame said.
MILITARY EXERCISES
The closure of the center for refugees and asylum seekers in central Tripoli may further restrict protection for migrants frequently subjected to abuse including torture and forced labor, both in and out of detention.
The UNHCR Gathering and Departure Facility (GDF), which housed nearly 1,000 people, had been plagued with problems, reflecting the difficulties for international agencies working in a city controlled by armed groups.
""Unfortunately UNHCR was left with no choice but to suspend work at the (GDF) after learning that training exercises, involving police and military personnel, are taking place just a few meters away from units housing asylum seekers and refugees,"" Jean-Paul Cavalieri, UNHCR's Libya head, said in a statement.
""We fear that the entire area could become a military target, further endangering the lives of refugees, asylum seekers, and other civilians.""
Libya's western coast has been one of the main departure points for migrants attempting dangerous sea crossings to Europe, though the number of departures has dropped sharply since mid-2017.
The country has a migrant population numbering hundreds of thousands, and several thousand are held in detention centers in or near Tripoli that have been left unguarded or hit by artillery or air strikes amid the fighting.
In July, an air strike hit a detention center in Tripoli's Tajoura district that was located in the same complex as an armed group's vehicle repair workshop, killing at least 53 migrants.
A U.N. report issued this week repeated previous findings that the air strike was likely carried out by a foreign aircraft, but failed to name the state."

Harry, Queen Elizabeth's grandson, posted the pictures he had taken of African wildlife on his Instagram account, which then had 5.6 million followers, to mark Earth Day and highlight conservation efforts. 
But the Mail on Sunday newspaper reported last April that the photos had not revealed the full story. It said the animals involved had been tranquilized and that a picture of an elephant in Malawi had been edited so that it was not possible to see there was a rope around its hind legs.
""Drugged and tethered ... what Harry didn’t tell you about those awe-inspiring wildlife photos,"" read the headline.
The prince argued the report was inaccurate because it indicated he had intentionally misled the public to think that he was a superior wildlife photographer who had captured the pictures under dangerous circumstances, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) watchdog said.
Harry said his caption had made clear the animals were being relocated as part of conservation efforts and that the photo had only been edited to meet Instagram's formatting requirements.
However, the paper said Harry had not explained the circumstances of the photo to his followers and that he had not needed to crop the pictures in the way he had.
IPSO's complaints committee supported the paper's argument and rejected Harry's claim that the article was inaccurate.
""The committee did not consider that it was significantly misleading to report that the photographs posted on the complainant’s Instagram account did not quite tell the full story and that the complainant had not explained the circumstances in which the photographs had been taken,"" it said.
Harry and his American wife Meghan have increasingly become embroiled in conflict with Britain's tabloid newspapers.
Meghan is suing the Mail on Sunday over its publication of a private letter she sent to her father, Thomas Markle, and Harry has accused some newspapers of bullying his wife in the same way they treated his mother, Princess Diana, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 as her limousine sped away from chasing paparazzi.
Earlier this month the couple, who are currently in Canada with their baby son Archie, announced they would no longer use their royal titles and were seeking an independent new life based mainly in North America.
Last week, lawyers for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as they are formally known, issued a warning to media not to use paparazzi pictures of the couple.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - White House senior adviser Jared Kushner said Washington wants Israel to wait until after its March 2 election before making any moves toward settlement annexation in the West Bank, following the announcement of a U.S. peace plan.
Kushner, an architect of the peace proposal hailed by Israel and rejected by the Palestinians, raised the stop sign in a video interview, posted on the internet on Thursday, with GZERO Media, a subsidiary of risk analysis firm Eurasia Group.
In the interview, he also voiced American displeasure with the Palestinians, who rejected the plan announced on Tuesday by U.S. President Donald Trump, accusing them of playing ""the victimhood card"" and passing up an opportunity for a state.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has hailed the U.S. proposal, told reporters on Tuesday that he would ask his Cabinet next week to approve applying Israeli law to Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
Such a move could be a first step toward formal annexation of the settlements and the Jordan Valley - territory Israel has kept under military occupation since its capture in the 1967 Middle East war and which Palestinians seek for a future state.
Map showing proposed State of Palestine: https://graphics.reuters.com/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PLAN/0100B5B73B0/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PLAN.jpg 
""Well let's see what happens,"" Kushner, who is Trump's son-in-law, said when asked about the possibility Israel would begin an annexation process as early as this weekend. ""The hope is that they'll wait until after the election and we'll work with them to try to come up with something.""
A senior Israeli official traveling on Netanyahu's flight home on Thursday was non-committal over whether the issue would be raised at the next Cabinet meeting, which is usually held on Sundays.
""The issue is being looked into,"" the official told reporters on the plane.
Israel, the official said, initially understood it could declare sovereignty in two stages: immediately, with regard to territory clearly within the U.S. plan's West Bank map delineation, and later on for more complex areas.
But the Americans preferred a full and final map before Israel took action, the official said, adding: ""We are working it out."" 
In the interview, Kushner called on Palestinian leaders to ""put up or shut up"" and said they now have a ""golden opportunity"" to help their people.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has called Trump's blueprint an ""onslaught against the national rights of the Palestinian people"". He plans to speak against the proposal in the U.N. Security Council in the next two weeks.
Washington's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, but with strict conditions on the Palestinians.
It gives Israel much of what it has long sought, including recognition of its West Bank settlements and Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley. A redrawn, demilitarized Palestinian state would be subject to Israeli security control, receiving tracts of desert in return for arable land settled by Israelis.

Most countries consider Israeli settlements on land captured in war to be a violation of international law. Trump has changed U.S. policy to withdraw such objections.

Mark Royden, 47, had denied smashing a glass box housing the priceless manuscript in Salisbury cathedral in southern England in 2018.
Salisbury Crown Court heard he had set off a fire alarm in the cathedral cloisters before stunning visitors by hitting the glass case with a hammer, causing three holes in it and damage estimated at 14,000 pounds ($18,400).
Failing to break through the safety glass, he tried to run out of the cathedral but was grabbed by maintenance workers and visitors, including an American tourist.
The parchment, one of only four original copies still surviving, was not damaged.
A key manuscript in English history, the Magna Carta is a charter of citizens' rights curbing the arbitrary power of medieval kings which among other things guaranteed the right to a fair trial.
King John agreed to place his seal on the document in June 1215 at Runnymede near Windsor, west of London, as a means of ending an uprising by rebel barons.
Prosecutors said when questioned by police Royden had appeared to question the authenticity of the document.
""The historical importance of the Magna Carta in establishing the right to justice cannot be overstated – which is somewhat ironic given Mark Royden’s repeated denials of his crime in the face of overwhelming evidence,"" said Rob Welling of the Crown Prosecution Service said.
""Had he succeeded in taking it, Royden would have deprived the nation of what is said to be the most beautiful surviving copy from 1215.""
Royden was released on bail and will be sentenced at a later date. The charter is back on display in Salisbury cathedral."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - On a windy January night in Brooklyn, a young Jewish woman wary of rising anti-Semitism in her city threw a man who had confronted her to the sidewalk.
It was Ariana Gold's first night of training with the Guardian Angels, a volunteer neighborhood patrol group that has started patrolling the borough's Crown Heights section, where attacks against ultra-orthodox Jews have risen in recent months.
""I think a lot of people are afraid and I think rightly so,"" Gold said. ""We've seen a lot of attacks in the Jewish communities.""
Gold, 28, who lives in a different Brooklyn neighborhood and is not ultra-orthodox, is among the first group of local Jewish women to sign up with the Guardian Angels, which was born in New York during the high-crime late 1970s and now has branches in dozens of cities across the country and around the world.
The defense techniques she was shown on her first night are designed to ""bring a person into submission without really hurting them,"" said martial arts master Milton Oliver, 51, a construction supervisor and Guardian Angel since 1982.
Gold, a New York native who has been boxing for exercise for five years, found her way to the Guardian Angels after spotting a recruitment poster in the subway.
""I believe in community engagement and working with communities, I believe in martial arts and self-defense, I believe in volunteerism and taking care of the people around you,"" said Gold, who works at a non-profit organization. ""So, this kind of combined all of those traits.""
The Guardian Angel patrols in Crown Heights, home to the Chabad-Lubavitch Hasidic movement and many of its followers, come after high-profile mass shootings at synagogues in Pittsburgh and San Diego in the past 16 months.
In New York, police reported a 26% jump in anti-Semitic hate-crimes last year. While most of the city's 234 incidents involved graffiti, they also included attacks on Lubavitchers in Crown Heights, which has a history of occasionally strained relations between Jews and blacks that flared into rioting in 1991.
Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa said community leaders asked his group to resume patrols for the first time since the riots after a mass stabbing attack on Hanukkah celebrants last month in suburban Monsey, New York, about 40 miles (64 km) away, as well as several assaults in Crown Heights.
Patrols were also launched in some other ultra-orthodox Brooklyn neighborhoods, he said.
Although the incidents prompted an increased police presence, Sliwa said residents still need to take charge of their own safety.
""You can't depend on a political figure or the police,"" he said. ""You've got to self-help, you have to use self-defense, you have to fight back, you have to be aggressive.""
The Guardian Angels have started training 40 to 50 mostly ultra-orthodox Jews to defend themselves and make citizens' arrests, Sliwa said. By late summer or early fall, he said they should be able to staff their own neighborhood patrols.
Meanwhile, Sliwa and a handful of Guardian Angel volunteers patrol the streets about three times a day in their signature red berets and jackets, often drawing handshakes, selfies and thanks from local residents in traditional Lubavitcher garb.
When Gold is fully trained, she said she will patrol ""wherever they send me,"" adding, ""I'm pretty flexible.""

WARSAW/PARIS (Reuters) - When French President Emmanuel Macron toured eastern Europe just weeks after being elected in 2017, he shunned Poland and delivered a stinging attack on its leaders.
Poland, he said, was isolating itself in Europe and its people deserved better of their nationalist government. Warsaw hit back at his comments, made in Bulgaria, by calling him ""arrogant"" and ""inexperienced"".
Macron will finally visit Poland next week, hoping to reset ties with a country he has loudly criticized over reforms of the judiciary, which he sees as undemocratic, and a climate change policy at odds with many of Warsaw's European Union partners.
By visiting Poland days after Britain leaves the EU, Macron is signaling the importance of one of the bloc's biggest member states. In an attempt to strengthen ties, he will propose new investment plans and try to build nuclear and military partnerships during the Feb. 3-4 visit, French and Polish officials said.
""A country so central can't be seen as being on the defensive all the time,"" a French diplomat told Reuters.
Macron could face an uphill battle on many fronts. Polish officials told Reuters they are skeptical that the new technologies France hopes to sell are beneficial for Poland.
Relations between Poland and France soured after Poland's Law and Justice (PiS) government scrapped a $3.4 billion helicopter deal with Airbus in 2016, angering France, which thought the deal was largely agreed.
Since then, France and Poland have been on the opposite sides of many arguments.
Macron, a fervent European integrationist, has decried nationalist governments like Poland's and criticized, along with the EU executive, and efforts by PiS to put Polish courts and media under more government control.
Both countries want to keep generous funding for their agricultural sectors in the EU budget, but Paris is pushing for more action on migration and the climate, while Warsaw has rejected EU policies on both matters.
""RE-BALANCING"" ACT
It is not clear to what extent Macron will press Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki and President Andrzej Duda on issues of disagreement when he meets them on Monday.
A French diplomat said Macron wanted to ""re-balance"" what Paris sees as Poland's ""Buy American"" policy, and would propose military and industrial cooperation in areas such as telecoms and nuclear energy.
""France and Poland have similar interests to be achieved at the EU level,"" a Polish government source said, pointing to nuclear power policies and agriculture.
France has long pushed the sale of French nuclear technology to Poland, with Macron raising the subject with Duda on the sidelines of a NATO summit in London in December, according to two Polish officials with knowledge of the talks.
Polish government officials said there was a consensus that Poland wanted to build some nuclear plants but was considering using nuclear technology from the United States and South Korea.
Two Polish officials said they had doubts about the French defense and nuclear offers.
""There are a series of signals that there were problems,"" one official said, citing regulatory issues.
The construction of France's new generation Flamanville 3 EPR nuclear reactor in northern France has been hampered by technical problems and construction is years behind schedule.
A French diplomat acknowledged talks on nuclear technology were at a very early, political stage."

The Sudanese authorities said last month they had 5,000 troops operating in Yemen as part of a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis.
""We informed the Sudanese authorities through the ICRC that we have Sudanese prisoners, and that we are ready to hold negotiations with them for a swap deal,"" al-Masirah said on Twitter, citing a Houthi official in charge of prisoner matters.
""We hope the Sudanese authorities will put pressure on Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to secure the release of their children,"" the official added, implying that the Sudanese prisoners would be released in exchange for Houthis held by Saudi or UAE forces, or groups affiliated to them. 
Yemen's conflict is seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. The Houthis, who control most big urban centers, say they are fighting a corrupt system.
The war has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.

The coalition battling IS militants in Iraq and Syria suspended most of its operations on Jan. 5 to focus on protecting coalition forces and bases, as tensions with Iran grew.
Iraq’s parliament also passed a resolution telling the government to end the presence of foreign troops in the country and ensure they not use its territory for any reason.
""In order to exploit the time that remains for the international coalition before the new relationship is set up... It was decided to carry out joint actions ... "" an Iraqi military statement said. 
The joint operations include aerial backing for the Iraqi forces depending on their needs, the statement said. 
Baghdad condemned both the killing of Soleimani and Iran's missile attacks on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops as acts of aggression on Iraq and a breach of its sovereignty.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has asked Washington to prepare for a U.S. troop withdrawal in line with the request by Iraq’s parliament. So far, the U.S. government has rebuffed the call to withdraw.
However, Washington has said it is exploring a possible expansion of NATO’s mission in Iraq, a plan to ""get burden-sharing right in the region"".

Backed by Russian air power, government forces have rapidly advanced on Idlib since last week, upending an area where millions have taken refugee since the start of Syria's nearly nine-year war.
Jeffrey told a news briefing that Syrian government and Russian warplanes had hit Idlib with 200 air strikes ""mainly against civilians"" in the past three days.
He said the assault had set ""700,000 people who are already internally displaced on the move once again toward the Turkish border, which will then create an international crisis"".
Moscow and Damascus say they are fighting jihadist militants who have stepped up attacks on civilians in Aleppo, but rights groups and rescue workers say air strikes have demolished hospitals, schools and hit other civilian areas.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday that Ankara was losing patience with the Idlib assault and would retaliate against any attack on its 12 observation posts in the area.
Turkey already hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees and fears millions more could soon cross the frontier.

The project, in the works since late 2018, has begun as a trial run with an initial payment for a shipment of cancer drugs and drugs required for organ transplants to Iran worth 2.3 million euros ($2.55 million), the government said. 
Swiss and U.S. officials had told Reuters last month that the humanitarian channel could be up and running within months. 
Food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies are exempt from sanctions that Washington reimposed last year after U.S. President Donald Trump walked away from a 2015 international deal over Iran's nuclear program.
But the U.S. measures targeting everything from oil sales to shipping and financial activities have deterred several foreign banks from doing business with the Islamic Republic - including humanitarian deals - just as Iran grappled with major protests.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A gunman went live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) to warn he was taking his ""final journey"" before firing at a protest against India's new citizenship law in Delhi on Thursday, wounding a student.
The shooter, dressed in a black jacket, brandished a single-barrel weapon as he stood meters away from dozens of policemen outside Jamia Millia Islamia University, where more than 1,000 protesters had gathered for a march.
He shouted slogans against the protesters, including hijab clad women, before firing at them in the first such incident in the capital during more than a month of demonstrations.
""He was in front of all the people - protesters and policemen who were standing nearby, but he jumped in from this side, brandished the gun and said 'Come I will give you freedom',"" a witness who gave his name as Aamir said.
The Citizenship Amendment Act fast-tracks Indian citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from three neighboring countries.
By late on Thursday, hundreds of riot police armed with teargas canisters and backed by water cannon patrolled the area as protesters sang the national anthem and waved the Indian flag.
Thursday's shooting raised concerns from the opposition that youths are trying to take the law into their own hands to crush any dissent against the government.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has rejected the protests and members of his Hindu nationalist party and its affiliates have painted the protesters as anti-nationals. 
This week, India's junior finance minister Anurag Thakur encouraged supporters at a state election rally in New Delhi to chant slogans calling for traitors to be shot, drawing a reprimand from the election commission.
FACEBOOK POSTS
Minutes before firing, the shooter, who identified himself as ""Rambhakt Gopal"" had uploaded posts onto his Facebook profile saying this will be his ""final journey"" and urging readers to ""remember his family"". 
His video showed him walking through a road near Jamia, where the students were gathering.
On his Facebook the shooter had also posted photos of himself posing with a gun and he is seen wearing a saffron T-shirt, the color of Hindu nationalists.
Police later said they had detained the suspected gunman but gave no details. They said one student was injured in his hand.
Facebook later said it had taken down the gunman's account.
""There is no place on Facebook for those who commit this kind of violence,"" the social media giant said in a statement. ""We have removed the gunman's Facebook account and are removing any content that praises, supports or represents the gunman or the shooting as soon as we identify it.""
The main opposition Congress party said the shooting showed comments by leaders of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party could stoke violence. 
""Is this what BJP leaders ... intended? Creating an armed militia of radicalized youth,"" the party said in a tweet.
India's Home Minister Amit Shah tweeted that he had spoken to the chief of Delhi police and asked him to take strict action.
""The federal government will not tolerate any such incident, will take serious action and the perpetrator will not be spared,"" he said.
Modi's government says the citizenship law is needed to help members of persecuted religious minorities who fled to India before 2015 from Muslim-majority Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
But protesters say the law, and a proposed national register for citizens, discriminates against Muslims and violates India's secular constitution.
Some of the biggest protests have taken place near Jamia university, which police stormed in December. On Thursday, police barricaded the road outside the university.

A group of students, most of them women, were holding a sit-in near the barricade after they were stopped from marching to a memorial for independence leader Mahatma Gandhi on the anniversary of his assassination in 1948. At least half a dozen were injured as a scuffle with the police ensued.

Since independence in 1832, Greece has repeatedly called for the return of the 2,500-year-old sculptures that British diplomat Lord Elgin removed from the Parthenon temple in Athens in the early 19th century, when Greece was under Ottoman Turkish rule.
The British Museum in London has refused to return the sculptures - roughly half of a 160 meter frieze which adorned the 5th century BC monument - saying they were acquired by Elgin under a legal contract with the Ottoman empire. Greece says they were stolen.
Culture Minister Lina Mendoni told Reuters that she believes the circumstances are ripe at the moment for the marbles' return.
""It is the mentality that has changed, the fact that Britain is distancing itself from the European family, it is 200 years since the Greek revolution. I think the right conditions have been created for their permanent return,"" she said.
Greece plans grand cultural events throughout 2021 to mark 200 years since the start of its revolt against Ottoman rule.
Britain will leave the European Union on Jan. 31.
She earlier told a conference in Athens: ""As Britain distances itself from Europe and the ideas that it advocates, Greece, rebounding from the recent crisis will in coming years have the opportunity to attract attention and interest from an international audience.""
The British museum has said ""the sculptures are part of everyone's shared heritage and transcend cultural boundaries"".
The museum also used to argue for years that Athens lacked a suitable place to preserve the marbles. Greece says that approach smacks of an antiquated and colonialist approach of displaying 'trophies' from expeditions overseas.
Greece stepped up its campaign for their return after opening a new museum in 2009 at the foot of the Acropolis hill, which holds the sculptures that Elgin left behind alongside plaster casts of the missing pieces. The modern glass and concrete building's windows reflect images of the Parthenon.
Mendoni said Greece would never give up the campaign for the marbles' return, accusing Elgin of being nothing short of a thief.
""Motivated by financial gain, publicity and self promotion, Elgin deployed illegal and untoward measures to extract from Greece the Sculptures of the Parthenon and a plethora of other antiquities in a blatant act of serial theft,"" she said."

The survey found that 51% supported independence, YouGov said, the first time the pollster had found majority backing for a ""Yes"" to secession since 2015.
Scotland's nationalist First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold another referendum but British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has refused permission, and no vote can take place without the consent of the government in Westminster.
In 2014, Scots voted to remain in the United Kingdom by 55% to 45%. However, members of Scotland's parliament on Wednesday voted in favor of a new poll, arguing that Britain's impending departure from the European Union, which a majority of Scots opposed, had changed the circumstances.
The poll found that more than one in five of those who voted ""No"" in 2014 but backed staying in the EU would now back independence.
However, a majority of Scots opposed holding a second vote on the issue this year and the survey found that many voters were still worried about the economic impact, with 42% thinking an independent Scotland would be worse off against 35% believing it would be better off.
""These are concerning times for unionists both north and south of the border with 'Yes' gaining considerable ground on 'No' since 2014,"" said Chris Curtis, Political Research Manager at YouGov.
""Yet the fundamental problem that flummoxed the 'Yes' movement in 2014, that independence would damage the economy, still exists and could still set them back in indyref2.""
Since the 2014 vote, most polls have suggested that Scots would narrowly reject independence again.
However Sturgeon's Scottish National Party, which strongly opposed Brexit, won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in Britain's national election in December, taking 45% of votes cast, an 8 percentage-point increase from 2017."
37,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 08:37AM ET</span>",Algerian protests blunted without a shot fired in anger,"By Lamine Chikhi
ALGIERS (Reuters) - While uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East have been quelled by deadly force, Algerian authorities are on the way to becalming a powerful protest movement without a shot fired - at least for now.
Thousands still march, but protests are smaller than those that toppled the veteran president last year. Some prominent figures say the opposition should accept an offer of dialogue from the government.
These changes suggest the secretive authorities, known to Algerians as le pouvoir - ""the powers that be"" - may have outmaneuvered the biggest threat to their rule in decades.
Their strategy has been to place new faces at the top of government, while playing for time and proposing talks. The approach seems to be wearing down the opposition.
""I did not go to the protests on the past two Fridays,"" said Hamdadou, 51, a telecoms worker who had attended most previous marches and asked to keep his family name unpublished.
""I think we have done the maximum to push toward change. Let's cross our fingers and see what happens.""
Protesters say the marches have diminished since last month's election of a new president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, seen by the leaderless opposition as an establishment stalwart.
The protests began nearly a year ago, flooding cities with national flags and placards, demanding a removal of the ruling elite, an end to graft and the army's withdrawal from politics.
Le pouvoir jettisoned President Abdelaziz Bouteflika, threw some top officials into prison on corruption charges and let the protests continue, publicly hailing them as a patriotic renewal while detaining dozens of marchers and prominent dissidents.
Their strategy - pushed by the powerful army chief Ahmed Gaed Salah - was to use December's election to restore legitimacy to a system that would remain essentially unchanged.
Tebboune was elected on an official turnout of 40%, though many protesters believe even that figure was inflated, and immediately freed many prisoners and offered dialogue with the protesters and reform of the constitution.
Gaed Salah then died suddenly of a heart attack in late December, meaning Algeria now has a new president, government and army chief and that all the most prominent figures associated with le pouvoir have been replaced.
FROM DEMONSTRATIONS TO DIALOGUE?
Some politicians who embraced the protest movement, known as ""hirak"", say their struggle should now move from the street to the negotiating table, arguing that further reforms can only be achieved through dialogue.
""It is the time for politics now. Hirak would continue to be a means of pressure, but only politicians can talk with the regime to push forward demands including a change of the system,"" said Soufiane Djilali, an opposition leader.
For the remaining protesters that viewpoint is anathema.
Maasum, a student at the Algiers Bab Ezouar university of technology, who gave only his first name, acknowledged during last Friday's protest that there were fewer demonstrators, but said he remained committed to bigger change.
""How can you talk with a president we do not recognize?"" he said. ""We said they must all go. So no dialogue until they all go.""
Djilali was one of several opposition figures including Mouloud Hamrouche, Ahmed Taleb Ibrahimi, Abdelaziz Rahabi and Ahmed Benbitour to meet Tebboune, a former prime minister under Bouteflika, drawing ire from Maasum and other street protesters.
NO SET LEADERSHIP
Few would deny the scope of the hirak's achievements so far. In a region where leaders have often used extreme violence to suppress public dissent, it has brought down a president, Bouteflika, who was entrenched for 20 years, without a gunshot.
Bouteflika's brother and de facto regent during his illness, as well as the once all-powerful intelligence chief Mohamed ""Toufik"" Mediene, have been sentenced to 15 years in prison.
""Many believe that the hirak fulfilled its mission by sacking Bouteflika and cleaning the country of its corrupt leaders,"" said Algerian political analyst Farid Ferrahi.
Even in the Kabyle region outside Algiers, a stronghold of the hirak, ""life is almost back to normal,"" said Said Mezouane, a resident of the village of Haizer.
But the thousands - down from hundreds of thousands last spring and tens of thousands before December's election - who still protest believe there has been only cosmetic change.
Since the hirak has no leadership, official organization or commonly agreed plans for effecting change, however, there is no clear mechanism by which it can agree on a way forward.
Novelist Kamel Daoud, a fierce critic of the authorities, wrote: ""Has the regime won? Yes, temporarily. It is also true to conclude that the protest has temporarily been lost"".
However, Algeria faces a hard economic year with falling energy revenue eating deep into its budget and a planned public spending cut of 9% this year - meaning the government may find it hard to win enduring public support.
Protesters in central Algiers seem unwilling to compromise.
""Morale is high. We will continue our struggle... we want the opposition to unite and push the regime to the exit,"" said Dahmani, 25, a student at Dely Brahim university."

The memorial, which included photos, candles and flowers, was set up opposite the law courts at the foot of a monument that marked Malta's victory over invading Ottoman Turks in 1565.
Anti-corruption journalist Caruana Galizia was killed by a car bomb in October 2017 and the small memorial to her sprung up almost immediately beneath the city-center monument.
Blogger Manuel Delia, who brought the case to court, said government workers had cleared the memorial more than 20 times, throwing away the various mementos into the bin.
The Court ordered the government to pay Delia 1,000 euros ($1,110) in compensation and to return the ""stolen"" material. It said Bonnici should pay legal expenses. He made no immediate comment about the ruling.
Bonnici moved from the justice to the education ministry earlier this month. In his previous role he was also responsible for local government, including public cleaning. He argued that the makeshift memorial risked damaging the original monument.
Delia said he should resign from the government for having turned the memorial into a divisive site.
""Owen Bonnici did this when he was minister for justice whose first duty is to safeguard everyone's fundamental human right. He did the opposite,"" Delia wrote on his blog. ""Bonnici's position as a government minister is entirely untenable.""
Malta's new prime minister, Robert Abela, said last week he had ordered that the memorial be now left untouched.
The previous prime minister, Jospeh Muscat, stood down after acknowledging that mistakes had been made during the investigation into Caruana Galizia's killing. A businessman with alleged links to government officials was charged in December with complicity in the murder."

The attack took place in the northern province of Cabo Delgado, where a festering Islamist insurgency threatens security in a nation set to become a top global gas exporter. Hundreds of people have been killed since 2017.
Birgit Holm, director of ADPP Mozambique, a charity working in education, health, agriculture and renewable energy, said its college had been set alight but it did not seem like any students or staff had been hurt.
The alarm was raised during a spate of attacks nearby, allowing people from a nearby village and the school in Bilibiza time to flee before the militants reached them on Wednesday night, she told Reuters.
""But (the militants) were there, and they burned the place, we don't know yet how much because nobody has dared to go back yet,"" she said.
An institute of agriculture in Bilibiza run by the Aga Khan Foundation, an international development agency, was also hit, Holm and the analyst, Johann Smith, said. The institute told Reuters it was still gathering information.
A group known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama began staging attacks in the region in 2017. More recently, the Islamic State has claimed a number of the attacks via their media outlets.
The violence, including beheadings, the razing of villages and clashes with security forces, is unfolding on the doorstep of the biggest gas find in a decade, with projects being developed by the likes of  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) and Total that have the potential to transform Mozambique's economy.
The frequency of attacks is growing, with around 16 so far in January, Smith said.
South Africa's International Relations and Cooperation Minister Naledi Pandor said this week that attacks by militants affiliated with the Islamic State in neighboring Mozambique were cause for concern.
""History has shown that poorer regions are most vulnerable to violent external incursions as material incentives are easily disbursed to attract young people to these negative activities,"" she told a conference in Pretoria, South Africa."

Immigration contributed a net 55,000 people to Switzerland's population last year, the State Secretariat for Migration said. The foreign population stood at 2.1 million at year's end, or around a quarter of the overall 8.5 million.
Net immigration from the European Union and EFTA countries Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein increased by nearly 32,000, mostly as Romanians and Bulgarians took advantage of the full opening of the Swiss labor market for them as of June 2019.
The biggest groups of EU citizens living in Switzerland are from Italy, Germany, France, Portugal and Kosovo.
In a binding referendum on May 17, voters will decide whether Switzerland should take back unilateral control of immigration, if necessary at the cost of abrogating the free-movement pact with the EU that took full effect in 2007.
The referendum under the Swiss system of direct democracy is being billed as Switzerland's ""Brexit moment"".
The referendum drive reflects unease with the influx of foreigners. But imposing limits on EU citizens would violate bilateral accords that enhance Swiss access to the EU single market, the lifeblood of the export-led Swiss economy.
Most Swiss oppose the idea of ending the free movement pact, a poll published this month found.
Campaigning to oppose the proposition in the referendum is a priority for the Swiss government, which has struggled to put relations with the surrounding EU on a new footing.
Brussels wants the Swiss to endorse a new treaty that would have Bern routinely adopt single market rules and create a more effective platform to resolve disputes. 
The Swiss government has dragged its feet for months while it tries to forge domestic consensus on how to proceed, annoying Brussels and triggering a row over cross-border stock trading. The May vote has put any progress on hold.

The treaty ran aground amid opposition that spanned the normally pro-Europe center left to the anti-EU far right. Critics say the pact infringes Swiss sovereignty to the extent that it would never get through parliament or pass a referendum.

The babies, at least some of them prematurely born, fell simultaneously ill in the early hours of Dec. 20, suffering from shortness of breath. Thanks to prompt medical intervention, all recovered and are not expected to face long-term harm.
""In the early hours five infants, aged between one day and one month, suffered shortness of breath almost simultaneously,"" Ulm police chief Bernhard Weber told a news conference on Thursday.
Hospital authorities first suspected an infection, but urine tests disproved that theory, while at the same time revealing traces of morphine in all five infants - even though two of them had not been prescribed the drug.
Morphine is routinely stocked at neonatal departments to treat the withdrawal symptoms of babies born to mothers who are addicted.
Investigators were able to conclude from the time of the symptoms that the poisonings had happened during a night shift. They later found a syringe containing morphine-infused baby milk in the locker of one of the nurses on that shift.

The nurse, who was not identified by authorities but described as ""young"", was arrested after the syringe was found. She denies charges of serious bodily harm and attempted killing.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling 5-Star Movement faces the prospect of desertions and ruinous splits which may be impossible to stem at a spring congress, party officials are warning.
The anti-establishment movement, which won twice as many votes as its nearest rival at the last national election in 2018, has been beset with problems ever since.
It shed votes when in government with the hard-right League until August last year, and has done so since forming a new administration with the center-left Democratic Party (PD).
Now 5-Star's parliamentarians and supporters are divided between those who want a return to its origins as a go-it-alone protest party, those who favor cementing the alliance with the PD, and those wanting to hook up again with the League.
5-Star's candidate won just 3.5% of the vote in a regional election in northern Italy on Sunday after former leader Luigi Di Maio resigned, complaining of backstabbing from colleagues.
""The Movement used to be poetry and hope, now it's guerrilla warfare and suspicion,"" said Max Bugani, a veteran 5-Star politician who now works with its mayor of Rome, Virginia Raggi.
Bugani, an influential 5-Star figure since its foundation in 2009, said the party could soon split up, and that this would be better than ""pushing on together but arguing every day.""
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, an independent close to 5-Star, wants it to commit to a long-term alliance with the PD in a ""progressive front"" against the popular rightist bloc spearheaded by League leader Matteo Salvini.
This strategy is backed by 5-Star's founder, comedian Beppe Grillo, but is resisted by Di Maio and other senior figures who want to remain equidistant from left and right, free to join forces with one or the other as circumstances dictate. 
Opinion polls put 5-Star on about 16% support, half its 2018 level and lagging the PD on 19% and the League on 30%.
ANARCHIC
The party's tensions are likely to come to a head at a congress intended to pick a new leader, reorganize, and set policy priorities. Originally set for March, 5-Star said on Thursday it had been pushed back by ""a few weeks"".
But some of its lawmakers see defections even before then.
They fear that caretaker leader Vito Crimi, a low profile senator, may struggle to impose discipline on an increasingly anarchic parliamentary group. 
""We are going to lose some people,"" said a senior source, suggesting some deserters were financially motivated to avoid an internal 5-Star rule obliging its lawmakers to give up part of their salaries to fund causes decided by party members.
Last month, three 5-Star senators defected to the League, depleting the government's already slim majority, and a League official said contacts were under way to lure another five or six.
Asked to comment on this, a 5-Star member of the government told Reuters ""it's possible.""
The difficulties of 5-Star, which defines itself as post-ideological, may have been inevitable once it transformed itself from an angry protest movement to a party of government, effectively joining the ""system"" it was born to fight.
Dismissing left and right as outdated concepts helped it hoover up votes across the political divide when in opposition. 
But to govern it had to join forces first with the hard right, alienating many of its left-leaning followers, and then with the left, alienating more conservative supporters.
It has had policy successes, pushing through many of its flagship measures such as the ""citizens' income"" poverty relief scheme, tougher sanctions for corruption, curbs on temporary job contracts and a cut in the number of parliamentarians.
It has also avoided the corruption scandals it decried in Italy's traditional parties, propelling its rise to government.
However, critics blamed Di Maio for hoarding power within his inner circle of advisers, and he failed to give the movement an effective structure or organization, fuelling simmering dissent which had no official outlet within the party.

""5-Star's internal organizational failings are a key part of its decline because political parties are first of all organizations,"" said Mattia Zulianello, a political scientist at Birmingham University who specializes in populist parties.

47,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 30, 2020 06:20AM ET</span>","'New dawn' Brexit to do list: money, charming Trump and making friends","LONDON (Reuters) - The United Kingdom leaves the European Union at 2300 GMT on Friday but Prime Minister Boris Johnson has a bulging to do list for what he has cast as a ""new dawn"" for the country.
Below are the biggest issues he has to deal with.
TRADE
As soon as the United Kingdom formally leaves the EU on Jan. 31 it can start negotiating trade deals with other countries.
The European Union - which accounts for about half of the United Kingdom's trade - along with the United States are the government's top priority for securing new trade deals.
A sticking point in U.S. talks will be a British proposal for a unilateral digital services tax, despite a U.S. threat to levy retaliatory tariffs on British-made autos.
'DIS-UNITED KINGDOM'
Brexit strained the bonds which tie the United Kingdom together: England and Wales voted to leave the EU but Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to stay.
Scottish nationalists are pushing for an independence referendum which Johnson says he will not allow. Irish nationalists also want a referendum on uniting Ireland.
TRUMP AND CHINA
Johnson granted Huawei a limited role in Britain’s 5G mobile network on Tuesday, frustrating a global attempt by the United States to exclude the Chinese telecoms giant from the West’s next-generation communications.
It is unclear what impact the decision will have on relations with the Untied States - the United Kingdom's closest ally. China has also cautioned the United Kingdom for what it says is meddling in Hong Kong - its former colony.
'ECONOMY, STUPID'
Ahead of the December election, Johnson said he would spend more on the National Health Service, infrastructure and ensure prosperity across the United Kingdom. In translation, that means more borrowing: more UK government bonds sold.
Some businesses are reporting a post-election ""Boris bounce"" recovery, and finance minister Sajid Javid says he is hopeful that Britain's economic growth can eventually bounce back to its pre-financial crisis levels of nearly 3% a year.
LONDON FINANCIAL CLOUT
Britain's vast financial services sector's future access to the European Union's will be one of the first issues to be discussed and must be finalised by the end of June.
The finance industry want to maintain a close relationship with the EU but it will not enjoy the same level of access as under the bloc’s single market, which includes a so-called passporting regime.
Instead, the government will be looking for the EU to make ruling based on equivalence where each side decides if the other’s rules for financial stability and investor protection are sufficiently aligned with its own to grant access.
The EU has indicated it will use the threat of restricting access for Britain's biggest export industry as leverage for wider demands such as fishing access to UK waters.
While London has repeatedly said it wants the nuclear deal with Iran to succeed despite Trump's abandonment of the pact, Johnson has called for a new Trump deal to replace it.
As the United Kingdom forges a post-Brexit foreign policy, Iran could give the best indication of its future orientation: will Johnson ultimately side with the United States or keep the United Kingdom aligned with the EU's Germany and France?
NEW TEAM?
After Brexit, Johnson is planning a reshuffle of his cabinet team of top ministers.

Naama Issachar's release came ahead of talks in Moscow on Thursday between Putin and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who flew in from Washington to pass on details of a U.S. peace plan, which Israel supports and Palestinians reject.
Netanyahu thanked Putin at talks in Moscow for what he said was a ""swift"" decision to pardon Issachar. Netanyahu has said he plans to meet her later on Thursday.
The release of the New Jersey-born 26-year-old is seen as a boon for Netanyahu, who had publicly appealed Putin to free her. 
The right-wing Israeli leader, under criminal corruption indictment, faces an election on March 2 and has campaigned on his ability to protect Israel's interests abroad. 
Issachar was jailed for seven and a half years after being arrested last April when police found nine grams of cannabis in her bags during a stopover at a Moscow airport on her way from India to Israel.
Her family called her treatment disproportionate and the case opened an unusual public rift between Russia and Israel. 

""It has been a long journey that I would not wish upon anyone,"" Yaffa Issachar, Naama's mother, was quoted as saying by the Jerusalem Post, having traveled to Moscow for her daughter's release. ""Now, all I want is to hug my daughter Naama.""

The Couleur gallery, in Stockholm's upmarket Ostermalm district, was holding an exhibition of work by Dali containing around 10 pieces by the Spanish artist, news agency TT said.
""They were worth 200,000 to 500,000 crowns ($21,000 to $52,000) each. So it's quite a lot of money. It's terrible."" gallery owner Peder Enstrom told TT.
The works by Dali were on loan from Switzerland, he said.
Police said the thieves smashed the glass entry doors of gallery and had made off with a number of pieces.

Warrants were issued for former U.S. Green Beret Michael Taylor and two other men, George-Antoine Zayek and Peter Taylor, prosecutors said in a statement. A warrant was also issued for Ghosn for illegally leaving the country, prosecutors said. 
Ghosn fled to Lebanon, his childhood home, at the end of last year, while he was awaiting trial on charges of under-reporting earnings, breach of trust and misappropriation of company funds, all of which he denies.
The arrest warrants come days after prosecutors searched the Tokyo office of Ghosn's former lawyer. 
Lebanon and Japan have about 40 days to decide whether Ghosn will be extradited to Japan or stand trial in Lebanon, Reuters reported last week. 
The two countries have no extradition treaty and Lebanon does not typically hand over its nationals. Ghosn's legal team is hoping to hold the trial in Lebanon, where the former auto executive has deep ties and hopes to clear his name.

Ghosn has struck out at what he has called Japan's unjust judicial system and said the alternative to fleeing would have been to spend the rest of his life languishing in Tokyo without a fair trial.

LILONGWE (Reuters) - For Ethiopian aeronautical engineer Lydia Elias, building and piloting a drone to support humanitarian and development projects on the continent of her birth has been a lifelong dream.
Now, as a student at Africa's first drone academy, she is about to make it come true.
The institute is in Malawi, and builds on the work of a pilot scheme launched in 2017 with support from U.N. children's fund UNICEF, in which drones have been used to deliver medical supplies, monitor crops and map cholera outbreaks.
As drones become smaller, more reliable and more affordable, their role in such projects - on a continent prone to natural disasters and dotted with isolated communities - seems certain to increase.
""Aeronautical engineers are very few in my country,"" said Elias, 23, as she set off to practice piloting a drone.
""After learning I will try to teach my people. I have an aerospace club, so I will try to transfer this knowledge to (colleagues) in my country.""
She and 25 others from across Africa are the first batch of students at the academy, which opened outside the capital Lilongwe this month.
They are learning how to make and fly drones, collect and analyze data over a 12-week course.
Other students share Elias's excitement.
""I have been able to create this drone,...which I made with my own hands,"" said Tanzanian Emmanuel Nasolwa, 26, beaming with joy as he showed off his work. ""I feel like ...I am going to do more things from this course.""
The academy plans to train 150 students to build and pilot drones by 2021, UNICEF said.
Financing from the Fund's partners has provided tuition to the first cohort of 26. It is expected that by 2022, the academy will run a tuition-free two-year master's degree program in drone technology.
""This decade that has just started is going to be digital and to help young people ...learn about drones will be an incredible step forward, not only for Malawi but for many other African countries,"" said Rudolf Schwenk, UNICEF Malawi country representative."

Greece served as gateway to the European Union for more than one million Syrian refugees and other migrants in recent years. While an agreement with Turkey sharply reduced the number attempting the voyage since 2016, Greek islands still struggle with overcrowded camps operating far beyond their capacity.
The 2.7 kilometer long (1.68 miles) net-like barrier that Greece wants to buy will be set up in the sea off the island of Lesbos, where the overcrowded Moria camp operates.
It will rise 50 cm above sea level and carry light marks that will make it visible at night, a government document inviting vendors to submit offers said, adding that it was ""aimed at containing the increasing inflows of migrants"".
""The invitation for floating barriers is in the right direction... We will see what the result, what its effect as a deterrent will be in practice,"" Defence Minister Nikos Panagiotopoulos told Skai Radio.
""It will be a natural barrier. If it works like the one in Evros, I believe it can be effective,"" he said, referring to a cement and barbed-wire fence that Greece set up in 2012 along its northern border with Turkey to stop a rise in migrants crossing there.
Last year, 59,726 migrants and refugees reached Greece's shores according to the UN agency UNHCR. Nearly 80% of them arrived on Chios, Samos and Lesbos.
A defense ministry official told Reuters the barrier will be installed at the north of Lesbos, where migrants usually attempt to cross over due to the short distance from Turkey.
If the floating fence is effective, more parts may be added and it could reach 13-15 kilometers, the official said.
""We need to test it to see if it can bring the results we want,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas told ANT1 TV."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's conservative government on Thursday defended its decision to use a detention center thousands of kilometers from the mainland to quarantine locals evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in China.
Australia on Wednesday said it would evacuate ""isolated and vulnerable"" locals from Wuhan as part of a joint operation with New Zealand.
Some health officials have criticized the decision to move those people to Christmas Island - about 2,600km (1,616 miles) from Australia and that had been used to hold thousands of refugees between 2002 and 2018.
Minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton said Australia has no other choice.
""The reality is people need to be accommodated for somewhere for up to 14 days. I can't clear out a hospital in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane,"" Dutton told reporters in Canberra. ""I don't have a facility otherwise that we can quickly accommodate for what might be many hundreds of people and Christmas Island is purpose-built for exactly this scenario.""
The detention center on Christmas Island was reopened last year after a decade of being idled. It houses a Tamil family whom Australia wants to deport to Sri Lanka.
Australia, which has seven cases of coronavirus, said about 600 people have told the government they are in Wuhan, though Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was not clear how many wanted to leave China.
Morrison said priority would be given to infants and elderly people.
On Thursday, the global death toll from the epidemic hit 170 people, while the number of infected patients rose to 7,711.
Australia's defense of its policy came as several countries began isolating hundreds of citizens evacuated from Wuhan.
Nearly 200 Americans, mostly U.S. diplomats and their families, airlifted from Wuhan on Wednesday, will remain isolated at a U.S. military base in California for at least 72 hours of medical observation, public health officials said.
A second flight with Japanese evacuees from Wuhan landed in Japan on Thursday, with nine people showing symptoms of fever or coughing, broadcaster NHK reported. The first flight landed on Wednesday and at least one more is expected in coming days.
New Zealand on Thursday said it would charter an aircraft to assist citizens wanting to leave Wuhan."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - At the stroke of midnight in Brussels on Friday, Britain will leave the European Union and Prime Minister Boris Johnson will deliver on his election promise to ""Get Brexit Done"".
But he won't have long to savor the triumph of a divorce that, over 3-1/2 years, shook British politics to the core and polarized the nation. Feb. 1 will mark the beginning of a new phase of negotiations between London and Brussels to agree on the shape of their future relationship.
They have until the end of 2020 -- a transition period during which Britain will remain an EU member in all but name -- to hammer out an agreement on trade and other issues including security, energy, transport links, fishing rights and data flow.
Johnson says 11 months is time enough to strike a ""zero tariff, zero quota"" trade deal and has vowed -- even though the option is there -- not to extend the limbo period beyond 2020.
CLIFF EDGE ""A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY""
If they fail, the legal default will be a potentially crippling no-deal Brexit that would leave trade between Britain and the EU based from 2021 on World Trade Organization terms that would impose import duties and controls.
EU Brexit adviser Stefaan De Rynck said this week that a cliff edge ""remains a distinct possibility"" because finding common ground by Dec. 31 will be harder than agreeing divorce terms as the two sides did in October, more than three years after Britons voted to leave the bloc in a referendum.
Trade agreements with the EU typically take years to complete, and few in Brussels believe the transition period will be long enough to seal more than a ""bare bones"" trade deal.
EXPECT A STAND-OFF OVER FAIR COMPETITION
Getting more than that would be easier if Britain was willing to remain aligned with EU regulations, but London insists it will not be ""a rule-taker"".
Britain's concern is that keeping to EU rules would make it harder to strike trade agreements with other countries, especially the United States.
The EU says it will not seal a trade deal with a large, economically powerful neighbor without solid provisions to guarantee fair competition.
Its demands will focus on ""level playing-field"" issues -- environmental and labor standards, as well as state aid rules -- to ensure Britain would not be able to offer products on the bloc's single market at unfairly low prices.
Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform think-tank said Britain's desire for full control of domestic regulation and trade policy will significantly limit the scope of any deal.
""At best, the EU and UK are on course to conclude a free trade agreement that removes all tariffs and quotas, but creates significant new administrative and regulatory barriers to trade in both goods and services,"" he said.
FISH FIGHT AHEAD
With industry supply chains in the EU currently crossing borders multiple times for products like cars and drugs, agreeing rules to designate where products come from -- and hence what regulations and taxes apply -- will be complicated.
But one of the biggest hazards on the road to a deal will be fishing rights, sparring over which has already begun.
Regaining control of Britain's rich fishing waters was a totemic issue for many Brexit campaigners, but Brussels has linked access for EU boats to access to EU markets for Britain's giant financial sector.
JUST A FEW MONTHS TO SEAL A DEAL
Although on paper the EU and Britain have 11 months to strike a deal on future relations, in reality the timeframe is much smaller.
Talks will not formally start until after EU governments agree a negotiating mandate late next month.
The two sides would then have to strike an agreement by the middle of October to leave time needed to translate the treaty into the EU's 23 official languages and secure the required parliamentary ratification before year-end."

The popular Akihito stepped down from the Chrysanthemum Throne in April, following three decades as emperor, an event marking Japan's first abdication in roughly 200 years, and his son, Naruhito, became emperor.
Akihito, 86, was examined by a neurologist and had a head MRI scan on Thursday morning.
""But there were no abnormalities detected, especially nothing suggesting anything like a stroke,"" a spokesman of the Imperial Household Agency said, adding that Akihito's condition will continue to be monitored.
Akihito had an episode of nausea and dizziness in July 2018 attributed to a condition caused by insufficient blood flow to the brain, but had not lost consciousness then, added the official of the agency managing the imperial family's affairs.
Akihito, who now holds the formal title of emperor emeritus, had breakfast as normal on Thursday, Kyodo news agency said. He has had heart surgery and has been treated for prostate cancer.
His 85-year-old wife, Empress Emerita Michiko, had surgery for early stage breast cancer in September and the palace said in December she had been unwell and lost weight since. 
Akihito, the first monarch under a post-war constitution that defines the emperor as a symbol of the people without political power, said in 2016 that he feared his age would make it hard for him to carry out his duties. 
Concern over his health was a top trending topic on Japanese Twitter. 

""At his age, this kind of thing is worrisome,"" one user wrote on Thursday. ""I guess all his hard work up to now is having an impact. Please make sure you take a good rest.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Large swathes of southeast Australia were bracing on Thursday for a days-long heatwave that threatens to stoke bushfires that have been burning for months.
As firefighters and residents prepared for the heightened danger, the New South Wales (NSW) state government launched a six-month inquiry to examine both the causes of and response to this season's deadly wildfires. 
""We don't want to waste the opportunity to take on board any recommendations we need to adopt ahead of the bushfire season this year... as we approach summer of 2021,"" said Gladys Berejiklian, the premier of NSW.
NSW state has been one of the hardest hit by bushfires, which started earlier than usual in September. The blazes have burnt out more than 11.7 million hectares (117,000 sq kms) across Australia's most populous states, killing at least 33 people and about 1 billion animals, and destroying 2,500 homes.
Fire danger warnings were issued on Thursday for several areas in South Australia state, where temperatures were forecast to exceed 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) and winds were expected to reach 35 km (22 miles) per hour. 
Among them was Kangaroo Island, a popular tourist destination that has already been razed by fires that killed two people.
The severe heat and high winds are forecast to hit NSW and Victoria states from Friday threatening to spark new life into some of the 120 fires burning across the three states or create new blazes.
Australia's dangerous summer weather has largely been driven by temperature variations in the Indian Ocean, which the country's weather bureau said on Thursday were likely to keep conditions hot and dry until March. 
Martin Webster, a NSW Rural Fire Service officer, highlighted the strains facing the state's 74,000-strong volunteer brigade as the huge fires continued to burn.
""Our local crews have been actively involved in firefighting since August and we are still long way from being out of the woods, so we are talking six or seven months of firefighting,"" Webster told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. 
Here are Thursday's key events in the bushfire crisis:
** There were 11 fires burning in the state of South Australia, 71 in New South Wales and 38 in Victoria. 
** Berejiklian, firefighting officials and family of three U.S. firefighters killed in a plane crash in remote bushland last week, attended a memorial service where members of the aviation community paid their respects. 
** Three firefighters who were trying to contain blazes in the Orroral Valley near Canberra were reported injured after a tree fell on their truck on Wednesday night, the ABC reported. Officials in the capital did not immediately return requests for information. 

** Rating agency Moody's on Wednesday warned increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters related to climate change would likely put at risk the 'AAA' credit rating of NSW.

Asian stocks and currencies fell on Thursday as fatalities rose and more cases were reported around the world.
China's National Health Commission said the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus in the country climbed to 170 as of late Wednesday and the number of infected patients rose to 7,711.
Almost all the deaths so far have been in the central province of Hubei, home to about 60 million people and now under virtual lockdown. The virus emerged last month in a live wild animal market in the provincial capital Wuhan.
Infections have been reported in at least 15 other nations, with 104 confirmed cases.
The World Health Organization (WHO) said its Emergency Committee would reconvene behind closed doors on Thursday to decide whether the rapid spread of the new virus from China now constitutes a global emergency.
""In the last few days the progress of the virus especially in some countries, especially human-to-human transmission, worries us,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva, naming Germany, Vietnam and Japan.
""Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak.""
ISOLATION PLANS
Plans to isolate hundreds of evacuated foreigners varied between countries.
Australia, South Korea, Singapore and New Zealand will quarantine all evacuees regardless of whether they showed symptoms for at least two weeks, while the United States and Japan were planning voluntary isolation for shorter periods.
Two returnees from Japan tested positive for the virus in Tokyo on Thursday although they showed no symptoms, explaining why some countries are planning extreme quarantine measures for the entire incubation period of up to 14 days.
South Korean protesters used tractors to block access to facilities earmarked as quarantine centers in the cities of Asan and Jincheon, about 80 km (50 miles) south of Seoul, on Wednesday.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Thursday urged residents not to give in to fear as the country prepared to evacuate the first of around 700 citizens from Wuhan.
""The weapons that will protect us from the new coronavirus are not fear and aversion but trust and cooperation,"" Moon said in a speech on Thursday, decrying ""fake news"" as creating excessive anxiety.
The first of up to four planned flights to Wuhan had been due to depart South Korea on Thursday morning, but were delayed for unspecified reasons, Yonhap news agency reported. The flights were still expected to depart by later in the day.
Singapore's foreign ministry said it was returning 92 Singaporeans from Wuhan on Thursday. All returning passengers, and foreign ministry staff accompanying them, will either be taken to hospital or quarantined for 14 days.
Nearly 200 Americans, mostly U.S. diplomats and their families, airlifted from Wuhan on Wednesday will remain isolated at a U.S. military base in California for at least 72 hours of medical evaluation, public health officials said.
A second flight with Japanese evacuees from Wuhan landed in Japan on Thursday with nine people showing symptoms of fever or coughing, broadcaster NHK reported. The first flight landed on Wednesday and at least one more is expected in coming days.
Three Japanese who returned on the first flight on Wednesday were confirmed to be infected with the virus, said the health ministry, two of the three had not shown any symptoms.
Japan will declare the virus as a ""designated infectious disease"" from starting Feb. 7 which will allow compulsory hospitalization, but will not apply to those without symptoms.
Chinese National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei on Sunday said the virus was infectious during incubation, which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another coronavirus that emerged from China and killed about 800 people in 2002-2003.
VIRUS HITTING CHINA ECONOMY
The effects of the virus are already weighing heavily on China's economy, the world's second-biggest, with companies cutting corporate travel and tourists cancelling trips during the traditional Lunar New Year holiday period.
A government economist said the crisis could cut China's first-quarter growth by one point to 5% or lower as the crisis hits sectors from mining to luxury goods.
Various airlines are cutting flights to the country, from British Airways and Lufthansa to Air Canada and American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL).
Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Inc's Google said it would temporarily shut all its offices in China and Sweden's IKEA said it had temporarily closed all its stores in the country because of the outbreak of the new coronavirus.
In many Chinese cities, streets were largely deserted. Tourist attractions were closed, while Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shops required people to have their temperatures taken and to wear masks.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese fashion billionaire Yusaku Maezawa has pulled out of a documentary search for a girlfriend to take on his voyage around the moon with Elon Musk's SpaceX, citing his ""mixed feelings"" about participating.
This month, the 44-year-old announced he was seeking single females over 20 willing to vie to become his girlfriend for a documentary to be aired on streaming service AbemaTV. Almost 28,000 people applied.
Maezawa said he is ""extremely remorseful"" about the decision to pull out, apologizing to the applicants and AbemaTV staff in posts to Twitter, where he is Japan's most followed account with more than 7 million followers.
Maezawa, the founder and former CEO of online fashion retailer Zozo (T:3092), which he last year sold to SoftBank Group Corp (T:9984), is known for launching big ideas with much fanfare - though some of them don't pan out as planned.
As CEO, he launched the Zozosuit, a polka-dot bodysuit that allowed users to collect body measurements to order custom-made clothes but which did not work well in practice. He also outlined an ambitious overseas expansion plan that wildly undershot targets, leading to a crash in the company's stock price.
Maezawa has pledged to give away $9 million to his Twitter followers in what he says is a ""social experiment"" to see if the payment boosts their happiness."

Issued for their alleged involvement in the planning and execution of the extrajudicial killings of six Jesuit priests and two others on a university campus in 1989, the designation bars them from entering the United States.
The crime is one of the most emblematic of the Central American country's civil war that pitted then-leftist guerrillas the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN) against the U.S.-backed Salvadoran army. The FMLN is now a political party.
In a statement, the U.S. Secretary of State said it had ""credible information"" that the current or former officials were directly or indirectly involved in ""a gross violation of human rights or significant corruption.""
Lisandro Quintanilla, a lawyer representing the military in El Salvador, could not immediately be reached for comment.
It was not clear what had prompted the United States to issue the designation. 
""We value our ongoing working relationship with the Salvadoran Armed Forces, but will continue to use all available tools and authorities, as appropriate, to address human rights violations and abuses around the world no matter when they occurred or who perpetrated them,"" it said.
El Salvador's civil war lasted from 1980 to 1992. It killed an estimated 75,000 people and left 8,000 more missing.
As in neighboring Guatemala, which was also the site of Cold War-era conflict, families of victims and human rights defenders in El Salvador have long sought justice.

In El Salvador, the Supreme Court of Justice declared a 1993 amnesty law unconstitutional in 2016 and ordered lawmakers to create a new law that would guarantee justice and reparation for victims. However, the process has been delayed.

Maduro, a socialist, last year suspended relations and gave Colombian diplomatic and consular staff 24 hours to depart in response to conservative President Ivan Duque's government's help to the Venezuelan opposition's efforts to bring humanitarian aid into the crisis-stricken country.
Colombia, like most Western democracies, recognizes Juan Guaido, chief of Venezuela's opposition-held National Assembly, as the country's rightful leader.
Colombia's Justice Ministry earlier this week said it would approach Guaido to request the extradition of Aida Merlano, who was imprisoned last year for vote buying but fled by climbing out her dentist's office. She was captured in Venezuela on Monday.
""It is a bad joke. Do you think Juan Guaido directs Venezuelan police?"" Maduro said during a state television broadcast.
Nevertheless, he proposed the restart of consular relations between the two countries.
""We are neighbors ... we are obligated to have diplomatic and political relations,"" he said.
Maduro calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to oust him in a coup and frequently accuses Duque of aiming to destabilize his government. On Wednesday he added that Merlano, in Venezuelan custody, was ""saying everything about the Colombian political class.""
Duque earlier on Wednesday said Venezuela should deport Merlano through Interpol. He said Maduro had allowed many other countries that recognize Guaido to maintain a diplomatic presence in the country."

The move would allow legal action against persons or companies trying to use her name or the movement's which are not in line with its values, she said. 
""I assure you, I and the other school strikers have absolutely no interests in trademarks. But unfortunately it needs to be done,"" she said on the social network. 
Thunberg said she had also applied to trademark ""Skolstrejk for klimatet"", school strike for the climate in Swedish - the wording on the placard she has held since she started her one-person protest outside the Swedish parliament in 2018, for whih she missed school. 
""My name and the #FridaysForFuture movement are constantly being used for commercial purposes without any consent whatsoever. It happens for instance in marketing, selling of products and people collecting money in my and the movement's name,"" she wrote on her Instagram account. 
Thunberg, who took center stage at the Global Economic Forum in Davos this month, and her fellow young activists in the movement want politicians to listen to climate scientists and take action to curb global warming.

Mexico and the United States, its most important trade partner, have been looking for ways to address the escalating security situation as well as clamp down on illegal drug and arms trade. 
Mexican authorities said the prisoners escaped from a penitentiary in southern Mexico City on Wednesday morning, possibly with the help of prison staff. 
""The escape of an inmate from this prison cannot be carried out without the involvement of public servants,"" Rosa Icela Rodriguez, interior minister for the Mexico City government, told reporters. 
Antonio Hazael Ruiz, deputy minister for the city's prison system, said the escapees had to get past five locked doors. Ten prison staff are being investigated for their possible involvement, Ruiz added.
Luis Meza and Victor Felix Beltran, both from Culiacan, in the western state of Sinaloa, had been held for drug trafficking while Yael Osuna, from Nayarit, had been held for being part of a criminal association. 
Beltran, known as ""El Vic"", managed the finances of Guzman's sons, local media reported. It was not immediately clear when the United States had submitted the request for their extradition. 
Guzmans's children, collectively known as ""Los Chapitos"", enhanced their family's near-mythical outlaw reputation last year when hundreds of heavily-armed Sinaloa Cartel henchmen poured into Culiacan to rescue one of Guzman's detained sons, briefly taking hostage the modern city of a million people.
Guzman himself escaped from two high-security prisons in Mexico but was eventually captured and extradited to the United States. 

Last year, he was sentenced to life in prison without parole and moved to a high security facility in Colorado after being convicted in a U.S. court of smuggling tons of drugs to the United States over a colorful, decades-long career.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Nine members of a defunct, cult-like Roman Catholic religious order in Italy's Tuscany region are under investigation for alleged sexual abuse of two brothers when they were minors, authorities said on Wednesday.
The nine, including five priests and three other men, were members of a religious order called the Disciples of the Annunciation. Late last year the Vatican shut down the small order, which had several communities in Tuscany.
The Vatican dissolved the Disciples following an internal Church investigation into the religious life of their members. The investigation found that it was run like a cult by a charismatic leader. 
According to the website of the diocese of the city of Prato, the local bishop, Giovanni Nerbini, informed local magistrates of the suspicions about the group.
Nerbini told a televised news conference that the first phase of the magistrates' investigation was completed and that the local church would cooperate fully with them.
The Tuscan newspaper La Nazione said the nine were suspected of having had group sex with two brothers when they were minors. The alleged abuse took place between 2008 and 2016.
There was no immediate comment from any of the accused.
La Nazione said investigators had recently raided several houses used by the order in the past, searching for documents and videos.
Nerbini said he believed the nine suspects were no longer in Prato but did not say whether either he or the magistrates had located them.
Sexual abuse and it's cover-ups have battered the Church’s credibility around the world and forced it to pay billions of dollars in settlements to victims.

The Italian Church has only recently begun to come to grips with the problem of sexual abuse on its territory and more victims, encouraged by action in other countries, have begun coming forward to reveal past abuse.

The plan is to hire 10,000 new soldiers in the coming months to ""allow our armed and security forces to be much more present in quantity and I hope in quality in areas where they were not,"" Cisse said.
He did not say how much the increase would cost or how the arid West African country would pay for it when military costs already take up a significant part of the budget.
It was also not clear how it would lure people into an army whose troops are frequently killed in attacks by Islamists.
The army declined to say how many troops it has now, but the World Bank estimated there were 18,000 armed forces personnel in 2017.
Former colonial power France intervened in 2013 to drive back militants who had seized northern Mali in 2012, but groups allied with al Qaeda and Islamic State have sprung back.
Much of central and northern Mali is largely lawless, and groups use the area as a base from which to launch attacks across neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso.
France has 4,500 troops in Mali and the wider Sahel and local international forces have also teamed up to contain the problem, but attacks have continued.
About 20 soldiers were killed in a pre-dawn attack on an army camp in the center of the country on Sunday and 24 others were killed when militants attacked a patrol in the north in November.
France warned on Monday against possible U.S. troop cuts in West Africa, worried about the impact on logistical support and intelligence gathering."

The surge in hostilities signals deadlock at stop-start peace talks involving U.S and Taliban negotiators in Doha.
The Defense Ministry said on Sunday government forces had killed 51 Taliban fighters in the weekend assaults.
But the Taliban hit back, carrying out attacks on security checkpoints in the northern province of Kunduz on Tuesday night in which a security official who declined to be identified said 15 members of the Afghan army were killed.
The Taliban also attacked a police station on Monday night in Pul-e Khomri, capital of the neighboring Baghlan province, killing 14 policemen, said Safdar Muhseni, head of the provincial council.
Taliban said it was responsible for both attacks. The group's spokesman, Zabihullah Mujahid, said 35 members of the Afghan security forces had been killed in the attack in Kunduz and 17 in Baghlan.
Sources close to the talks in Doha said the Taliban had agreed internally to halt attacks against U.S. forces and ""reduce"" assaults against Afghan government interests, but clashes between the Taliban and Afghan forces have risen.

Afghan forces and the Taliban also clashed on Tuesday when security personnel tried to access the site of a crashed U.S. military plane in central Afghanistan. U.S. forces were later able to access the site and recover the remains of two personnel and what is believed to be the flight data recorder.

Colombia is the principal destination for Venezuelan migrants fleeing from political, social and economic crisis under the government of President Nicolas Maduro.
Unlike its neighbors, Colombia has not imposed stringent immigration requirements on Venezuelans, and 1.6 million now live in the country. The United Nations said last year the figure could rise to 2.4 million by the end of 2020.
The first permit is a renewal of the so-called PEP visa, which was previously used by the government to give legal status to migrants. It could benefit some 200,000 Venezuelans who entered the Andean country before Nov. 29 last year, the migration agency said in a statement.
The second measure, known by its Spanish initials as the PEPFF visa, will be granted to Venezuelans who have formal job offers, the agency said. It will take force in a few days, it added.
The permits are meant to help the government identify Venezuelans residing in Colombia and bring them into the legal economy, in a bid to reduce spending pressures on Colombia, which has committed to providing basic services like healthcare and school places to migrants.
Last August, President Ivan Duque said Colombia would give citizenship to 24,000 children born to Venezuelan migrant parents in Colombia, to prevent them from being stateless and less able to access education and healthcare.
During a visit last week by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Duque called on the international community to mobilize greater resources and efforts to help with the crisis.
Managing the crisis will require $1.35 billion this year to meet migrants' basic needs in 17 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean that are sheltering them, according to the United Nations."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Parliament gave final approval to Britain's divorce from the European Union on Wednesday, paving the way for the country to quit the bloc on Friday after nearly half a century and delivering a major setback for European integration.
After an emotional debate during which several speakers shed tears, EU lawmakers voted 621 for and 49 against the Brexit agreement sealed between Britain and the 27 other member states last October, more than three years since Britons voted out. 
Thirteen lawmakers abstained and the chamber then broke into a rendition of Auld Lang Syne, a traditional Scottish folk song of farewell. Britain's 73 departing EU lawmakers headed for an ""Au Revoir"" party in the EU chamber after the vote.
Earlier on Wednesday, Britain's ambassador to the EU handed documents formalizing Brexit to a senior EU official. Against a backdrop of British and EU flags at the bloc's Brussels headquarters, Tim Barrow, smiling, passed over a dark blue leather file embossed with the emblem of the United Kingdom.
After protracted divorce talks, Britain will leave the club it joined in 1973 at midnight Brussels time (2300 GMT) on Friday, when British flags will be removed from EU offices and the EU flag lowered on the British premises there.
With a status-quo transition period running only until year-end, fresh talks - covering everything from trade to security - will begin soon on a new relationship.
""We are considering a zero-tariff, zero-quotas free trade agreement. But the precondition is that EU and British businesses continue to compete on a level playing field. We will certainly not expose our companies to unfair competition,"" European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen told the chamber.
Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier told envoys of the remaining 27 members earlier on Wednesday that a loose association agreement like the EU has with Ukraine should serve as the basis for new relations, diplomatic sources said. 
""We will not give ground on issues that are important to us,"" Barnier said, according to sources briefed on the closed-door meeting. 
""THE UK DIDN'T FIT""
On his last working day as a member of the European Parliament, leading Brexit campaigner Nigel Farage told reporters there was ""no going back"" once the UK leaves. 
""The UK didn't fit, we'd be better off out,"" he said, describing euroscepticism as a settled view in the UK, where ""Leave"" won the 2016 referendum by a narrow 52 to 48 percent margin. 
He said British Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised him there would be no so-called 'level playing field' clauses on fair competition in the new EU-UK deal, highlighting a major point of contention with the bloc in the coming talks. 
As Farage beamed, his Brexit Party lawmakers waved goodbye to the chamber with mini Union Jack flags and chanted ""Hurray!"", but their Socialist compatriot Jude Kirton-Darling choked back tears. 
""It's probably the saddest day of my life so far. Brexit is something that attacks the very foundation of our identity,"" said Kirton-Darling, who plans to stay in Brussels with her Belgian husband.
Guy Verhofstadt, a liberal EU lawmaker from Belgium and a staunch europhile, lamented Brexit as a historic debacle: ""It's sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, twice gave its blood to liberate Europe.""

As a new reality dawns on Europe from Saturday, the UK's Permanent Representation to the EU, or UKRep, will become a foreign mission - already dubbed ""UKmissEU"" by some.

BEIJING/GENEVA (Reuters) - Foreign governments flew their citizens out of the epicentre of China's coronavirus outbreak on Wednesday, as the number of deaths jumped to 133 and the World Health Organization voiced ""grave concern"" about person-to-person spread in three other countries.
The WHO said its Emergency Committee would reconvene behind closed doors on Thursday to decide whether the rapid spread of the new virus from China now constitutes a global emergency.
""In the last few days the progress of the virus especially in some countries, especially human-to-human transmission, worries us,"" WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference in Geneva, naming Germany, Vietnam and Japan.
""Although the numbers outside China are still relatively small, they hold the potential for a much larger outbreak.""
There have been 6,065 cases of the flu-like virus in 15 countries worldwide - all but around 70 in China - according to the latest WHO figures. All the deaths so far have been in China, where the National Health Commission said there had been 132 fatalities as of end-Tuesday. Another death was reported in Sichuan province on Wednesday. 
The situation remained ""grim and complex"", said Chinese President Xi Jinping, who on Tuesday had vowed to defeat the ""devil"" virus. U.S. President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Xi and his administration was working closely with China on containing the outbreak.
Some major airlines suspended flights to China, and a senior economist predicted a major impact on growth.
The WHO's panel of 16 independent experts twice last week declined to declare an international emergency, but will re-evaluate the situation on Thursday.
""We are at an important juncture in this event. We believe these chains of transmission can still be interrupted,"" said Mike Ryan, Executive Director of the WHO's Health Emergencies Programme.
Ryan also praised China's response, saying: ""They are taking extraordinary measures in the face of what is an extraordinary challenge.""
STREETS DESERTED
In many Chinese cities, streets were largely deserted. Tourist attractions were closed, while Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shops required people to have their temperatures taken and to wear masks.
""It's my first time here in Asia, I feel very unlucky,"" said Brazilian tourist Amanda Lee, 23, cutting short a trip. ""I couldn't even see the places I wanted, like the Great Wall.""
Almost all the deaths so far have been in the central province of Hubei, home to about 60 million people and now under virtual lockdown. The virus emerged last month in a live wild animal market in the provincial capital Wuhan.
""I was extremely worried that I was stuck there,"" said Takeo Aoyama, who arrived in Tokyo on a chartered plane carrying 206 Japanese out of Wuhan as some governments began evacuating their citizens.
The United States flew about 210 Americans out of Wuhan, to be screened several times on arrival in California. France said a first flight of French nationals would leave on Wednesday night and Britain said it would put 200 citizens on a charter plane on Thursday. Canada was also organising evacuations.
The virus is weighing heavily on the world's second-biggest economy, with companies cutting corporate travel to China and tourists cancelling trips. Various airlines are cutting flights, from British Airways and Lufthansa to Tanzania's national carrier that postponed maiden flights.
A government economist said the crisis could cut China's first quarter growth by one point to 5% or lower as the crisis hits sectors from mining to luxury goods.
Hong Kong stocks took a beating on the first day of trading after the Lunar New Year break. Casino and financial stocks led the Hang Seng index 2.5% lower to a seven-month trough.
""In our view, the worst is yet to come,"" securities firm Nomura said, warning of a severe, near-term blow to China's economy.
'LESS DEADLY THAN SARS'
But in a potentially major step towards finding a vaccine, scientists in Australia said they had developed a lab-grown version of the virus, the first recreated outside China. 
The researchers at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity said they would share the sample, grown from an infected patient, with the WHO and global laboratories in the hope of hastening immunisation and detection.
The number of cases of the new virus in China now exceeds the 5,327 that were infected with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which also originated in China and killed about 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.
While some experts believe the new strain, known as ""2019-nCoV"", is not as deadly as SARS, alarm has grown over its rapid spread and many unknown attributes.
""There have been more cases in China, but so far with a lower death rate than the SARS outbreak,"" said Michael Head, a health researcher at Britain's University of Southampton.

Like other respiratory infections, the new virus is spread by droplets from coughs and sneezes, with an incubation time between one and 14 days.

KINGSTON/MIAMI (Reuters) - Shaken Caribbean residents and tourists said on Wednesday that life was returning to normal after a powerful earthquake struck the region and rattled nerves but spared the area from serious damage to property or loss of life.
The magnitude 7.7 quake hit Tuesday afternoon in the Caribbean Sea between Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cuba, bursting drains and ripping open sinkholes.
Several aftershocks followed, including a magnitude 6.1 tremor closer to the Cayman Islands, unnerving people for hours afterwards.
""Our nerves are on edge not knowing if we're going to be safe or not,"" said Canadian tourist Andrew Walsh, 43, on a visit to Jamaica's Montego Bay with his family. ""It is still causing us some anxiety.""
In the Cayman Islands, home to about 62,000 people, many schools remained closed but most businesses were open, according to Sandra Hill, editor with Cayman Marl Road, a local news website.
""We are still feeling aftershocks. There are a lot of sinkholes,"" said Hill, 46. But she added that ""generally speaking there is a sense of normalcy today.""
The quake was also felt in Miami where several high-rise buildings were evacuated downtown.
Attorney Jake Greenberg, 33, based on the 24th floor of a Miami skyscraper, said he was not worried about returning to the office. But the tremors triggered memories of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, when he was living near New York City.
""It's not something you forget,"" he said of the attacks. ""Everyone thought (yesterday's earthquake) was nothing, you didn't feel anything, but still there was a moment that made me think of what could've happened.""
In Cuba, the quake was felt in many provinces. The government said there was no damage nor injuries, after thousands of people were evacuated from buildings.
In eastern Cuba, nearest to the quake and where minor tremors are common, residents spent Wednesday morning comparing tales of being spooked by shaking beds, sofas, lamps and balconies before evacuating to the streets.
""Oh yes, we felt it all right and for quite some time,"" said hairdresser Nuris Lopez in Cuba's eastern Granma province.
""The pigs and chickens got really nervous,"" she added, laughing.
Walsh, the Canadian tourist in Jamaica, said he remains alert to more aftershocks or the possibility of a tsunami.
""This (earthquake) definitely has us on standby here,"" he said. ""If there is a tsunami, there are lots of hills."""

Geneva is home to several U.N. arms, including the Human Rights Council, the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the High Commissioner for Refugees, the World Health Organization and the World Trade Organization. Agencies in Vienna include the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Office on Drugs and Crime.
""The attribution of any attack is very uncertain and fuzzy, but this was apparently a well resourced attack,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York. ""The attack resulted in a compromise of core infrastructure components at both (Geneva) and (Vienna), and was determined to be serious.""
""The damage related to this specific attack has been contained, and additional mitigation measures implemented. Nevertheless, the threat of future attacks continues, and the United Nations Secretariat detects and responds to multiple attacks of various level of sophistication often,"" he said.
The U.N. Human Rights Office said in a statement that the servers accessed by the hackers ""did not hold any sensitive data or confidential information.""
""The hackers did manage to access our Active User Directory, which contains the user IDs for our staff and devices. However, they did not succeed in accessing passwords. Nor did they gain access to other parts of the system,"" the statement said.
The United Nations is headquartered in New York, where U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the U.N. Security Council and U.N. General Assembly are based.
A U.N. spokesman said last week that the world body directed officials in June not to use WhatsApp to communicate because ""it's not supported as a secure mechanism."" However, some U.N. staff have said WhatsApp is still regularly used by many.

GOMA (Reuters) - Suspected Islamist militants killed at least 30 people overnight in attacks on villages in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, local officials and civil society leaders said on Wednesday.
Four villages were raided by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group, in the west of Beni territory, which has seen a surge of violence since Oct. 30, when the army launched an large-scale offensive against the rebels.
Local administrator Richard Kivanzanga said 32 people had been killed in the attacks to the west of the city of Oicha.
Among the victims was an Anglican pastor in the village of Eringeti, said Omar Kavota from local rights group CEPADHO.
""The victim had the misfortune to pass them on his way to the field with his wife,"" Kavota said in a statement.
In December, President Felix Tshisekedi said he had sent 22,000 troops to fight the ADF, including special forces, and that they had succeeded in dismantling nearly all of the ADF's bases.
Attacks have eased in January, but in total at least 265 people have been killed since November, according to the Kivu Security Tracker, a research initiative that maps unrest in Congo's restive east, where the ADF has been operating for more than two decades.
Several previous ADF attacks have been claimed by Islamic State, although researchers and analysts say there is a lack of hard evidence linking the two groups.
The United States imposed sanctions on the leader of the ADF and five others in December for perpetrating serious human rights abuses including mass rape, torture and killings.

The United States has imposed a series of sanctions in response to Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Moscow has since built up military infrastructure on the peninsula.
The latest move comes a day before a visit to Ukraine by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
The officials blacklisted on Wednesday include Yuri Gotsanyuk, named prime minister of Crimea's pro-Russian regional government after the 2019 election, and six others, a Treasury statement said.
Treasury said the individuals also were blacklisted by Canada on Wednesday.
The sanctions follow action taken on Tuesday by the European Union, which blacklisted seven of the same people, including Gotsanyuk.
Also blacklisted is Moscow-based railway company Grand Service Express, which operates in the Crimea region, and its Chief Executive Officer Alexander Ganov. 
The U.S. sanctions block assets under its control and prohibit U.S. individuals and businesses from conducting transactions with those targeted.
""Treasury's action, taken in close coordination with our international allies and partners, reiterates our unwavering support for restoring free and fair democratic political processes in Crimea,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Truckloads of medical aid for civilians in Syria's northeast is stuck in Iraq, the United Nations aid chief said on Wednesday, after Russia and China prevented the U.N. Security Council from renewing authorization for the cross-border deliveries.
Earlier this month, the council allowed a six-year-long cross-border aid operation to continue from two places in Turkey, but dropped crossing points from Iraq and Jordan due to opposition by Russia and China. In December the two countries vetoed a bid to extend approval for both the crossing points in Turkey and Iraq.
""Some 400,000 medical items planned for delivery are stuck on trucks in Iraq and unable to cross,"" U.N. aid chief Mark Lowcock told the council on Wednesday.
""The secretary-general (Antonio Guterres) has asked members of this council for their support in getting agreement that these items can be brought in,"" he said. ""As of today, they remain in Iraq.""
Lowcock said that the World Health Organization had warned that the removal of the Iraq crossing point from the cross-border aid operation would lead to ""a reduction in the medical services available and a growing shortfall of medical supplies.""
Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia has dismissed concerns about closing the Iraq border crossing because he said the situation on the ground had changed and humanitarian aid was being delivered to the northeast from within Syria.
""Instead of whipping up passions here, we would recommend that OCHA (Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs) as quickly as possible establish effective cooperation with the legitimate authorities in Damascus,"" he said on Wednesday.
Deputy U.S. Ambassador Cherith Norman Chalet said the closing of the Iraqi border crossing had cut off 40 percent of U.N. medical equipment and supplies to northeastern Syria.
""Russia has denied principled humanitarian aid for those in need throughout Syria for over eight years. Now, with China blindly following its lead, Russia has escalated its campaign to restrict humanitarian access in Syria through a cynical and politicized effort,"" she told the council.
China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun rejected the U.S. accusation as groundless.
""Every country is entitled to vote its own position,"" Zhang said. ""Do you think we're still in a period of colonialism and the whole world has to side with the U.S. and the UK? The time has long gone.""
Lowcock said the United Nations was in talks with all parties, including the Syrian government, ""to ensure reliable and adequate supply lines and humanitarian capacity in the northeast"" and called for the ""crucial"" reopening of a key highway.
""No United Nations convoys containing medical supplies have gone from Damascus to the northeast this month. There were three airlifts in December. There have been none so far in January,"" Lowcock told the council."

Sentenced to seven and a half years in jail on drug offences, Issachar, 26, asked for a presidential pardon after Putin met her mother during a visit to Jerusalem last week.
In Jerusalem, where Putin was attending an event to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, the Russian leader told Issachar's mother that ""everything will be okay"" for her daughter.
Israel had previously condemned the sentence as ""disproportionate"". 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is due to meet Putin on Thursday, welcomed the pardon on Wednesday.
""I thank my friend President Putin for granting a pardon to Naama Issachar and I am looking forward to our meeting tomorrow...,"" he said. 

The two men are due to discuss a new U.S. peace plan to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

RIYADH/CAIRO (Reuters) - Arab powers appear to be prioritizing close ties with the United States that are vital to countering Iran over traditional unswerving support for the Palestinians in their reaction to President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan.
At a White House event on Tuesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump proposed creating a Palestinian state but demilitarized and with borders drawn to meet Israeli security needs, while granting U.S. recognition of Israeli settlements on occupied West Bank land and of Jerusalem as Israel's indivisible capital.
The plan diverges from previous U.S. policy and a 2002 Arab League-endorsed initiative that offered Israel normal relations in return for an independent Palestinian state and full Israeli withdrawal from territory captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
Saudi Arabia's response exemplified the careful balance now required from Gulf Arab monarchies, Egypt and Jordan which rely on U.S. military or financial backing and find themselves aligned with the United States and Israel in confronting Iran.
The Saudi Foreign Ministry expressed appreciation for Trump's efforts and support for direct peace negotiations under U.S. auspices. At the same time, state media reported that King Salman had called the Palestinian president to reassure him of Riyadh's unwavering commitment to the Palestinian cause.
Egypt and Jordan, which already have peace deals with Israel, as well as Bahrain, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) used similar language that swung between hope for re-starting talks and caution against abandoning long-held stances.
Despite Palestinians' rejection of the plan and boycott of Trump over perceived pro-Israel bias, three Gulf Arab states - Oman, Bahrain and the UAE - attended the White House gathering in a sign of changing times.
In a bitterly divided Arab world, backing for Palestinians has long been seen as a unifying position but also often a source of internal recriminations over the extent of that support, especially as some states have made independent, pragmatic overtures to historical adversary Israel.
Trump and Netanyahu praised the UAE, Bahraini and Omani ambassadors for attending the White House announcement: ""What a sign it portends - I was going to say 'of the future' - what a sign it portends of the present,"" Netanyahu said to applause.
Critics were less kind, condemning the envoys' presence as a ""shameful"" abandonment of the Palestinian cause.
""No government or ruler wants to be seen to sell Palestine so cheaply and hand Netanyahu such a victory and, in fact, end up footing the bill,"" said Neil Quilliam, senior research fellow at Britain's Chatham House think-tank.
""At the same time, all states except perhaps Egypt are dependent upon the U.S. and will not risk angering Trump, given his propensity to act like a petulant child.""
A THOUSAND NO'S
Saudi King Salman has previously reassured Arab allies he would not endorse any plan that fails to address Jerusalem's disputed status or Palestinian refugees' right of return, amid perceptions Riyadh's stance was changing under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is close to Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner, the plan's main architect.
Palestinian officials say Prince Mohammed, the de facto Saudi ruler, has pressed Abbas in the past to support the Trump plan despite serious concerns. Saudi officials have denied any differences between the king and crown prince.
Naif Madkhali, a prominent Saudi who tweets often in support of the government, blasted Trump's plan: ""No and a thousand no's,"" he wrote under the hashtag #Down_with_the_deal_of_the_century.
In Bahrain, which hosted a U.S.-led conference last June on the Palestinian economy as part of Trump's broader peace plan, opposition groups came out strongly against the proposal.
""Whoever today gives up the Holy Land of Palestine will tomorrow give up his land in order to preserve his seat,"" tweeted Waad party leader Ibrahim Sharif. ""Treachery is a stab in the back and is not a point of view.""
Any change to the consensus on refugees' right of return to what is now Israel and the Palestinian Territories would reverberate loudest in Jordan, which absorbed more Palestinians than any other country after Israel's creation in 1948.
Palestinians, which by some estimates now account for more than half of Jordan's population, hold full citizenship but are marginalized and seen as a political threat by some people of Jordanian descent.
""The biggest risk is to Jordan, where sentiment towards the issue and rising levels of discontent converge,"" said Quilliam.
Analysts predicted most Egyptians would reject the plan but not present a problem to President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi's government, which has already cracked down harshly on dissent.
""I feel angry and helpless as an Egyptian, an Arab, a Muslim and above all a human..."" prominent blogger Zainab Mohamed wrote of Trump's plan.
The Palestinian Foreign Ministry criticized Arab countries after their generally positive comments on Trump's plan.
""Following the revelation of details of the American-Israeli conspiracy, it is unacceptable to hide behind ambiguous and murky statements in order to escape confronting this conspiracy,"" it said in a statement.
However, a spokesman for Abbas said later he had received calls from Saudi King Salman and Lebanese President Michel Aoun ""supportive of the Palestinian position""."
79,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 12:16PM ET</span>",Special Report: 'Scam PAC' fundraisers reap millions in the name of 'heart-tugging' causes,"By Jarrett Renshaw and Joseph Tanfani
Birmingham, Alabama (Reuters) - From unmarked strip-mall offices in small-town Alabama, the calls go out across the United States, meant to talk people into giving money for heart-tugging causes like helping breast cancer patients or the widows of fallen police officers.
Even as they charmed millions from credulous donors, a dozen former callers for two major fundraisers told Reuters that they knew their companies would be keeping the vast majority of it. And the groups they were raising money for weren’t charities at all, but political action committees, which normally are set up to gather funds for candidates or political causes.
""The motto was, ‘Leave your morals at the door,’” said Alexander Lefler, 21, who worked for nearly a year at a call center southeast of Birmingham, Alabama, describing what he saw as high-pressure and deceptive tactics. “We kind of all understood what we were doing was wrong, but I needed a place to live.”
The call centers in Alabama, along with others in Nevada, New Jersey, and Florida, raise money on behalf of “scam PACs,” slang among critics for political action committees that purport to support worthy causes but in reality hand over little of the money for political – or charitable – purposes. Instead, the bulk of the money is kept by fundraising firms or the people running the PACs.
Through interviews with the former callers and donors, reviews of call scripts and visits to three call centers in Alabama, Reuters has obtained rare access into the world of these for-profit fundraisers, a tiny but lucrative niche of the multi-billion-dollar U.S. telemarketing industry.
These so-called “scam PACs” and their fundraisers exploit the gray zone between U.S. election finance and state charity fundraising laws, regulators told Reuters. They often are set up as super PACs, groups which in recent years have been empowered by the courts to raise and spend money in unlimited amounts, with little regulation.
But “scam PACs” are not like other political action committees. Rather, they and their fundraisers present the PACs as charities, suggesting they support veterans, firefighters or victims of deadly diseases, for instance. 
In fact, “scam PAC” operators and fundraisers are often old hands of the charity world, with a history of run-ins with regulators, state and federal records show. Some fundraisers work in both worlds, raising money for charities and PACs.
When organizations operate as political action committees, however, they are not subject to the laws governing charity fundraising, according to federal and state regulators and telemarketing industry officials. (See related story https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-fundraisers-scampacs on regulation of ""scam PACs"") 
In return for tax-exempt status, charities generally must register with states, disclose their key employees and account for how the money is spent – in some cases by providing audited financial statements.
Not so for “scam PACs.”
“It is a way for them to get around the charity laws – that’s exactly what they’re doing,” said Stuart Discount, chief executive of the Professional Association for Customer Engagement, a trade association for direct marketers.
""Scam PAC” telemarketers who use aggressive tactics in the charity realm also face less risk of scrutiny or sanction when they turn to PAC fundraising, regulators and former callers said. Callers told Reuters they easily made the switch, working in the same buildings, for the same bosses, using similar scripts.
Though “scam PACS” have no standard definition and can’t be definitively counted, a review of Federal Election Commission records suggests they account for a sliver of the some 6,800 PACs in the country. Even so, Reuters identified a loose network of fundraising companies and PACs that quickly grew into a money-making force, with some ranking near the top fundraisers in the period stretching from January 2017 through mid-2019.
Starting with a group of eight fundraising operations that earned at least a half-million dollars each during this period, Reuters traced interconnections among them and 31 PACs. Generally, those in the informal network portrayed themselves as charitable, gave little to the causes they promoted and relied principally on small donors. Most were super PACs, but several were traditional political action committees, which have contribution limits.
All told, the PACs took in $83.1 million during the 2 ½ year period examined by Reuters, about 82% of which went to the eight fundraising companies, according to the campaign disclosures required by the FEC.
The PACs examined for this article typically handed over less than 10% of their take – sometimes less than 1% – to candidates or causes, Reuters found. Aside from the lion’s share that went to for-profit fundraisers, many of the PAC operators took a slice for salaries and overhead.
Two of the fundraising companies identified by Reuters employed jail inmates and ex-cons as telemarketers, according to interviews in Alabama with several former employees, as well as court records.
Reuters interviewed a dozen donors to PACs in the informal network. All said they thought they were giving to a charity. Alex Angelides, a 31-year-old engineer from Arlington, Virginia, donated $600 to a super PAC called For a Better America, which spent 90% of its money on fundraising alone.
It’s infuriating,” said Angelides, who learned from Reuters that it was a PAC that got his money. “It would’ve been nice to know that my money was going to a PAC, not a charity, and that it wasn’t going to actually help police and firefighters directly.”
“There should be more transparency on this to protect consumers,” he said.
The committee’s treasurer, attorney Chris Marston, told Reuters the purpose of the PAC was to raise money “ in support of candidates who would help police and firefighters.” 
“I’m sure the (call) scripts didn’t misrepresent anything,” Marston said. “I can’t speak to people’s understanding or what the scripts said.”
Few other top officers at these fundraising firms and PACS would speak to Reuters on the record. Those who responded denied their marketing was deceptive and defended their business model and compensation.
“I don’t think you understand how hard it is to fundraise,” said Forrest Sandusky Baker IV, a telemarketing professional. Baker said he founded Salt Lake City fundraising firm American Public Resource because he hoped to support worthy goals like helping veterans. The firm was paid nearly $3 million from 2017 through mid-2019 for its work raising money for PACS that spent anywhere from 0% to 7% on their promoted causes.
Baker said his employees never try to dupe donors and that he can’t control what his clients, the PACs, do with the money he raises.
“My job is to deliver a message, and try as best as I can to make sure I’m not working for a scumbag,” he said.
Richard Zeitlin, the biggest fundraiser in the loose network identified by Reuters, told a reporter in a brief interview that he had closed down all of his call centers, saying “I wanted a change in direction.” Asked about ex-employees’ claims of deception in his companies’ PAC fundraising practices, he declined to discuss specifics.
“How do I know you are telling the truth or the people who talked to you are telling the truth?” he said.
Last summer, after coming under fire from state and government regulators for alleged deception in fundraising for charities, he defended his reputation on a website called richardzeitlintruth.com.
While acknowledging that every industry has its “bad apples, he wrote: “To this day it strikes me as odd that an industry that has over the years hired hundreds of thousands of people (perhaps millions), many of whom had trouble holding down more traditional day jobs, would become such a punching bag for the government and the media.”
ANONYMOUS OFFICES, UNCLEAR OWNERSHIP
In a small Alabama town at the edge of the Talladega National Forest, next to a Chinese restaurant, stands a shop with mirrored windows and no signs.
The call center in Sylacauga, visited by Reuters last year, was operated by Las Vegas-based TPFE Inc, a firm controlled by Zeitlin. Like many such telemarketing centers tucked away in strip malls or office parks, it offered no clues to what went on inside.
Federal campaign records tell part of the story. In the 2 ½ year period examined by Reuters, records show, TPFE and three other Zeitlin firms earned more than $27.6 million for PAC fundraising.
For instance, the operation raised $16.8 million for PACs founded by Robert Piaro of Fredonia, Wisconsin, which purported to support police, veterans and people with breast cancer. About 82% of the money, $13.8 million, went to Zeitlin’s firms, while Piaro collected $190,613 in salary from the PACs, according to the records.
One Piaro committee, Americans for the Cure of Breast Cancer, garnered $1.6 million in donations through Zeitlin’s fundraising operations and made one charitable contribution, $10,000 to the Susan G. Komen Foundation – less than 1% of the total raised, campaign filings show.
JoAnn Coleman, 63, a construction engineer from Gaithersburg, Maryland, said she was particularly vulnerable to a pitch for the breast cancer PAC.
“I had breast cancer, so they knew how to get me,” she said. When she later realized it was a PAC telemarketer, she felt exploited. “What a racket, oh my God.” 
Piaro declined to comment.
On his website, Zeitlin said his firms’ revenue – which he described as 80% to 90% of the proceeds – “may seem high” but actually is standard for the industry and is needed to offset high costs for technology and “intensive time-consuming labor.”
As a fundraiser for charities, Zeitlin ran into trouble with regulators.
In 2018, the Federal Trade Commission sued Zeitlin for allegedly deceptive practices in charity fundraising, but the case has been suspended because a grand jury was investigating, according to court documents. The FTC declined to comment.
Zeitlin told Reuters he was not the target of the grand jury investigation. He said only that it was based in Florida; Reuters could not determine the specific jurisdiction.
Neither Zeitlin nor his attorney would comment on the FTC lawsuit. Zeitlin, whose operations also have been examined by the Center for Public Integrity and other media outlets, said on his website that he’s “never been accused, indicted, tried or convicted of anything.”
Some political fundraising operations change locations frequently, operate under different names or dissolve and resurface under another name, making it difficult to trace their ownership, activities and connections to one another.
Reuters also could not ascertain the ownership of another large fundraising operation with a call center in Hoover, Alabama, some 45 miles from Zeitlin’s center in Sylacauga. Reporters visited the center last summer, though it has since closed.
Going by various names, the fundraising operation has worked for some of the same PACs as Zeitlin’s firms have and has employed some of the same people, according to internal PAC records, state corporate filings, employee interviews and deposition testimony in a civil case unrelated to this article. It also has roots in charity fundraising.
The fundraising operation used corporate names including Charity Promotions, from 2013 to 2016, and Charity Appeal, from 2016 to 2018, according to several ex-employee interviews and state filings. The fundraisers later went to work for PACs under the names Politicause and Pledge Assistance, both registered in Wyoming, which requires little disclosure from corporations.
Together Politicause and Pledge Assistance earned close to $20 million between January 2017 through mid-2019 raising money for PACS, campaign finance records show. Those two fundraising firms, whose ownership is not clear, dissolved – Pledge Assistance in July 2018 and Politicause in June 2019, according to Wyoming records.
Interviews and records indicate managers at both firms once worked at a Zeitlin company called Courtesy Call. None of the three managers Reuters was able to identify could be reached for comment.
At the time Reuters visited, the firm’s Hoover call center was jammed with desks and callers on headsets. The otherwise bland office was decorated with posters from the film “Glengarry Glen Ross,” a tale of ruthless telemarketer salesmen set in a real-estate boiler room. “Always Be Closing,” one poster read. “Coffee is for Closers Only,” read another.
LOOKING FOR 'NATURALS' 
In interviews, a dozen former employees of Politicause and Zeitlin’s TPFE described techniques they used to wrangle donations, leaving contributors with the impression they were giving to good causes.
“You are not lying, but you are being extremely misleading,” said Jason Jones, 24, a former employee at Politicause.
Training was minimal, pressure relentless and turnover high, the workers said. If new workers weren’t making sales, they were quickly fired. “It’s a sink or swim environment. They are looking for naturals,” said Jones, adding that good performers could take home $1,000 to $1,500 a week.
Former callers at both TPFE and Politicause said they were given scripts and FAQs that required them to mention that the groups were political action committees but were told by managers to glide past the disclosures about who was calling and how the money would be used.
“They said to pitch it like it was a charity but as quietly and quickly as you can, slip in that it was a PAC,” said Lefler, who worked at TPFE until March.
The callers said they’d already honed their charity pitches and so found it easy to repurpose them for the political committees, appealing to patriotism and what one called “pulling heartstrings.”
One FAQ, given to callers at Politicause and reviewed by Reuters, shaped the fundraising pitch for a super PAC called the American Coalition for Injured Veterans. It “is an organization who (sic) advocates for those who deserve it the most and are often left behind: American Veterans, especially who are homeless and disabled,” the FAQ read.
If the potential donors suspected they had given to the group before, the callers were instructed to say: “I have no way of knowing because we feel that donations are given from the heart, not the hand, so we keep all donation records confidential,” according to the FAQ.
The PAC, organized by Zachary Bass, spent 90% of its take on fundraising, campaign filings show. It spent $103,700 on behalf of House candidates – about 3% of the total, and it has contributed nothing directly to veterans groups.
Bass, who set up several other super PACs, declined to comment.
Across the industry, calls are computer-generated before being routed to telemarketers, something Politicause and TPFE employees said allowed their firms to maximize the number of calls – and to pester people repeatedly.
“They called 4 times in one day. We have told them many times to stop calling us,” one person contacted by Politicause complained to the FTC in April 2019, noting that the household was on a Do Not Call list.
Federal Do Not Call rules do not apply to political or nonprofit fundraising. Reuters obtained FTC complaint records, with names redacted, through a Freedom of Information Act request. The FTC’s response to complaints is not noted in the records.
Pitches at Politicause and TPFE were adapted to avoid allegations of fraud, former callers said, noting that the conversations were occasionally monitored by company compliance officers. At Politicause, for instance, some said they initially were told to say donations would be used to “help” buy new police and fire equipment. But because that suggested donors were contributing directly to purchasing new gear, the callers said they were told by managers to adjust their language.
“We could no longer say, ‘We are helping police officers get body armor,’ but we could say, ‘We are supporting efforts to get them body armor,’” said Jackie Armstrong, 32, a former Politicause employee.
When asked by potential donors how much of the money would go to the cause they were touting, telemarketers said they suggested it was the vast majority.
“‘We are proud to say it’s a 90-10 split,’” Jones recalled saying, leaving out that his company was getting the 90% share. “’We wish it was 100, but we have to keep the lights on.’”
The workers said Politicause managers eventually reined in that practice, requiring them to instead say that at least 10% went to the cause. Callers said they did so quickly and proudly, hoping people wouldn’t catch on.
At TPFE, callers said they told potential donors all proceeds went to “defraying the cost of the appeal [for funds] and to accomplish the mission,” said former employee Jake Adair, 28.
“Just enough to get them to stop asking,” he added.
FROM JAIL TO BOILER ROOM
James Dellinger, 34, said he and other callers got in the door with a remarkable qualification – they were in jail.
While in the Shelby County Jail on a felony charge of stealing a truck, Dellinger said he began working at a center in suburban Birmingham then known as Charity Promotions as part of his government-sponsored work release program. The company later was renamed Politicause.
These workers were a convenient labor pool – and skilled at getting people to open their wallets, former callers said. 
“We were good at slick-talking these people,” said Dellinger, who court records show has been convicted of felonies including the truck theft and other burglary charges.
Some of the workers for TPFE also had felony convictions, according to several former callers and court records. The Sylacauga call center employed work release inmates, an arrangement that apparently ended before 2018, the former callers said.
“What is wrong with giving somebody a second chance?” Zeitlin responded when Reuters asked about his hiring practices.
Both Politicause and TPFE had procedures to keep workers with fraud convictions from handling credit card information, former callers said, although Politicause workers said the rules were sometimes relaxed for high performers.
Zeitlin did not respond to questions about this issue.
Drug abuse was a problem at both call centers, ex-employees said. They said it was not uncommon to find needles in the bathroom or a caller passed out at his desk.
Jessica Blanchard, 23, who worked at Politicause in 2018, said many callers either were addicts from halfway houses or jail inmates on work release.
Former Politicause employee Armstrong said he was fired in 2018, when the call center did charity fundraising, for having drugs at work. A week later, Armstrong said, he was rehired to help raise money for political action committees.

“It’s the only thing in life I’ve ever been (expletive) good at,” said Armstrong, who records show has theft and drug convictions. “Most of the guys that are real good are felons.”

80,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 12:13PM ET</span>","Abu Dis, an unlikely capital for a future Palestinian state","By Stephen Farrell and Rami Ayyub
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Abu Dis, the town earmarked for the Palestinian capital in U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan, lies a short distance to the east of Jerusalem's walled Old City.
A relatively featureless urban sprawl on the old road to Jericho, it has little of the religious or cultural resonance of the historic city center, which contains sites sacred to the three great monotheistic faiths: Judaism, Christianity and Islam.
Abu Dis belongs to the Palestinian governorate of Jerusalem but is just outside the Israeli municipal city limits set by Israel after it captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967, later annexing it in a move not recognized by most of the international community.
What the neighborhood does have is a large shuttered building that was constructed in an earlier, more hopeful era to be a site for the parliament of the Palestinian Authority.
That hall now lies abandoned and disused after the breakdown of the Oslo peace process and the outbreak of the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, two decades ago.
Since then, Palestinians in Abu Dis have been cut off from Jerusalem neighborhoods to the west by a high concrete wall that Israel built to stop suicide bombers and gunmen entering the city.
Students at a nearby university have used the wall as a backdrop to project movies during warm summer nights when they sit outside.
The White House document accompanying the U.S. plan's release said the barrier should ""serve as a border between the capitals of the two parties.""
It said Jerusalem should ""remain the sovereign capital of the State of Israel, and it should remain an undivided city.""
It continued: ""The sovereign capital of the State of Palestine should be in the section of East Jerusalem located in all areas east and north of the existing security barrier, including Kafr Aqab, the eastern part of Shuafat and Abu Dis, and could be named Al Quds or another name as determined by the State of Palestine.""
GRAPHIC: Trump's Middle East peace plan - https://graphics.reuters.com/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PLAN/0100B5B73B0/ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-PLAN.jpg
HOLY SITES
That would leave within Israel's control the hill at the heart of the Old City known to Jews as Har ha-Bayit, or Temple Mount, and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary.
The holiest place in Judaism, it was home to the Jewish temples of antiquity and its restraining wall built by Herod the Great - known as the Western Wall - is a sacred place of prayer for Jews.
Atop the plateau are two imposing Muslim holy places, the Dome of the Rock and the Al-Aqsa Mosque, which was built in the 8th century. Muslims regard the site as the third holiest in Islam, after Mecca and Medina.
It is this compound that Palestinians seek as part of the capital of a future state and to which Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas was referring when he said it was ""impossible for any Palestinian, Arab, Muslim or Christian child to accept"" a state without Jerusalem.
The day after the Trump plan identified Abu Dis as a potential capital, residents were scornful of the notion.
Mohammed Faroun, an Abu Dis resident, said: ""The capital of Palestine is Jerusalem.""
Another resident, who declined to give his name, said: ""Trump, or whoever else, are not welcome. Jerusalem tells its own story, every stone tells about its history. It was never Israeli or American, it is Palestinian, Islamic and Arab."""
81,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 12:06PM ET</span>",France's Macron accuses Turkey's Erdogan of breaking Libya promises,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron accused Turkey's president on Wednesday of breaking promises made at a conference on Libya after Turkish warships and Syrian fighters arrived in the north African country.
""I want to express my concerns with regard to the behavior of Turkey at the moment, which is in complete contradiction with what President Tayyip Erdogan committed to at the Berlin conference,"" Macron told a joint news conference with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.
Macron's comments came a week after the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Russia - which all back eastern Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar - and Turkey - which backs the government in Tripoli - agreed with Western powers in Berlin to push for a lasting ceasefire and uphold an arms embargo.
However, since then there has been an uptick in fighting with Haftar's Libyan National Army attempting to open a new front by moving forces towards the city of Misrata in the west of the country.
Pictures unverified by Reuters on social media appeared to show Turkish warships off the coast of Libya on Wednesday.
Macron confirmed the presence of Turkish ships and accused Ankara of violating Libya's sovereignty and endangering European and West African security. 
""We have seen during these last days Turkish warships accompanied by Syrian mercenaries arrive on Libyan soil. This is an explicit and serious infringement of what was agreed in Berlin. It's a broken promise."" 
Without naming them, the United Nations on Jan. 25 said several countries backing rival factions in Libya had violated the arms embargo since Berlin.
It said cargo planes full of advanced weapons, armored vehicles, advisers and fighters had arrived at eastern and western Libyan airports, something that risked ""plunging the country into a renewed and intensified round of fighting"".
Macron made no mention of violations from any other countries except NATO ally Turkey.
Paris has been accused of supporting Haftar politically having previously provided him with military assistance to fight Islamist militants. France denies backing Haftar. 

Libya has had no stable central authority since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011. It has had two rival governments, in the east and the west, for more than five years.

(Reuters) - Dylann Roof, the white supremacist who killed nine black people at a South Carolina church in 2015, has appealed his conviction and death sentence, with lawyers arguing he was too mentally ill to stand trial or represent himself at sentencing.
""Roof's crime was tragic, but this Court can have no confidence in the jury's verdict,"" says his appeal, filed with the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday. 
A jury found Roof guilty of 33 federal charges, including hate crimes resulting in death, for the shocking mass shooting at the landmark Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston in June 2015.
Roof dismissed his defense attorneys just before trial and represented himself during jury selection. At the last minute he reinstated his lawyers for the guilt phase but represented himself again for the penalty phase.
The same jury that found him guilty also gave him the death penalty in January 2017 after deliberating for less than three hours.
Federal public defenders representing Roof said in a 321-page brief that when Roof represented himself he was a ""22-year-old, ninth-grade dropout diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder, autism, anxiety, and depression, who believed his sentence didn't matter because white nationalists would free him from prison after an impending race war."" 
Roof had been cooperating with his trial lawyers for 16 months, but suddenly objected when he learned they planned to present him as ""developmentally disabled or mentally ill.""
In a competency hearing, five experts testified that he showed a wide range of mental health symptoms, but when Roof addressed the hearing he told the judge he instructed his lawyers to stop suggesting he had any mental problems, the brief said.
U.S. District Judge Richard Gergel nonetheless found him competent, saying he was ""cogent and articulate"" when he addressed the court and ""this defendant has an extremely high IQ.""
In allowing him to represent himself, Gergel said, ""I continue to believe it is strategically unwise, but it is a decision you have the right to make.""
The U.S. Supreme Court affirmed a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to act as his own lawyer in the 1975 decision Faretta v. California.
But Roof's lawyers say that decision and subsequent ones set limits on self-representation.
The 2008 decision Indiana v. Edwards allows judges to force a lawyer on defendants who lack mental capacity, they said.
""The choice is not all or nothing,"" the lawyers said, citing the 2018 ruling in McCoy v. Louisiana.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's justice minister condemned parliament's sole far-right lawmaker on Wednesday for a social media post in which he called for a black fellow MP with dual Portuguese-Guinean citizenship to be ""returned to her own country"".
Portugal's Angolan-born Justice Minister Francisca Van Dunem said in a speech that lawmaker Andre Ventura's comments were ""an example of the xenophobic discourse which has begun to invade our institutional spaces and now arrived in parliament.""
Ventura, the head of small populist party Chega (Enough) who was elected for the first time in October, posted the statement on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Tuesday in response to a policy proposal by Joacine Katar Moreira from the eco-Socialist party Livre.
She had proposed that items in Portuguese museums obtained from former colonies should be returned to their countries of origin.
""I propose that the lawmaker herself be returned to her own country. ... It would be calmer for everyone, including her own party, and especially Portugal!"" wrote Ventura.
Moreira is one of three black members of parliament, and has presented various policy proposals on tackling racism and colonial legacies in Portugal.
Moreira's Livre decried Ventura's statement as ""deplorable and racist"", while the ruling Socialists said the party deemed his actions ""inadmissible"" and was considering a vote of condemnation in parliament.
An unrepentant Ventura told TSF radio: ""She is constantly attacking our history and defending foreign interests. If she acts like that she may as well leave."" Still, he said his comment was ""obviously ironic"" as he was not referring to physical deportation.
Chega was not immediately available for comment.
At a time when far-right populist movements are on the rise in most of Europe, their peers in Portugal still enjoy relatively weak support because of the country's attachment to a young democracy that began in 1974 after four decades of Antonio Salazar's fascist dictatorship.
Ventura was elected with just 1.3% of the vote for his party, but rights groups have voiced concerns that his populist rhetoric often broadcast from parliament is whipping up anti-foreigner and homophobic sentiments and nostalgia for Salazar."

""I'm not sleeping at night thinking about the threats that this man has leveled at me on Facebook,"" said Meloni, whose popularity has risen sharply over the past year, making her one of the most recognizable faces in Italian politics.
Raffaele Nugnes was arrested in southern Italy last year after Meloni's sister denounced him to the police over his Facebook posts, where he published a photo of Meloni with her baby daughter and said the girl was his.
""Giorgia Meloni, I would like to see my daughter Ginevra please,"" he wrote on one occasion. ""You have three days to go you-know-where. If you don't come, you know what will happen, I will come to Garbatella,"" he said, referring to the Rome neighborhood where Meloni lives.
He repeated his assertion in court on Wednesday and the judge ordered that he undergo a psychiatric assessment.
Meloni said she had never met the man.
""I am often away from home and I have grown increasingly anxious and have had to take special precautious. Just having a baby sitter is no longer enough,"" she said.
Politicians of all colors expressed their solidarity with Meloni. Her party is allied with Matteo Salvini's anti-immigration League and is now the fourth largest group in Italy, according to latest opinion polls, with support climbing into double digits in recent months."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi movement said on Wednesday it had fired rocket and drone strikes at Saudi targets including Aramco oil facilities, the group's first claim of such attacks since it offered to halt them four months ago.
Few details were given of the precise nature and timing of the attacks, and there was no immediate confirmation from the Saudi authorities of any strikes.
In comments reported by Houthi-run Al Masirah TV, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saria said more than 15 ""operations"" had been carried out in the past week inside Saudi Arabia in retaliation for an escalation in air strikes.
 Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) facilities in Jizan on the Red Sea were targeted, along with other targets near the border with Yemen, including Abha and Jizan airports and Khamis Mushait military base, ""with a large number of rockets and drones"", he said in a separate statement.
State oil giant Aramco declined to comment on the report.
The Houthis have been battling a Saudi-led military coalition for nearly five years. If confirmed, the attacks would be the first by the Houthis on Saudi Arabia since late September, when the group said it would halt missile and drone attacks if the coalition ended air strikes on Yemen.
Oil prices were higher after the reports. Brent futures were up 70 cents, or 1.18%, at $60.21 a barrel at 1348 GMT and U.S. WTI was up 47 cents, or 0.88%, at $53.95 a barrel.
The Houthis had made their offer to halt strikes on Saudi targets last year after claiming responsibility for a Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil facilities that initially halved the kingdom's output. Riyadh rejected the Houthi claim of responsibility for that attack and blamed Iran, which denied it. 
After a lull in hostilities in recent months on many fronts, violence has escalated at a frontline east of Yemen's Houthi-held capital Sanaa, since a Jan. 19 missile attack on a government military camp which killed more than 100 people. 
United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths in the past week condemned the uptick in troop movements, air strikes, and missile and drone attacks, saying they jeopardise progress being made on de-escalation and confidence building. 
Yemen has been mired in almost five years of conflict since the Houthi movement ousted the government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from the capital in late 2014. The Saudi-led military coalition intervened in 2015 in a bid to restore him.
The United Nations has been trying to re-launch political negotiations to end the war and, separately, Riyadh has been holding informal talks with the Houthis since late September about de-escalation.

86,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 11:16AM ET</span>",Explainer: Inside the plans for Trump's expanded travel ban,"By Ted Hesson
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he plans to expand his travel ban to bar people from several additional countries, a move that could again reignite questions about whether the policy discriminates against Muslims.
Trump said during a visit to Davos, Switzerland, last week that his administration planned to add ""a couple of countries"" to the ban, but did not give further details.
According to a source familiar with a draft version, the tentative list of nations included Belarus, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania.
WHY IS TRUMP ISSUING A NEW BAN NOW?
Trump is seeking re-election in November and has made immigration restrictions a central focus of his 2020 campaign.
The revised ban could appeal to Republican voters and Trump's stance will contrast with the current crop of Democratic candidates. A 2017 survey by Politico-Morning Consult found that 83 percent of Republican voters backed the policy.
The announcement of the ban's expansion is expected to come as soon as this week, according to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official who requested anonymity to discuss the process. The timing is close to the third anniversary of its original release, which occurred within days of Trump's January 2017 inauguration.
The travel ban went through three iterations, all which were challenged in federal court. The current version — issued as a presidential proclamation in September 2017 — requires the DHS to review the visa restrictions every 180 days and permits the addition or removal of countries. The ban was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2018 and includes a periodic review of whether countries should be added or taken off the list.
WHY INCLUDE THESE SEVEN COUNTRIES?
The Trump administration has not publicly announced the countries under consideration for the expanded travel ban, nor given reasoning for targeting specific nations. But Reuters confirmed that the administration has weighed visa restrictions against Belarus, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Nigeria, Sudan and Tanzania, a list first reported by Politico.
The country list could change before Trump issues the new ban, the DHS official said. The U.S. State Department declined to comment, while the DHS and the White House did not respond to requests for comment.
Margaret Huang, executive director of Amnesty International USA, suggested during a call with reporters on Tuesday that barring countries such as Myanmar and Eritrea, where the organization has documented human rights violations, could make it more difficult for migrants seeking safety in the United States.
Several of the countries on the possible target list, such as Nigeria and Tanzania, have strong economic and security-related ties to the United States.
In 2017, Trump reportedly complained that Nigerian immigrants coming to the United States would never ""go back to their huts"" in Africa, according to a New York Times report that year. The White House denied at the time that Trump referenced ""huts"" in the discussion.
Nigeria received no warning from Washington that it could be subjected to the new ban, a Nigerian government minister said on Monday.
HOW DID THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION EVALUATE COUNTRIES?
As directed by the current ban, the DHS completed a worldwide review of countries last year that evaluated whether the entry of their nationals into the United States could cause a public safety threat, according to the DHS official and a second department official.
The review examined each country's ability to verify the identity of its own nationals, information sharing practices with the United States, and possible terror or public safety risks, the officials said.
State Department officials then attempted to work with the countries to remedy outstanding issues, a step that removed some countries from consideration, according to the officials.
Ultimately, Trump will decide the countries that will be subjected to the visa restrictions, the officials said.
WHO WILL BE BANNED?
The updated travel ban will be tailored and not outright bar all travelers from the countries, according to the two DHS officials.
Instead, the countries will be subjected to a range of visa restrictions with a focus on immigrant visas, according to one of the officials. Such visas - unlike a visitor visa - can lead to permanent residency.
Since it's implementation in December 2017, at least 79,769 visa applications have been subject to the ban, according to date from the State Department. Of those, 6,333 qualified for exceptions and another 17,798 were granted waivers, but a federal lawsuit claims the waiver process is opaque and difficult to navigate.
IS THE TRAVEL BAN DISCRIMINATORY?
During Trump's presidential campaign in 2015, he called for ""a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.""
After he issued the first version of his travel ban, critics derided the order — which targeted travelers and immigrants from seven Muslim-majority nations — as a ""Muslim ban.""
Three of the nations under consideration for the updated ban — Kyrgyzstan, Nigeria and Sudan — have majority Muslim populations. Eritrea and Tanzania have sizable Muslim minorities.
The list of countries currently subject to visa restrictions include five Muslim-majority nations — Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. North Korea and Venezuela also faced visa restrictions, but those measures affect relatively few travelers. Litigation over the ban is continuing."

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's gay community is facing increased government ""attacks"" and fears that its hard-won rights, and an improvement in public acceptance of them, may be at risk, a rights group said.
The European Union has long criticized Prime Minister Viktor Orban's right-wing government over its record on the rule of law and civil liberties, including its attitude toward minorities such as homosexuals.
The Hatter (""Background"") group said various legislative moves, a lack of police vigilance and sometimes hostile rhetoric from the ruling Fidesz party threatened to undo the progress seen since the fall of communism three decades ago.
""By the end of 2019, our worst fears had become reality when Hungarian state actors led by the governing parties started increasingly concentrated attacks against the LGBTQI community,"" it said.
The acronym denotes lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transgender, questioning (or queer) and intersex.
""We fear that this... might become the modus operandi of the government. Ultimately, this will shift Hungarian public opinion that has otherwise shown signs of growing support for LGBTQI causes in recent years.""
Hatter cited several recent homophobic attacks which it said the police had failed to investigate with proper vigor.
Asked about the complaints, a government spokesman said the constitution and other laws guaranteed the same freedoms for all Hungarian citizens.
Hungary does not allow gay marriage but gay couples can acquire a legal status short of marriage. Individual gay people can adopt children but gay couples can't.
LOOPHOLES
Orban has spoken of closing ""loopholes"" in adoption law where it applies to gays but has not proposed new legislation. He has also not called into question the legitimacy of gay pride marches, unlike the leader of Poland's ruling party, Jaroslaw Kaczynski.
However, Orban has defended the traditional family model. In 2018, his government promoted the legal recognition of the traditional heterosexual family model, even though the constitution already defines marriage and family as one man, one woman and their children.
Last year parliament speaker Laszlo Kover, a prominent Fidesz member, outraged rights groups by equating gay adoption with child sex abuse.
""In a moral sense there is no difference between pedophiles and those who demand (gay adoption),"" Kover told a public forum, according to the news portal index.hu. ""Both objectify the child as a consumer good, and consider it a means of self-fulfillment.""
Orban's chief of staff, Gergely Gulyas, endorsed Kover's remarks at the time.
""Such adoptions put the child's interests below those of the adopters who cannot have children on their own. That is factually correct."""
88,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 29, 2020 10:38AM ET</span>","In bid to reinvigorate independence drive, Spain's Catalonia gets set for snap regional election","BARCELONA (Reuters) - The pro-independence head of the Catalonian government said on Wednesday he planned to call a snap regional election in a move that could have a major impact on Spain's national politics.
Quim Torra cited distrust in his coalition partner in the regional government and said he wanted to regain unity among separatist parties to move toward winning independence for the wealthy northeastern region.
""The political course of this legislature has come to an end...It's essential to again give voice to the citizens,"" he said in an address at his government palace.
He gave no precise date but said it would be called after the Catalan parliament had approved the region's budget plan for the year. Taking into account normal parliamentary and electoral procedures, the election could be held in late May at the earliest.
Torra's term was due to end in 2021 but his future has been uncertain since a court sentenced him in December to an 18-month ban from public office for refusing to remove symbols supporting jailed Catalan activists from government buildings.
He has appealed and the ban will not take effect until being upheld by a higher court.
But as a consequence of the ruling, the Catalan parliament on Monday stripped Torra of his rights as a lawmaker, opening a rift with Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), his fellow separatist coalition partner.
""No government can function without unity, a common strategy...and loyalty among its partners,"" Torra said, addressing the internal squabbles.
ERC said it respected Torra's decision and played down the rift.
""Our adversary is no other than the (Spanish) state and its repression that punishes the overall independence movement,"" it said in a statement.
ERC, which last year was the most popular party in Catalonia in local and national elections, could benefit from the ballot.
NATIONAL IMPACT
Catalonia has been a major driver of Spanish politics since the region unilaterally declared independence in October 2017 following a referendum deemed illegal by courts, prompting Spain's biggest political crisis in decades.
Madrid briefly imposed direct rule there before calling an election that resulted in a pro-independence regional coalition government headed by Torra.
Torra is due to meet Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez in Barcelona on Feb. 6 to set the agenda for negotiations over the region's political situation.
He said he wanted to explore at the meeting the central government's ""real will"" for a negotiation.
The dialogue was a condition for ERC to facilitate Sanchez's appointment as prime minister earlier this month, while Torra's Junts per Catalunya party voted against the Socialist leader."

LONDON (Reuters) - Days before it leaves the European Union, Britain put itself at odds with European allies on Wednesday in warmly welcoming U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan while France and the wider EU warned that it must respect international law.
The plan envisages a Palestinian state but demilitarized and with borders drawn to meet Israel's security needs. It accords U.S. recognition of Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank that most of the world regards as illegal.
The French Foreign Ministry welcomed the fact the Trump administration was putting forward ideas to resolve the conflict and said it would study the 181-page plan closely, but added that any agreement must ""conform with international law"".
That line was reiterated by the European Commission, which said the proposals needed to respect ""all relevant U.N. resolutions and internationally agreed parameters"".
But Britain, which has played a key role in the Middle East since World War One, offered no words of caution, instead welcoming the plan as a ""serious proposal"" and encouraging both sides to give it ""genuine and fair consideration"".
The gap could signal a split on a critical area of foreign policy just before Britain formally leaves the EU on Friday.
The French reference to international law is important given that Israeli government officials have interpreted Trump's plan as giving them a green light to move quickly in applying Israeli sovereignty over nearly a third of the West Bank by formally annexing the territory to Israel.
Israeli Defence Minister Naftali Bennett wants to advance the issue immediately, with a fellow minister calling for a vote in the Israeli parliament in the coming days, despite the government only having a caretaker status.
Israel has occupied the West Bank since the 1967 Middle East war and built up a network of Jewish settlements across the territory, where more than 500,000 of its citizens now live, amidst around 3 million Palestinians.
The settlements are widely regarded as contravening international law, a position Israel disputes. Annexing the territory would be a clear breach of international law, analysts say, and violate the United Nations founding charter.
POST-BREXIT SHIFT?
""The European Union has been clear that it cannot support a U.S. plan that runs counter to internationally agreed parameters, international law, and past U.N. Security Council resolutions,"" said Hugh Lovatt, a Middle East specialist at the European Council on Foreign Relations.
""The U.S. plan is at odds with all these things.""
At a time when the International Criminal Court has already opened an investigation into alleged war crimes in the Palestinian territories, Israel could face sharp and wide condemnation if it acts to annex territory.
""The EU and its member states must warn that such action will have grave consequences,"" said Lovatt, suggesting that the bloc might decide to give more serious backing to the ICC investigation if Israel formally seizes parts of the West Bank.
The problem for EU member states is that they have limited leverage over Israel, despite the historical role France and Britain have played in the region.
If the EU were to decide to impose sanctions or other measures against Israel over annexation, it would require unanimous approval of all 27 member states after Britain's departure. Similar steps have failed in the past as Hungary and other smaller member states have sided with Israel.
Britain, too, is reluctant to set itself at odds with Israel as it looks for trade deals after Brexit, including closer ties with Israel's leading high-tech and defense industries.
Moreover, some analysts see Britain shifting closer to U.S. foreign policy positions after Brexit, in part to help smooth the way for a major free trade deal with the United States."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Wednesday that President Vladimir Putin had no view on a proposal that would see his job description change to Supreme Ruler from head of state after a government commission said it was considering the idea.
The title change is one of an array of possible alterations to the Russian constitution put forward by members of a government commission set up after Putin earlier this month said he wanted to change the Russian basic law.
Putin, 67, proposed his own constitutional changes, which were widely seen as giving him scope to retain influence once his current presidential term expires in 2024, though he has said he does not favor the Soviet-era practice of having leaders for life who die in office.
The overhaul, which triggered a change in government, also cemented Putin's control of the transition process and was seen by some as an attempt to reduce intra-clan infighting between now and 2024, while allowing Putin to show he is responding to public discontent after years of belt-tightening.
The State Duma, the Russian lower house of parliament, has already given its backing to his reforms in a preliminary vote. The government commission is considering further possible changes.
""There are... some very curious proposals among those put forward. For instance, they proposed renaming the position of head of state to 'Supreme leader',"" Pavel Krasheninnikov, the government commission's co-chair, told the Rossiiskaya Gazeta government newspaper.
When asked about the idea on Wednesday, the Kremlin was non-committal, calling it a ""new initiative"" and one of various proposals that may or may not be implemented.
""Right now all this is at the discussion stage,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""President Putin has no view on this.""
Other proposals include formally recognizing Russia's status as a ""victorious power"" in World War Two and recognizing Orthodox Christianity as the country's main religion, the Kommersant newspaper reported.
""Naturally some (of the proposals) will be eliminated, some will be accepted and from this the commission's sought-after result will appear,"" Peskov told reporters.
Russia's TASS news agency said Vladimir Zhironovsky, leader of the nationalist pro-Kremlin LDPR party, had suggested the president be known as the Supreme Leader many times in order to move away from job titles derived from foreign languages."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A leading government hawk called on Wednesday for Israel to establish sovereignty over nearly a third of the occupied West Bank, hours after U.S. Donald Trump announced a Middle East peace plan that Palestinians said amounted to apartheid.
The remarks by Naftali Bennett, a coalition partner in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government, led Palestinians to say Trump's plan had given the ""green light"" for Israel to formally annex its settlements in the West Bank that it has occupied since the 1967 Middle East War.
Trump's plan envisages a two-state solution with Israel and a future Palestinian state living alongside each other, but with strict conditions that Palestinians have baulked at.
He proposed a four-year schedule for the creation of a Palestinian state, with Palestinians first having to agree to halt attacks by the Islamist militant group Hamas which controls the enclave of Gaza.
But the plan also gave U.S. recognition of Israel's West Bank settlements - deemed illegal under international law - Israeli sovereignty over the Jordan Valley, and a redrawn, demilitarized Palestinian state that would meet Israel's security requirements.
Jerusalem would be the undivided capital of Israel, it said.
ELECTION JOSTLING
With Netanyahu still outside Israel after attending the plan's presentation in Washington, Bennett outlined his hardline interpretation of what the White House had offered Israel.
""Last night history knocked on the door of our home and gave us a one-time opportunity to apply Israeli law on all settlements in Samaria, Judea, the Jordan Valley and the northern Dead Sea,"" Bennett said, using the Hebrew names for areas in the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
He had ordered a team to be set up to apply Israeli law and sovereignty on all Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
Bennett is vying with Netanyahu for support from right-wing voters in an election set for March 2. It is unclear whether the present caretaker administration has a legal mandate to carry out such a move after two inconclusive elections in 2019.
Netanyahu on Wednesday reiterated his support for Trump's plan, telling Fox television: ""We will not contradict in any way the outline that the president put forward.""
But Amir Peretz, head of Israel's left-wing Labor Party, said no unilateral plan could work. ""Now more than ever it's clear that we need a diplomatic compass,"" he said.
SLAP OF THE CENTURY 
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called Trump's plan the ""slap of the century"" after it was announced.
Chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said on Wednesday Trump's team had simply ""copied and pasted"" the blueprint that Netanyahu and Israeli settler leaders wanted to see implemented.
""It's about annexation, it's about apartheid,"" he said in Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. ""Moving to the de jure annexation of settlements is something that was given the green light yesterday.""
Palestinians also dismissed the proposal for a capital in Abu Dis, in the West Bank just outside the Israeli municipal borders of Jerusalems. It lies a mile east of the historic walled Old City, home to sites sacred to Judaism, Christianity and Islam but cut off by an Israeli wall and checkpoints.
Palestinian leaders believe the Trump administration is biased toward Israel.
Before announcing the much-touted plan, it had broken from international consensus by recognizing disputed Jerusalem as Israel's capital, halted aid to the Palestinians, and said it no longer considered the settlements a breach of international law. 
Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and the plan's principal architect, shrugged off the Palestinian rejection.
""We're not going to chase the Palestinians...the Palestinian leadership, you can't really treat them like they're a serious government, or capable or competent dealmakers,"" he told reporters. ""They'll do what they've always done, which is screw everything up.""
The Palestinians could push for a U.N. condemnation of the plan. Israel's U.N. mission signaled on Tuesday it would work to thwart this in a diplomatic campaign with the United States.
PALESTINIAN STATE 
Gaza political analyst Talal Okal said the deal gave Israel the right to take what it wanted ""immediately, while the Palestinians have to wait four years to see whether they have rights or not"". 
Amos Yadlin, a former Israeli head of military intelligence said: ""This is the most favorable plan for Israel ever presented by an international player.""
However he said that because it included mention of a two-state solution, it could still cause problems for Netanyahu among his right-wing allies.
Bennett seemed to confirm this. ""The Israeli government will not recognize a Palestinian state,"" he said

The Al-Aqsa mosque compound, also known as the Temple Mount, has been often been a flashpoint of violence. Under a ""status quo"" agreement also involving neighboring Jordan, Jewish prayer is prevented there - a source of frustration for some Israelis.
U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan, whose unveiling on Tuesday was immediately welcomed by Israel and excoriated by the Palestinians, proposed that ""people of every faith should be permitted to pray"" at the disputed site in Jerusalem's Old City.
But the U.S. ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, on Wednesday described the statement as aspirational, for now.
""The status quo, in the manner that it is observed today, will continue, absent an agreement to the contrary. There is nothing in the plan that would impose any alteration in the status quo that is not subject to the agreement of all the parties,"" Friedman told reporters in a conference call.
""Having said that, as we point out, we would like the region to be more open and free with regard to the exercise of freedom of religion,"" he said, suggesting such a situation might eventually be instituted at the Jerusalem site and elsewhere."

BUDAPEST/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hungary's ruling Fidesz party will remain suspended from the European People's Party, the EU's conservative umbrella group, EPP chairman Donald Tusk said on Wednesday, extending a year-long standoff with the populist right-wing party.
Fidesz's leader, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, has locked horns with his EU peers over issues such as democratic freedoms and the rule of law in Hungary, leading to the suspension of his party last March.
Tusk, who was elected EPP president late last year, met earlier this month with three envoys who had visited Hungary to assess the situation.
""I have received an oral report from the evaluation committee with the conclusion that there has not been sufficient progress in Budapest. Therefore I will not propose to vote or even discuss Fidesz,"" Tusk told the EPP's European Parliament group, according to an aide who was present.
""We will continue the suspension as long as the situation is as it is... I don't intend to start my presidency by revolution or large divisions, but I won't compromise about values. How can one even do that? We must find a practical solution.""
Orban has several times threatened to leave the EPP, saying it has lost touch with conservative voters and demanding a return to a tougher stance on issues like migration and cultural identity.
Asked about the EPP issue before Tusk's remarks, Fidesz Vice Chair Katalin Novak told Reuters the party was growing impatient about the limbo.
""We feel our shared interest is to decide this issue one way or another,"" said Novak, who is responsible for the party's foreign politics. ""We are ready to make a call on that.""
Asked if it might move unilaterally, she said: ""Fidesz... is an inch from quitting the EPP. Soon after the premier meets the leaders he planned to, Fidesz will make a decision, regardless of the EPP.""
MEP Tamas Deutsch said Fidesz would quit the EPP if forced, adding that he believed it would exert a growing gravitational pull now that EPP parties have lost elections in France, Spain, Italy and Poland.
""Four of the seven largest EU nations have replaced conservative governments and the UK is leaving the bloc,"" he said.
""Something is off here, for Pete's sake. The EPP has lost the confidence of the citizens."""

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenian President Borut Pahor plans to start formal talks with parliamentary parties on February 4, seeking to resolve a political crisis sparked by the resignation of center-left Prime Minister Marjan Sarec on Monday.
Sarec, who took power in September 2018 to lead the first minority government in Slovenian history, said his government did not have enough seats in parliament to push through important legislation.
The president's office said in a statement that Pahor has 30 days to nominate a candidate for the role of prime minister or inform the parliament that he will not put forward a name.
Parliamentary members will then have a further 16 days to nominate their own candidates. If no candidate is nominated or no candidate can secure the backing of a majority in parliament, the president would be required to call an early election.
According to parliamentary speaker Dejan Zidan, an early election could take place in the second half of April.
Parties have already started informal talks about forming a new government, with much depending on the center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), the largest parliamentary party with 26 out of 90 seats but which has so far been in opposition.
The executive board of the SDS is due to meet on Thursday when it could decide whether to attempt to form a new government or opt for a snap election, Slovenia's fourth such vote in a row.

Mass protests have gripped Iraq since Oct. 1, with the mostly young protesters demanding the overhaul of a system they see as profoundly corrupt and as keeping most Iraqis in poverty. More than 450 people have been killed.
The deadline set by President Salih is the latest sign that the Shi'ite political parties who dominate Iraq's parliament have failed so far to bridge their differences and select a new prime minister who is acceptable to the protesters.
Salih called on the rival political blocs to resume talks and agree a nominee.
If no name was presented to him by Feb. 1, Salih said in a statement he saw it as essential that he ""carry out my constitutional prerogatives and designate whom I find more acceptable to the public and parliament"".
Two political blocs - Bina, backed by Iran, and Islah, led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr - are closely involved in backroom discussions to agree on a candidate.
The protesters have been demanding not only a new electoral law and committee, but also the removal of the entire political class and appointment of a prime minister with no party affiliation."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The German cabinet on Wednesday backed plans to exit coal as an energy source by 2038 as part of efforts by Chancellor Angela Merkel's ruling coalition to protect the climate and restore its green credentials.
The government is spurring a shift toward renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power with exits from nuclear power by 2022 and coal-fueled power sources by 2038.
""This is not just an exit from coal, it's an entry into renewable energy,"" Environment Minister Svenja Schulze told reporters.
Of the coal exit, she said: ""We will cut a quarter of all CO2 emissions in Germany - that is a very important sign, internationally too, that Germany is taking its responsibility here.""
Caught on the hop when a series of unusually hot summers and the impact of Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg's Fridays for Future movement caused public opinion to turn, the German government last year introduced a major climate package, which included economy-wide carbon pricing.
Germany aims to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 55% of its 1990 level by 2030. Last year, Merkel acknowledged her coalition's credibility on climate policy had been hurt by abandoning an earlier 2020 emissions cut target.
Designed to ensure Germany hits the 2030 target, the coal exit will be accompanied by heavy investments in renewable energy.
Economy Minister Peter Altmaier said last week Germany's transition to a fossil-fuel free energy mix will be like undergoing ""open-heart surgery"" as the car, steel and renewable industries will need to work hard to stay competitive.
COMPENSATION
As part of the plan, the government has agreed to compensate workers, companies and regional governments as it switches off plants by 2038.
The government has struck a deal worth more than 40 billion euros ($44 billion) with coal-mining regions.
""These regions need us to think about their future too,"" said Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, adding that the 40 billion euro package would ""ensure the structural change succeeds"".
A draft law approved by the cabinet to phase out hard coal-fired power stations envisages maximum phase-out compensation of 165,000 euros per megawatt in 2020, falling to 155,000 euros in 2021 and 2022.
The maximum sum would drop by about 25% annually thereafter before reaching 49,000 euros in 2026. There will be no further compensation after 2026.
Once the heartland of German industry, the coal regions of North Rhine-Westphalia have fallen on hard times as traditional heavy industries have lost sway, while coal regions in the east have yet to fully shrug off the impact of four decades in Communist East Germany.
The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has sought to win votes in eastern Germany from the coal exit with a simple message: jobs are more important than the environment.
The oldest, dirtiest plants, some dating back to the 1950s, will go first. As well as phasing out hard coal power stations, the government also plans to exit brown coal, or lignite, of which Germany is the world's largest producer.
Brown coal generates about 19% of the country's electricity, but is considered the most polluting type of coal, partly because its low energy density means more must be burned.

LONDON (Reuters) - Several witnesses have asked for guarantees that they will not be prosecuted for anything they say at a public inquiry into a fire that killed 72 people in London's Grenfell Tower nearly three years ago, the inquiry's chairman said on Wednesday.
The 23-storey social housing block, owned by the wealthy London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was engulfed by flames on the night of June 14, 2017, in Britain's worst fire in a residential building since World War Two.
A public inquiry into the blaze said the key factor in the unstoppable spread of the fire was the presence of a flammable cladding system that had been fitted to the tower's external walls during a recent refurbishment.
The inquiry, chaired by retired judge Martin Moore-Bick, is due to begin hearing evidence next Monday from people, firms and bodies that were involved in the renovation.
At the start of Wednesday's hearing, Moore-Bick said he had just received an unexpected request from several of the witnesses, who wanted to make sure they could not incriminate themselves by participating in the inquiry.
""What they're asking me to do is to apply to the attorney general for an undertaking that nothing said by a witness in answers to questions in the inquiry will be used in furtherance of a prosecution against them,"" he said.
Moore-Bick, whose announcement drew audible gasps and protests from people attending the hearing, said he would decide whether to grant the request after lawyers representing all parties, including Grenfell survivors, had discussed the matter.
Many survivors and bereaved relatives have previously said those responsible for wrapping Grenfell Tower in combustible cladding should face criminal charges.
MANSLAUGHTER
Police have said they are considering possible charges, including gross negligence manslaughter and corporate manslaughter. But they say they will not announce any decisions on charges until the public inquiry has ended as they will need to take into account its findings.
Moore-Bick said the surprise request had come from certain employees and ex-employees of Rydon Maintenance Ltd, a privately owned firm that was the main contractor in charge of the refurbishment, as well as from Harley Facades Ltd, a sub-contractor that dealt with the cladding.
He said the same request had also been made by Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation (KCTMO), a body which used to manage social housing in the borough and was stripped of its responsibilities after the Grenfell Tower fire.

Certain survivors have alleged that official neglect of their ethnically mixed, largely low-income community had played a part in the tragedy, and that warnings from residents that there were fire hazards in the tower had been ignored.

DHAKA (Reuters) - Rohingya refugees reacted with surprise and joy on Wednesday to the news that Bangladesh would provide formal education to their children, two and a half years after they were forced to flee Myanmar.
Human rights groups have long campaigned for the nearly half a million effectively stateless Rohingya children in Bangladesh’s refugee camps to be allowed access to quality education, warning of the costs of a 'lost generation'.
""Oh my god! Bangladesh is letting us be educated!"" Mohammed Zobayer, 19, said by phone when Reuters told him about the decision, taken this week but not formally announced.
Officials say the move will provide schooling to the age of 14 and training thereafter in place of informal learning for only younger children.
""I'm so excited. This is so good. I can't express my happiness,"" Zobayer said.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017, and were forced into squalid camps across the border in Bangladesh. U.N. investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with ""genocidal intent"".
Bangladesh has not recognized the vast majority of the refugees and does not issue birth certificates for those born in the camps, making their legal status unclear.
Last year it expelled scores of them from local schools, saying they were using fake Bangladeshi identity cards.
Mahbub Alam Talukder, Bangladesh's refugee relief and repatriation commissioner, told Reuters Rohingya children would be taught in existing learning centers and some more schools would be built, with teachers recruited through NGOs. ""They will follow the Myanmar national curriculum,"" he said.
Learning centers are operated in the camps by international NGOs and the U.N., but children and their parents say they offer mostly unstructured learning and playtime for those who attend.
""Many have already lost two academic years,"" Zobayer, who works as a teacher in one of the learning centers, said. ""Now they can chase their dreams. It is like having a new life.""
Dil Mohammed, a senior Rohingya leader, said the community was grateful to Bangladesh.
""The country saved our lives by opening its doors for us. Now, by providing education, they have saved our children from becoming a lost generation,” he said, adding that Myanmar had barred Rohingya children from mainstream schools in 2012.
The Hague-based International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar on Thursday to protect the Rohingya against further atrocities and preserve evidence of alleged crimes, after west African nation the Gambia launched a lawsuit in November accusing the country of genocide."

George never fought in a battle, nor even left the south of England, but from his library at Buckingham Palace he kept a close eye on the British army, via detailed strategic maps and charts.
The collection, which belongs to the Royal Collection Trust and can be seen on https://militarymaps.rct.uk https://militarymaps.rct.uk/?_ga=2.43856805.1452758383.1580298075-398737622.1580298075/, includes material from the 16th to 18th centuries such as fortification plans, maps of encampments and rough sketches drawn in the field.
The maps give a view of the military as George would have seen it, at a time of major British, European and American conflicts. The Seven Years War (1756–63), the American War of Independence (1775-83) and the French and Napoleonic wars (1792–1815) are among those represented.
Some maps of the American War of Independence were two meters wide and were probably hung on purpose-built mahogany stands, the Royal Collection Trust said.
One map of the British defeat at the Battle of Yorktown in 1781 - the only known copy to survive outside the United States - has an annotation marking ""The Field where the British laid down their Arms"".
""It is fitting, and rather moving, that on the 200th anniversary of George III's death we are able to make the King's collection of military maps digitally available to all, offering new insight into his topographical interests and his contribution to the cartographic sciences,"" said Martin Clayton, the Royal Collection Trust's Head of Prints and Drawings.
George's father, George II, was the last British monarch to go to battle at the head of his army but to this day the British royal family are closely involved in the military. The Queen is the official head of the British army, while Prince Philip and Prince Charles served in the navy.
Prince Harry served in the British army for ten years, including two separate stints of active service in Afghanistan."

Iraq's parliament has voted to ask the United States to withdraw its 5,000-strong force after the Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike in Baghdad, which killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and the Iraqi leader of a powerful pro-Iran armed faction.
Washington has paused some of the military activity of its troops in Iraq, which were invited back into the country in 2014 as part of a mission to fight the Islamic State militant group in both Iraq and Syria, after withdrawing three years earlier.
""We are looking forward to sitting down and having a broad discussion with the Iraqi government of our entire strategic framework relationship in the near future,"" James Jeffrey, the U.S. special envoy for Syria, told Reuters. 
Jeffrey said U.S.-led coalition operations were still on pause in Iraq as the focus has been on force protection and talks with the Baghdad government on the way forward.
Iraq is an ally of both the United States and Iran, and has had to balance those relationships carefully at a time of escalation between the two foes. Recent months have seen demonstrations in Iraq against both countries' influence.
President Donald Trump responded angrily to demands from Baghdad that U.S. troops withdraw from Iraq, even threatening to impose sanctions if the troops were forced out. He met Iraq's president, Barham Salih, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week.
Jeffrey said the United States supports a possible future role by NATO in Iraq and Syria.
""Nobody is rushing anything,"" Jeffrey said when asked about the time frame for talks with the Iraqi government. ""We are very interested in NATO's process of seeing what additional role it can do.""

The past week had seen no spike in activities of Islamic State in neither Iraq or Syria, but activity levels remained at a level that caused concern, Jeffrey said.

Ties between the NATO allies were badly strained last year when Turkey bought Russian S-400 defense systems, prompting Washington to threaten sanctions and to suspend Turkish involvement in its F-35 jet program, where Ankara was a buyer and manufacturer.
Washington says the S-400s are not compatible with NATO systems and threaten the stealth capabilities of its  Lockheed Martin  (NYSE:LMT) F-35 jets. Ankara rejects this and says S-400s will not be integrated into the alliance's defenses.
Turkey has accused the United States of stalling and ignoring its proposal to form a joint working group on the issue involving NATO, even though Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump agreed in November to start work on it.
""We made the appointments there (in Washington), but there are no serious efforts on this yet,"" Erdogan was quoted by NTV as saying. ""The S-400 issue is over. It is out of the question for us to turn back from this deal,"" he told reporters on a return flight from Senegal.
Days after Erdogan's Washington visit in mid-November, his spokesman said Turkish and U.S. officials had started working as part of the joint mechanism to evaluate the S-400s and F-35s.
Erdogan also again warned that Ankara could look elsewhere for fighter jets. ""Either the United States will give us the money for these or give us the jets,"" Erdogan said. ""If they won't give us back the money... we can also find and buy them elsewhere or make them ourselves.""
Last month, a $738-billion defense spending bill passed by the U.S. Senate called on Trump to sanction Turkey and prohibit the delivery of F-35s to the NATO ally over the S-400s."

More than 350 knives were blunted and 18 confiscated in the raid on two open-air markets, police said in an online report.
It showed men with kitchen knives lining up to have their knives blunted by a machine, as well as police examining the knives of a local baker. It was unclear whether souvenir knives on sale at the markets - Andijan is a center of traditional knife-making crafts - were included.
""Preemptive measures continue to be taken to prevent crime,"" the police report, posted this week, said.
Andijan lies in the Central Asian state's densely populated Ferghana valley. In 2005, security forces crushed armed protests in the city, initially blaming Islamist extremism but later acknowledging poverty played a role.
Murder rates in Uzbekistan have dropped under President Mirziyoyev, who came to power in late 2016 and has taken steps to boost economic growth and create jobs by opening up the secretive state.
But stabbings, which are often spontaneous and result from ordinary quarrels, grab public attention. Last October, for example, a trader bled to death in broad daylight at a market near the capital Tashkent after being stabbed in an argument with fellow market workers."

Renewed bombardments by Russia-backed Syrian government forces on Idlib have raised concern of a new refugee wave from the area which borders Turkey and is home to 3 million people.
Turkey and Russia, which support opposing sides in Syria, agreed to work toward de-escalating the fighting in Idlib and creating a demilitarized zone under agreements in 2017 and 2018 known as the Astana and Sochi accords. 
But fighting has continued in the last remaining rebel bastion in country's nearly nine-year war despite several other agreements for a ceasefire, as recently as this month.
""Currently, Russia is not abiding by Astana or Sochi,"" NTV quoted Erdogan as saying. 
Speaking to reporters on his flight back from Senegal, he said Turkey, which is building houses in northern Idlib to shelter civilians fleeing the bombing, has told Russia that it is running out patience.
""If we are loyal partners with Russia on this, they have to put forth their stance... Our wish is that Russia immediately makes the necessary warnings to the regime which it sees as a friend,"" he said.
""The Astana process has fallen into silence now. We need to look at what Turkey, Russia and Iran can do to revive the Astana process,"" he said.
On Tuesday, Syrian government forces entered a town in the south of Idlib city, in a significant advance for President Bashar al-Assad. Turkey said it would retaliate against any attack on its 12 observation posts around Idlib.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based war monitor, said a Turkish military convoy of 30 vehicles, including 12 armored vehicles, entered Syria on Monday evening and was expected to establish a new observation post south of the town of Saraqeb in Idlib.

The civil case for damages was filed referring to universal jurisdiction rules by claimant Ismail Ziada.
Judicial authorities in countries that recognize universal jurisdiction for serious offences such as war crimes and torture can investigate and prosecute those crimes no matter where they were committed.
""A Dutch judge is not competent to rule on the case of the claimant,"" presiding Judge Larisa Alwin said, explaining that universal jurisdiction could be applied for individual criminal responsibility but not in a civil case.
In civil cases in national courts, Gantz enjoys immunity from prosecution due to his government function at the time of the alleged crimes, Alwin said.
A career soldier, Gantz was chief of staff of the Israeli armed forces from 2011 until his retirement in 2015. He was commander during the 2014 war against Palestinian militants in Palestinian-run Gaza, when the incident took place. 
About 2,200 Palestinians are estimated to have been killed, up to 1,500 of them civilians during the conflict. On the Israeli side, 67 soldiers were killed and five civilians.
During the June 2014 air strike that Ziada was trying to claim damages for, his family's home in the Gaza strip was bombed. He lost his mother, three brothers, a sister-in-law and his 12-year old nephew in the blast.
Besides Gantz, he also sought the possibility of getting damages from the former commander of the Israeli air force, Amir Eshel. 
Ziada told reporters he was very disappointed with the verdict but said he would fight on. 
""Israel still enjoys impunity, everybody sees that and then the only opportunity to get justice is denied. This is unacceptable to me,"" he said. 
He is expected to appeal but said he would study the ruling before making a final decision. 

Gantz is the main rival facing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an election in Israel on March 2, Israel’s third in less than a year after inconclusive ballots in April and September.

The Torkham border crossing, at the top of the Khyber Pass, through which thousands of vehicles pass every week, is the main trade link between the uneasy neighbors.
In September last year, Pakistan opened the crossing for 24 hours a day to boost trade.
""Some mortars were fired from across the border in Afghanistan and landed inside Pakistan. They caused some damage to vehicles,"" Mahmood Aslam Wazir, deputy district commissioner of the area on the Pakistani side, told Reuters.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are both U.S. allies but their relations have rarely been close.
Afghanistan has for years accused Pakistan of supporting Taliban militants. Pakistan denies doing so and in turn accuses Afghanistan of supporting militants fighting the Pakistani government.
Exchanges of fire across a border Afghanistan has never recognized are common.
An Afghan official denied that Afghan forces had fired into Pakistan.
Attaullah Khogyani, spokesman for the governor of Nangarhar province, on the Afghan side of the border, suggested that Pakistani forces had fired the mortar bombs as a ruse.
""In the past, Pakistan has played the same game whenever they want to close the Torkham crossing,"" Khogyani told Reuters.
Pakistan was angered this week when Afghan President Ashraf Ghani condemned the arrest in Pakistan of a Pakistani ethnic Pashtun rights activist.

TULI GULED, Ethiopia (Reuters) - First, drought in Ethiopia’s Oromiya region destroyed Asha Khalif Ali’s crops and animals. Then her husband and brother were killed in ethnic violence. She fled with her seven children, the youngest on her back, and watched their small faces grow gaunt with hunger as they sought safety. 
Scientists and humanitarians say Asha's story – of a once prosperous family endlessly buffeted by the intertwined plagues of climate change and violence –  will become more familiar around the world as repeated disasters push families into competition for ever-scarcer resources. 
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said on Jan. 21 the world needs to prepare for ""millions"" more climate change refugees and cited a U.N. ruling this month that such people deserved international protection. 
Behind each number lies a story of suffering. 
For Asha, the drought that ended two years ago exacerbated simmering tensions over resources between ethnic groups. After gunmen from a rival ethnic group killed her husband, she fled into the mountains with her children. 
They marched barefoot for five days. The children's feet bled; her milk dried up. When they finally reached a safe village, Asha collapsed. She and four of her children were hospitalized. 
They found refuge in the village of Tuli Guled in the eastern Somali region, where the International Committee of the Red Cross gave them seeds and tools. Then heavy rains and desert locusts destroyed her crop and her hope.
""Life has changed a lot since the seasons changed. Food is more expensive. We used to have three meals a day. Now I can only afford one,"" Asha said, sitting on three bags of rotten wheat. Her two youngest children squirmed in her lap as she struggled to hold back tears. 
""I fear my children may starve."" 
INTER-ETHNIC VIOLENCE
The World Meteorological Organization says more extreme weather events linked to temperature rises of 3-5 degrees Celsius can be expected if carbon dioxide emissions, which hit a new record in 2018, keep rising at the current rate. 
Ethiopia had the highest number of new internally displaced people in the world in 2018 - 2.9 million - according to the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Center. Some fled drought or floods, others fled clashes. 
It's hard to measure the impact of climate change on violence, and it is not the cause of all inter-ethnic conflicts in Ethiopia, which have flared since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed took power in April 2018.
His political and economic reforms, though widely praised, have also unleashed long-repressed tensions among Ethiopia's myriad ethnic groups as they lay claim to disputed territory. 
However, recent data and testimonies from displaced people such as Asha demonstrate the complex interaction between climate change and violence. 
""Many make the link today between their experience of violent conflicts and climate change,"" said Peter Maurer, president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, as he toured Ethiopian villages devastated by violence, drought, heavy rains and desert locusts. 

""The struggle over less productive land is at the origin of much of what they suffer.""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - On a recent balmy evening at a Mumbai sports ground, writer Varun Grover, a pink flower tucked behind his ear, read his new poem to thousands of people protesting against a citizenship law.
""Dictators will come and go. We will not show our papers,"" Grover, who has written lyrics for several Bollywood musicals and was the writer of Netflix's flagship Indian show ""Sacred Games"", told the crowd.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new law grants citizenship to followers of non-Muslim religions fleeing persecution from India's three Muslim-majority neighbors - Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
But critics say the law is Islamophobic and a threat to India's secular constitution. The government says the law seeks to help persecuted minorities and it accuses its opponents of misconstruing it.
The nearly two months of protests, spearheaded by students, represent the most concerted challenge to Modi and his Hindu-nationalist government since he was first elected in 2014.
The campaign has been championed by musicians and poets, both Hindu and Muslim, highlighting the stand much of India's liberal intelligentsia and artistic community has taken against the government.
""In the short term, songs or poems bind the protesters and keep the camaraderie going,"" Grover, 40, told Reuters.
""In the long term, which I think is more important, it reminds those of us who are voicing our opposition why we aren't like those who support this government.""
Grover's Hindi-language poem, ""We Will Not Show our Papers"", which he first posted on social media on Dec. 21, has become a rallying cry for the demonstrators.
It has been translated into several Indian languages, and is recited at rallies, and hashtagged on Twitter.
Rap and folk musicians have also rallied to the anti-government cause.
""There is a strong element of resistance to rap music - it was a symbol of protest against white supremacy, and it also feels relevant to the mostly student protesters,"" said Shumais Nazar, a student at New Delhi's Jamia Millia University, who has written rap songs for the campaign and performed them at rallies.
Nazar was at the university last month when police stormed in, firing tear gas shells as scores of students took shelter inside, in a night of violence that shocked many and galvanized the protests.
The police said they were going after ""miscreants"" who threw stones at them from the campus.
Muslim artists have also been vocal, with writer Hussain Haidry's poem ""I am an Indian Muslim"" resonating with Muslim demonstrators who have carried national flags and copies of the constitution, aiming to prevent Hindu nationalists from painting them as anti-India.
""Do not look me from one perspective – I have a hundred faces ... I am as Indian as I am Muslim,"" Haidry said to cheers at the same Mumbai rally that Grover addressed."

A total of 124 deputies in the 240-seat parliament voted against the fourth no-confidence vote against the center-right coalition government led by Prime Minister Boyko Borissov, while 102 lawmakers were in favor.
The Socialists sought to topple the government which came to office in 2017, accusing it of failing to prevent severe water shortages in the western city of Pernik - a crisis that led to the ousting of Environment Minister Neno Dimov earlier this month.
The Socialists also blamed the government for failing to impose proper controls over garbage imports and serious air pollution in many cities of the Balkan country.
Prosecutors have charged Dimov with deliberate mismanagement for allowing industrial use of the water of a dam that provides drinking water to about 100,000 people in the city of Pernik despite its decreasing levels.
The government has since come up with a plan to divert part of Sofia's water supply to Pernik and tighten border controls of imports of scrap and waste materials."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's government has stepped up the purchase of air purifiers over the last two years, taking the number of devices in ministries to protect against deteriorating air quality to nearly 300, government data seen by Reuters showed.
    Six federal ministries - including the health, foreign and home affairs - bought at least 159 air purifiers during 2018-2019 at a cost of 5 million rupees ($70,353), according to previously unpublished data obtained under a Right to Information (RTI) law. 
That compares with at least 140 air purifiers bought for $55,000 during 2014-2017 for the six ministries and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office, as previously reported by Reuters. The latest data on purchases for Modi's office was not available. (https://reut.rs/2ppjyBj)
The purchases come as the federal and city governments faced criticism for failing to address the problem of worsening air pollution, especially in the winter, and drew criticism from one activist.
""It's absolutely criminal to spend taxpayers' money in buying air purifiers for government officials,"" said environmentalist Vimlendu Jha, who is a member of a government panel tasked with solving Delhi's pollution crisis.
In November, the level of pollution in the capital forced authorities to shut schools, restrict the use of cars and declare a public health emergency.     
A senior official at the environment ministry, which bears the most responsibility for tackling pollution, said there was no particular drive to buy purifiers to protect civil servants.
""The government is not spending a fortune by buying air purifiers. And it's not that officials don't get to inhale toxic air by confining themselves to their offices,"" said the ministry official.
The six ministries and Modi's office did not respond to requests for comment. 
Air purifiers can cost up to nearly $1,000 and are too expensive for most Indians. 
Per capita income in New Delhi, a city of more than 20 million, is about $400 a month and thousands of homeless people endure the cold and the toxic air while sleeping on the streets.
Reuters requested for data using the RTI law from the six ministries as it had comparable numbers previously reported in 2018. These were the ministries of foreign affairs, tourism, agriculture, health, home affairs and the federal think-tank Niti Aayog.
Of the total of 159 devices bought by the ministries, the home affairs ministry topped the list with 103 of them in 2018 and 2019, the data showed. Graphic: Modi's government purifer purchases 2018-2019 - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/mkt/13/1536/1511/www.jpg 
""All the air purifiers have been installed in various offices/rooms of this ministry,"" the ministry said in its RTI response, adding the amount spent was 3.1 million rupees ($43,619).
In October and November, when New Delhi saw some its worst air pollution last year, the foreign ministry bought 12 purifiers. Four of them - bought for the minister's office - were priced at nearly $1,000 each.
The federal health ministry bought 23 air purifiers in the last two years, including 14 in 2019, its highest annual purchases since 2015, the data showed.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A small natural earthquake detected in North Korea on Wednesday was likely a result of seismic instability lingering in the area since North Korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test in 2017, the South Korean government said.
A magnitude 2.5 earthquake was detected at 9:33 a.m. (0033 GMT) in Hamgyong Province, the location of North Korea's shuttered Punggye-ri Nuclear Test Site, according to South Korea's Meteorological Administration.
""It was a natural earthquake, presumably caused by the sixth nuclear test,"" the administration said in a statement on its website. ""The area is about 3 kilometers (1.86 miles) southeast of the sixth nuclear test site.""
Punggye-ri is the only known site in North Korea used to test nuclear weapons. At least six tests were conducted there between October 2006 and September 2017.
In early 2018, North Korea said it would close the site, saying its nuclear force was complete.
The entrances to tunnels at the site were blown up in front of a small group of foreign media invited to view the demolition, but North Korea rejected calls for international experts to inspect the closure.
Frustrated at what it sees as a lack of reciprocal concessions by the United States in denuclearization talks, North Korea now says it is no longer bound by its self-imposed moratorium on test firing nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles, though it has not conducted new tests.
The 2017 nuclear test, which North Korea said was a thermonuclear weapon, appeared to be several times larger than previous blasts, according to monitoring organizations at the time.
In the weeks after the sixth explosion, experts pointed to a series of tremors and landslides near the nuclear test base as a sign the large blast had destabilized the region.
Wednesday's quake is the latest confirmation that the nuclear explosion had permanently changed the geology of the area, said Woo Nam-chul, an earthquake analyst at KMA.
""The terrain of the area was solid enough to have no natural earthquakes before the sixth nuclear test in September 2017."""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Wednesday he wants greater federal powers during natural disasters, as authorities warned bushfires ravaging the country for months were sweeping through a national park near the capital.
Morrison said he wanted to set up a ""legal framework that would allow the Commonwealth to declare a national state of emergency"" before the next summer bushfire season, adding the chain of command between states and the federal government remained unclear.
Although he gave no details, the plan showed the conservative leader moving to head off criticism he was too slow to act when the seriousness of the country's worst bushfire season in a generation became apparent late last year.
Attacked by political opponents and media commentators for holidaying in Hawaii while the fires raged, Morrison initially said the country's eight state and territory governments had the main oversight during natural disasters.
He later mobilized about 3,000 Australian Defense Force reservists to help regional communities affected by the fires.
""It has long been the case that state and territory governments have primary responsibility for protecting the life and property within their borders,"" Morrison said.
""The scale of the bushfires this season, not least their simultaneous reach across many borders, has demonstrated to me the limits of these arrangements,"" Morrison said in a speech in the capital, Canberra.
Just to the south of the city, authorities warned people to stay away from some regional areas due to a 10,000 hectare (25,000 acre) forest fire, although no suburbs of Canberra itself were under threat.
Over the summer, Canberra has regularly been shrouded in bushfire smoke that has put its air quality among the lowest ranked in the world and prompted government agencies to ask employees to stay home.
A week ago, the city's airport was closed briefly when bushfire burned near its edges.
The Bureau of Meteorology has warned Canberra will be at the center of a heatwave that will put the city's temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) for several days.
Since September, bushfires in Australia have killed 33 people and an estimated 1 billion native animals, while 2,500 homes and a wilderness area the size of Greece have been destroyed, prompting critics to accuse Morrison of not doing enough to cut the country's carbon emissions.
Morrison said Australia should adapt to changing weather patterns that would make bushfires more frequent, but ""when it comes to practical safety of people living in bushfire zones, hazard reduction is even more important than emissions reduction"".
Here are Wednesday's key events in the bushfire crisis:
* New South Wales state firefighters were tackling 91 fires, none above the lowest warning level of ""advice"".
* In Victoria state, there were 15 warnings in place, none of which was deemed an immediate threat to property.

* The Bureau of Meteorology has warned a high pressure weather pattern will move across Australia's east coast later this week, bring soaring temperatures over the weekend including in Canberra.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. military said it has begun notifying nearly 9,000 South Korean workers that they will be put on leave starting April if Seoul and Washington fail to reach a deal on sharing costs for the upkeep of 28,500 U.S. soldiers in South Korea.
The two countries have held six rounds of talks but have been unable to reach an agreement due to differences over Washington's demand for a sharp hike in Seoul's contribution for this year.
The current agreement technically expired at the end of 2019, but the U.S. military was using ""residual funds"" in efforts to minimize the impact on the workers, U.S. Ambassador Harry Harris has said.
The U.S. Forces in Korea (USFK) said it began to send ""furlough letters"" to employees on Tuesday in line with U.S. law requiring 60 days notice.
""Without the Republic of Korea's continued commitment to share the cost of employing our Korean National workforce, USFK will soon exhaust programed funds available to pay their salaries and wages,"" it said in a statement.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly said South Korea should bear more of the burden for hosting the troops, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War which ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty.
Washington demanded up to $5 billion a year, more than five times what Seoul agreed to pay last year under a one-year deal, but Harris said it has ""compromised"" on its numbers and hoped South Korea will also make an adjusted offer.
South Korean officials have said the U.S. demand was ""out of the existing agreement's framework"" and any deal should be ""reasonable, fair and mutually acceptable.""
The salaries of some 8,700 employees who provide administrative, technical and other services for the U.S. military has typically been covered by about 70 percent of South Korea's contribution."

KINGSTON (Reuters) - A major earthquake struck south of Cuba on Tuesday, sending shockwaves as far as Miami and sparking panic in the Cayman Islands where it ripped open sinkholes, but did not do serious damage to people or property, initial reports said.
The magnitude 7.7 quake hit in the sea between Jamaica, the Cayman Islands and Cuba, at a depth of 6.2 miles (10 km). Several aftershocks, including one of 6.1 magnitude much nearer to the Cayman Islands, followed the principal quake.
Cindi Welcome, 27, a trainee travel agent in Cayman capital George Town, said she first thought her blood pressure was playing up when the tremors struck. Then she screamed.
""The building was shaking like paper,"" she said. ""The panic was real. This was the worst we have ever felt.""
Residents reported drains blowing open and sinkholes appearing, one of which swallowed half a car, said Jewel Hydes, a 44-year-old risk manager on the islands.
""It was really, really horrific. Everyone on the island is still in shock,"" Hydes said. ""We kept seeing tons of people praying, running out of buildings, 'cause they were swaying.""
In Miami, Florida, several downtown buildings were evacuated as office workers streamed outdoors to safety.
Miami personal injury attorney Eli Stiers was in his 29th floor office when he suddenly started feeling queasy.
""I was like: 'Did I have some bad sushi?'"" he said. Then he noticed his office door swinging back and forth. ""We were like, did a plane hit the building? A sinkhole open up? Then it hit us that it was an earthquake. You don't expect that in Miami.""
The Miami-Dade Fire-Rescue department responded to multiple calls about high-rise buildings swaying. The department said it had no reports of injuries or structural damage.
To varying degrees, that message was repeated across the region, despite the strength of the quake.
Angie Watler, a spokeswoman for police on Cayman Brac, the island nearest the epicenter, said members of the public had reported some damage to buildings and to a swimming pool at the Carib Sands resort on the south of the island. 
Videos from Jamaica and the Caymans showed water sloshing out of pools during the quake. 
Watler said there were no reports so far of injuries but that authorities were still making checks.
The International Tsunami Information Center said a threat of a tsunami wave had largely passed. Minor sea level fluctuations up to 1 feet (30 cm) were still possible, it said.
The quake was also felt in several provinces across Cuba, the government said. However, it was not strongly felt in the capital of Havana, according to a Reuters witness.
Don Blakeman, a geophysicist at the National Earthquake Information Center, said the impact of quakes was hard to predict but that it happening at sea appeared to have helped.

""The good news is really that it waved out into the ocean,"" Blakeman said by telephone. ""It would have been a much different story if it had been right in Kingston.""

The Trump administration told U.S. airlines after a meeting that it was not taking the step of canceling flights, airline and government officials told Reuters.
The administration is holding daily meetings on the coronavirus and has considered a wide range of potential options. Two U.S. officials said the administration had not taken any options off the table, including a temporary ban on flights, if public health data supported the move.
On Monday, Republican Senator Tom Cotton urged the administration to immediately halt commercial flights from China to the United States.
Airlines including United Airlines Holdings Inc have said they are canceling some flights to China as demand has fallen sharply, and global companies have told their employees not to travel on deepening fears over the spread of the flu-like virus.
The coronavirus that originated in the city of Wuhan has killed 132 people in China and spread across the world, rattling financial markets.
The United States and other countries have warned their citizens that they should reconsider visiting China.
The Centers for Disease Control said on Tuesday the Trump administration was expanding screening for the virus at 20 U.S. airports."

Offshore assets including U.S. refiner Citgo have long been seen as attractive by investors holding the country's defaulted bonds and companies seeking to be paid back for the nationalization of their holdings.
The funds are to be drawn from accounts previously held by the government of President Nicolas Maduro but frozen last year after the United States imposed a broad set of sanctions meant to force a change of government.
""(They are) state funds used to represent and defend the assets of the state in pending litigation,"" legislator Adriana Pichardo of the Popular Will opposition party said in a telephone interview.
Lawmakers from the First Justice opposition party objected to the measure on the grounds that it did not clearly identify what cases would be financed.
Jose Ignacio Hernandez, whom opposition leader Juan Guaido has tapped as a special prosecutor, said in a statement that the U.S. Treasury Department would need to grant licenses for the use of the funds, which are to be destined exclusively for legal fees.
The Treasury Department did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Venezuela's congress set aside $3.5 million in U.S funds in November for such litigation.
Guaido, who has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela’s legitimate president, has made defending Venezuela's offshore assets a top priority, and has appointed allies to run Citgo.
Canadian mining company Crystallex has sued in the United States, seeking to seize shares in Citgo to collect $1.4 billion for the takeover of its assets by late socialist President Hugo Chavez."

President Donald Trump and other top officials initially said Iran's Jan. 8 attack had not killed or injured any U.S. service members.
""As of today, 50 U.S. service members have been diagnosed"" with traumatic brain injury, Pentagon spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Campbell said in a statement about injuries in the attack on the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq.
Symptoms of concussive injuries include headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light and nausea.
Thirty-one of the 50 were treated in Iraq and returned to duty, including 15 of those diagnosed most recently, Campbell said.
Eighteen of the total have been sent to Germany for further evaluation and treatment, and one was sent to Kuwait and has since returned to duty, he said.
""This is a snapshot in time and numbers can change,"" Campbell said.
In its previous update on Friday, the Pentagon had put the number of those injured at 34.
Trump last week appeared to play down the injuries, saying he ""heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things.""
That prompted criticism from a U.S. war veterans group. William Schmitz, national commander of the Veterans of Foreign Wars, said on Friday the group ""expects an apology from the president to our service men and women for his misguided remarks.""
According to Pentagon data, about 408,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury since 2000.
Iran fired missiles at Ain al-Asad in retaliation for the U.S. killing of a top Revolutionary Guard general, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike at Baghdad airport on Jan. 3.
The missile attacks capped a spiral of violence that had started in late December, and both sides have refrained from further military escalation."

Anez unveiled her new cabinet after her ministers had all resigned at her request. However, all but three were reinstated in a ceremony at the government palace where the President played down talk of crisis.
""This adjustment in the cabinet was necessary to be absolutely sure that all members of the team working together are committed to an honest and transparent management for the good of all Bolivians,"" she said.
The conservative former senator, who became president amid a power vacuum last year after the resignation of Evo Morales, sparked criticism from allies and opponents when she announced her intention to be a candidate in the May 3 vote.
The three ministries reshuffled were those of rural development, education and communication.
Bolivia has been gripped by political turmoil since October when a disputed election led to widespread protests that eventually toppled leftist leader Morales. Anez took the interim president role after Morales and others in his party resigned.
The former Minister of Communication, Roxana Lizárraga, had criticized Anez, who she said was surrounded by a ""small group of politicians"" that was seeking to remain in power instead of guaranteeing the neutrality of the caretaker government.
""We assumed power originally to recover democracy, so that we could get to new elections,"" she said, adding that Anez's candidacy betrayed the widespread popular uprising against Morales after the Oct. 20 election that led to his resignation."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Many years from now, far from the spray of water cannons and the unmistakable smell of tear gas, they will look back on their season of protest and remember exactly how they felt.
On this winter day, the march was called off early by police. Two teenagers walked under the orange glow of a highway overpass. Lights from police vans swirled ahead, but for the time being, the empty stretch of road belonged to them. The world felt entirely contained in that moment, existing only between the young couple on a Hong Kong street.
The boy tucked a stray hair behind the girl's ear and kissed the top of her head through the black T-shirt wrapped around his face. The girl took his gloved hand in hers.
Wing and Tony are two 18-year-olds in love. They are also front-line protesters in an increasingly violent pro-democracy movement that has upended this city for seven months. Normally quiet and reserved, the two have joined thousands of local teenagers in clashes with riot police all across Hong Kong, their hometown transformed into a battleground between China's growing reach and people's desire for more democracy.
But even in this extraordinary moment, there are the most ordinary of adolescent experiences, like first love.
Stories like Wing and Tony's can be found all over this city, private moments hidden amid the public chaos. Like the movement itself, their relationship is swept up in the passions and contradictions of the young: full of both conviction and uncertainty, idealism and fatalism.
Instead of shy first dates where arms brush against the other in the darkness of a movie theater, Wing found Tony a free helmet and gas mask, and showed him how to wear them. Rather than texting about where to get bubble tea, Wing sends Tony's personal details, including his lawyer's phone number, to friends who are safely monitoring the protests from home.
The couple, who asked for only their first names to be used because they fear identification by law enforcement and arrest, met at an orientation camp during their first semester in college last summer. By then, the now-scrapped extradition bill, which would have exposed Hong Kongers to mainland Chinese justice, had already sparked mass protests across the city. Wing had just broken up with her boyfriend, who refused to join her at rallies and protests on the weekends.
It was a scorching summer, but for those few days at camp among the trees, the students were able to forget about the turmoil outside and return to the teenagers that they were.
A picture of Tony and Wing at camp show them with their faces covered in painted hearts and moustaches. Wing beams at the camera, while Tony, a thick monobrow painted on his forehead, feigns resignation.
On one of the last nights of the camp trip, students played a game of hide and seek on the lawn. The night air was cool and the kids shrieked as they ran from one another.
""There was a point when a lot of people were chasing after us, so we were running away together,"" Wing said. ""It kind of felt like we were running away from the riot police.""
After the trip ended, they exchanged numbers. Wing saved Tony in her phone as ""Good Guy"" in Cantonese, a term for boys who have been friend-zoned. Tony saved Wing's number under ""Kong Girl,"" a local reference to shallow and spoilt women.
Wing (on Whatsapp): Almost done with class.
Tony: I've got a short break too.
Wing: I'm not gonna tell you where I am.
Tony: I know already...You're inside my heart.
Wing: You're crazy. Piss off! Bye bye.
Tony had attended an all-boys secondary school and never had a girlfriend before. After camp, he couldn't stop thinking about Wing and her big smile. Unlike him, she came from a privileged background and he assumed she would be haughty. But as he got to know more about her, his opinion of her changed. He was surprised and worried when he heard through friends that Wing was attending pro-democracy protests alone.
Tony had marched a few times in demonstrations, but had become disillusioned by the police crackdown.
""We couldn't change anything,"" he said, looking down at his hands. ""So, I figured I'd rather be a happy ignorant pig.""
Wing was different. She had already made up her mind to do whatever was necessary to fight against China's encroachment.
""I thought she was really brave,"" Tony said. ""I didn't expect her to be so close to the front line.""
On the first of October, Tony heard that Wing was heading to the protest alone, and decided to join her. They were just friends then, relying on each other to keep the other safe.
The road was a sea of teenagers in black, their faces hidden behind the heavy fabric of improvised balaclavas. Shards of glass crunched under their sneakers. A police officer had just shot a young protester at point-blank range.
Wing grabbed Tony's hand.
Suddenly, riot police were firing rounds of tear gas a block away, advancing quickly. Tony looked over his shoulder and ran, never letting go of Wing, her hand sweaty and slippery in his.
Blocks later, they turned down an alley. A middle-aged dishwasher saw them through her restaurant's back door. ""Come in, come in,"" she said, beckoning them inside. The two huddled next to a toilet, holding their breath as police sirens wailed by.
Realizing they were still clinging to each other, Wing dropped Tony's hand.
After that day, the two began attending more rallies and protests together. They formed a new daily routine: Tony would pick Wing up from school or her part-time job as a barista, then they would find a quiet alley away from the CCTV cameras to change into their ""black bloc"" clothes, a front-line uniform of black clothes and masks to blend into the crowd.
Together, they extinguished tear-gas canisters, dug up bricks for other protesters to throw, and hid behind makeshift barricades across Hong Kong. While Wing was always eager to push forward to the front, Tony was more cautious, keeping an eye on Telegram channels to make sure they could keep a safe distance from riot police.
""I was more impulsive than him.… I usually think and just go,"" Wing said, laughing easily. ""At first, I worried that he's one of those people who would always tell others to leave the protest, but he wasn't like that. Instead, he would ask why they were leaving.""
Rolling his eyes at her, Tony nodded.
""I can be the one to drag her back if she goes way too far to the front line,"" he said, jabbing her on the shoulder.
The only time Tony could spend time alone with Wing was when he walked her home from the subway station. Even then, she was consumed by the protests, constantly checking her phone for updates, pretending to ignore Tony's repeated attempts to confess his feelings toward her.
Wing: I want to cry.
Tony: It's gonna be alright. Where do you need to go to bail your friend out?
Wing: Hospital.
Tony: Did you arrive?
Wing: They said it's not visiting hours and won't let me in. There's so many police here.
Tony: It's gonna be alright. Did they explain why?
Wing: No, they didn't. I just bailed her out. She can leave after she sees the doctor.
Tony: Good. Call me if you need anything.
Undeterred by Wing's rejection, Tony tried again to tell her how he felt. Knowing she liked being by the sea, Tony asked her to meet him at a waterfront park in Kwun Tong, an industrial area with shuttered factories overseeing a distant skyline of glittering high-rises. Stammering a little, Tony tried to take Wing's hand. She shook him off, saying they weren't in a relationship and shouldn't hold hands.
""Everything's happening too fast. It's not the right time yet,"" Wing remembered telling him.
A few weeks later, Wing messaged Tony to ask after one of their other friends who had disappeared after a protest. When Tony didn't respond for an hour, Wing called him on Facetime. She relayed the news that their friend had been arrested.
Tony started crying, blaming himself for not joining his friend at the protest. He was tucked under the covers of his childhood bed, his parents sleeping next door.
""I've only seen him crying twice. The first time was when his friend got arrested, another time was when his grandma lost her vision because of her disease,"" Wing said.
Tony had attended nearly every protest by her side, keeping her safe but never questioning her decision to continue attending rallies despite the growing risks. Seeing the usually stoic Tony sniffling on the other side of the phone, she finally admitted to herself that she saw him as more than a friend.
""Can you be my boyfriend?"" she asked shyly.
""Yes, girlfriend,"" he replied, no longer crying. Finally, he thought.
Wing: If you haven't fallen asleep yet, I will call you back.
Tony: Just call me, it's fine. This is a 24-hour hotline. I can't open a 24/7 convenience store but I can be an on-call boyfriend that's open 24/7.
Wing: LOL
As autumn turned to winter, millions more poured into the streets of Hong Kong.
Wing and Tony spent an entire week in November facing off against police near Hong Kong Polytechnic University, which became the site of a dramatic standoff between university students and riot police. But they were able to find brief moments of respite to act like normal teenagers. In December, Tony met Wing's family and he invited her to his mother's birthday dinner.
Sharing a birthday cake that Wing had baked for his mother, Tony felt like it was the first time he was experiencing a regular courtship. His mother liked Wing so much she told her to come back again for dinner. As they were leaving, his mother pulled him aside and told him to ""keep her safe,"" knowing the two spent most of their free time at demonstrations.
Tony's mother just wanted her son to have a stable job and live a peaceful life. But Tony and Wing don't think they can plan for a future right now. They feel it's almost certain that one of them, or perhaps both, will be arrested or injured in the months to come.
""It's like we have no future now,"" Tony said. ""Going out to protest these days feels like giving the police a chance to arrest us.""
Wing puts it down to pure luck that they haven't been hurt or arrested yet.
""Even if I was injured, though, I'd still go out, because if we don't speak up now, it will be harder for us to speak up in the future,"" she said. ""Other people will need to bear the consequences if we don't go protest now.""
On New Year's Eve, Wing and Tony left their gas masks at home and climbed up the winding concrete steps of Garden Hill in the heart of Sham Shui Po, a blue-collar neighborhood in Hong Kong's Kowloon Peninsula.
By midnight, a small crowd had gathered at the top of the hill.
""10, 9, 8,"" the crowd began to chant.
""7, 6, 5, 4 …"" they all counted down in unison.
At the stroke of midnight, Wing yelled out a slogan that she had spent the past six months screaming at rallies.
""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Time!""
Tony stayed quiet.
""I felt odd joining her,"" he said, not quite knowing why.
Below them, thousands of apartment windows glowed yellow and white like distant constellations. Tony put his arm around Wing, who nuzzled his neck.
Asked later what he would do if Wing was arrested, Tony paused for a moment.
""I will wait for her,"" he said. Riot charges can carry a 10-year prison sentence.
""Really?"" Wing asked.
""Yes.""
""But what if I lost an eye, an arm, or a leg?"" she said, defusing the poignant moment with gallows humor.
""If she got arrested, I'd blame myself for not being able to protect her,"" he said. ""It's pretty sad that I found my first love during the protests.""

Tony took Wing's hand. It was a rare day away from the front lines. They planned to spend it wandering around a shopping mall, like they used to with friends before the protests began. Wing wanted to see the new ""Frozen"" movie. Their heads close together, they laughed at a private joke and walked away, two teenagers in love.

LIMA (Reuters) - As Peruvian authorities detained opposition leader Keiko Fujimori on Tuesday night for a new 15-month jail term, the politician published a pre-recorded video alleging ""persecution"" and vowing to ""end her silence"" on the case. 
A judge on Tuesday afternoon ordered her detention as prosecutors continue an investigation for alleged money laundering. She had already spent 13 months in jail, but Peru's top constitutional court ordered her release in November. Prosecutors appealed that decision.
In the video, which was published on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and appeared to have been recorded earlier on Tuesday, Fujimori said she would ""give a political response to this political persecution."" 
Her message is a significant shift in strategy. In November, Fujimori said she would lie low and dedicate herself to her family, but is now vowing to aggressively defend herself politically and publicly. 
""This isn't justice,"" Fujimori said, before describing a forceful defense. ""As woman, as wife, as mother, I am going to bring out all the strength that I have."" 
She said her husband would seek support from foreign governments and organizations to support her release. 
Fujimori, the daughter of imprisoned former President Alberto Fujimori, has not been officially charged. Prosecutors allege she took money from embattled Brazilian firm Odebrecht [ODBES.UL] to finance a presidential campaign while pretending it came from other sources. 
Odebrecht has admitted to bribing scores of politicians throughout Latin America, and three of Peru's former presidents have received jail orders for their ties to the company. Fujimori and her allies allege this crackdown amounts to a criminalization of politics, while others say Peru is finally cleaning up its act on combating systemic corruption. 
Either way, prosecutors have aggressively gone after top politicians but in most cases have not filed formal charges. 
Judge Victor Zuñiga said in his decision that allowing Fujimori to remain free or to hold her on house arrest, two options that were on the table, ""would not guarantee ... that the defendant will not interrupt the evolution of the investigations.""
Prosecutors had asked for a slightly longer 18-month term. Fujimori's defense said they would appeal. 
Fujimori arrived at Zuñiga's courtroom in Lima's downtown shortly before the judge finished reading his decision, which took over eight hours. A few dozen supporters were outside chanting in support. 

Key evidence against Fujimori includes the testimony of an Odebrecht executive who told prosecutors that the company helped finance her presidential campaign in 2011, when she was the runner-up.

126,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 04:49PM ET</span>","Trump leaps into Middle East fray with plan that favors Israel, upsets Palestinians","By Steve Holland and Dan Williams (NYSE:WMB)
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday proposed creating a Palestinian state as part of a Middle East peace solution, drawing Palestinian condemnation for imposing strict conditions and for agreeing to let Israel maintain control of long-contested West Bank settlements.
Trump announced his plan for Israeli-Palestinian peace at a White House event with embattled Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu standing at his side. It includes what Trump called a four-year freeze by Israel on new settlement activity.
Although Trump's stated aim was to end decades of conflict, the plan he advanced favored Israel, underscored by the absence of Palestinians from Trump's announcement.
It seemed unlikely to immediately advance Israeli-Palestinian talks that broke down in 2014, but the plan was called ""an important starting point for a return to negotiations"" by the United Arab Emirates. Egypt also offered an encouraging statement.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, however, mocked what Trump has called the ""deal of the century,"" describing it as the ""slap of the century.""
Palestinians have refused to deal with the Trump administration in protest at pro-Israel policies such as moving the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the eastern part of which is sought by the Palestinians. 
Trump set in motion a four-year timeline for Palestinians to agree to a security arrangement with Israel, halt attacks by the Islamist militant group Hamas and set up governing institutions in order to establish a Palestinian state with its capital in Abu Dis, a part of east Jerusalem.
This too poses a potential problem for Palestinians. 
Abu Dis lies a mile east of Jerusalem's walled Old City, home to Jewish, Christian and Muslim holy sites. Palestinians living in Abu Dis are cut off by a high concrete Israeli security wall and checkpoints.
The site is unlikely to satisfy Palestinian leaders who want a more central location. Trump's plan says this barrier should serve as a border between the capitals of the two states, adding that Jerusalem should remain Israel's undivided, sovereign capital.
""My vision presents a win-win opportunity for both sides, a realistic two-state solution that resolves the risk of Palestinian statehood to Israel's security,"" Trump said.
'SLAP OF THE CENTURY'
Abbas, speaking to reporters in the West Bank city of Ramallah, called the plan the ""slap of the century.""
""Jerusalem is not for sale, our rights are not for sale and are not for bargain and your deal, the conspiracy will not pass,” Abbas said.
Before the Trump announcement, thousands of Palestinians demonstrated in Gaza City and Israeli troops reinforced positions near a flashpoint site between the Palestinian city of Ramallah and the Jewish settlement of Beit El in the West Bank.
Critics say both Trump and Netanyahu have been intent on diverting attention away from domestic troubles. Trump is going through an impeachment trial while Netanyahu was formally indicted in court on corruption charges on Tuesday. Both men deny any wrongdoing. 
Netanyahu also faces a difficult election in March - his third in less than a year. He is locked in a battle with Blue and White Party chief Benny Gantz, who also expressed support for the Trump plan.
Netanyahu said that the Trump plan offers Palestinians a pathway to a future state but that it may take them ""a very long time to get to the beginning of that path.""
""If they agree to abide by all the conditions you have put forward in your plan, Israel will be there. Israel will be prepared to negotiate peace right away,"" he said.
Trump said he had sent a letter to Abbas asking him to study the deal.
""I explained to him that the territory allocated for his new state will remain open and undeveloped for a period of four years. During this time, Palestinians can use all appropriate deliberation to study the deal, negotiate with Israel, achieve the criteria for statehood and become a truly independent and wonderful state,"" he said.
Under Trump's proposed Middle East peace plan, the United States will recognize Israeli settlements on the occupied West Bank.
The White House document said Israel agreed to a four-year ""land freeze"" to secure the possibility of a two-state solution. But a senior Israeli official later played down the notion of a settlement freeze in the West Bank.
U.S. senior administration officials said they expected initial Palestinian skepticism over the plan but hoped that over time they will agree to negotiate. It places high hurdles for the Palestinians to overcome to reach their long-sought goal of a state.
""Strip away the domestic and Israeli political considerations that determined the timing of the plan’s release, and the message to the Palestinians, boiled down to its essence, is: You’ve lost, get over it,"" said Robert Malley, president of International Crisis Group and a former U.S. National Security Council official.
The U.S. plan represented the most detailed attempt to break the deadlock between Israel and the Palestinians in several years, the result of a three-year effort by Trump senior advisers including Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner.
Trump has endorsed a proposed map outlining the two states, U.S. officials said. The Palestinian state would be double the size of land that Palestinians currently control and would be connected by roads, bridges and tunnels, they said. 
Israel will also take steps to ensure Muslim access to al-Aqsa mosque in Jerusalem and respect Jordan's role regarding holy sites, the U.S. officials said.

Trump's plan calls for Palestinian refugees to settle in a future Palestinian state and creates a ""generous compensation fund"" for them, one of the officials said.

The bloodshed was some of the worst since armed groups agreed a peace deal last February. That was meant to bring stability to a country rocked by violence since 2013, when mainly Muslim rebels in the Seleka alliance ousted the then president, prompting reprisals from mostly Christian militia.
The clashes broke out on Saturday in the eastern town of Bria between different ethnic factions of the ex-Seleka armed group FPRC, according to the United Nation's peacekeeping mission known as MINUSCA.
Thirty-eight were killed based on a body count at the local hospital, but the death toll could be closer to 50, said regional prefect Evariste Binguinendji.
""Parents have already started burying their dead, so it's difficult to get an accurate figure,"" Binguinendji told Reuters by phone.
The president of the CAR Red Cross, Antoine Mbao Bogo, said 41 had been killed in the clashes.
The situation in Bria has been calm since around midday on Sunday, when MINUSCA peacekeepers were deployed in the town, said mission spokesman Vladimir Monteiro.
The presence of rival factions in Bria, a diamond-mining hub, made the town a regular flashpoint for violence before the latest peace deal was agreed.
Commenting on the FPRC infighting, FPRC spokesman Aboubacar Ali Sidik said there had been no split. ""There are problems, as there are in all families. We always end up finding a solution.
Thousands of people have died because of the unrest in the diamond and gold-producing country, and a fifth of the 4.5 million population have fled their homes.
The government and rebels expressed optimism when the peace accord was signed last year, but lasting peace is not guaranteed: similar agreements in 2014, 2015 and 2017 all broke down."

International Organization for Migration (IOM) launched a program on Tuesday to help tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants settle for the long-term in Brazil.
USAID officials said the agency will provide $4 million to fund the program that will facilitate access to employment, business training and language courses to aid the economic and social integration of Venezuelan émigrés.
Almost 900,000 Venezuelans fleeing the political and economic crisis in their country have crossed the border into Brazil since 2018, according to Brazilian authorities. 
Most have continued to other countries, especially in Spanish-speaking Latin America, but 264,000 Venezuelans have applied to stay in Brazil, overwhelming social services in the Brazilian border state of Roraima.
The IOM program backed by USAID will help Brazil's strategy carried out by the country's Army and Air Force to move Venezuelan immigrants out of Roraima to cities further south where there are more opportunities for sustainable work and a new life. 
The program, called Economic Integration of Vulnerable Nationals from Venezuela in Brazil, was launched by USAID Deputy Administrator for Latin America John Barsa and the U.S. State Department's deputy assistant secretary for Western Hemisphere Affairs, Carrie Filipetti.
USAID said it has already provided nearly $15 million to date to support Venezuelans in Brazil. 
Since fiscal-year 2017, the U.S. government has provided more than $656 million in humanitarian and development funding to help Venezuelans affected by their country's ongoing crisis, both inside Venezuela and in 16 neighboring countries.

The drone was shot down just east of Misrata, a key source of military power for forces aligned with the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), those forces said on their social media pages.
They posted pictures of the charred wreckage of an aircraft and a largely intact wing being carried away on a pick-up truck, identifying it as a drone supplied by the United Arab Emirates.
The UAE has been supporting east Libya-based forces led by Khalifa Haftar, supplying them with Chinese-made Wing Loong drones that long gave them an aerial advantage over less powerful Turkish drones used by their rivals, according to U.N. experts, diplomats and analysts.
Many more of the Turkish drones have been destroyed or shot down than the Chinese drones.
However, Turkey has recently been sending reinforcements to the GNA, which include air defense systems as well as military advisors, analysts say.
Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) has been waging a offensive to take control of Tripoli since April, the latest escalation of a conflict between rival camps based in Tripoli and east Libya since 2014.
The LNA said the downed drone was Turkish, but a weapons specialist with wide experience in the region confirmed the drone was a Wing Loong. UAE authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.N. mission to Libya said on Saturday that weapons had been pouring into Libya despite a pledge by international powers to respect an arms embargo that has been routinely breached. 
In the eastern city of Benghazi on Tuesday, several hundred people attended a rally to celebrate the capture of what the LNA said was a Turkish armored vehicle seized from their rivals. 
In Tripoli, three children were killed and one was seriously wounded after a shell fell on a residential area in the Hadba al-Badri district, a spokesman for the Red Crescent said.
U.N. children's agency UNICEF said this month that the war in Tripoli had shut more than 200 schools, depriving more than 115,000 children of schooling. 
The fighting has forced more than 150,000 people, 90,000 of whom are children, to flee their homes, according to U.N. estimates.

The weekend attack followed less than a week after militants killed 36 civilians in a neighboring province, part of a surge in violence in the West African country that has killed hundreds, forced more than half a million from their homes and made much of the north ungovernable over the past two years.
The government did not provide further details on the latest attack in the village of Silgadji, describing it in a statement on Tuesday as ""cowardly and barbaric"".
It was not immediately clear who was responsible.
Islamist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have carried out increasingly brazen raids against civilian and military targets in Burkina Faso in recent months, including an attack on a mining convoy in November that killed nearly 40 people.
The rising insecurity has forced people from their homes. The number of displaced increased tenfold in 2019 to more than 560,000 people, making it the world's fastest-growing displacement crisis, according to the Norwegian Refugee Council.
The flight of refugees into other parts of the country is straining local resources and leaving authorities struggling to cope.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland is willing to consider a compromise with the European Union on its selection of judges under certain conditions, its justice minister said on Tuesday after talks with a senior EU official on rule of law concerns.
""I declared readiness to convince my colleagues from the ruling camp to consider coming up with a new model for choosing judges,"" Zbigniew Ziobro told journalists after meeting EU Values and Transparency Commissioner Vera Jourova in Warsaw.
Jourova, however, said she did not gather from the meeting that any compromise had been proposed, adding that the discussion focused on differences in position and these were very clear. 
She added the door to a dialogue between Poland and the EU on judicial reform was open and the EU hoped to find a long-term solution to tensions between Warsaw and Brussels.
Since coming to power in 2015, Poland's eurosceptic, nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has introduced a series of judicial reforms which EU officials and democracy activists say may breach the bloc's standards on rule of law.
Last week, Poland's Supreme Court said rulings made by judges appointed under new government rules could be challenged, resulting in a number of cases being postponed. 
On the same day, parliament passed a law that critics say aims to muzzle judges. The European Commission has asked the EU's highest court to freeze the new law, which allows for disciplining judges critical of government changes to the judiciary.
The European Commission said last week it was ""very concerned"" about the situation - a message it has repeated since the law was proposed late last year.
The threat for Poland is that Brussels may limit funding for countries that infringe the rule of law, said Polish Senate speaker and opposition politician Tomasz Grodzki, who was one of the first officials to meet Jourova on Tuesday.
""(I want) to have a message back for (European Commission President) Ursula von der Leyen...that the door for the dialogue with Poland is open,"" Jourova told journalists in Warsaw.
The PiS government has asked Poland's constitutional court to examine whether the Supreme Court, the top judicial body, has the right to rule on the legitimacy of judges appointed under its reforms. 

The European Commission said last week that the independence and legitimacy of the constitutional court had been seriously undermined by PiS reforms.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - As Nigel Farage packed a few belongings into a box at his office in the European Union's parliament in Brussels on Tuesday, he reflected that he will miss the very institution on which - as its bluntest critic - he built his political career.
""I'll miss some of the fun, some of the theater,"" the Brexit Party leader told Reuters in an interview. ""I'll miss being the pantomime villain, which I've been many times. This has been a massive chapter of my life.""
What Farage doesn't regret, though, is spearheading a campaign that led to Britain's exit from the EU, which will happen quietly at midnight in Brussels on Friday but with great fanfare in London's Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) at a party he promised would bring together more than 30,000 people.
Farage and 72 other Britons will attend their last plenary session of the 751-seat European Parliament this week.
On Friday morning, a group of Brexit Party lawmakers will march out of the modernist assembly building with a Union Jack to mark the end of Britain's 47 years as a member of the EU.
Britain's vote to leave the EU in 2016 was a triumph for Farage, a former commodities trader who become an abrasive anti-immigration politician, tapping into a deep well of popular anger in Britain that rivals failed to understand.
A colorful character who is often pictured holding a pint of beer, 55-year-old Farage's acerbic euroscepticism was the bane of committed Europeans in Brussels.
He recalled with a laugh on Tuesday how once he told then-European Council President Herman Van Rompuy to his face that he had ""the charisma of a damp rag"" and the ""appearance of a low-grade bank clerk"".
He said that, although he has sought to disrupt the EU from within over the past two decades, the European Parliament would be a duller place without him and lawmakers from the 27 other EU countries may miss the publicity he brought for their assembly.
Farage also boasted that his Brexit Party had helped Boris Johnson become Britain's prime minister last year, and since then the Conservative Party leader had adopted policies and rhetoric that he had used for 25 years.
After Friday, Britain will enter an 11-month transition period during which it faces tough negotiations with the EU on everything from trade regulations to fishing rights to establish a future relationship.
""In this negotiation, we've got a much stronger hand than they have,"" he said. ""We've got Germany petrified of us becoming a competitor on their doorstep.""
Farage said that however the haggling between London and Brussels turns out, there will be no going back on Brexit, a course of action that for Britain's place in the world marked the biggest change since Henry VIII left the Church of Rome 500 years ago.
""And I say that not even tongue in cheek,"" he added."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish nationalists Sinn Fein will withhold support for the government after a Feb. 8 election without a commitment to immediately start planning for a referendum on the unification of Ireland, its leader said on Tuesday.
The governing Fine Gael and main opposition Fianna Fail, the favorites to lead the next government, both refuse to govern with Sinn Fein, the former political arm of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) that fought British rule of Northern Ireland before a 1998 peace deal.
However opinion polls suggest Sinn Fein is set to strengthen its position as the third largest party and close the gap on the two bigger ones. Sinn Fein says it is willing to form a coalition with either party and that it offers the only viable alternative to another minority government.
Under the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that mostly ended three decades of violence between Catholic nationalists seeking union with Ireland and Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom, Britain's minister for the region can call a referendum if it appears likely it would pass.
A vote would also be required in the Irish Republic. In its election manifesto, Sinn Fein said it wanted to establish a parliamentary committee and citizens assembly to plan for Irish unity and seek to secure a referendum within five years.
""Of course for us that is a core issue, I cannot see a situation in which Sinn Fein would be in government without that work being undertaken,"" Sinn Fein President Mary Lou McDonald told a news conference on Tuesday.
""Let's be clear about it - the calling of such a referendum in the real politik will be made at 10 Downing Street and that call, I believe, will only be made when Dublin is proactively planning for unification and looking for that referendum.""
While a Northern Ireland withdrawal from the United Kingdom remains a distant prospect according to opinion polls, Britain's exit from the EU has increased calls for unity given that the province voted 56%-44% to remain in Europe in the 2016 Brexit referendum.
Both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have said they would ultimately like to see the unification of the island, which was partitioned almost a century ago, but now is not the time.
Fianna Fail has pledged to start preparations on how Dublin should approach a possible unification vote but not the kind of detailed preparations proposed by Sinn Fein, whom Fianna Fail say are exploiting the issue for short-term gain."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Historians in Germany have released previously unseen photos of the Nazi Sobibor death camp, including what they believe are images of John Demjanjuk, who was sentenced in 2011 for his role in the killing of about 28,000 people there.
Ukraine-born Demjanjuk, who had been No. 1 on the Simon Wiesenthal Center's list of ""Most Wanted Nazi War Criminals"", was deported to Germany from the United States in 2009, where he had spent much of his life as a car worker, to face trial.
The photos, described by historian Martin Cueppers as a representing a ""quantum leap in the visual record on the Holocaust in occupied Poland"", had belonged to Johann Niemann, once deputy commandant of Sobibor. 
Between March 1942 and November 1943, some 1.8 million Jews were murdered as part of a Nazi scheme called ""Aktion Reinhard"", mostly at the extermination camps Belzec, Sobibor and Treblinka. 
Few photos of Sobibor, which was razed before the end of World War Two, have survived so the pictures offer new insight into how the camp worked and into the individuals involved.
""It was a breathtaking experience for me to see these pictures of Sobibor,"" said Jetje Manheim, 72, from the Netherlands whose grandparents were murdered at the camp where Jews were killed with exhaust fumes in gas chambers. 
""For the first time I saw what my grandparents glimpsed at the end of their exhausting 72-hour train journey. On that day, their lives ended,"" she said at the presentation, at a museum on the site of the former SS and Gestapo headquarters in Berlin. 
The newly discovered photos, made available by Niemann's descendants, have helped keep alive the memory of her relatives.
Some pictures showed Niemann himself, including one of him posing on a horse on the ramp where deportation trains arrived.
Others are of Trawnikis, non-Germans enlisted to work at the camp, often as guards. Two prints probably show Demjanjuk who was transported to Sobibor in March 1943, said Cueppers.
The historians approached police to help them identify Demjanjuk. ""The conclusion that it is probably John Demjanjuk was a combination of the most modern police methods and historic research,"" said Cueppers. 
Demjanjuk's son said the photos proved nothing about his father. In a statement emailed to Reuters, he said it was ridiculous to draw conclusions from blurry photos showing many similar faces.
""The photos are certainly not proof of my father being in Sobibor and may even exculpate him once forensically examined,"" John Demjanjuk Junior said.
Demjanjuk was found guilty of being an accessory to the murder of about 28,000 Jews at Sobibor although he denied he was there. 
He died in 2012 but the landmark verdict in Germany opened the way to more trials as it allowed a conviction on the grounds that presence in a camp alone was sufficient evidence of guilt. 
Sobibor was razed after a prisoner uprising in October 1943 in which Niemann was killed. 

The collection has been handed over to the archives of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations raised ""serious concerns"" on Tuesday about the trials of hundreds of alleged Islamic State members in Iraq, some of whom merely prepared meals, offered medical services or even acted as human shields for the jihadist group.
Iraq has processed thousands of cases under its anti-terrorism law - including of detainees from outside the Middle East transferred from neighboring Syria - in the aftermath of a 2014-17 war against Islamic State militants.
The joint report by the United Nations Human Rights Office in Iraq (UNAMI) and the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) covers 794 trials carried out between May 1, 2018 and Oct. 31, 2019, OHCHR spokesman Jeremy Laurence told a news briefing in Geneva.
""(The report) raises serious concerns about unfair trials placing defendants at a serious disadvantage,"" he said, adding that 28 of the cases in the U.N. report involved foreign defendants from 11 different countries.
These were from: France, Iran, Egypt, Belgium, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, Syria, Armenia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
In some cases, the individuals had provided basic support services, such as selling vegetables or preparing meals for members of the ultra-hardline jihadist group, the report said.
One young man, a 14-year-old at the time, was sentenced by the Karkh juvenile court in Baghdad to 15 years in prison for admitting that he acted as a human shield, along with other family members, to protect fighters from an air strike, it said.
In another case, the defendant, who was a pharmacist, was given a life sentence in Mosul for providing wounded Islamic State members with medical services.
""Prosecutions under the anti-terrorism legal framework... focused on 'membership' of a terrorist organization without sufficiently distinguishing between those who participated in serious crimes and those who joined ISIL (Islamic State) out of perceived necessities of survival or under coercion,"" the report said.
In 109 of the cases studied by the United Nations, death sentences were handed down, Laurence said. In one of those cases, the defense lawyer was appointed on the day of the trial, had not met his client beforehand and stayed silent throughout.
Defendants or defense lawyers alleged torture or ill-treatment during interrogation in 260 hearings, the report said, including of women and children. The report said that judges did not generally question confessions that appeared to have been obtained in this way.
The U.N. agencies could not independently verify those allegations, but said they had been receiving ""credible reports"" of torture and ill-treatment by authorities for years.

The embassy, a Cold War legacy of North Korea's diplomatic relations with Communist East Germany, has continued to operate since German reunification in 1990, with one of its buildings turned into a low-cost hostel popular with backpackers.
The hostel's operators lease the premises from the embassy for 38,000 euros ($42,157.20) per month under a contract agreed in 2016, the Berlin administrative court said, but it ruled this breached U.N. sanctions and a European Union directive.
The United Nations explicitly banned such leasing arrangements by North Korean embassies worldwide as part of U.N. Security Council Resolution 2321, passed in November 2016 after Pyongyang's fifth nuclear test.
In November 2018, Berlin city authorities prohibited the operator from using the property, citing an EU directive implementing the U.N. sanctions.
Appealing against that decision, the unnamed operator argued that the city authorities did not have the competency to order the hostel be closed and said it stopped paying rent to the embassy in April 2017, the Berlin court said.
But the court upheld the Berlin city authorities' decision, arguing: ""Since the prohibition based on U.N. sanctions law is mandatory, the discretion of the authorities was reduced to zero and only allows for the decision taken.""

Unidentified gunmen in four vehicles tore through the camp late on Sunday and set the protesters' tents on fire, police and medical sources said. The incident came a day after security forces had made a violent nationwide attempt to close down such settlements.
The protesters said they now intended to make their camp more permanent and on Tuesday they began to clear the ruins and build new huts out of bricks and mortar that would provide better protection.
""After they burned our tents, we started building with bricks. And if they destroy the brick-built camp, we will use the bricks of our houses, I swear by God. We do all that for the sake of our motherland, Iraq,"" said one protester, who declined to give his name.
Mass protests against corruption, economic decline and foreign political interference have rocked Iraq since October.
Nearly 500 people have been killed while demonstrating against the largely Iranian-backed ruling elite. After a lull this month, protests resumed in Baghdad and other cities, including Nassiriya, Basra and Najaf.
Nassiriya has been a major flashpoint with frequent violent clashes between protesters and security forces.
As they began to put their protest camp back together, volunteers turned al-Haboubi square in central Nassiriya into a construction site. A giant billboard overlooking the scene reads: ""The fearful do not create freedom"".
""We will build with bricks, and if they destroy bricks, we will build with concrete. Iraqis won't step back until they regain all rights,"" another protester said."

The decision came after Cyprus came on board, as any EU move on sanctions requires unanimity. Nicosia had stalled the process in recent weeks, diplomats said, trying to push the bloc toward separate sanctions against Turkey for hydrocarbons drilling in eastern Mediterranean.
The EU has maintained sanctions against Russia since Moscow seized and annexed the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. They include a blacklist of firms and individuals associated with Russia's administration of Crimea.
The seven people added to the blacklist on Tuesday include Yuri Gotsanyuk, named prime minister of Crimea's pro-Russian regional government after the 2019 election.
Tuesday's move raises the number of individuals on the blacklist to 177, along with 44 firms or other entities. Blacklisted people and firms have their assets in the EU frozen and individuals are barred from travel there.
The bloc's main economic sanctions targeting Russia's energy, financial and arms industries are currently in place until the end of July, while a ban on doing business with Crimea holds until the end of June."

Assad's campaign to regain Idlib province, the last rebel bastion in a nearly nine-year-long civil war, has sparked a new exodus of thousands of civilians toward the border of Turkey, which backs some insurgent groups fighting Assad.
Syrian state broadcaster al-Ikhbariya said government forces entered Maarat al-Numan, 33 km (20 miles) south of Idlib city, on Tuesday and were combing its districts while advancing further into the town. The state news agency SANA said later the army had ""liberated most of the town's districts"".
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said via WhatsApp that government forces ""took full control"" of Maarat al-Numan, the second largest town in Idlib province, after entering it backed by Russian air strikes.
The renewed fighting comes despite a Jan. 12 ceasefire deal between Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides of the conflict. Turkey already hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees and fears millions more could soon cross the frontier.
Maarat al-Numan is located on the main highway in Idlib linking the capital Damascus with Aleppo in northern Syria.
Turkey's Defence Ministry said Turkish forces would retaliate ""in the strongest way, without hesitation"" against any attack on its observation posts in Idlib province by Assad's forces.

Manzoor Pashteen, leader of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM), which has campaigned against military excesses during anti-terrorism operations, was arrested on Monday in the northwestern city of Peshawar.
On Tuesday, hundreds of the group's supporters, joined by other rights activities and some politicians, rallied in several cities. Two members of parliament belonging to the PTM were picked up by law enforcement officials at the Islamabad demonstration.
""Today they came and disrupted our peaceful protest held to demand the release of PTM leader Manzoor Pashteen, and arrested Mohsin Dawar and Ali Wazir along with other activists,"" Afrasiab Khattak, a veteran politician and a former member of parliament, told Reuters.
The PTM's criticism of the powerful military has brought it into conflict with Pakistani authorities, who accuse it of being bankrolled by hostile neighbors Afghanistan and India.
PTM denies that allegation. The military and the government deny PTM's allegations of human rights abuses.
Dawar and Wazir had earlier spent close to four months in jail under anti-terrorism laws before being released on bail.
Demonstrations were also held in other cities in Pakistan, including Pashteen's home district of Tank, located close to Pakistan’s restive tribal areas, the focal point of a decade-long insurgency by Islamist militants and anti-terrorism operations by the Pakistani military, which has displaced millions of people.
Demonstrations in solidarity with Pashteen were also held in cities across the border in Afghanistan, whose president, Ashraf Ghani had earlier criticized his arrest. Many of PTM supporters are ethnic Pashtuns originally hailing from the borderlands with Afghanistan."

NICE, France (Reuters) - Most weekdays, 64-year-old Joelle Svetchine steps out of her French Riviera apartment, checks the sun is shining and the sea calm, and decides whether to go rowing.
""It clears your head being out on the water,"" the pensioner told Reuters as she sculled across a bay near Nice under a blue sky. ""I'm lucky to have free time and to be in good health, to have this freedom and no longer worry about work.""
The former physiotherapist says she can lead an active life because she retired at the age of 61 and 1/2, benefiting from a pension system that allows many French workers to stop working years before their peers in other parts of Europe.
That system though is now under threat from a reform of the pension system being driven through by President Emmanuel Macron. His reform has provoked weeks of protests and strikes.
France has one of the earliest retirement ages among industrialized nations and its pensioners enjoy the third highest income level on a purchasing power basis of all European Union citizens, behind only those in Luxembourg and Austria.
Macron, a former investment banker, is pressing ahead with creating a universal pension system from a mishmash of schemes, each with their own benefits. He says it will be fairer. Trade unions say it will mean workers affected could have to work longer to get the same pension.
Macron has for now pulled back on another plank of his reform, raising the retirement age by two years to 64, but that could be a temporary retreat as the government says the system is underfunded.
Svetchine began working in the private sector before switching to public hospitals. She said she frequently saw workplace injuries the likes of which unions cite as justification for rail workers, dockers and others retiring up to a decade earlier than typical workers.
""In all jobs, the body gets worn down. I know that in foreign countries, like Germany, people work longer. But in what state?"" Svetchine said.
Macron has said a single, points-based system which gives every worker the same rights for every euro contributed will be fairer, in particular for women.
That aspect of the reform, at least, resonates with Svetchine, who failed to reach her full pension by the legal retirement age after having taken two years maternity leave and later working part-time.
But she expressed support for the anti-reform strikes and protests.
Longer life expectancies meant that the early 50s was perhaps too early to retire nowadays, but a one-size-fits-all system that did not factor in a job's physical and mental demands would be unjust, said Svetchine.
""After all, to enjoy retirement, you need to be in good shape,"" she said."

ROME (Reuters) - A charity ship carrying hundreds of people rescued in the Mediterranean said on Tuesday it had received permission to dock in Italy as European governments tried to agree where the migrants should go.
The relocation of rescued migrants is a contentious issue for the European Union, with the influx of newcomers fuelling the rise of anti-immigrant parties in states including Italy.
An Italian interior ministry source said Germany and France would take in some of the 403 migrants aboard the Ocean Viking ship, run by the French NGO SOS Méditerranée, with Ireland and Luxembourg also expected to offer help.
SOS Méditerranée said it had been told to take those rescued, including 38 women and 149 minors, to Taranto in the heel of Italy.
Two more rescue ships carrying some 230 people were also waiting to be assigned a safe port either in Italy or Malta.
Matteo Salvini, the head of Italy's rightist League party, condemned the decision to let the Ocean Viking come to Italy.
""The number of (migrant) arrivals has risen 500% in January 2020. Madness!!!"" he wrote on Twitter. ""Those who are allowing this to happen are accomplices.""
Italy's interior ministry says some 870 boat migrants have come to the country this month, after 155 in the same period last year. This does not include those on the Ocean Viking.
Migrants departures from Libya have jumped in recent days following fighting there.
In September, interior ministers from five EU countries agreed a new scheme to distribute rescued migrants to try to relieve pressure on southern states including Italy.
Italian Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese has established better relations with European partners and charity organizations than her predecessor, Salvini.
Interior ministry data published last December said other EU countries were offering to take some 80% of migrants who qualified for relocation."
146,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>","For Burundi gravedigger, bodies and memories resurface as mass grave exhumed","NAIROBI (Reuters) - What seems like a lifetime ago, Barampama Maximilien shoveled dirt over rows of bodies at gunpoint, sweating in fear that he would be next. This week the skeletons - and his memories - emerged from Burundi's red earth.
The mass grave, which authorities exhumed on Monday, was one of more than 4,000 they said this month they had identified - a stark reminder of the east African country's brutal history of ethnic conflict.
The pit that Maximilien helped dig contains more than 300 bodies, locals say, and dates back to the aftermath of an attempted coup in April 1972, when he was 21 and in nearby Gitega prison for petty theft.
Others were brought there and accused of aiding the rebels. Many of the new arrivals were Hutus, Maximilien said. 
Burundi has the same mix of population from that ethnic group and the Tutsis as neighboring Rwanda, where 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were estimated to have died in a 1994 genocide. Both countries have bloodsoaked histories dating back to colonial days. 
""Those who brought to Gitega prison's compound were badly beaten. Some had their hands or arms broken. The perpetrators were accusing them of helping rebels,"" he said. 
Graves were sometimes dug by machine, and sometimes he and other prisoners were forced to do it, he said. The military then took suspected rebels there by truck.
""Those still alive were ordered to walk to the grave, lie down and then six soldiers lined up and shot them dead,"" he said, imitating the sound of guns. 
""Soldiers warned us against talking about it. I was deeply afraid I could be the next to be killed, particularly when I noticed some friends were missing.""
When one group of prisoners rioted and tried to escape, soldiers fired into the jail until blood flowed form under the doors, he said.
It is unclear whether the Truth and Reconciliation Commission responsible for opening the graves will hold anyone to account for the killings. 
It is mandated to investigate abuses dating from the 19th century, when Burundi was colonized by Germany, up to 2008. That is three years after President Pierre Nkurunziza took office. U.N. authorities have accused his security forces of overseeing the torture, murder and gang rape of opponents. 
Its chairman, Pierre Claver Ndayicariye, said in a speech that Burundians should ""pray God so that what happened, never happens again"". He declined to comment on whether anyone would be held accountable. 
For one man, just opening the grave is action enough. As the diggers' shovels rose and fell, he craned forwards as if to recognize the face of the elder brother he never knew among the dusty skeletons.

""I am happy if I see the remains of my brother ... before I die,"" he said, as another brother choked back tears and ducked back into the crowd. ""I know his bones are here.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Indian police on Tuesday arrested a university student who has been involved in organizing protests against a contentious citizenship law after he made comments that the ruling Hindu nationalist party said were seditious.
Sharjeel Imam shot to national prominence when he helped to organize a mass sit-in in New Delhi, one of many rallies staged over more than a month against a new citizenship law that the protesters say discriminates against Muslims.
The 31-year-old history student further angered nationalists in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with what they said was a seditious call for the restive northeastern region of Assam to be ""cut"" from the rest of the country.
Last week, Sambit Patra, a BJP spokesman, described Imam's comment as a call for ""open jihad"". The BJP has sought to depict him as a dangerous rebel in national media and in party rallies ahead of a state election in New Delhi on Feb. 8.
Speaking to Reuters shortly before he was arrested in the eastern state of Bihar, Imam, a Muslim, said he had only called for railway and road links to Assam to be disrupted as part of the ongoing campaign of protests against the citizenship law.
Imam also said the BJP was trying to vilify him in order to discredit the largely leaderless protest movement ahead of the Delhi state election.
""They want to discredit educated Muslims who speak up,"" said Imam, a student at Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University, known for its leftist activism and opposition to the BJP government.
Police officer Rajesh Deo said Imam had been found after a three-day search in Bihar and would be moved to Delhi to face charges of sedition.
In a statement, Imam's lawyers said he was fully cooperating with the investigation.
The citizenship law aims to fast-track Indian citizenship for non-Muslim minorities from three neighboring countries.
Many Indians say the law is discriminatory against the country's large Muslim minority and violates the country's secular constitution."

CASTLEBAR, Ireland (Reuters) - Fianna Fail's near century-long dominance of Irish politics came to a halt in 2011 after it suffered an unprecedented electoral collapse. Nine years later, the party is on the verge of leading the next government.
Four successive polls have put Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's bitter rivals in the lead since he called a Feb. 8 election, as voters grow disillusioned with his Fine Gael party's management of a rapid recovery from the economic ruins of a decade ago.
Whoever wins will lead Ireland into the next phase of Brexit talks, where any obstacles to future trade could hurt its large exporting sector. Both parties want as close a trading relationship with Britain as possible.
In 2011, after leading Ireland to the brink of bankruptcy, Fianna Fail -- whose leaders negotiated independence from Britain and participated in peace talks in Northern Ireland -- lost a record 58 of its 78 seats.
The difference on the doorsteps then and now could not be starker, according to one of survivors from that day, Fianna Fail Deputy Leader Dara Calleary.
""It was bleak but it was a bleak time for the country,"" the 47-year-old former junior minister told Reuters.
""We just had to get the head down and build, build, build. We rebuilt the organization, got new people involved, especially during that period of 2012, 2013 and 2014. That was crucial.""
Under leader Micheal Martin, who was a senior minister during the humiliating 2010 EU/IMF bailout, the party has sought to win back trust by playing a constructive role from opposition on Brexit and budgeting.
Calleary believes Martin's decision to shun being ""against everything for the sake of being against it"" is key to the recovery that saw Fianna Fail get within six seats of Fine Gael at the last election in 2016.
A co-operation deal whereby it backed the minority government from opposition was a further show of responsibility for still-sceptical voters, while allowing the party to mostly avoid blame for policy mistakes.
QUICK COME BACK
Such a deal may have to be reciprocated this time around to facilitate a Fianna Fail-led minority administration. The most recent opinion poll on Sunday gave them a three-point lead.
""I always felt that they were going to come back, just not so quickly. They have still the record of being one of the most longstanding, effective mainstream parties in Europe and you don't lose that that easily,"" said David Farrell, professor of politics at University College Dublin
""A lot of credit has to be given to Micheal Martin who has rather skillfully weathered an incredible storm. There is no doubt many commentators had written them off.""
The next 10 days will test Martin's belief that his party's association with the bankers and property developers who turned the Celtic Tiger boom to bust has completely faded -- and whether voters trust the architects of that era's economic excesses to fix deficiencies in housing supply and healthcare.
Political heirs to the opposing sides in Ireland's 1920s civil war, the two main parties are both center-right and have similar policies, although Fianna Fail has pitched itself slightly centerwards by promising spending over tax cuts.
It's a pitch the Irish Times described as ""change ... but not too much change"" and one Farrell says will resonate with Ireland's large swathe of middle-ground voters: ""Where do you go, except back to Fianna Fail?""
In Calleary's western constituency of County Mayo, which helped lead the revival four years ago, that line appears to be landing.
""I think the people are ready to trust Fianna Fail after the crisis,"" Jim Fahy, a barman in his early 40s, said outside a local supermarket in the town of Castlebar.
""It's not so much what they have done to deserve another go, but maybe what Fine Gael have done to deserve not being in."""

PISSILA, Burkina Faso (Reuters) - Two years ago, Pissila was a quiet farming town in Burkina Faso, unfamiliar with the violence that was stirring further north. Now an influx of displaced people has changed life dramatically for its 15,000 inhabitants. 
As deadly attacks on civilians by jihadist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have surged, 30,000 people have poured into the town seeking refuge, trebling the population, straining resources and leaving authorities struggling to cope. 
Much of the work of housing the newcomers has been shouldered by ordinary people, such has been the speed of the rise in violence in a once calm country.
The chaos caused by home-grown insurgents has coincided with a spillover of jihadist groups from Mali. Hundreds have died in attacks in Burkina over the past year, many of which have had a ethnic or religious bent, and large areas of the country are out of government control. 
Aid organizations and charities have rushed to help, and tents have been set up for the displaced in Pissila by an aid organization called HELP, but many say it is not enough in a country where nearly one million have fled violence over the past year. 
""Almost all of the families [in Pissila] are hosting at least one displaced family. Some families have taken in around 80 people. So that is putting pressure on their way of life. It changes everything ... for them,"" said Pissila prefect Simplice Traore. 
Lines snake outwards from the town's central water well and from a food distribution center set up by the U.N.'s World Food Program. Residents' houses are crammed with people, many of whom sleep dozens to a small room on thin mats among piles of emergency water or food supplies stacked against the walls. The unlucky ones sleep outside. 
Medical centers are full, said Traore, and the sick and elderly go untended, resting where they can out of the hot sun that sucks moisture from the parched surrounding farmland. There is no room for more children in the school and an estimated 2,000 children do not attend, he said. 
Alphonse Sawadogo made the 15 km journey to Pissila on foot on Jan. 17 after an attack by gunmen on motorbikes forced him to flee his home village.

""It is truly sad,"" said the 52-year-old farmer. ""They killed a youth. They set fire to the school. They arrived in a part of the village where houses were close to each other and started shooting.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain should cut a salary threshold for migrants to 25,600 pounds ($33,650) a year to help fill jobs after Brexit, a government commissioned report said, while warning a planned overhaul of the immigration system could hit economic growth.
With Britain leaving the European Union on Friday, the government is introducing the biggest shake-up of its border controls in decades, ending the priority given to migrants from the bloc over those from other countries.
The proposed changes would make it harder for EU nationals to work in Britain after Brexit while benefiting those outside the bloc by lowering the amount they have to earn.
The Migration Advisory Committee (MAC), an independent body which gives the government advice, recommended lowering the minimum general salary threshold for skilled migrants by 4,400 pounds a year from 30,000 pounds.
""Our recommendations are likely to reduce future growth of the UK population and economy compared to freedom of movement, by using skill and salary thresholds,"" MAC chairman Alan Manning said.
""No perfect system exists and there are unavoidable difficult trade-offs,"" he added in a statement.
The recommendations are intended to help guide Prime Minister Boris Johnson's new immigration policy, which will be implemented from the start of next year.
Johnson's spokesman said the government would carefully consider the report before setting out more details of its new system.
""The government will introduce a firmer and fairer points-based immigration system from 2021 that welcomes talent from around the world while reducing low-skilled migrants and bringing overall numbers down,"" he said.
The MAC was tasked with drawing up new salary thresholds for migrants and devising a points-based immigration system, based on that used in Australia, to be put into place once freedom of movement for EU nationals ends.
If the government wanted to bring in a points-based system, then it should also allow a route for skilled workers who did not have a job offer, the committee said.
There should be different minimum salary requirements for certain highly paid professions, the report said. Teachers and healthcare workers should benefit from lower salary thresholds based on national pay scales, it added.
Manning said the proposals would lead to a very small increase in GDP per capita and productivity, and slightly improved public finances.
But while demands on the state-run health service, schools and housing would slightly ease, there would be increased pressures on social care.
For highly skilled migrants - those described as having exceptional talents such as musicians and scientists - the advisers recommend a more open system, saying the current cap on visas is too restrictive."

Many demonstrators have rejected the government formed last week by the Iran-backed Shi'ite group Hezbollah and its allies without participation of major political parties including the second-largest Christian party, Lebanese Forces (LF).
Demonstrations that began last October against a political elite blamed for steering Lebanon into its worst crisis in decades have turned violent as some protesters clashed with security forces at barricades around parliament and government headquarters in central Beirut to demand an independent cabinet.
""The Fathers stress the right for peaceful demonstrations to demand reform, but strongly reject the mobs on the streets and squares, especially in Beirut, lest the mobilization veers away from its noble goals,"" the Christian religious leaders said in a statement after a summit.
Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai had called the summit which gathered patriarchs of Lebanon's many Christian sects, according to state news agency NNA. The meeting's communique was read out in live broadcasts on local media.
The Christian faith leaders said the government should be given ""room to take on its responsibilities"", and called on Arab states and the international community to support Lebanon.
Lebanon is governed according to a sectarian political system that parcels out state positions according to religious sect. The presidency is reserved for a Maronite Christian.
The largest Christian party, President Michel Aoun's Free Patriotic Movement, is close to Hezbollah and has backed the new government, which has yet to issue a policy statement.
The heavily indebted country's crisis is rooted in decades of state corruption and waste. Foreign donors say any support to Lebanon will depend on it enacting long-delayed reforms.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab said on Tuesday he would not obstruct a state budget drafted by the previous cabinet and approved on Tuesday by parliament in a session boycotted by some parties including the staunchly anti-Hezbollah LF."

A report on the assembly's news site ICANA said a minimum number of MPs had signed a request to parliament's managers to arrange a debate on the motion for Iran to take the far-reaching step of leaving the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said last week that Iran could withdraw from the NPT if European countries refer the country to the U.N. Security Council over the 2015 deal, a move that would overturn diplomacy in Tehran's turbulent relations with Western powers.
Lawmakers in the past have sometimes withdrawn their signatures seeking debates on motions about nuclear and other issues.
To become a law, the proposal would have to be passed by lawmakers in two readings and then ratified by the Guardian Council, a body that is in charge of ensuring bills do not contradict religious laws or Iran’s constitution.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the highest authority in the Islamic Republic, has the final say on all state matters like Tehran's nuclear policy.
The 1968 NPT has been the foundation of global nuclear arms control since the Cold War, including the 2015 deal Iran signed with world powers that offered it access to global trade in return for accepting curbs to its atomic program.
The fate of the 2015 pact has been in doubt since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of it in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the country's economy. 
Iran has responded by gradually scaling back its commitments, although it says these steps are reversible if the European powers can salvage the deal by shielding Iran's economy from U.S. penalties. 
Britain, France and Germany formally accused Iran on Jan. 14 of violating the terms of the agreement to curb its nuclear program, which eventually could lead to the reimposing of U.N. sanctions lifted under the pact.

However, the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell on Friday extended the time available to discuss ways to save the nuclear deal with Iran under the dispute mechanism.

(Reuters) - More than two years after he first proposed a plan to revive the long moribund Israeli-Palestinian peace process, U.S. President Donald Trump is finally set to release details. But there is profound mistrust between the sides and no longer mutual acceptance that the United States is the natural broker of any solution.
WHAT ARE THE KEY ISSUES?
* The status of Jerusalem, including historical sites sacred to Judaism, Islam and Christianity.
* Establishing mutually agreed borders.
* Finding security arrangements to satisfy Israeli fears of attacks by Palestinians and hostile neighbors.
* The Palestinian demand for statehood in territory - the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem - captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
* Finding a solution to the plight of millions of Palestinian refugees.
* Arrangements to share natural resources, such as water.
* Palestinian demands that Israel remove its settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. More than 400,000 Israelis now live among about 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, with another 200,000 settlers in East Jerusalem.
WHY REVIVE THE PEACE PLAN NOW?
Both Trump and Netanyahu would like to divert attention away from their domestic troubles. Trump faces an impeachment trial while Netanyahu was indicted on corruption charges in November. Both deny wrongdoing.
They also both face re-election campaigns – Netanyahu in March and Trump in November. Netanyahu twice tried and failed to secure a majority in the Israeli parliament last year.
Trump has repeatedly delayed the launch of his plan to avoid causing election problems for Netanyahu because of the possibility it will require some concessions from Israel.
He faces his own political clock and could ill-afford to wait for months for Israel to decide its next prime minister, according to a source familiar with the peace team's thinking.
WHAT'S IN THE TRUMP PLAN?
The proposal is dozens of pages long but little has been revealed about its contents.
Palestinian and Arab sources who were briefed on the draft fear it seeks to bribe Palestinians into accepting Israeli occupation, in what could be a prelude to Israel annexing about half of the West Bank including most of the Jordan Valley, the strategic and fertile easternmost strip of the territory.
Palestinians say the Jordan Valley, nearly 30 per cent of the West Bank, would be a vital part of their future state, as the breadbasket of the West Bank and its border with Jordan.
Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, the plan's principal author, launched the first stage in Bahrain in June. It called for a $50 billion investment fund to boost the Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies.
WHAT ARE ITS CHANCES?
The last Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014.
Enduring obstacles include the expansion of Israeli settlements on occupied land and generations of mutual suspicion.The last two decades have also seen the rise to power in Gaza of the armed Islamist movement Hamas, which is formally committed to Israel's destruction and is in the midst of a decades-long power struggle with the Western-backed Palestinian Authority, headed by President Mahmoud Abbas.
The elephant in the room is the two-state solution - the long-standing international formula to bring about peace by creating an independent Palestinian state co-existing side-by-side with Israel.
The United Nations and most nations around the world back this blueprint, the foundation of every peace plan for decades.
The Trump administration has refrained from endorsing it. In November it reversed decades of U.S. policy when Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced Washington no longer regarded Israeli settlements in the West Bank as a breach of international law.
Palestinians and most of the international community view the settlements as illegal under international law. Israel disputes this.
CAN THE UNITED STATES BE AN HONEST BROKER?
Netanyahu, who heads Israel's ruling right-wing coalition, ""gladly"" accepted Trump's invitation to Washington. On the eve of the announcement he said: ""The deal of the century is the opportunity of a century, and we're not going to pass it by.""
His principal domestic rival, the centrist former general Benny Gantz, also visited Washington to discuss the deal with Trump, calling it ""a significant and historic milestone"".
Both are jostling for maximum political advantage ahead of the March 2 election, where Gantz will seek to oust Netanyahu as Israeli prime minister.
But Palestinian Prime Minister President Mohammad Shtayyeh said the Trump administration plan was ""nothing but a plan to finish off the Palestinian cause. We reject it.""
The Palestinian leadership said Washington can no longer be regarded as a mediator after a series of Trump decisions that delighted Israel but infuriated Palestinians.
These included recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and slashing hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.
The cuts were widely seen as a means of pressuring the Palestinian leadership to come back to the negotiating table. So far, that has failed."

SILIVRI (Reuters) - Defense lawyers walked out of a Turkish courtroom on Tuesday in protest against judges in the case of businessman and philanthropist Osman Kavala, who was again remanded as a trial continued over his involvement in 2013 protests.
Kavala has been in custody for more than two years, charged with attempting to overthrow the government by organizing and funding protests against then-Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan, who is now Turkey's president.
The protests began in Istanbul's Gezi Park and spread nationwide.
Lawyers for Kavala and other defendants requested that three judges on a panel recuse themselves, arguing that the court acted against legal procedures in listening to an additional witness without the lawyers or the defendants present.
The court rejected the request, prompting some 50 defense lawyers to walk out of the hearing. Observers in the courtroom were also removed and chanted: ""Osman Kavala is our pride"".
The witness, Murat Papuc, whose statement was read at the hearing, claimed he was given gas masks said to be distributed from a venue affiliated with Kavala.
Asked to make a statement against the witness, Kavala, who faces life in jail if convicted, said he would not deliver his defense without his lawyer present but requested his release.
The judges concluded the hearing by remanding Kavala in jail while a most defense lawyers and observers were outside of the courtroom.
The indictment against Kavala cited tapped phone calls in which Kavala discussed sending pastries, milk, juice and gas masks to protesters as evidence that he financed the protests.
The European Court of Human Rights called in December for Kavala's release saying there was a lack of reasonable suspicion that he committed an offence. The Turkish court said Tuesday the European court's ruling was not final.
The next hearing on his case is set for Feb. 18. Fifteen other defendants are on trial along with Kavala, who is currently the only one in jail."

157,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 28, 2020 07:49AM ET</span>",Netanyahu formally indicted in court on corruption charges,"By Stephen Farrell and Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was formally indicted in court on Tuesday on corruption charges after he withdrew his request for parliamentary immunity from prosecution.
Netanyahyu was in Washington for meetings with U.S. President Donald Trump ahead of the release of Trump's long-delayed Israel-Palestinian peace plan when Israel's attorney-general filed the charges in a Jerusalem court.
The immunity bid seemed doomed to fail from the beginning since Netanyahu, who denies any wrongdoing, lacked sufficient votes in the legislature for approval.
The request for protection from prosecution had effectively blocked the filing of the indictment until now.
As proceedings move toward trial the timeline remains unclear and it could take months or years.
In addition to his legal battle, Netanyahu is fighting for his political life in a March 2 election, Israel's third in less than a year after inconclusive ballots in April and September.
Netanyahu, Israel's longest-serving prime minister, said in a statement that an immunity debate in parliament would have been a ""circus"" and he did not want to take part in this ""dirty game"".
With public attention in Israel focused on events in Washington, Netanyahu's White House meetings seemed likely to overshadow his latest legal woes.
The veteran right-winger is under no legal obligation to resign.
Netanyahu's main rival, centrist former general Benny Gantz, made Netanyahu's legal troubles a centerpiece of his campaigns in two Israeli elections last year.
Gantz made a brief trip to Washington to discuss the peace plan with Trump, and had rushed back to Israel expecting to lead the parliament debate against granting Netanyahu immunity.
""Netanyahu is going to trial - we have to move on,"" Gantz said after Netanyahu pulled his immunity request.
""The citizens of Israel have a clear choice: a prime minister who works for them or a prime minister busy with himself. No one can manage the country and in parallel manage three serious criminal cases,"" Gantz said in a tweet. 
The corruption charges marked the first criminal indictment against a serving Israeli prime minister. The charge sheet was first published by Israel's attorney general in November following a long-running investigation. The charges included bribery, breach of trust and fraud.

Netanyahu is suspected of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts, which prosecutors said included cigars and champagne, from tycoons and of dispensing regulatory favors in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website.Netanyahu could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.

Greece has promised faster processing of asylum requests of more than 70,000 pending from previous years, to shut five overcrowded refugee camps on its islands and replace them with more restrictive holding centers. 
""(We want) to assure fast and efficient asylum procedures so that people in need of protection they will get one as soon as possible,"" Nina Gregori, executive director of EASO, told reporters.
Human rights groups have criticized the conservative government over its new framework to speed up the processing of asylum requests as a ""rushed"" attempt that would impede access to a fair asylum process for refugees.
Deputy Migration Minister George Koumoutsakos said speeding up the processing of asylum requests would help the state ease overcrowding in camps. 
Greece, via neighboring Turkey, was the main gateway into the European Union for more than a million mainly Middle East and Asian migrants fleeing conflict in 2015-16.
Last year, 59,726 migrants and refugees reached Greek shores, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, most of them arriving on Lesbos, Chios or Samos island near Turkey's coasts.

BARCELONA (Reuters) - A Catalan separatist leader briefly released from prison to testify in the region's parliament said on Tuesday he was confident the northeastern Spanish region would eventually vote again on independence.
Oriol Junqueras and five other politicians appeared before an investigative committee of the regional parliament, their first time out of prison since being sentenced in October to lengthy terms over a failed 2017 independence bid.
The parliament in the regional capital Barcelona was heavily protected by police as a few hundred protesters welcomed the jailed leaders, chanting ""Independence"" and ""Freedom for political prisoners"".
Catalonia unilaterally declared independence in 2017 following a referendum that was not authorized by Spanish courts. The Spanish government responded by taking control of the region and calling a new election for the regional leadership, in which separatist parties again won a majority.
""A self-determination referendum is a normal thing. We want to exercise it again and we will exercise it again,"" Junqueras, a former deputy regional leader, said in his testimony.
Spain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is due to attend a meeting in Barcelona on February 6 to set the agenda for negotiations over the region's political situation.
Junqueras said plans for talks between the Socialist-led Spanish government in Madrid and the pro-independence regional government in Barcelona were a ""step forward"". But he voiced scepticism that it would succeed given what he described as previous disappointments with the Socialists.
The dialogue was a condition for Junqueras' separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) to facilitate Sanchez's efforts to be appointed prime minister, an arrangement that was denounced by opposition parties on the right.
It comes at time of turmoil among the two main separatist parties, including ERC, which has raised the prospect of a snap regional election and further political uncertainty in Spain.
""We offer dialogue to everyone,"" said Junqueras, who received the longest jail sentence of the separatist politicians: 13 years.
He said his offer included those who welcomed the jail sentence: ""Dialogue is the best of the options to make the (Catalan independent) republic that we wish a reality."""

Among those arrested over the course of this month were two foreigners, one municipal official, and more than 20 university professors, he told a briefing.
The government of the predominantly Muslim ex-Soviet republic has been cracking down on Islamist opposition in recent years, banning the Islamic Renaissance Party of Tajikistan and accusing its leadership of plotting a coup.
Tajikistan has also blamed Islamists, and the ultra hardline Islamic State militant group in particular, for a series of deadly attack on foreign tourists and local prison staff and border guards.
The Brotherhood, founded more than 90 years ago in Egypt, has survived repeated crackdowns at home and has a network of groups across the Middle East and beyond, some directly linked to the Egyptian organization and others more loosely affiliated.
Its founder Hassan al-Banna called for a religious revival and the establishment of a caliphate under sharia law.
The Brotherhood’s opponents, including several autocratic Arab states, say it is a dangerous terrorist group which must be crushed. The movement says it publicly renounced violence decades ago and pursues an Islamist vision using peaceful means."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Britain's exit from the EU is reshaping the balance of power in Europe, removing one of the bloc's two big military powers and one of the top contributors to its budget. Britain has been an outspoken supporter of free trade, close ties with the United States and a tough sanctions policy toward Russia. Here are some issues:
DEFENSE, SECURITY, INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS
Britain and France, the EU's two nuclear armed U.N. Security Council permanent members, have long been by far the bloc's leading military powers. Britain was also the bloc's only member of the ""Five Eyes"" intelligence sharing group, giving it privileged access to the output of U.S. spies. To contain the damage from Britain's exit, the bloc is keen to keep London in a tight security and defense relationship in the future.
The departure of a traditional proponent of trans-Atlantic ties will leave more say to Paris, which has greater ambitions for the integration of European defense.
RUSSIA
Britain has been a key backer of sanctions against Russia over Ukraine, with the most important economic ones now in place only until the end of July. Other Russia hawks, including Sweden, Poland and the Baltic states, will see their hand weakened in discussions with peers such as Italy, Hungary and Cyprus that are keen to resume business ties with Moscow.
ECONOMIC LIBERALISM & TRADE
Britain and the EU will find themselves in separate trade talks with the United States and China, which will change the negotiating leverage of the world's most important trade relationships.
Within the EU, the free-traders' lobby will be weakened, leaving the Netherlands at the helm of a group that also includes Ireland, Sweden, Denmark and other smaller states.
With Germany seen leaning more toward a traditional French model of a strong state role, Britain will be an absence in discussions about industrial policy, vetting foreign investment, state aid to industry and creating national champions.
MACRON IN THE DRIVING SEAT
Without Britain, the Franco-German ""engine"" of the union becomes more important. But as Angela Merkel nears the end of her long tenure as the Germany chancellor, French President Emmanuel Macron could get a bigger say in EU affairs.
Macron wants to reform the EU and deepen its integration, creating a rift with newer eastern EU members such as Poland, which had seen euro-sceptic Britain as an ally.
The eastern members want to compete within the EU through lower prices and reject French proposals to harmonize more rules. They support expanding the bloc into the Balkans, which Macron has resisted, and they strongly back NATO as a bulwark against Russia, while Macron called the alliance ""brain dead"".
EU BUDGET
The EU is entering a period of horse-trading over its budget for 2021-27 and the departure of Britain leaves a gaping hole. Other net contributors do not want to pay more, while recipients do not want to give up aid.
EURO ZONE
Britain was by far the largest EU state outside the euro zone, meaning the other eight countries that have kept national currencies lose their most important ally when their interests diverge from those of states that use the euro."

The Jutarnji List daily, citing local property registers, said at the weekend that Kujundzic had failed to declare two apartments he owned on the island of Pag, as required under Croatian law, when he took office in October 2016.
Kujundzic denied he had done anything illegal, while Plenkovic did not comment directly on the newspaper's allegations, instead saying it was up to Kujundzic to clarify his situation.
Plenkovic has yet to nominate Kujundzic's successor, who will take over one of the most challenging ministerial portfolios.
The public health service has been in arrears for years and puts a large strain on a state budget that the government is trying to keep in balance to satisfy criteria for adopting the euro in 2023 or 2024.
The conservative-led government is facing a national election in the autumn but before that, in the spring, Plenkovic faces a contest with more conservative opponents for leadership of his Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).
In an opinion poll last week the biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats, moved marginally ahead of the HDZ for the first time in almost four years.
Plenkovic reshuffled his cabinet last July with six new incumbents after some ministers stepped down following media allegations of questionable real estate deals."

JIGJIGA, Ethiopia (Reuters) - Mustafa Muhumed Omer began demanding justice after his uncle disappeared and continued despite threats to his mother and sister, and the torture and death of his brother.
Now in charge of the sprawling Ethiopian Somali region, the former activist and aid worker has seven months before people vote on his reforms to a system where extrajudicial killings were rife.
Authorities this month set Aug. 16 as the date for Ethiopia's landmark elections. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed promised free and fair polls when he took power in April 2018, and wider change after years of deadly political violence.
The vote will be a litmus test of whether Abiy has won over a population traumatized by decades of repression and ongoing ethnic and political bloodshed. So far, Abiy has overseen the release of political prisoners and lifted a ban on political opponents.
He has also appointed several former dissidents to powerful positions, including Mustafa, 46, whom he made president of the eastern Somali region in August 2018.
With simmering ethnic strife forcing millions from their homes across Ethiopia in spite of Abiy's steps, Mustafa knows his job is not done.
""Forces that want unrest are not defeated,"" Mustafa told Reuters from his office in the city of Jigjiga, capital of the arid Somali region that 4.5 million people call home.
The region, also known as Ogaden, has rich natural gas resources and an impoverished population. It has been wracked by violence amid a government crackdown on the separatist Ogaden National Liberation Front (ONLF), active since 1984.
Abiy granted amnesty to the ONLF in return for a promise to engage in peaceful politics. Now Mustafa - whose boyish features belie the horrors suffered by his family - is dismantling structures that rights groups say were used to imprison, torture, and kill thousands of people.
He has shut down a prison nicknamed “Jail Ogaden” notorious for torture, established an auditor general to investigate government finances and retrained the feared paramilitary Liyu police. His predecessor, Abdi Iley, is on trial for fomenting violence, charges he denies. Journalists and aid agencies, previously banned, are now free to work in the region.
'FORCES' SEEK UNREST
Mustafa's quest for justice began as a university student, after his uncle was arrested by the military in 1995, accused of ONLF links and never seen again.
“My family’s injustice becomes just part of a larger injustice that happened to the people,” he said.
Mustafa carried on speaking out against the government during postings for the United Nations and charity Save the Children spanning from Zimbabwe to the United Arab Emirates.
The threatening phone calls began in October 2016, he said.
""You have to praise the region’s president,"" a voice told him, ""or we are going to rape your sister, we will kill your mother.""
Ten days later, Liyu police dragged his brother from their father's house in the early hours of the morning. Hours later, Mustafa said, three police threw his brother from the back of a moving truck, killing him in front of their horrified father.
""I talked to people who buried my brother and who saw the body, and they said the body had a lot of wounds,"" he said. ""He was tortured."" 
Two of those police are now in jail pending the outcome of their trials. A third is being sought.
The scale of abuses means not every perpetrator can be prosecuted, said Mustafa, who hopes the August elections will unify the country and direct resources to neglected regions.
Abiy has formed a new party, the Prosperity Party, by unifying three of the four ethnically-based parties in the coalition that had ruled Ethiopia since 1991. Five other regionally-based parties, including Mustafa's Somali Democratic Party, have also joined.
But rival parties are also emerging; analysts say an overall majority for Abiy's party is not guaranteed.
One such challenge comes from the ONLF's new party, said Ahmed Yassin, an ONLF political advisor.
""Mustafa’s party and the parliament is 90% composed of the previous regime,"" he said. ""We did not see serious commitment to bringing justice to the people.”
Mustafa conceded that few perpetrators had been brought to justice, and said his region will establish its own truth and reconciliation commission after the vote. He could not change parliament without an election, he said."

Police cleared out the migrants from the camp site in northern Paris' Porte d'Aubervilliers, which had housed more than 1,000 people often living in squalid conditions beside the busy and noisy Peripherique ringroad.
Those who were moved out were then taken on buses to transport them to new accommodation. Police faced no resistance during the operation.
The migrants appeared to be mainly from North Africa, the Middle East and Asia, many of them fleeing countries blighted by wars and poverty.
Since the closure of a huge migrant camp in Calais in 2016, many refugees have moved to Paris. Authorities have repeatedly dismantled illegal campsites only to see them pop up again in different areas a few months later.
The Aubervilliers site sprung up just two months after police had carried out a similar operation at two huge migrant tent camps in nearby sites in northern Paris.
Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo was present as authorities moved in during the early hours of Tuesday to dismantle the Aubervilliers site. Rubbish, debris and discarded items such as bicycles could be seen next to the ramshackle, shantytown-style tents.
Last November, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the French government would step up plans to clamp down on illegal immigration by clearing out migrant tent camps, imposing quotas for migrant workers and denying newly arrived asylum seekers access to non-urgent healthcare.

Opinion polls show that illegal immigration remains a big concern for many French voters, propping up support for far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who is likely to be President Emmanuel Macron's main opponent in the next election in 2002.

Police said the group tried to enter the European Union at the Roszke crossing at about 0430 GMT, prompting the security officer on site to open fire.
The crossing was the scene of a large-scale riot at the peak of Europe's migrant crisis in 2015, when police clashed with hundreds trying to break through the frontier into the EU.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban subsequently ordered a steel fence erected along Hungary's frontier, curbing arrivals. But migrant traffic started increasing again late last year and there are currently several hundred attempted illegal crossings per week.

Bushfires have killed 33 people and about 1 billion animals since September, while 2,500 homes and an area the size of Greece have been destroyed.
Firefighters have used several days of cooler, damper weather across much of the continent to try to gain control of more than 100 blazes still burning before temperatures rise again from mid-week. 
One blaze in a national park south of Canberra was upgraded to the emergency warning level, as the emergency services chief told residents to stay on alert, given rising winds could spark spot fires in the suburbs.
People in some areas near in Namadgi National Park were told it was too late to leave.
""Helicopters and large air tankers are water-bombing, establishing containment lines and undertaking aerial surveillance,"" Canberra's emergency services said in a notice. 
""The fire may pose threats to all lives directly in its path,"" Emergency Services Agency Commissioner Georgeina Whelan told reporters. ""...Firefighters may be unable to prevent a fire from reaching your property. You should not expect a firefighter on your door."" 
Winds of 5 kph had reached gusts as high as 40 kph (3.1-25 mph), she said, fanning the blaze and worsening conditions. 
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology and firefighting services were predicting temperatures to top 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) over the weekend. 
""Worsening conditions are forecast for later the week so prepare now,"" the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said on Twitter. 
People should clear their properties of any flammable vegetation, while any broken roof tiles should be repaired to protect houses from airborne embers, it said.
Here are Tuesday's key events in the bushfire crisis:
* NSW firefighters were tackling 60 fires. Only one fire is at ""watch and act"" warning level, meaning there was no immediate danger. The rest are at lower warning levels.
* In Victoria state, there were 16 warnings in place, none of which was deemed an immediate threat to property.
* A high pressure weather pattern is set to move across Australia's east coast later this week, bring soaring temperatures over the weekend.
* Fires cloaked Canberra in thick, hazardous smoke on Tuesday. 
* Researchers from the University of Sydney on Tuesday released a report that found just three days of low-level bushfire smoke exposure increased the threat of cardiac arrest, with people over 65 at higher risk.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealanders will go to polls on September 19 to decide on a second term for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, and also to vote in referendums on the divisive issues of legalizing cannabis and euthanasia.
Ardern is hugely popular among liberal voters overseas thanks to her compassionate but decisive response to a mass shooting, her focus on climate change action and multilateralism, and her ability to combine motherhood and leadership. 
But her popularity at home has been affected by slowing economic growth and low business confidence, a failed state housing project and scandals within her coalition government.
“I will be asking New Zealanders to continue to support my leadership and the current direction of the government, which is grounded in stability, a strong economy and progress on the long term challenges facing New Zealand,” Ardern told a news conference. 
Political pundits are predicting a close contest, with scheduled referendums on legalizing cannabis and euthanasia expected to be distracting and divisive.
""I am not making predictions on this as it's going to be a tight race,"" said Grant Duncan, Associate Professor at Massey University in Auckland.
New Zealand's Treasury last month trimmed its 2020 economic growth forecast and flagged a budget deficit as international headwinds including Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war bite. The government last month announced a NZ$12 billion ($7.7 billion) infrastructure spend to try counter those factors.
Two October opinion polls showed support for her ruling coalition at its lowest since 2017. Her own popularity also waned, but she remains far ahead of her rivals. 
In an interview with Reuters last month, Ardern noted there was work to be done but her party was still polling higher than it was before the 2017 election.
'CAN'T DELIVER'
Ardern, 39, took the helm of the country as the world's youngest female leader in 2017, a remarkable rise that dominated global headlines and generated the phrase ""Jacinda-mania"". 
She campaigned passionately to end child poverty and economic inequality, upstaging the ruling center-right National Party and forming a government with the small, nationalist New Zealand First Party and the Green Party under the country's proportional voting system.
Ardern's response to the massacre at two mosques in Christchurch in March, when she wore a headscarf to meet with the families of the victims and then rapidly pushed a ban on semi-automatic weapons through parliament, was widely praised.
She became only the second head of state after Pakistan's Benazir Bhutto to give birth while in office, attending the United Nations with her baby and partner in tow. 
But critics have accused her of playing to a global audience while bringing little change locally.
""New Zealanders have seen that Labor and Jacinda Ardern can’t deliver,"" National Party leader Simon Bridges said in a statement. ""While there’s a lot of announcements, leadership means actually getting things done.""

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan forces and Taliban fighters clashed in a central region where a U.S. military aircraft crashed, officials said on Tuesday, as the government tried to reach the wreckage site in a Taliban stronghold.
On Monday, the U.S. military said an E-11A aircraft crashed in the province of Ghazni, but disputed Taliban claims to have brought it down, without saying how many were aboard or if any had been killed.
Security forces were sent to the site immediately after receiving a report of the crash in the Deh Yak district, but were ambushed by Taliban fighters, Ghazni provincial police chief Khalid Wardak told Reuters.
""As per our information, there are four bodies and two onboard were alive and they are missing,"" Wardak said, adding that the forces subsequently received an order to retreat and airborne action is to be taken instead.
Zabiullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said Afghan forces backed by U.S. military support had tried to capture the area around the crashed aircraft and clashed with fighters of the Islamist militant group.
The attempt was repelled, however, he told Reuters, but added that the Taliban would allow a rescue team access to recover bodies from the crash site.
""Taliban fighters on the ground counted six bodies at the site of the U.S. airplane crash,"" he said, adding that while there could have been more, the militant group could not be certain, as fire had reduced everything to ashes.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, U.S. officials said the plane was carrying fewer than five when it crashed, with one official saying initial information showed there were at least two.
The site has not been visited by U.S. officials or any other members of the international force in Afghanistan, but the Taliban claim to have brought down the plane is misleading, a U.S. defense official told Reuters on Tuesday, adding that a preliminary probe showed there was a mechanical error.
The crashed aircraft, built by Bombardier Inc, is used to provide communication capabilities in remote locations."

Giammattei, who took office in January, said the governments will work to develop a legal framework so that El Salvador can develop projects through a public-private partnership on the Guatemalan coast.
""We have offered El Salvador something unprecedented in the history of Central American integration, and today I want to announce it publicly because we are going to explore, as soon as possible, the possibility that El Salvador has a port in the Atlantic, in the Guatemalan Atlantic,"" Giammattei said during a news conference at the Salvadoran presidential residence.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Andrew has provided ""zero cooperation"" to U.S. authorities probing sex trafficking allegedly carried out by deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein and co-conspirators, a prosecutor said on Monday.
The FBI and U.S. federal prosecutors contacted Prince Andrew's lawyers and requested an interview with the prince, who socialized with Epstein, Manhattan-based U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said at a news conference in front of Epstein's mansion. 
As of Monday, ""Prince Andrew has provided zero cooperation,"" Berman said at the event hosted by Safe Horizon, a group pressing for more legal protection for abuse victims.
He did not say when U.S. authorities had requested an interview with Andrew.
Buckingham Palace declined to comment.
Andrew said in November he would be willing to help ""any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required."" 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation's probe is focusing on British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein, and others who facilitated the wealthy financier's alleged trafficking of underage girls, law enforcement sources told Reuters in December.
Maxwell has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.
Epstein had socialized with Andrew and other high-profile figures including U.S. President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton, according to court filings. 
Epstein’s suicide in August, at age 66, came a little over a month after he was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. Prosecutors said he recruited girls to give him massages, which became sexual in nature. Epstein had pleaded not guilty.
In 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a Florida state charge of soliciting prostitution. He completed a 13-month jail sentence that was widely criticized as too lenient. 
Andrew has described his association with Epstein as ""ill-judged"" and in November the prince stepped down from public duties as the allegations became a distraction for the royal family.
Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, has denied an allegation in a civil lawsuit from Virginia Giuffre, who claims she had sex with the prince when she was 17 in an encounter arranged through Epstein.
Giuffre's lawsuit said Maxwell recruited her into Epstein's circle and Epstein forced her to have sex with him and friends including Andrew.
Despite Epstein's death, investigations continue into potential accomplices.
In December, sources told Reuters, law enforcement did not plan at that time to interview Andrew, although the investigation was said to be at an early stage.
The FBI has been following up on leads received from women who contacted a hotline the agency set up at its New York field office in the wake of Epstein's arrest in July, the sources said in December.
This month, the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands sued Epstein's estate claiming he raped and trafficked dozens of young women and girls on a private island he owned in the territory.
The complaint filed by Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George significantly broadened the scope of the financier's alleged misconduct, saying it spanned from 2001 to 2018 and targeted girls who appeared to be as young as 11 or 12.

The Virgin Islands is seeking civil penalties plus some assets from Epstein's estimated $577.7 million estate, including the forfeiture of his two private islands, Little St. James and Great St. James.

The attorney general, Raúl Melara, said the petition arises from an investigation that includes a video in which Quijano can be seen in a meeting with alleged members of the violent Mara Salvatrucha gang, better known as MS-13.
""As an advocate for all Salvadorans, I announce that after a serious, rigorous and objective investigation, I have ordered that ... the request for [removal of immunity] be filed against Deputy Norman Quijano,"" Melara said in a video published on Twitter.
In October, during a trial against 425 members of the Mara Salvatrucha and several collaborators, a witness declared having held a meeting with the conservative politician.
Quijano defended himself in a post on Twitter.
""I have not given money to criminals, much less agreed to benefits,"" he said.
The 73-year-old dentist vied for the Salvadoran presidency in 2014 as part of the right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena) party. After his defeat, he returned to the legislature.
MS-13 and its rival, Barrio 18, have spread throughout El Salvador and control many territories, creating temptation for political parties to negotiate with them for electoral support.
In August 2015, the Salvadoran Supreme Court declared gangs as terrorist groups.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's ruling party plunged into a divisive leadership struggle on Monday when party chief Yeidckol Polevnsky refused to stand down after being voted out by opponents.
Lopez Obrador's National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) party reshaped Mexico's political landscape with a convincing victory in the 2018 elections, winning majorities with its allies in both houses of Congress.
But MORENA, formally registered in 2014, has struggled to pick a new leader amid infighting between different wings of the party.
Divisions in MORENA at a time when the economy is stagnant and homicides are at record levels risk eroding the party's grip on Congress with a new lower house due to be elected next year.
Protracted infighting within in the Mexican left, which has long been highly factional, could also be an unwelcome distraction from Lopez Obrador's plans for a so-called ""recall"" referendum on his leadership in the spring of 2022.
On Sunday senior MORENA congressman Alfonso Ramirez Cuellar was elected as temporary leader by a party congress of more than 1,000 representatives until a new leadership election is held in a few months' time.
But Polevnsky, who had led the party since Lopez Obrador stepped down before the 2018 general election, on Monday refused to recognize Sunday's vote, saying it broke party rules.
""We will continue to lead in strict adherence to (party) legality and our statute,"" she said on a video on Twitter.
Some sections of the party backed Polevnsky while others welcomed Ramirez Cuellar's appointment.
Lopez Obrador declined to be publicly drawn into the dispute.
""It should be resolved democratically,"" Lopez Obrador said during his daily morning press conference. ""Don't get me involved in the question of party politics."""

LAGOS (Reuters) - Nigeria's business capital of Lagos will ban commercial motorcycles from operating in large parts of the city, the state government announced on Monday, a move that could change the commute for thousands and threaten ride-hailing startups.
The Lagos state government announced on Twitter that it would ban motorcycles, commonly known as okadas, from operating in most of Lagos because of what it described as their ""chaos and disorderliness"" and ""scary figures"" of fatal accidents.
Companies such as Max.ng, Oride and Gokada have been aiming to capitalize on the congested Lagos roads and the city's teeming population to expand their operations.
The ban cites a 2018 law to bar okadas and small three-wheeled vehicles known as kekes from Feb. 1. It would bar them from 40 bridges and flyovers and areas covering the business districts of Victoria Island and Lagos Island, Apapa, where the primary port is located and Ikeja, which is home to the international airport.
Chinedu Azodoh, cofounder of Max.ng, is hopeful that the ban would not apply to them since their bikes are above the 200 cubic centimeter engine size banned specifically by the law.
""From what we've seen today, we don't think the ban affects our business,"" Azodoh said.
Still, he said, enforcement could be tough on their riders and drivers if police are not well-versed on the specifics of the law.
""We expect some more clarity on how this will be implemented,"" he said.
Max.ng, which also operates in Kano, Ibadan and Akure in Nigeria, had an investment round last year that raised more than $5 million.
Startup Gokada also raised $5 million last year for its Lagos operations. Founder Fahim Saleh said that while their bikes are also above 200cc, he was not sure about the impact of the ban on them.
""It's disappointing,"" he said, adding they would seek to expand its operations in courier and logistics services. ""We don't know how it's going to be enforced.""
ORide, part of OPay in which Norwegian software firm Opera Ltd has an equity interest, also offers ride-hailing motorcycles in Lagos. Reuters could not immediately reach the company for comment.
In June, Gokada told Reuters that there are an estimated 8 million okada drivers operating across Nigeria.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador lashed out at critics on Monday after a group of his supporters angrily hectored members of a U.S.-Mexican family protesting to the government about the murder of their loved ones.
Supporters of the president chanted insults at participants of a peace march as their column arrived on the Zocalo square in Mexico City's historic center next to the presidential palace on Sunday.
Among the leaders of the march were Adrian LeBaron, who lost a daughter and four grandchildren in a November massacre of nine women and children by suspected cartel gunmen.
The nine dead, who were dual U.S-Mexican nationals of Mormon origin, were among the 34,582 homicide victims registered in the country in 2019, a record.
Some American relatives of the LeBarons sparked anger in Mexico after the massacre by urging U.S. President Donald Trump's administration to declare Mexican drug cartels terrorist organizations.
Lopez Obrador supporters who jostled the protesters yelled ""LeBaron out"" and other slogans.
When asked at a regular news conference about the hostility directed toward the peace march by his supporters, the leftist Lopez Obrador said victims of violence deserved respect.
The clashes, he said, were due to ""existing differences.""
He then accused conservatives of double standards and argued that groups close to them were not calling for investigations into how former security minister Genaro Garcia Luna had allegedly become involved with a notorious drug cartel.
Without specifying whom he was accusing, Lopez Obrador said those complaining about violence now were ""as silent as mummies"" when the military-led crackdown on organized crime Garcia Luna had helped mastermind was still underway before his rule.
""Enough hypocrisy,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters.
U.S. prosecutors last month arrested and charged Garcia Luna with taking bribes from the cartel formerly run by convicted kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman. He denies the charges.
One leader of the weekend peace march was Javier Sicilia, a poet who also led protests against gang violence when his son was killed by suspected cartel hit men during former President Felipe Calderon's administration.
Instead of curbing the violence, homicides rose sharply under the crackdown that started under Calderon. His administration faced widespread criticism for failing to restore order.
Lopez Obrador declined to meet the leaders of the march. He has previously sat down with members of the LeBaron family and other Mormon families whose relatives were killed in the November massacre."

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The filing of murder charges against the former CEO of Brazilian miner Vale SA and 15 others for a 2019 dam collapse that killed more than 250 people was hailed by victims' families as a major step in bringing those responsible to justice.
But the move by state prosecutors in Brazil's Minas Gerais risks driving a wedge between their investigation and a parallel probe at the federal level, complicating the judicial process and potentially making convictions less likely, according to a lawyer with knowledge of the case and other legal experts.
    Federal investigators are yet to identify the cause of the Jan. 25, 2019 collapse of a tailings dam at the Corrego do Feijao iron ore mine dam east of Brumadinho, which released a sea of mud that slammed into Vale's offices and cut through a nearby community, killing 259 people and leaving 11 still missing. It was one of the world's worst mining tragedies.
The final results of a complex study will not be completed until June, they say.
That delay has put the state and federal investigations out of synch, recalling the legal problems that dogged the prosecution of a similar mining disaster in Brazil in 2015.
""The charges are a bit of a surprise,"" said Davi Tangerino, a lawyer and law professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas in Sao Paulo, ""because of the awaited technical study.""
""I don't think there are the concrete elements required for homicide charges, precisely because this technical part is missing,"" Tangerino added.
A legal source involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the divergence between the state and federal prosecutions was likely to be exploited by defense lawyers.
""It gives a lot of ammunition to the defense,"" the source said, adding that Vale would seek to portray the lack of a technical study into the disaster as a flaw in the prosecution's case.
On the day the charges were announced, the Rio de Janeiro-based miner and lawyers for its former chief executive officer, Fabio Schvartsman, stressed that the technical study was not yet complete.
Schvartsman's lawyers described the murder charges as ""hasty and unfair"" without the investigation's conclusions. The others charged were managers at Vale and employees of the auditing company that had vouched for the safety of the dam.
""Fabio always cooperated with the investigations ... in the belief that any decision about criminal responsibility would be made on technical criteria. Unfortunately that's not what happened,"" his lawyers said in a statement to Reuters for this story.
Vale told Reuters in a statement it ""considers it essential to have an expert, technical and scientific conclusion on the causes of the rupture ... before responsibility is pointed out."" The company said it was cooperating with authorities and helping those affected by the disaster.
State prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. When presenting the charges, they said Vale had internal information showing various dams to have an unacceptable risk profile, including the one that collapsed last year.
Federal prosecutors said they had maintained communication with their state counterparts since the start to gather evidence and secure successful prosecutions.
JURISDICTION
For Alberto Zacharias Toron, a lawyer and professor in criminal law, the filing of the murder charges sets up a possible dispute over jurisdiction of the case, which could play into the hands of the defense.
""The Supreme Court could say the case is federal and all this work will be annulled, including the charges,"" he said.
Deciding the jurisdiction of a case can be complicated, especially when it involves multiple people, areas and crimes. Certain forests and parks are federal, for example, whereas murder is often regarded as the remit of the state.
The criminal investigation into the similar Mariana dam disaster, which occurred at a mine co-owned by Vale just over three years before the one at Brumadinho, experienced long delays due to arguments over jurisdiction.
The case was finally tried in federal courts, partly because the scale of the disaster meant it polluted a federal river and impacted multiple states.
Toron, who worked for the defense during those investigations, said board members of the joint venture operating the Mariana dam were also accused of murder but the defense successfully had the charges reduced to the lesser charge of flooding resulting in death. That alone caused a seven-month delay.
Even those lesser charges were later rejected by a federal judge last September on the grounds that board members did not ""exercise management roles."" Federal prosecutors have appealed.
In the Brumadinho case, state prosecutors have focused on management, rather than board members, but it remains to be seen whether that will help secure convictions."

The 89-year-old Polish woman vividly recalls her World War Two childhood in her Nazi-occupied homeland. Her family's home in the town of Oswiecim was seized by German forces and they were relocated to a house only about a mile away from the camp.
""When you went outside you saw the (smoke) column. It stank so badly, especially when the wind blew in this direction,"" Szelc said, speaking to Reuters in the same home from which she had been removed as a child. ""When the orchestra played and the people were screaming, the dogs were barking, it was like hell.""
The Nazis forced prisoner orchestras to play music at some of their death camps as the trains carrying Jews from across Europe arrived and the passengers were sent on to their death.
Szelc said the sights and sounds still reverberate in her mind today. ""Such a tragedy,"" she said, shaking her head.
More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished in Auschwitz's gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease.
Six million Jews in all were murdered in the Nazi Holocaust.
Szelc's quiet hometown was filled with the commotion of car convoys and police sirens on Monday as world leaders gathered at the Auschwitz site for a ceremony marking the 75 anniversary of its liberation near the end of World War Two.
Across the street from Szelc, her neighbor Barbara Kaczmarczyk, 55, said that after the German defeat, her grandparents returned to their home, in which she lives today, to discover a trove of Nazi documents and SS porcelain dishware.
""Every old house here has some,"" said Kaczmarczyk. ""There is a lot of history here.""
She was told by her family that Joseph Mengele, the SS doctor who subjected Auschwitz prisoners to cruel medical experiments, had at one point resided in their brown brick house. Reuters could not independently verify her account.
""No one wants to repeat this history. It is good that everybody remembers it,"" Kaczmarczyk said.
The history of World War Two has become a political and diplomatic issue for Poland whose nationalist government seeks to highlight Polish suffering in the conflict and rule out any complicity by Poles who aided the Nazis during the Holocaust."

""Yes, a site is being prepared for placing the Zafar satellite into orbit,"" Iranian Minister of Information and Communications Technology Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi tweeted.
The post included a link to a story by U.S. broadcaster National Public Radio that noted satellite imagery suggested the Islamic Republic was preparing for a space launch. Iran had at least two failed satellite launches last year.
After the Zafar satellite is placed in orbit a timeline has been finalised to launch five more, the minister said.
The United States fears long-range ballistic technology used to put satellites into orbit could also be used to launch nuclear warheads.
Tehran denies the U.S. accusation that such activity is a cover for ballistic missile development and says it has never pursued the development of nuclear weapons.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump reimposed sanctions on Iran following Washington's 2018 withdrawal from an international accord designed to put curbs on Iran's nuclear program.
Trump said the nuclear deal did not go far enough and also did not include restrictions on Iran's missile program and support for its proxies in the Middle East region.
Tensions have reached the highest level in decades between Iran and the United States after top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to retaliate with a missile attack against a U.S. base in Iraq days later.

Iran launched its first satellite Omid (Hope) in 2009 and the Rasad (Observation) satellite was sent into orbit in June 2011. Tehran said in 2012 that it had successfully put its third domestically-made satellite Navid (Promise) into orbit.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra took a gamble last year when he shuttered Congress after a bruising battle over a corruption crackdown with opposition lawmakers allied to the powerful Fujimori political dynasty.
The gamble paid off. Vizcarra has emerged as the showdown's survivor and has dealt his political nemesis a blow not seen in 20 years, when Alberto Fujimori resigned the presidency via fax from Japan amid a ballooning graft scandal.
In legislative elections on Sunday, Popular Force, the party of Fujimori and his daughter, Keiko Fujimori, which had held an unbreakable majority, gained an estimated 12 seats in the 130-seat chamber - down from 73.
""It is a stunning defeat,"" said Fernando Tuesta, a political scientist at Peru's Catholic University.
The blow puts in doubt the future of a political movement that has shaped almost every aspect of Peruvian life and the country's economy for 30 years, even as the copper-rich country prepares for next year's presidential election.
But while Vizcarra has rid himself of a key rival, he remains a lone wolf in a fractured Congress where he has no direct party representation. He has a package of reforms on the table -- from how top judges are elected to stripping lawmakers of immunity against criminal investigations -- but it is unclear how much support he will be able to rack up.
Inside Popular Force, the party leadership tried to portray the election result as just another cycle against its movement, and pledged to bounce back.
""Any other party that faced the persecution we have faced would have disappeared,"" Luis Galarreta, Popular Force's secretary general and a former president of Congress, told Reuters in an interview. ""This is not the first time that our party goes through a difficult situation.""
Peruvian politics have been dogged by corruption for years. The last four of Peru's elected presidents have been ordered to serve jail time. Keiko Fujimori herself was imprisoned until recently on money laundering allegations, with investigation against her ongoing. She denies any wrongdoing.
Galarreta acknowledged that the party's aggressive opposition to Vizcarra - who gained increasing popularity with his battle with Congress - harmed the party's popularity, though he argued this was inevitable.
""Congress is unpopular and by having a majority of seats we assumed a political liability,"" he said.
But Galarreta said it is time to refocus the party on its roots and the legacy of Fujimori's presidency.
An engineer, Alberto Fujimori ran the country for a decade in the 1990s and was praised for reviving the economy, but his administration was dogged by accusations of bribery and excessive use of violence in efforts to curb anti-government violence. He is now serving a 25-year sentence for human rights violations.
After his demise Keiko and younger brother, Kenji, shot to prominence on the back of the family name, wielding huge power in the Andean nation of over 30 million people. Kenji became the most voted congressman in 2006 and Keiko lost the presidency in 2016 by a margin of just 0.24%.
But the most recent election shows how their influence has gone bust, all while the two siblings remain publicly estranged.
""They have gone from their best moment in electoral history to their worst moment in electoral history,"" said Carlos Melendez, a political scientist who studies Fujimorismo.
""Popular Force cannot aspire to the 2021 presidential election,"" Melendez said. ""I think it should look at 2026, or even 2031 onwards. The sensation of a chaos is still too fresh."""

Torra will now be unable to vote in parliament but will remain head of the Catalan government, despite opposition parties' demands that he be removed from the post, Torrent said.
Catalonia unilaterally declared independence in 2017 following a referendum, prompting the Spanish government to impose direct rule from Madrid and call a new election, in which pro-independence parties won a majority in parliament.
Torra was later handed an 18-month ban from public office for refusing to remove symbols supporting jailed Catalan activists from government buildings during an electoral campaign, and the electoral board stripped Torra of his seat in the Catalan parliament. That decision was upheld by Spain's Supreme Court last week.
There was no word of any arrests of injuries in the scuffles that broke out with police on Monday when several hundred people, some of them waving Catalan flags, protested against the decision to strip Torra of his rights as a lawmaker.
Spain's Socialist prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, is due to attend a meeting in Barcelona next week to set the agenda for negotiations to address Catalonia's independence drive.
Separatist left-wing party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) was instrumental in facilitating Sanchez's confirmation as premier this month after a long political stalemate.
Torra's center-right Junts per Catalunya and ERC, who have a coalition government in the region, have been at odds over the issue of whether to remove Torra from power, raising the prospect of a snap regional election that would increase political uncertainty in Spain."

AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - A renewed drive by President Bashar al-Assad to recapture rebel-held territory in Syria's northwest sparked a fresh exodus of many thousands of civilians toward Turkey's border on Monday amid heavy air strikes, aid workers and witnesses said.
Syrian government forces backed by Russian air power have stepped up a campaign to recapture Idlib province, the last rebel stronghold where millions took refuge after fleeing other parts of Syria earlier in its nearly nine-year civil war.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said Assad's forces had since Friday wrestled control of 22 towns and had cut through a strategic highway in Idlib that links the capital Damascus to Aleppo in northern Syria.
It said the Syrian army had encircled and was close to capturing Maarat al-Numan, an urban center 33 km (20 miles) south of Idlib city. This would mark a significant advance for Assad's drive to take back all of Syria.
A rescue worker who posted a video from Maarat al-Numan said the city had been devastated by an assault of barrel bombs, missiles and shelling in recent days that had laid waste to scores of homes and vital infrastructure. 
""Marat al-Numan is completely destroyed and its population has been displaced and is living in uncertainty,"" said the civil defense force worker, who did not identify himself.
Moscow and Damascus say they are fighting jihadist militants that have stepped up attacks on civilians in Aleppo, but rights groups and rescue workers say air strikes have demolished hospitals, schools and other civilian areas. 
The renewed fighting comes despite a Jan. 12 ceasefire deal between Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides of the conflict.
Fouad Sayed Issa, an aid worker with the Violet Organization in northern Syria, said Assad's latest campaign has frightened Syrians in the rebel enclave who fear death or arrest if their towns are recaptured.
""Over the past few days we have seen thousands of new internally displaced persons and we are talking here at the very least about 50,000 over the past four days,"" said Issa.
A witness said that thousands on Monday fled from the Idlib towns of Ariha and Saraqib, with trucks and cars seen crawling in gridlocked traffic toward areas, including the town of Azaz, close to the Turkish border.
The Observatory estimated that about 120,000 people had fled from countryside around Aleppo and Idlib over the past 12 days. Aid workers said most have moved to relatively safer parts of northern Syria near the Turkish frontier.
Turkey, which backs some rebel groups opposed to Assad, already hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees and fears that millions more could soon cross the border.

190,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 01:42PM ET</span>",Reported Pompeo comments put Ukraine in awkward spot before visit,"By Pavel Polityuk
KIEV (Reuters) - Reported comments by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appearing to play down Ukraine's importance to Americans have put Kiev in an awkward spot days before Pompeo is due to visit.
Ukraine is already walking a political tightrope over the attempt to impeach U.S. President Donald Trump, which focuses on allegations he pressured Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate the son of his Democratic rival Joe Biden.
Pompeo, who is due to make an official visit to Ukraine starting on Thursday, will be the most senior U.S. official to travel to Ukraine since the impeachment process began.
Last week he was accused of shouting ""do you think Americans care about Ukraine?"" at a National Public Radio reporter after she questioned him about Ukraine in an interview.
Pompeo said the reporter had lied in setting up the interview and in agreeing to conduct the post-interview conversation off the record but did not dispute what she said about the content of the post-interview encounter. NPR stood by its account of the meeting.
Zelenskiy has not commented on the matter, consistent with a strategy to avoid or deflect most questions about Trump's impeachment.
Sviatoslav Yurash, a lawmaker in Zelenskiy's party who sits on parliament's foreign policy committee, said Ukraine was unlikely to raise the issue; analyst Volodymyr Fesenko of the Penta think-tank said Ukraine was in no position to complain.
""We may not like what Pompeo allegedly said, but we cannot afford to criticize Pompeo for this. We cannot show our negative attitude,"" he said.
In a statement to Reuters, Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said Pompeo's visit was a ""clear demonstration of support for Ukraine"" focused on the Donbass conflict, military aid and Washington's support for Kiev's domestic reforms.
A senior U.S. administration official stressed that Washington's focus was supporting Ukraine and its fight against corruption. 
Former Ukrainian Foreign Minister Pavlo Klimkin told Reuters Kiev regarded Washington as ""a special partner,"" but said the background to Pompeo's trip was ""really unfavorable"".
Ukraine counts on Washington for diplomatic support and military aid to buy Javelin anti-tank missiles and other hardware as it battles Russian-backed separatists in its eastern Donbass region in a war that has killed more than 13,000 people.
Trump froze nearly $400 million in U.S. military assistance to Ukraine shortly before speaking to Zelenskiy, prompting accusations from Democrats that he had misused U.S. foreign policy for personal gain.
After finding itself pitched in the middle of a domestic political row in Washington, Kiev suffered more embarrassment when the White House published a summary of a Trump-Zelenskiy call containing criticism of France and Germany.

Banias has capacity to process more than 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil."
192,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 01:07PM ET</span>","Pakistani rights activist arrested on charges of sedition, protests threatened","PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistani authorities on Monday arrested the leader of a rights movement that has made allegations of human rights violations by the military during anti-terrorism operations, officials said.
Supporters of the Pashtun Tahaffuz Movement (PTM) led by Manzoor Pashteen threatened nationwide protests in response to his arrest.
PTM's unusually direct criticism of the powerful military has brought it into conflict with Pakistani authorities, who accuse PTM of being bankrolled by hostile neighbors Afghanistan and India.
The PTM denies that allegation. The military and the government deny PTM's allegations of human rights abuses.
Pashteen was arrested by police from Peshawar in the early hours of Monday on a number of charges, including “sedition,” a senior police official of Pakistan’s northwestern province of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa told Reuters.
The arrest was criticized by Afghanistan.
“While our region is suffering from atrocities caused by violent extremism and terrorism, governments in the region must support and encourage peaceful civilian movements for justice,” President Ashraf Ghani said on Twitter.
In response, the Pakistan foreign office described Ghani's tweet as unwarranted interference in Pakistan's internal affairs. It said ""such statements are not helpful to the promotion of good neighborly relations ... and urges the Afghan side to work together for the common objective of peace and stability in Afghanistan and the region.""
Many of PTM’s supporters are ethnic Pashtuns who hail originally from the borderlands with Afghanistan, the focal point of a near-decade long insurgency by Islamist militants and subsequent anti-terrorism operations by Pakistan’s military, which displaced millions of people from the area.
The group also had two members elected as lawmakers in Pakistan’s parliament in 2018 general elections, both of whom were arrested under anti-terrorism laws last year and detained for close to four months before being released on bail.
One of the two lawmakers, Mohsin Dawar, told reporters on Monday that PTM and its supporters would demonstrate against Pashteen’s arrest.
Pakistani authorities have previously attempted to bar protests by PTM and brought legal cases against people who have taken part in demonstrations.
Previously, Gulalai Ismail, an active campaigner for PTM, fled Pakistan for exile in the United States because of what she termed threats against her and her family made by Pakistan’s security apparatus. Her father, a university professor who remained in Pakistan, was arrested on charges of “hate speech.” He was released on bail after being detained for a month."

LONDON (Reuters) - Nigeria had no warning from Washington that it could be added to the list of countries subject to a U.S. travel ban, information minister Lai Mohammed said on Monday, adding such a move would be ""hasty"" and send the wrong signal to investors.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would add more countries to his travel ban list. While he gave no details, a source familiar with the proposal said the tentative list included seven nations - Nigeria, Belarus, Eritrea, Kyrgyzstan, Myanmar, Sudan and Tanzania.
An announcement was imminent, said Mohammed, adding that while Abuja had reached out to the U.S. administration since learning about the plan, his government did not get any warning and had not been told any possible reason.
""We are doing everything we can,"" Mohammed told Reuters in an interview. ""A travel ban is going to send the wrong signal to investors, it is going to stifle the good of the country and vulnerable people who need medication and schools will be the most affected.""
Nigeria, Africa’s largest economy and most populous country, is a U.S. anti-terrorism partner and has a large diaspora residing in the United States.
It is not clear what sort of restrictions Nigeria might face if added to the list and the U.S. administration has so far not commented. Under the current version of the U.S. travel ban on foreign countries, citizens of Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, and some Venezuelan officials and their relatives are blocked from obtaining a large range of U.S. immigrant and non-immigrant visas.
""Nigeria has done very well in the area of fighting terrorism,"" Mohammed said, adding that Washington help drive militant groups such as Islamic State out of Nigeria.
DEAF EARS
Asked about Nigeria's move to close its land borders last August with neighbors such as Benin and Niger to fight smuggling, Mohammed said the move had been a success and boosted food production inside the country.
""Every attempt in the last 16 years to persuade our neighbors, especially Niger, to adhere to the ECOWAS protocol of transit has fallen on deaf ears,"" he said, referring to the trade protocol governing the exchange of goods between the Economic Community of West African States to which Nigeria belongs. ""No country can allow that it can become a dumping ground for goods from elsewhere.""
In 2015, the central bank banned the use of its foreign exchange to pay for rice imports and has backed loans of at least 40 billion naira ($131 million) to help smallholders boost output, before moving to a full border closure last summer.
Mohammed said his government was happy with how the move had spurred local production. Yet the border closure also worsened price pressures, with inflation at 11.98% in December, rising for the fourth straight month and well outside the central bank's band of 6%-9%.
""We see this only as temporary,"" he said, adding he expected inflation to fall into the single digits by 2023."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Holocaust survivors in Israel are better off financially than in the past thanks to the efforts of campaigners after decades of government neglect and bureaucracy, but some still live in poverty.
World leaders joined some of the survivors in Poland on Monday to mark 75 years since Soviet troops liberated Auschwitz, the biggest Nazi death camp, where more than 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, perished.
With an average age of 85, some 140,000 Holocaust survivors live in Israel today. Another 50,000 have recently been added to a broader category of survivors that include Jews who faced persecution in countries such as Algeria and Iraq.
Israel's government allocated a record 5.5 billion shekels ($1.6 billion) to all survivors of persecution in 2019, up from 2.9 billion in 2012 and just 1.5 billion in 2004, according to the Holocaust Survivor Rights Authority in the Finance Ministry.
It is not possible to say how much that amounts to for individuals as not all are eligible to receive full assistance.
Some survivors also receive funds from Germany. Poland, on whose territory the Nazis built Auschwitz and many other camps, provides some funds for Israelis of Polish descent.
""All people who were in (Nazi) camps get monetary payments,"" said Galia Aricha, a legal adviser at the authority.
One of those is Vera Grossman Kriegel, an Auschwitz survivor, who gets by on her small pension and social security payments.
""I manage,"" said the 81-year-old, who was born in Czechoslovakia and moved to Israel in 1953. ""I don't need much to live on. I am quite satisfied with how I live.""
It took heavy lobbying by survivor groups to force changes.
""There are still Holocaust survivors who live in poverty but in the last decade rights have changed,"" said  Aviva  (LON:AV) Silberman, an attorney who founded the Aviv Association for Holocaust Survivors 12 years ago.
""The ones who suffered because they were in the worst places don't live in poverty.""
LIVING IN DIGNITY
An estimated 25% of the Holocaust survivors in Israel live in poverty, mostly Soviet immigrants who arrived in the 1980s and 1990s.
They are not eligible for the full benefits provided for Holocaust survivors as they arrived in Israel after 1953, and were not covered by a reparations agreement signed between Israel and West Germany that year or by a separate Israeli law.
Funding for survivors ranges from an annual grant of about 4,000 shekels a year to up to 11,000 shekels a month including pension and disability payments.
""The vision is that every Holocaust survivor should live in dignity and welfare,"" Silberman said.
Conditions for many survivors improved significantly after 2014, when Yair Lapid, himself the son of a Holocaust survivor, became finance minister.
""Nothing was done for years. It was a disgrace,"" Lapid told Reuters.
Lapid, now an opposition politician, added 1 billion shekels a year to the budget for survivors, raised monthly allowances, gave survivors free access to medicines and tweaked a law to improve benefits for those who moved to Israel after 1953.
Aricha said more work still needs to be done, such as informing survivors of what benefits they are entitled to.
""We find people who didn't know their rights,"" she said."

Some 9.4 million Afghans are in need of basic food and housing this year, up from 6.5 million in 2019, when the U.N. sought more than $600 million from governments and other donors, as the economy stalls and the Taliban insurgency intensifies.
""Afghanistan remains the world's deadliest conflict, and on top of the lingering effects of the drought in 2018, coupled with growing poverty, the need is up,"" Toby Lanzer, the U.N.'s deputy special representative for Afghanistan, told Reuters.
Lanzer is in Brussels and London this week after traveling to Ottawa, New York and Washington to urge donors to pledge cash for emergency support, which is separate from the billions of dollars of development aid for Afghanistan pledged in October 2016 at an international conference in Brussels.
That development aid runs out at the end of this year and the country will need billions of dollars more, Lanzer said. He said the U.N hopes to hold another donors' conference later this year to raise money for the 2021-2024 period.
The dependence on aid underscores the challenges facing the Western-backed government in Kabul, which needs economic growth to help replace foreign money and to provide jobs for the 450,000 people entering the labor market every year.
Lanzer said international financial support for Afghanistan was still strong but that a ceasefire, or at least a fall in violence, would have a significant impact on improving farming, water sources and education across the country.
""We would be available to work with the government in districts where the government isn't present,"" he said.
Peace talks between the United States and the Taliban began last year but have been interrupted at least twice after Taliban attacks on U.S. military personnel in September and December.
Earlier this month, another round of talks kicked off with U.S. Special Representative on Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, meeting repeatedly with the Taliban's chief negotiator."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Berlin will have to take on Britain's mantle as protector of the interests of Europe's smaller, northern liberal democracies after Brexit, Germany's Europe Minister said, forecasting that Britain's departure would rebalance the European Union.
In an interview with Reuters, Europe Minister Michael Roth said Germany would bear a greater responsibility for the wealthy countries to its north and west, which have traditionally lined up behind Britain in backing an economically liberal EU.
""After Brexit, the EU's balance will be realigned,"" he said on Monday. ""For Denmark, Sweden or the Netherlands, Britain was a very important partner. These countries now have an interest in closer ties to Germany.""
Britain is due to leave the bloc on Jan. 31, at which point it will no longer have a say in its workings. Traditionally, London has been seen as an advocate of an EU focused on economic cooperation, aligning it with northern neighbors who were wary of deepening political ties.
But he rejected suggestions that disagreements between Paris and Berlin over the EU's enlargement into the Balkans suggested that the 'Franco-German motor' that has traditionally been at the heart of European integration was now under strain.
Germany has been seen as the fulcrum around which more statist France and more liberal Britain revolved, but Britain's departure would not cause Paris and Berlin to grow apart.
""At the moment we're seeing that while there is broad agreement between Berlin and Paris in many areas, there are also areas where cooperation has snagged - regardless of Brexit,"" he said.
French President Emmanuel Macron caused consternation last year when he vetoed the opening of talks on membership for Albania and North Macedonia, effectively rejecting the key planks of the two countries' foreign policies.

""I hope that we will see movement in this area soon,"" Roth said. ""The EU's (executive) Commission will soon make a proposal on which hopefully all member states can agree.""

ROME (Reuters) - Matteo Salvini's surprisingly clear defeat in a key regional election on Sunday brusquely halts what seemed an unstoppable rise for the Italian hard-right leader and disrupts his progress toward national power.
Salvini campaigned relentlessly in the northerly Emilia-Romagna region, a traditional left-wing stronghold, promising that victory for his League party's candidate as governor would allow him to serve an ""eviction order"" on the government in Rome.
Opinion polls pointed to a neck-and-neck race, but the final count showed the incumbent Democratic Party (PD) governor won comfortably by almost eight points.
""In my opinion the result has hurt Salvini's aura of invincibility,"" said Lorenzo De Sio, politics professor at Rome's Luiss University, adding that he would now find it harder to win a raft of other regional ballots due this year.
Salvini put on a brave face, telling reporters he had done ""everything humanly possible and even a bit more"", to win the region and he was ""absolutely satisfied"" to have eroded the left's support.
Yet even having to explain defeat seemed an unfamiliar and uncomfortable role for the tough-talking, down-to-earth leader who had led his conservative allies to eight straight regional victories since the last national ballot in March 2018.
With Italian markets rallying on the view that the 5-month old government of the PD and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement will now be more stable, things are suddenly looking less rosy for Salvini.
He walked out of government with 5-Star last August, in a failed bid to trigger a national election that polls predicted he would win. Instead, 5-Star joined up with the PD and shunted him into opposition.
Having predicted that victory in Emilia would trigger a government collapse, on Monday he said ""only the good Lord"" knows how long it will remain in office.
His best hope of a quick return to power lies in the crisis of 5-Star, which performed dismally on Sunday after its leader resigned last week. The movement could collapse or panic into bringing down the government, though its caretaker leader said on Monday that it would do neither.
PROBLEMS MOUNTING
The League remains easily Italy's largest party but polls say its support has fallen to about 31% from the 34% it won at European elections in May, as it has shed votes to its ally Brothers of Italy, seen as even further to the right.
Luiss's De Sio said the result in the other region up for grabs on Sunday -- Calabria in Italy's southern toe -- carried another warning for Salvini.
There, the center-right bloc's candidate won an easy victory but the League got fewer votes than either the PD or Silvio Berlusconi's Forza Italia party, Salvini's more conservative mainstream ally.
Last year it seemed the League could eclipse and even absorb the other center-right parties, but De Sio said the Calabria vote showed that ""Salvini can't win without the support of more moderate voters"".
Salvini said his first move after Sunday's elections would be to take a few days off to go fishing. When he comes back he will have plenty of problems on his plate.
The ruling parties are negotiating a new, proportional electoral system that would make it harder for him to win a clear majority whenever the election comes, and he faces several legal problems that could escalate at any time.
Next month, the Senate is expected to authorize magistrates to put him on trial on a kidnapping charge, for preventing migrants from disembarking from a rescue boat when he was interior minister last year.
In two separate financial probes, prosecutors are also investigating the League for possible money laundering and for international corruption over suspicions that it tried to obtain millions of euros via a secret Russian oil deal.
Salvini has also lost perhaps his greatest asset: dominance of Italy's public squares.
The grassroots movement known as the Sardines, which sprang up during the campaign in Emilia, packed the country's piazzas with anti-Salvini rallies and having helped the left to victory, they could now go from strength to strength."

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Gunmen shot dead two protesters in Iraq's southern city of Nassiriya overnight and a Baghdad district became a battlefield on the third day of a drive by security forces to end months of demonstrations against the largely Iran-backed ruling elite.
Clashes over the weekend had already killed at least five protesters and rockets hit the U.S. embassy compound in Baghdad's fortified Green Zone housing government buildings.
Security sources told Reuters three people were wounded when at least one rocket landed inside the U.S. embassy compound, the first time in years that an attack on the Green Zone - a regular occurance - had actually hurt staff there.
The Iraqi military said five Katyusha rockets had hit the Green Zone late on Sunday, without reporting casualties. The U.S. embassy was not immediately available for comment. 
Authorities began the pushback on Saturday to try to end protests that began in the capital on Oct. 1 and in other southern cities. Demonstrators are demanding the removal of all politicians, free elections and an end to corruption.
In Nassiriya, at least 75 protesters were wounded, mainly by live bullets, in overnight clashes when security forces tried to move them away from bridges in the city, police and health sources said.
Unknown gunmen in four pickup trucks had attacked the main protest camp there, shooting dead the two people and setting fire to demonstrators' tents before fleeing the scene, the sources said.
Some protesters began building more permanent structures using bricks, Reuters witnesses said, while others broke into a police office on Monday and set fire to at least five police vehicles parked inside.
The leaderless movement is an unprecedented challenge to Iraq's Shi'ite Muslim-dominated and largely Iran-backed ruling elite, which emerged after a U.S.-led invasion toppled Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003.
""REVOLUTION""
Pitched battles raged in the Khilani area of central Baghdad near Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), on Monday with protesters throwing stones and Molotov cocktails at security forces using tear gas, live rounds in the air and slingshots to push them back.
Some of the demonstrators danced on the protest frontline while others shielded themselves behind concrete blocks and trees or by using metal sheets. 
""This revolution is peaceful. They use various kinds of fire against us, live ammunition, bullets and teargas canisters. I got injured in my face,"" said Allawi, a hooded protester who gave only his first name. 
Tuk tuks darted through the crowd to help the wounded and carried away protesters suffering from teargas inhalation. 
Demonstrations continued in other southern cities, despite repeated attempts by security forces to clear up their camps.
Nearly 500 people have been killed in the unrest, with both security forces and unidentified gunmen shooting people dead.
After a lull earlier this month, demonstrations resumed; protesters have controlled three key bridges in Baghdad and maintain camps and road blocks in several cities in the south.
The government has responded with violence and piecemeal reform. The international community has condemned the violence but not intervened to stop it.
Saturday's push by the authorities began after populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said on Friday that he would halt the involvement of his supporters in the demonstrations.
Sadr had backed the demands of protesters for the removal of corrupt politicians and for the provision of services and jobs soon after the demonstrations began in October, but stopped short of calling on all his followers to join in.

""Everyone has come out protesting against the government,"" said Hussain, a protester. ""We demand that all politicians resign and get out. We don't want Moqtada or any of them.""

PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - France hopes ""good sense"" will prevail and the United States will not slash support for French military operations in West Africa, where groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are expanding their foothold.
Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian made the appeal as Defence Minister Florence Parly was due to meet U.S. counterparts on Monday to discuss the crisis in the Sahel, a band of scrubland south of the Sahara. 
The Pentagon announced plans last year to withdraw hundreds of military personnel from Africa as it redirects resources to address challenges from China and Russia after two decades focused on counter-terrorism operations. Those cuts could deepen following an ongoing global troop review spearheaded by Defense Secretary Mark Esper.
The possibility has alarmed France, which relies on U.S. intelligence and logistics for its 4,500-strong mission in the Sahel. The deaths of 13 French soldiers in a helicopter crash during a combat mission in Mali in November increased France’s determination to secure more support in the zone.
France believes it is time to increase, not ease, pressure on militants to prevent ""Islamic State from rebuilding in the Sahel,"" a senior French defense ministry official told Reuters. 
Parly will put her case on Monday to Esper and National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien. 
“I hope they will be rational to keep this partnership … and that good sense will prevail,” le Drian told reporters.
The U.S. currently has 6,000 military personnel in Africa. Although some experts say a repositioning of forces is overdue, many U.S. officials share French concerns about relieving pressure on militants in Africa.
""Any withdrawal or reduction would likely result in a surge in violent extremist attacks on the continent and beyond,"" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham and Democrat Chris Coons wrote in a letter to Esper this month.
Former colonial power France intervened in 2013 to drive back militants who had seized northern Mali the previous year. Fighters have since regrouped and spread. Over the past year, militants have stepped up attacks in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. 
Although groups in the Sahel are believed to have the intent to carry out attacks against the United States, they are not currently believed to have the capacity to do so, officials say.
SCRAMBLING DRONES
General Francois Lecointre, chief of staff of the French armed forces, told Reuters that the loss of U.S. intelligence from intercepted communications would be the ""biggest setback"".
""I’m doing my utmost to prevent this from happening,"" he said, adding that French drone-based spying systems would not be operational until year-end.
France said this month it would deploy 220 additional troops to the region, despite rising anti-French sentiment in some countries and criticism at home that its forces are bogged down.
Parly recently visited the Sahel with counterparts from Portugal, Sweden and Estonia to press European allies to do more, especially by contributing special forces to a new French-led unit due to be set up this year.
One of the main aims of the outfit, officials said, is to improve coordination between regional troops and French planes able to carry out air strikes.

So far, take-up has been limited with only Estonia committing 40 troops, while discussions continue with eight nations. Germany has refused to take part.

203,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 09:25AM ET</span>","Four months after 'Howdy, Modi!', some Indians abroad protest over citizenship law","By Nivedita Bhattacharjee and Alexandra Ulmer
BENGALURU/MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi got a thunderous reception when he addressed a crowd of more than 50,000 Indian-Americans in a stadium in the U.S. city of Houston last September.
But four months after the event dubbed ""Howdy Modi!,"" intended to deepen relations with the wealthy Indian-American minority which has influence in India, some members of the diaspora have been protesting against a new citizenship law.
In the past month, small demonstrations from Harvard to San Francisco have underlined criticism of what detractors say are Modi's divisive identity politics.
The law, which was promised by Modi before he was re-elected and was approved in December, in effect granted Indian citizenship to non-Muslim religious groups fleeing persecution from three neighboring Muslim-majority countries.
Critics say it is a prelude for the marginalization of Muslims and an affront to India's secular constitution.
""It is still only a minority, but the disenchantment (in the diaspora) is real and deep,"" said a 50-year-old sociologist who gave her name only as Nidhi to avoid straining relations with older relatives who attended Modi's rally in Houston.
Nidhi emigrated to the United States when she was five and has taken part in demonstrations against the citizenship law in the U.S. state of Texas.
""If we as Indo-Americans don't raise our voice, we are complicit,"" she said.
The latest protests were outside Indian diplomatic missions on Sunday, India's Republic Day. A large proportion of the rallies attract student, academics and religious minorities -- groups that have long been worried by Modi's rise.
Many in the diaspora cheered Hindu nationalist Modi to an election victory in 2014, convinced he would transform India into an economic powerhouse.
But India's economy has been sputtering because of an ailing banking sector and tepid rural demand, while protests in India, in which at least 25 people have been killed, have revived the specter of social unrest after years of stability under Modi.
Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Corp's India-born CEO, Satya Nadella, told Buzzfeed News this month the citizenship law was ""bad.""
Even so, a significant chunk of Indians abroad remain die-hard Modi supporters who have staged their own rallies in favor of the law.
SOCIAL MEDIA PUSH
Vijay Chauthaiwale, chief of the foreign affairs department of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said overall diaspora support was intact.
""People believe in the conviction of Mr. Modi. Some transient issue will not affect his popularity,"" Chauthaiwale said.
The BJP has launched a social media push with the diaspora, circulating testimonies from ""persecuted minorities in Pakistan"" who could benefit from the citizenship law.
But Modi's critics say cracks are appearing in his overseas support.
""Those who are educated are saying, 'Hey, this is not what we were expecting,'"" said Sam Pitroda, the opposition Congress party's head of overseas affairs.
Chicago-based Pitroda was unable to provide data, but said he was getting many calls from worried Indians abroad.
Retired engineer Krishna Vavilala, 82, was excited by Modi's rise and recounted being photographed at ""Howdy, Modi!"" - which took its name from what is a popular greeting in Texas - because his beard made him look like the Indian leader.
But recent developments have given him pause.
He suggested that Modi, who has not answered questions at a press conference in India since coming to power six years ago, speak to more reporters. Vavilala also urged Modi to clarify ""perceptions"" that he wants to sideline minorities.
""His heart is in the right place,"" said Vavilala. ""But the euphoria of ""Howdy, Modi!"" has lost its shine."""
204,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 09:07AM ET</span>",Tunisia's biggest party Ennahda rejects new government proposal,"TUNIS (Reuters) - The biggest party in Tunisia's parliament on Monday rejected the idea of a government that excludes other parties, adding that it was ready to contest another election.
The statement by the moderate Islamist Ennahda threatens to upend a second attempt to form a coalition government since elections in October, which fragmented the political establishment.
""We reject the government coalition being confined to some parties,"" said Abd Karim Harouni a senior official of Ennahda, which has been part of recent unity coalitions that included most parties.
Ennahda's own nominee for prime minister failed to push his proposed government through parliament on Jan. 10, giving President Kais Saied the opportunity to nominate his choice for premier, the former finance and tourism minister Elyes Fakhfakh.
Fakhfakh said last week he would not seek to replicate recent unity coalitions, but would instead build a cabinet only from those, including Ennahda, that were ""aligned with the values of the revolution"".
Ennahda's rejection of that proposal means Fakhfakh could struggle to assemble majority support in parliament, risking a new parliamentary election.
It points to a tussle for influence between Ennahda and Saied over the shape of the next government, analysts say, with the party's rejection of Fakhfakh's proposal showing its fear that he will overtake it as the major political force.
Although Ennahda, the best-established party in Tunisia and a key part of successive coalition governments, came first in October's election with 53 of the 217 seats, its vote share declined from previous polls.
Saied won the second-round run-off vote of a separate presidential election in a landslide, but as an independent he lacks a parliamentary base of his own.
Tunisia's prime minister and government are primarily answerable to the parliament, but the president also has a veto over new legislation they introduce.
The second-largest party, Heart of Tunisia, whose leader was defeated by Saied in the presidential election, but which is also an opponent of Ennahda, was one of those which Fakhfakh ruled out of joining the government.
It said his decision contradicted the will of voters and accused Saied of seeking to seize powers and move toward a presidential system of government.
Ennahda's Harouni said all parties needed to be in the government to make it strong enough ""to deal with major challenges and carry out necessary reforms."""
205,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 09:05AM ET</span>",The man with the spider brooch who could cost Macron Paris,"By Elizabeth Pineau
PARIS (Reuters) - Cedric Villani, out campaigning to be the next mayor of Paris, was dressed in his trademark three-piece suit with pocket watch and spider brooch under his overcoat.
""Don't go changing,"" a passerby said as Villani chatted to shoppers and stallholders in the Marche Monge, an open-air market in Paris's Latin quarter. ""You can count on that,"" Villani replied.
Opinion polls show Villani, 46, a mathematician who turned politician three years ago, is a long shot to win the election in March. But he could frustrate efforts by President Emmanuel Macron to claim the mayor's office, one of the biggest prizes in French politics, by splitting the vote and handing the mayoralty to someone else.
On Sunday, Macron called Villani to his office at the Elysee Palace to talk about his election bid. Villani emerged to tell reporters he would not pull out.
The two men have history. Villani used to be a Macron loyalist who in 2017 became a member of parliament with Macron's party. He rebelled when the party passed him over and named Benjamin Griveaux, a long-time Macron aide, as its candidate for mayor.
With the Macron vote split, polls show the front-runners for the mayoral vote are the president's ideological opponents - Anne Hidalgo, the Socialist incumbent, and Rachida Dati, a minister in a previous right-wing government.
On Saturday, before his audience with Macron, Villani said it was up to voters to decide who becomes mayor. ""You don't win an election in Paris via machinations among party machines,"" he told Reuters.
For a day of campaigning on Saturday, Villani set off from his home on the left bank of the river Seine on a Velib rental bike, then switched to the metro to complete the journey to the market.
He shook hands with stallholders and shoppers. Voters asked him about ride-sharing scooters that are left strewn on pavements, trees that have been cut down and a transport strike that hurt small businesses.
Villani - a winner of the Fields Medal, often called the nobel prize of mathematics - says if elected he will invest 5 billion euros in a green program and shift the terminus for long-distance trains out of central Paris.
""I like his intelligence more than anything, his originality, and I believe he's sincere,"" said shopper Christiane Weil.
Villani has not said if there is any symbolism behind the brooch.
It's not the first time a spider brooch has entered politics. Brenda Hale wore one when, as president of Britain's Supreme Court at the height of the Brexit debate, she delivered a ruling that Prime Minister Boris Johnson had acted unlawfully in suspending parliament, lighting up social media.

""Wearing a spider to deliver news that trapped the prime minister felt pointed,"" The Guardian newspaper said.

206,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 09:01AM ET</span>",Bolivia's Anez sparks fierce backlash with election bid,"By Daniel Ramos
LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian politics is back in crisis mode after caretaker leader Jeanine Anez launched plans to run in upcoming presidential elections, sparking criticism from allies and opponents, and prompting at least one minister to resign in protest.
The South American country was gripped by political turmoil in October when a disputed election led to widespread protests that eventually toppled leftist leader Evo Morales. Anez took the interim president role amid the political vacuum.
The conservative former senator, who launched her presidential bid on Friday, had previously said her goal was solely to help the country hold new, transparent elections and that it would not be appropriate for her to run.
""A presidential candidacy disrupts her historic role and the credibility of the transition,"" Carlos Mesa, the runner-up in the Oct. 20 vote and a former ally of Anez, wrote in response to her election plans.
""What is at stake is the international image of the country and of those who have fought with democratic conviction in defense of popular sovereignty.""
Over the weekend at least one of Anez's cabinet, communications minister Roxana Lizárraga, resigned, saying the government had forgotten its ""objectives"" and that running while in office would be a ""betrayal of democracy"".
On Sunday Anez said she had asked all her ministers to resign for a ""new stage of democratic transition"".
Anez said in a speech on Friday she had not intended to run but had decided to be a candidate because of a split opposition vote to Morales' socialist party and what she said was a lack of candidates who could unify the country.
Anez had been seen favorable among those who had taken part in protests against Morales, who angered many by defying term limits to run for a fourth consecutive term. She has restored some calm after a period of deadly protests last year.
""Jeanine Anez has every right to run like any Bolivian,"" said Oscar Robles, a university professor in the highland seat of government La Paz.
Most disagreed, however.
Another ally and presidential hopeful Tuto Quiroga said the move hurt Bolivia's international credibility and put at risk the objective of holding impartial elections.
Morales, currently living in Argentina, said on Twitter that Anez's candidacy was proof there had been a ""coup"" against him, a stance he has long held since his November resignation.
Morales is not running in the 2020 election, but has appointed former economy minister Luis Arce as the candidate of his Movement for Socialism (MAS) party. Polls show MAS leading in a split field against a number of opposition parties.
Local newspaper Los Tiempos in an editorial also criticized Anez's decision saying it ""transgressed a kind of tacit pact"" and urged her to withdraw her candidacy.
""I don't agree with Jeanine Anez being a candidate; it removes impartiality and transparency from the election,"" said Remberto López, a taxi driver in La Paz.
""The people no longer want fraud."""

Militants loyal to Islamic State have been waging an insurgency in the north of the Sinai Peninsula and other parts of the country that has killed hundreds of soldiers, police and residents.
A Cairo criminal court sentenced eight defendants to life terms and 29 to terms ranging from one to 15 years, after prosecutors accused them of planning attacks, promoting the group's ideology in prisons and financing its cells, the judicial sources said. Seven were acquitted.
The defendants, all of whom pleaded not guilty, can appeal against the sentence at the court of cassation, Egypt's top civilian court.
Separately, another Cairo criminal court referred the cases of three men accused over a 2018 failed assassination attempt against Alexandria's security chief to Egypt's top religious authority, paving the way for possible death sentences, judicial sources said.
Prosecutors said the defendants were part of a militant group called Hasm, which the government describes as an armed wing of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood. The group denies any link with any militant activity."

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Of the hundreds of testimonies he heard from survivors of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz, retired German prosecutor Gerhard Wiese says the one that touched him most was of a Jewish father who had tried but failed to save his twins from the gas chamber.
The father had offered his children to Josef Mengele, the Nazi officer known as the Angel of Death for his inhumane genetic experiments focused on twins, hoping they stood a better chance of survival.
But Mengele waved them away to the gas chamber, said Wiese, the last surviving prosecutor of the Auschwitz trials which took place in Frankfurt in the 1960s of hundreds of ex-members of Adolf Hitler's feared SS group for their roles in the Holocaust.
""After this witness statement there was absolute silence in the room,"" said 91-year-old Wiese, as Germany and the world mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz. ""One wave of the hand - that's all it took for a fate to be sealed.""
More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished at Auschwitz, the death camp set up by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland in 1940 to carry out Hitler's ""Final Solution"" to exterminate European Jews.
World leaders were due to join Holocaust survivors at Auschwitz later on Monday to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the camp by Soviet troops.
Wiese is alarmed by a rising trend among Germans to distance themselves from Nazi crimes.
""Even if some people don't like it, you have to keep reminding them: 'you were born in this country and you have to live with its history: the good and the bad parts',"" he said.
The German government is alarmed by rising anti-Semitism and hate crime. Last year, an anti-Semitic gunman killed two people near a synagogue in the eastern city of Halle and a far-right sympathizer was arrested on suspicion of killing a pro-immigration politician.
""CULT OF GUILT""
Mainstream parties accuse the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) party of contributing to an atmosphere of hate that encourages political violence. AfD leaders have also been accused of downplaying Nazi crimes.
On Monday, an AfD lawmaker was condemned for saying that Germany should put an end to its ""cult of guilt"" over the Holocaust.
Stefan Raepple, an AfD lawmaker in the southern state of Baden Wuerttemberg, took issue with German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier's decision to deliver a speech at Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem last week in English, not in German, to avoid using the ""language of the perpetrator""."

LONDON (Reuters) - A public inquiry into the 2017 fire at London's Grenfell Tower, which killed 72 people, began to zero in on Monday on how the densely populated social housing block was allowed to become a tinder box and who was to blame.
The 23-storey tower, owned by the wealthy west London borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was destroyed on the night of June 14, 2017, in Britain's worst fire in a residential building since World War Two.
The disaster shocked the nation, prompting an outpouring of grief as well as soul-searching over allegations by survivors that neglect of their ethnically mixed, largely low-income community had played a part.
In its first phase, now complete, the public inquiry led by retired judge Martin Moore-Bick examined in forensic detail the sequence of events on the night of the blaze.
The second phase will look into events in the years leading up to the fire, in particular a recent refurbishment during which flammable cladding was fitted to the external walls, the key factor in the rapid spread of the fire.
Witnesses who will give evidence in the phase two public hearings will include representatives from the architects, contractors and sub-contractors who carried out the refurbishment, and from the makers and sellers of the cladding.
In a statement introducing phase two, the inquiry's lead counsel Richard Millett said that out of all the bodies involved in the refurbishment, only the Kensington and Chelsea local authority, which commissioned it, had admitted any failings.
In written statements submitted by their lawyers, the companies involved had refused to admit any mistakes or sub-standard work, Millett said, describing their attitude as ""a merry-go-round of buck-passing"".
""One finds in these detailed and carefully crafted statements no trace of any acceptance of any responsibility for what happened at Grenfell Tower,"" he said.
The main contractor in charge of the refurbishment was privately owned British firm Rydon. The cladding supplier was the U.S. firm Arconic Inc, while the makers of the insulation material used as part of the cladding system were Celotex Corp, a U.S. subsidiary of France's Saint-Gobain.
London's Metropolitan Police, who are conducting their own investigation into the fire, have said they were considering possible criminal charges including gross negligence manslaughter, corporate manslaughter and breaches of the Health and Safety Act.
But the police have said they would not announce any decisions on charges until the public inquiry had concluded, because they needed to take into account its findings.
Phase one of the inquiry, now complete, established that the fire had started in a fourth-floor flat due to a faulty refrigerator, before breaking out to the external cladding and engulfing the tower, re-entering the building via the windows."

BANJUL (Reuters) - Gambian police arrested 137 people and more than two dozen were injured as protests calling for President Adama Barrow to honor a pledge to step down after three years in office turned violent for the first time, the government said.
Barrow came to power after a 2016 election, ending 22 years of authoritarian rule by Yahya Jammeh. But he has reneged on his campaign promise to step down by this month, saying the constitution requires him to serve out a full five-year term.
In response, a movement called ""Three Years Jotna"" - which means ""enough"" in the local Wolof language - began protesting last month to demand his departure.
On Sunday, police intervened when protesters deviated from the planned route on the outskirts of the capital Banjul in order to march toward the city center, the government said.
In a statement late on Sunday, government spokesman Ebrima Sankareh said the protesters had stormed a police barricade and chanted that they planned to unseat Barrow.
""The protesters became riotous and violent by obstructing roads and burning tyres and logs on the highway as well as setting up fires in nearby bushes and on government wetland,"" Sankareh said.
Eighteen police officers and seven civilians were injured, Sankareh said, adding some of those among the 137 arrested were executive members of Three Years Jotna.
The government also decided to ban Three Years Jotna, Sankareh said, calling it ""a subversive, violent and illegal movement"", and suspended two radio stations it accused of inciting violence during demonstrations.
Opposition leaders could not be immediately reached for comment.
After winning plaudits at the beginning of his tenure for committing to respect rights and establish a truth commission to investigate abuses under Jammeh, Barrow is facing multiple challenges.
Hundreds of Jammeh's supporters demonstrated earlier this month to demand the former president be allowed to return to Gambia from exile in Equatorial Guinea. Jammeh fled there in January 2017 under military pressure from West African countries to respect his election loss to Barrow.
The government has said Jammeh will be arrested if he returns to Gambia for killings, torture and other abuses allegedly committed by his security forces. Jammeh denies those allegations.
Barrow also faces a weak economy, hobbled by massive debts incurred by Jammeh's government."
213,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 27, 2020 07:13AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hackers acting in Turkey's interests believed to be behind recent cyberattacks - sources,"By Jack Stubbs, Christopher Bing and Joseph Menn
LONDON (Reuters) - Sweeping cyberattacks targeting governments and other organizations in Europe and the Middle East are believed to be the work of hackers acting in the interests of the Turkish government, three senior Western security officials said.
The hackers have attacked at least 30 organizations, including government ministries, embassies and security services as well as companies and other groups, according to a Reuters review of public internet records. Victims have included Cypriot and Greek government email services and the Iraqi government's national security advisor, the records show.
The attacks involve intercepting internet traffic to victim websites, potentially enabling hackers to obtain illicit access to the networks of government bodies and other organizations.
According to two British officials and one U.S. official, the activity bears the hallmarks of a state-backed cyber espionage operation conducted to advance Turkish interests. 
The officials said that conclusion was based on three elements: the identities and locations of the victims, which included governments of countries that are geopolitically significant to Turkey; similarities to previous attacks that they say used infrastructure registered from Turkey; and information contained in confidential intelligence assessments that they declined to detail.
The officials said it wasn’t clear which specific individuals or organizations were responsible but that they believed the waves of attacks were linked because they all used the same servers or other infrastructure.
Turkey’s Interior Ministry declined to comment. A senior Turkish official did not respond directly to questions about the campaign but said Turkey was itself frequently a victim of cyberattacks.
The Cypriot government said in a statement that the “relevant agencies were immediately aware of the attacks and moved to contain” them. ""We will not comment on specifics for reasons of national security,"" it added.
Officials in Athens said they had no evidence the Greek government email system was compromised. The Iraqi government did not respond to requests for comment.
The Cypriot, Greek and Iraqi attacks identified by Reuters all occurred in late 2018 or early 2019, according to the public internet records. The broader series of attacks is ongoing, according to the officials as well as private cybersecurity investigators.
A spokeswoman for the UK’s National Cyber Security Centre, which is part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, declined to comment on who was behind the attacks. In the United States, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on who was behind the attacks and the Federal Bureau of Investigation did not respond to a request for comment.
HIJACKED
The attacks highlight a weakness in a core pillar of online infrastructure that can leave victims exposed to attacks that happen outside their own networks, making them difficult to detect and defend against, cybersecurity specialists said.
The hackers used a technique known as DNS hijacking, according to the Western officials and private cybersecurity experts. This involves tampering with the effective address book of the internet, called the Domain Name System (DNS), which enables computers to match website addresses with the correct server. 
By reconfiguring parts of this system, hackers were able to redirect visitors to imposter websites, such as a fake email service, and capture passwords and other text entered there.
Reuters reviewed public DNS records, which showed when website traffic was redirected to servers identified by private cybersecurity firms as being controlled by the hackers. All of the victims identified by Reuters had traffic to their websites hijacked - often traffic visiting login portals for email services, cloud storage servers and online networks -- according to the records and cybersecurity experts who have studied the attacks. 
The attacks have been occurring since at least early 2018, the records show.
While small-scale DNS attacks are relatively common, the scale of these attacks has alarmed Western intelligence agencies, said the three officials and two other U.S. intelligence officials. The officials said they believed the attacks were unrelated to a campaign using a similar attack method uncovered in late 2018.
As part of these attacks, hackers successfully breached some organizations that control top-level domains, which are the suffixes that appear at the end of web addresses immediately after the dot symbol, said James Shank, a researcher at U.S. cybersecurity firm Team Cymru, which notified some of the victims.
VICTIMS
Victims also included Albanian state intelligence, according to the public internet records. Albanian state intelligence had hundreds of usernames and passwords compromised as a result of the attacks, according to one of the private cybersecurity investigators, who was familiar with the intercepted web traffic.
The Albanian State Information Service said the attacks were on non-classified infrastructure, which does not store or process any “any information classified as ‘state secret’ of any level.”
Civilian organizations in Turkey have also been attacked, the records show, including a Turkish chapter of the Freemasons, which conservative Turkish media has said is linked to U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen accused by Ankara of masterminding a failed coup attempt in 2016.
The Great Liberal Lodge of Turkey said there were no records of cyberattacks against the hijacked domains identified by Reuters and that there had been “no data exfiltration.”
""Thanks to precautions, attacks against the sites are not possible,"" a spokesman said, adding that the cleric has no affiliation with the organization. 
The cleric has publicly denied masterminding the attempted coup, saying “it’s not possible,” and has said he is always against coups.

A spokesman for Gulen said Gulen was not involved in the coup attempt and has repeatedly condemned it and its perpetrators. Gulen has never been associated with the Freemason organization, the spokesman added.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean sexual abuse victim who took on the Catholic Church has announced plans to form a new political party, one of several that has emerged since protests rocked the country late last year.
James Hamilton, a doctor who was one of the first people in Chile to come forward claiming he was the victim of child sexual abuse by clergy, has called his party Dignity.
The name is a reference to the public square in the Chilean capital where protesters have gathered over the past three months to denounce inequality and high living costs.
Hamilton is seeking to unite his countrymen around ""principles"" rather than ideologies of left and right.
He was one of several men who accused now-defrocked Santiago parish priest Fernando Karadima of sexually abusing them as boys. Karadima, who denied wrongdoing, was found guilty in a Vatican investigation but not prosecuted due to the statute of limitations.
Hamilton, who won $146,000 in “moral damages” last year in the case, said he saw himself as continuing his battle against the abuse of the weak by the powerful.
""We have to try to change the soul of politics,"" he told journalists in Santiago on Friday.
His party is one of eight that have sought registration with the electoral board since the protests broke out in October, compared to just one in the same period the previous year, data showed.
If they succeed in gathering the required signatures from supporters and funding, the nascent parties, whose names include Party of the People, A Fairer Chile and Party for Citizen Representation, pose a potentially significant challenge to the 21 established parties of left and right.
Those parties are facing a widespread legitimacy crisis after the worst unrest since the end of the regime of General Augusto Pinochet in 1990 brought the country to a halt and left them struggling to respond to widespread public fury.
President Sebastian Pinera´s center-right government has been accused by protesters of overlooking entrenched inequality and failing to stamp out alleged human rights abuses by police and soldiers.
The fractured opposition has also faced criticism that it is focused on politicking instead of seeking concrete solutions to the public discontent and failing to wholesale condemn the violence at the protests´ fringes, which has caused millions of dollars of damage to infrastructure and businesses.
In a poll published last week, politicians of all stripes were panned. Only 2% of respondents said they had confidence in established political parties and 72% identified themselves as without political allegiance.
Mireya Dávila, an academic with Chile´s Public Affairs Institute, said the ground was fertile for a new breed of politicians with the ""moral legitimacy"" of Hamilton, who also pioneered the use of robotics in surgery in Chile.
""We will have to see if he has the leadership capacity and political intuition to keep himself above the fray,"" she said."

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenian Prime Minister Marjan Sarec said he was sending his resignation to parliament on Monday and called for an early election, saying his minority government could not push through important legislation.
The government coalition of five center-left parties held only 43 out of 90 seats in parliament and lost the informal support of the opposition Left Party in November, finding it ever harder to get bills through parliament.
""With this coalition, this situation in parliament, I cannot fulfill the expectations of the people,"" Sarec told a news conference. ""I would be able to fulfill them after an election.""
Just before his statement, the national news agency STA reported the resignation of Finance Minister Andrej Bertoncelj.
On Friday, Bertoncelj issued a statement protesting new legislation proposed by Sarec's LMS party, under which the budget would cover losses of the national health system, saying that would not be acceptable.
Analysts said the opposition center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), which is the largest party in parliament, is likely to try to form a new government. An early election would take place only if that attempt fails.
The next election is scheduled for the middle of 2022.

Britain will leave the EU on Friday, drawing a line under years of debate about whether the country will be better off outside the bloc, and beginning the process of redefining its economy, its national priorities and its place in the world.
""As we leave the EU I want to send a message that the UK is open to the most talented minds in the world, and stand ready to support them to turn their ideas into reality,"" Johnson said in a statement announcing the new scheme.
From Feb. 20, scientists and researchers will be able to get their visa applications speeded up if they have been endorsed by one of four national bodies. There is no cap on the number of these 'Global Talent' visas.
The changes announced on Monday were flagged during the late 2019 election campaign and replace a similar system which mostly applied to non-EU nationals, and which was limited to 2,000 visas per year.
Johnson's government has already outlined broader immigration reforms, expected to be set out in legislation in the coming months. The points-based system will seek to limit the rights of low-skilled workers to settle in Britain while trying to provide industry with the skilled workers they need."

ELAZIG, Turkey (Reuters) - The death toll rose to 39 from the earthquake that struck eastern Turkey on Friday, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said on Monday, as rescue teams continued the search for two others who remained under a collapsed building.
The magnitude 6.8 quake caused 35 deaths in Elazig province and four in neighboring Malatya. More than 1,600 others were hurt, including 86 still being treated in hospitals, though none were in serious condition, the government said.
The two remaining people were under the remains of a building in Elazig, about 550 km (340 miles) east of Ankara. Forty-five people had been rescued from under the rubble so far in the search, which was winding down on Sunday evening.
Authorities have warned residents not to enter damaged buildings because of the danger of collapse and further aftershocks, leaving many without a home in a region where temperatures fell to -6 C (21.2°F) on Monday morning.
Addressing reporters in Elazig, Soylu updated the death toll and said the government would provide financial support to those whose homes were damaged. Some 1,000 temporary homes would be built, and some schools and mosques were now being used as shelters, he added.
Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum said authorities had started demolishing 22 damaged buildings in Elazig. Construction of some 2,000 new houses in the province is expected to be completed by year end, he added.
Turkey has a history of powerful earthquakes. More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, a quake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500."

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan Markle's estranged father Thomas said on Monday that he was prepared to face his daughter in court and that she and her husband Prince Harry had hurt Queen Elizabeth by abruptly stepping back from royal duties. 
Harry, the British monarch's grandson, and Meghan, duchess of Sussex, agreed with the queen this month that they would no longer work as royals after their surprise announcement that they wanted to carve out ""a progressive new role"" which they hope to finance themselves.
""I think they've hurt the queen, I think they've hurt the royals, and it just doesn't work,"" Markle told ITV's Good Morning Britain program. ""I'm a little embarrassed for them and feeling really sorry for the queen.""
""The break from the royals is going to cause far more problems.""
Harry has spoken of his sadness at being forced to give up his royal duties in a deal with the queen, saying there was no other option if he his wife Meghan were to seek an independent future away from stifling media intrusion.
Under the arrangement, Harry will remain a prince and the couple will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they begin a new life split between Britain and North America, where they will spend the majority of their time. 
""This decision to make a break from the royals is very confusing, I don't think anyone understands or can figure out how this happened or why it happened - it makes no sense,"" Markle said.
Markle, who lives in Mexico, has given a number of TV interviews in which he has criticized his daughter, saying they were the only way he could communicate with her.
Meghan has not publicly commented on the situation with her father, but friends of hers told People Magazine last year Markle had not tried to get in touch with her and she was devastated by his actions.
He missed the couple's glittering wedding in 2018 due to health problems and has been estranged from his daughter since then. He said he had never met Harry or his grandson, the couple's baby son Archie.
The Sussexes are now in Canada as they plan their future. 
""I REALLY MISS MY DAUGHTER""
However, Markle could face Meghan in court. She is suing The Mail on Sunday newspaper over its publication of a private letter she sent to him, in breach of her copyright and human rights. The paper aims to use his evidence in the legal battle.
""If it comes to meeting them in a courtroom, that's great - at least I finally get to see them, but I don't want to face off or have a battle with them,"" Markle said. He added that he had asked the newspaper to publish the letter.
Harry has accused the tabloid press of bullying his wife, likening their treatment to that which his mother Princess Diana suffered. Supporters of the couple say some negative coverage has been fueled by racism.
However, Markle said he did not think that Meghan had faced racist media coverage in Britain: ""I don't buy that.""
""I really miss my daughter,"" Markle added, saying she had ""ghosted"" him. 
""I love my daughter and I certainly would love my grandson and I'd love Harry if I met him, I'm sure,"" he said, adding that the prince, sixth-in-line to the British throne, should have come to visit him to ask for his daughter's hand in marriage.

When asked what he would say now to Prince Harry, he said: ""Man up and come down and see me.""

KIGALI (Reuters) - Rwanda, often lauded internationally for its economic progress and reintegration after the 1994 genocide, is detaining and abusing street children at a holding center in the capital, an international rights group said Monday.
Two homeless boys who had been held at the holding center, known as the Gikondo Transit Centre, confirmed to Reuters that they had been abused there, giving accounts that were similar to those compiled from 30 children in the report by the New York-based group Human Rights Watch.
Rwanda’s justice minister, Johnston Busingye, said the center trains young people in skills including carpentry and welding and rehabilitates them from life on the streets.
""These centers are run in full compliance with law,"" he said in a text message to Reuters.
Rwanda adopted a law in 2017 that defines Gikondo, open since 2005, as a rehabilitation center for people including minors exhibiting ""deviant"" behavior. Human Rights Watch said the government is arbitrarily arresting and holding people there, and subjecting them to ill treatment.
Human Rights Watch said it had interviewed 30 children aged 11 to 17 between January and October 2019 who had previously been detained at Gikondo. All but two of them had said officials at the center beat them. Children said they had to share lice-infested mattresses with other children, access to medical care was sporadic and there was no support for rehabilitation.
President Paul Kagame, who won a third term in office in 2017, is praised abroad for steering a peaceful recovery in Rwanda since the 1994 genocide, when extremists from the Hutu ethnic majority killed an estimated 800,000 minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus.
But he has also been criticized for what rights groups say are widespread abuses, a muzzling of independent media, and suppression of political opposition.
Nelly Nshutinamagara, 12, who lives on the streets of Kigali, told Reuters he was arrested by police at night, taken to Gikondo, and beaten with batons.
""They treat us badly by using batons…when one child makes a mistake, they beat us all,"" he told Reuters in an interview after he was released earlier this month.
Another child, nine-year-old Francois Muhizi, told Reuters: ""They lock us inside a big hall and refuse to let us out to urinate.""
Human Rights Watch urged the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child, which begins a review of Rwanda's policies on Monday, to call for the immediate closure of the center. Rwanda ratified the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991.
“Rwandan authorities claim they are rehabilitating street children,” said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. “But instead, they are locking them up in inhuman and degrading conditions, without due process, and exposing them to beatings and abuse.”"

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's right-wing League leader Matteo Salvini failed to overturn decades of leftist rule in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna on Sunday in an election that brought relief to the center-left and the embattled government.
Salvini had campaigned relentlessly in the region since the start of the year, seeking a shock victory that he hoped would bring down the national coalition government, which includes the PD and is riven by internal strife.
""The ruling majority comes out (of the regional elections) stronger,"" said PD leader Nicola Zingaretti, adding that Salvini had failed in his attempt to ""shove the government out"". 
With 99% of the ballots counted, incumbent Democratic Party (PD) governor Stefano Bonaccini had won 51.4% of the vote compared to 43.7% for the League's candidate.
Opinion polls had pointed to a neck-and-neck race, and the defeat by almost eight points was a clear and rare reversal for Salvini, who had promised to serve the government with an ""eviction order"" if he won.
Italian government bonds rallied on Monday, with yields falling to their lowest in almost three months as markets saw the result as positive for the stability of the 5-month old government.
There was no obligation for the government to resign had Salvini won, but after eight consecutive regional election victories, another triumph in Emilia-Romagna would have put the fractious ruling coalition under intense pressure.
""I don't feel defeated, you can win and you can lose but if I lose I'll be happy anyway and I'll work twice as hard,"" Salvini said late on Sunday when the contest looked like being much closer than the final result.
His rightist bloc did secure a resounding victory in a separate regional election on Sunday in the underdeveloped southern toe of Italy, Calabria.
""CLEAR AND BEAUTIFUL""
But the main prize was undoubtedly Emilia-Romagna, one of Italy's wealthiest regions, which is home to the Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) sports car and Parmesan cheese and has been an impregnable leftist stronghold for generations.
""Emilia-Romagna has sent a signal. Salvini knows how to talk about problems, but he doesn't know how to sort them out and the people have responded,"" Zingaretti said.
Former Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who now heads a small centrist party in the ruling coalition, hailed Bonaccini's ""clear and beautiful victory."" 
Underscoring the enormous interest in the ballot, turnout hit 68%, some 30 points up on the last such election in 2014.
But while the PD dodged disaster, its coalition partner, the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, won just 3.5% of the vote in Emilia-Romagna and little more than 7% in Calabria.
The party was the largest group in 2018 national elections with 33% backing, but has seen its support slide in recent months leading to a wave of defections amongst its lawmakers and the resignation of its leader Luigi Di Maio.
Its caretaker leader Vito Crimi said on Monday the party must stick together and continue to support the government.
Political analysts predicted that Sunday's results would weaken 5-Star's standing within the coalition and give the PD more power to drive its own policy priorities.
""Looking ahead, the government will likely continue to struggle to deliver on most policy fronts... The 5-Star will be internally torn, at the very least, until its planned congress in March,"" said Wolfango Piccoli in a Teneo research note, noting that the risk of a snap general election was lower. 
In a political blunder, Salvini walked out of government with 5-Star last August, expecting to trigger a national election that polls predicted he would win.
Instead, 5-Star joined up with the PD and shunted him into opposition. Looking to exact revenge, Salvini has since concentrated all his efforts on winning a stream of local votes.
Bonaccini was helped in Emilia by a grassroots movement that sprang up during the campaign, earning itself the name ""the Sardines"" by packing local squares with anti-Salvini rallies.
The Sardines would probably have faded away if Salvini had won, but are now expected to try to give structure to their movement and try to bolster the centre-left.
Salvini's anti-immigrant, anti-European message resonated during the campaign, as did his pledge to slash taxes.

But incumbent Bonaccini had one of the highest approval ratings of any Italian regional chief and his strategy of focusing exclusively on core local issues proved successful.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranians should not allow U.S. President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" approach to harm national unity ahead of parliamentary elections, President Hassan Rouhani said in a speech, lashing out at hardliners over mass disqualification of candidates.
Iran's clerical rulers face challenges in keeping the economy afloat under increasingly tough U.S. sanctions imposed by Washington after it withdrew in 2018 from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers. Vital oil exports have been slashed.
""We should not let Trump succeed in creating gaps between the establishment and people ... We should remain united ... Don't turn your back on (Feb. 21) elections. Let's have a high turn out,"" said Rouhani in a speech broadcast live on his official website.
""We should not let Trump and those terrorists in the White House isolate Iran."" 
Iran's hardline Guardians Council, which vets all election candidates, has disqualified about 9,000 of the 14,000 who registered to run in the elections. Moderates say in most cities they have no candidates to enter the race. 
""This parliamentary election is a very important election ... I have written letters to relevant authorities to resolve the issue of disqualifications,"" said Rouhani. 
""You (hardliners) claim that you will win the election. That is fine, but just let the election be a competitive one."" 
Since Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, its rulers have swept aside challenges to their grip on power. But the gap between them and the people has widened since last year, when hundreds were killed in anti-government protests. Iran has yet to announce the death toll and rejects figures published by human rights organizations. 
Tehran also risks a legitimacy crisis amid mounting public fury and international criticism over the belated admission of blame by Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards for shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane by mistake. 
Angry Iranians took to streets to protest against the delayed admission by the Guards.
The distrust between the rulers and the ruled, combined with economic hardship, bodes ill for the parliamentary vote in February, when Iran's rulers typically seek a high turnout to show their legitimacy, even if the outcome will not change any major policy. 
""I am calling on our nation to vote,"" Rouhani said. ""Even if you have criticism over issues and problems, please cast your vote.""

BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (Reuters) - In Zimbabwe's second city Bulawayo, Abraham Kavalanjila and his two sons have given up waiting for the water to come back on, and trekked out into the maize fields to draw on an open well.
They know it is risky drinking untreated water from a borehole used by so many other people. ""We have no option. This water is dangerous as you can see, just check,"" says Kavalanjila, pointing to a pile of human waste nearby.
City authorities say they have had to shut down water supplies for 96 hours a week - more than half the time, often in two-day blocks - to cope with a sharp fall in reservoir levels caused by the country's worst drought in years.
The shortages have exacerbated an economic crisis marked by shortages of foreign exchange, fuel, medicines and power that has triggered protests and political unrest.
Kavalanjila says the cut-offs often go on for longer than scheduled in his Luveve township. 
He carries the well water home in buckets and containers then his wife Rumbidzai boils it before using it for bathing, flushing toilets and, sometimes, cooking.
""At times you see there will be little organisms in the water and even when you are bathing you feel your body itching,"" Rumbidzai told Reuters in the local Ndebele language while her nine-year-old son had a bath to get ready for school.
""So if you boil the water it gets better.
DELAYED DAM
Bulawayo city has decommissioned two of its dams after water fell below pumping levels, according to the city's director of engineering services Simelani Dube.
The remaining four dams have an average capacity of 35% and falling, he added. ""We are projecting that in the next three to four weeks we might lose the third dam. It's currently sitting above 10% in terms of capacity."" 
Authorities say the long-term answer is for Bulawayo to build a new dam 100km (60 miles) away to draw water direct from the Zambezi River. 
But the project, first mooted in 1912 by white colonists and finally started in 2004 is still is only a third complete.
Cassian Mugomezi, a sprightly 84-year old pensioner who has lived in the Luveve township for more than five decades, said the water cuts were some of the worst he could remember.
""If it does not rain this year I don't know what we are going to do,"" he said.

Like Kavalanjila, he has had to rely on open wells and other privately-run projects. A nearby church pumps out clean water through its own borehole. Today, though, it is shut down in one of the city's regular power cuts that can last up for 18 hours.

SEOUL (Reuters) - While a North Korean deadline for the United States to soften its stand on denuclearization talks passed uneventfully over the New Year, state media and propaganda efforts have been focusing on the prospect of a long confrontation with the United States.
Optimism that two years of contacts between leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump would usher in a new age, and related hopes for economic improvement after decades of deprivation, appear to have faded.
Instead, the government has been hard at work in recent weeks using state media, propaganda posters, and performances to warn the public of a bumpy road ahead under U.S. and international pressure.
The propaganda effort has included calls for North Koreans to ""break through barriers"" and strengthen the country.
The weekend's Lunar New Year celebrations included a concert for Kim and other dignitaries with tributes to the country's leaders for overcoming adversity.
It is a familiar message for North Koreans, but one that now underscores that the leadership does not foresee a breakthrough in diplomacy any time soon.
""The message will be that because of the U.S. hostile policy and sanctions, that things will be more difficult for the foreseeable future,"" said Andray Abrahamian, a visiting scholar with George Mason University Korea.
Behind the scenes, North Korean officials still say they are seeking badly needed sanctions relief, said one European scholar who regularly attends informal meetings with North Korean representatives.
Publicly, North Korea has said it is no longer bound by commitments to halt nuclear and missile testing, blaming the United States for failing to meet the year-end deadline for it to show more flexibility in the nuclear talks and its ""brutal and inhumane"" sanctions.
Since Kim came to power in 2011, many North Koreans have steadily seen living conditions improve compared with deprivation and even famines of the 1990s.
In 2018, Kim doubled down by declaring the ""completion"" of the nuclear weapons program would allow the government to focus on economic development.
'WORRYING TIME'
But the failure to win sanctions relief is putting Kim in a sensitive spot.
""In 2012, Kim promised that there would be no more belt tightening, so for him to call on the country to prepare for exactly that sends a very clear message,"" Abrahamian said.
""Most North Koreans have seen their economic prospects improve under Kim Jong Un so I’m sure this is a worrying time for them.""
The propaganda push is designed to support a line Kim set out in a speech at the end of last year calling for North Koreans to brace for an “arduous and prolonged struggle” and to foster a self-reliant economy because of a delay in the anticipated lifting of sanctions, analysts said.
Kim used that speech to acknowledge North Korea may need to ""tighten our belts"" for the time being.
But state media and propaganda have not yet widely pushed that line widely, likely in part because of Kim's past promises, said Rachel Minyoung Lee, an analyst with NK News, a website that monitors North Korea.
""It is a controversial term and North Korea will likely roll it out very subtly and carefully,"" she said.
The final months of 2019 saw senior officials warning the United States not to ignore its threat of a ""new way"" if it did not offer more concessions in talks aimed at getting North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons.
Beyond a warning from Kim that the world would soon see a ""new strategic weapon"", however, the deadline passed uneventfully.
Since then, the North's state media has been ominously quiet on the issue of talks with the United States.
""I have a feeling they're biding their time to roll out some changes to their foreign policy, including US policy, and North Korea may make its intentions clearer as it gets closer to the showcasing of its 'new strategic weapon',"" Lee said.

Another 6,000 employees at sawmills, plywood mills and other forestry plants had already planned to strike on Monday, bringing the overall outage to about 15,000 workers.
Employers have promised to respond with a lockout of workers at a dozen plants from Feb. 10 unless a deal is reached by then, further paralyzing Finland's forestry industry - a major source of export revenue.
""Strikes and lockouts will be terminated earlier if the outcome of the negotiations is reached between the parties and approved by both sides,"" the Paperiliitto union said, adding that the next round of talks are scheduled for Tuesday.

The incident came after a group of protesters on Sunday set alight the lobby of a newly built residential building in Hong Kong that authorities had planned to use as a quarantine facility, as fears grow over a coronavirus outbreak in mainland China.
Hong Kong has been convulsed with demonstrations over the past seven months centered on its relationship with mainland China, with anger fueled by what protesters see as growing interference from Beijing.
The device exploded in a toilet cubicle at the Caritas Medical Centre at about 2.30 a.m. local time, police said in a statement.

The motive for the hospital explosion was not known.
There have been calls by pro-democracy legislators, activists and a medical staff union in recent days for Hong Kong to shut the border with the mainland to prevent the coronavirus from spreading.
Hong Kong on Sunday barred residents of China's Hubei province, the center of the virus outbreak, from entering the city. Chief Executive Carrie Lam last week dismissed a border closure as inappropriate and impractical.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to disclose details of his long-delayed Middle East peace proposal to Israeli leaders on Monday, as he attempts to generate some momentum toward resolving one of the world's most intractable problems.
Trump will hold separate, back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Benny Gantz, the head of the centrist Blue and White Party, who is Netanyahu's rival in March 2 elections.
On Tuesday, Trump will deliver joint remarks with Netanyahu at the White House, where the president may reveal details of his peace proposal.
The two days of foreign policy meetings will provide Trump with a contrast from the trial in the Republican-led Senate that is weighing articles of impeachment against him approved by the Democratic-led House of Representatives.
But whether it truly will jumpstart the long-stalled effort to bring Israelis and Palestinians together is far from certain.
Palestinians have refused to engage the Trump administration on the effort and roundly denounced a $50-billion economic revival plan it set forth last July to lift the Palestinian and neighboring Arab state economies.
Palestinians fear the plan will dash their hopes for an independent state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.
The White House hope was that if Trump could get the support of both Netanyahu and Gantz for the plan, it would help provide some momentum. A U.S. official said Trump wants to know both Netanyahu and Gantz are on board with the plan before announcing it.
Trump’s message to both: ""You have six weeks to get this (plan) going, if you want it,"" the official said.
Having both leaders present helps take the politics out of the effort, said a U.S. source familiar with internal deliberations.
""The rationale...is it depoliticizes this to the point that, no matter what happens on March 2, the two leaders of the two largest parties can potentially be supportive,"" the source said.
The Trump plan is the product of three years' effort by senior advisers Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz, as well as Jason Greenblatt, who left the government last autumn.
Trump last year had hoped to release his secret proposal aimed at triggering negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, but was forced to delay it as Netanyahu struggled to form a governing coalition.
The proposal, more than 50 pages long, aims to take on some of the most difficult issues separating the two, such as the status of Jerusalem. Palestinians want the city’s eastern part as their future capital.
Trump, talking to reporters on Air Force One on Thursday, said he was eager to release his plan.
""They say that's the hardest of all deals. I love doing deals,"" he said.
Netanyahu, a veteran right-wing leader, faces political and legal troubles at home as he heads for his third election in less than a year, and was indicted on criminal charges in November. He denies any wrongdoing.
Netanyahu's principal domestic political rival, Gantz, a centrist former general, last week lifted his objection to having the peace plan published before Israel's March election. He had previously seen it as interference in the vote.
""I am looking forward to meeting the president - a president of utmost friendliness to the State of Israel - on a matter that is very important for the State of Israel - with national, strategic and security ramifications,"" Gantz told reporters as he landed in Washington on Sunday.
""We will hold a back-and-forth, get to know one another, and take it from there.""
But Trump, preoccupied with November's re-election bid, faces his own political clock, and can ill afford to wait months for Israel to decide its next prime minister, a U.S. official said."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A recent respite for Australian firefighters that brought rains and cooler weather is set to end, meteorologists warned on Monday, with hot conditions forecast for later this week raising a risk that blazes may start spreading again.
Australia experiences regular bushfires over summer, but this season's fires began early and have claimed 33 lives in the past four months, killed millions of animals and charred an area nearly the size of Greece.
More than a week of solid rain in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, the three states most affected by the fires, has more than halved the number of blazes, but above average temperatures were set to return by the weekend.
""Unfortunately, the reprieve may be short-lived with a blast of heat likely late this week in some areas,"" the New South Wales Bureau of Meteorology said on Twitter.
As of Monday, 59 bush and grass fires were burning throughout New South Wales state, 28 of which were yet not contained.
""More than 1,300 firefighters are using more favorable conditions to slow the spread of fires and strengthen containment lines, ahead of forecast increasing temperatures later in the week,"" the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said on Twitter.
Temperatures in Melbourne, where the Australian Open tennis tournament is in its second week, are forecast to reach 41 Celsius (105.8 Fahrenheit) on Friday. 
Following are some highlights of what is happening in the bushfire crisis: 
* Rainfall continued in Queensland, with some areas receiving nearly a sixth of their annual average in a 24-hour period on Monday.
* Australian authorities are yet to determine what caused a plane that carried three U.S. firefighters to crash last week in New South Wales.
* Wayne Coulson, chief operating officer of Coulson Group, the Canadian firm that owned the plane and employed its crew, said on Monday he flew to the crash site. ""To see our aircraft on the ground, knowing we have had such loss of life was devastating,"" he said.
* One in two Australians have donated money to support bushfire relief efforts, a new survey showed over the weekend.
* Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Monday that he will move a motion of condolence at parliament's first sitting in early February.
* A bushfire near Canberra, the country's capital, was at ""watch and act"" level with fire services saying that no properties were under threat, but warning also the situation may deteriorate.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvians elected a fractured Congress with no clear leadership on Sunday, split among 10 parties with a center-right party grabbing the most seats with a tally of 24 out of 130, an Ipsos count of vote data reported by domestic media showed.
The result is a blow to Popular Force, the right-wing opposition party led by Keiko Fujimori, which has lost control of Congress and won fewer than 10% of seats, even as most voters remained supportive of conservative parties.
The party's diminishing popularity could spell trouble for its chances in Peru's next presidential election in 2021.
The new legislature replaces one dissolved in September after a long-running battle between President Martin Vizcarra and lawmakers over an anti-corruption drive.
The new balance of power could give Vizcarra a fresh chance to push his package of anti-corruption reforms, staunchly opposed by the opposition majority in Congress. But the legislature could also be stuck in gridlock.
All parties expected to win seats received between 5% and 10% of votes, according to Ipsos, although most seats are poised to go right-of-center parties.
Vizcarra does not have party representation in Congress, but center and left-wing parties have generally supported his agenda.
The special election was triggered last year when Vizcarra used a controversial constitutional provision to close Congress after it repeatedly failed to endorse his plans. The move was deemed legitimate by Peru's top court this month.
The new Congress will be short-lived and will be replaced by a standard 5-year legislature in 2021, when Peru will also celebrate 200 years of independence.
Fujimori is the daughter of Peru's ex-President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights crimes and graft. She herself was released from jail in November amid a corruption investigation.
The elder Fujimori is a divisive figure who governed between 1990 and 2000 strengthening Peru's economy, but his administration was beset by rights abuse accusations and graft scandals that ultimately led to his resignation.
Popular Force has been the runner-up in Peru's last two presidential elections, in 2011 and 2016, when Keiko was its candidate."

WARSAW/OSWIECIM, Poland (Reuters) - World leaders join aging Holocaust survivors in Poland on Monday to mark 75 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp by Soviet troops, amid concerns over a global resurgence of anti-Semitism.
More than 1.1 million people, most of them Jews, perished in the camp's gas chambers or from starvation, cold and disease.
Set up by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland in 1940, at first to house Polish political prisoners, it became the largest of the extermination centers where Adolf Hitler's plan to kill all Jews - the ""Final Solution"" - was put into practice.
Speaking before Monday's ceremonies, David Harris, head of the American Jewish Committee, said groups ranging from far-right white supremacists to jihadis and the far-left were fuelling anti-Semitism worldwide.
""Jews in western Europe think twice before they wear a kippa, they think twice before they go to a synagogue, think twice before they enter a kosher supermarket,"" he told Reuters.
A 2019 survey by the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League showed that about one in four Europeans harbor ""pernicious and pervasive"" attitudes towards Jews, compared with 19% of North Americans.
In Germany, 42% agreed that ""Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust"", it said. Two people were killed in a shooting near a synagogue in eastern Germany in October, in what officials called an anti-Semitic attack.
After visiting Auschwitz last week, Mohammed al-Issa, the head of a global Muslim missionary society, said governments and Muslim communities should do more to combat anti-Semitism.
""European countries should have stronger and more active laws that would criminalize anti-Semitism,"" Al-Issa, secretary-general of the Mecca-based Muslim World League (MWL), told Reuters.
More than a dozen heads of state including German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will take part in ceremonies starting at 3.30 p.m. (1430 GMT) at the ""Gate of Death"" where rail tracks led trains packed with victims into the camp.
The commemorations take place as Poland seeks to highlight its own suffering during World War Two, in which six million Poles, including three million Polish Jews, were killed and Warsaw was razed to the ground.
For many non-Jewish Poles, Auschwitz remains the place where the Nazis jailed and killed Polish resistance fighters, the intelligentsia, Roman Catholic priests and innocent civilians.
Critics say the nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) government is not doing enough to counter anti-Semitism and is instead focusing on what it sees as Polish heroism during the war and downplaying Jews' claims to postwar restitution of property seized from them. PiS says the West fails to grasp the extent of the nation's pain and bravery.
One survivor, a Jewish Pole, spoke about the need to remember Auschwitz.
""We need to do everything possible to keep this world from acquiring amnesia,"" Benjamin Lesser said at the camp on Sunday. ""It's hard to believe civilized, cultured, educated people could become such monsters."""
239,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2020 06:19PM ET</span>","China has world's second-largest arms industry, think tank estimates","STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Newly available data suggests that China is the world's second-biggest arms producer, behind the United States and ahead of Russia, a leading conflict and armaments think-tank said on Monday.
A lack of transparency means the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute has excluded China from its annual global rankings of arms makers, but it said credible financial information had become available for four major companies.
The data, covering the period from 2015 to 2017, allowed it to compile what it called the most comprehensive picture of Chinese companies' weapons production to date.
""With the increase of available data on these companies, it is now possible to develop reasonably reliable estimates of the scale of the Chinese arms industry,"" the institute said.
The four companies had combined estimated arms sales of $54.1 billion for 2017, it said, which would put them among the top 20 arms producers in the world.
""Three of the companies would be ranked in the top 10.""
Total U.S. arms sales in 2017 were $226.6 billion, and in Russia, $37.7 billion, according to the think tank's Top 100 list for that year.
Aircraft and avionics group Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) would rank as the sixth largest arms producer, with estimated 2017 sales of $20.1, while land systems-focused China North Industries Group Corporation (NORINCO) would place eighth with an estimated $17.2 billion in sales, the institute said.
The other two companies it looked at, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC) and China South Industries Group Corporation (CSGC), had estimated sales of $12.2 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, a spokesperson for the institute said.
China's foreign and defense ministries did not respond to faxed requests for comment during a public holiday. Calls to AVIC, NORINCO and CSGC went unanswered and China Electronics Technology Group (CETC) declined to comment.
The Sweden-based think tank has said global expenditure in 2018 hit $1.8 trillion, its highest level since the end of the Cold War, fuelled by increased spending in the United States and China.
U.S. arms sales that year were $246 billion, Russia's were $36.2 billion and the United Kingdom had $35.1 billion in sales, it said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will hold back-to-back meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israeli opposition leader Benny Gantz on Monday as he prepares to release his long-delayed Middle East peace plan.
Trump will meet first with Netanyahu, Israel's veteran right-wing leader, and then with the latter's election rival Gantz, who just last week dropped his objection to having the peace plan published before Israel's March vote, a schedule released by the White House showed.
He will meet with Netanyahu again on Tuesday, and the two of them are scheduled to deliver joint remarks.
During the talks with both Israeli politicians, Trump is likely to share some details of his plan, a U.S. source familiar with the subject said.
""Today, I leave to Washington to stand by an American president who brings a plan which I believe is promoting our most crucial interests ... together with him, we will make history,"" Netanyahu said before taking off for the U.S. capital. 
Trump said last week he would release details of his peace initiative before meeting with Netanyahu and Gantz, but the White House has yet to say exactly when the plan will be made public.
In contrast to the regalia and high-security that could be expected from Netanyahu's arrival later on Sunday, Gantz, a former general who heads Israel's centrist Blue and White Party, traveled with a small entourage on a commercial flight.
""It's a very important visit,"" he told Reuters after landing at Dulles International Airport outside Washington. Asked what he hoped to achieve, Gantz said, ""Good relations, and explanation, and understanding between the president and myself.""
He would not be drawn on how the Washington visit might affect his prospects in the election.
Gantz on Saturday called Trump's plan a ""meaningful landmark mapping the way for the different players in the Middle East to finally move forward towards an historical and regional agreement."" 
The political aspects of the plan to end the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians have been closely held, although the economic components have already been unveiled.
While Trump was set to brief Netanyahu and Gantz, Palestinian leaders said they had had no communication with the U.S. administration. They have warned that no deal can work without them on board.
Trump has made a number of decisions Israel has welcomed that have angered Palestinians. He recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital, moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and slashed humanitarian aid to the Palestinians.
The proposal, dozens of pages long, addresses in detail the thorny political issues between Israel and the Palestinians, such as the status of Jerusalem, Trump administration officials say.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump said Palestinians might react negatively to his plan at first, but that ""it's actually very positive for them.""
The launch of the plan has been delayed numerous times over the last two years. U.S. officials decided to move forward now rather than wait until Israel's election, because the past two elections left the Israel government deadlocked. 

A source told Reuters last week that bringing both Netanyahu and Gantz in on the details was aimed at defusing any suggestion Trump might be favoring one candidate over the other.

242,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2020 04:25PM ET</span>","Sorrow and triumph, an Auschwitz survivor's journey back to a former hell","By Maayan Lubell
OSWIECIM, Poland (Reuters) - Jona Laks could smell the burning flesh as she walked towards death at the Auschwitz crematorium. More than 75 years later, aged 90, she has returned to what was the most notorious Nazi death camp of World War Two's Jewish Holocaust.
""I can see it now,"" she says, gazing upon the crematorium where the corpses of Jews from across Europe who were murdered in gas chambers were later burned in furnaces.
""I saw sparks from the chimney and I could feel the burning flesh. As we got closer I could feel something was going to happen. I started crying. I didn't want my sisters to see me cry,"" Laks said softly. She was to be saved moments later.
The Nazis murdered more than one million people at Auschwitz, nearly all of them Jews. Six million Jews were murdered in the Holocaust.
Laks was about 14 when she was transported to Auschwitz in 1944 with her twin sister Miriam and older sister Chana from the Jewish ghetto of Lodz in Nazi-occupied Poland.
She returned this week as a guest of honor at the international ceremony on Jan. 27 commemorating the 75th anniversary of the camp's liberation, hosted at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial.
""It's still so clear. I can't imagine it was 75 years ago,"" said Laks, speaking slowly as her face filled with sorrow.
""THE LAST SURVIVORS""
Laks made the trip from her home in Israel with her granddaughter, Lee Aldar, 28.
At every step of the journey, her emotions built up. ""We must be getting closer,"" she said looking out of the car window at a gray sky above bare trees lining the road from Krakow to Oswiecim.
""I'm nervous. I'm trying to adjust myself,"" she told her granddaughter. ""There are those who do not want to talk about it. They want to leave the past behind, it's difficult to relive.""
But for Laks, telling her story is important. ""We, the last survivors that still remain, if we will not speak out and not tell, it will be forgotten as if nothing happened.""
As the vehicle neared the camp, Laks recalled her first moments there. ""It looked as if it was the end of the world, that everything is dark, cruel, unexplainable, inexplicable,"" she said.
Under Auschwitz's metal gate with its ""Arbeit macht frei"" (""Work sets you free"") slogan, Laks stopped before she entered, marking the moment as she spoke, arm-in-arm with her granddaughter:
""Through this narrow gate, so many people walked and never came back, ending their lives behind these barbed-wire fences.""
Five days earlier, at home in Tel Aviv, she had recounted her own arrival at Auschwitz with the same frankness.
With her sisters and thousands of other Jews from the Lodz ghetto, she was transported by train. They were forced into cattle carts, no windows and scarcely any room to move. She thinks the journey lasted about three days.
When they arrived they underwent 'selection': as they lined up on the platform, an SS doctor would choose who was fit for camp labor and who was to be killed in the gas chambers.
It was Joseph Mengele, Auschwitz's ""Angel of Death"", carrying out selection that day.
""Eventually Mengele came over with his dogs and his stick in his hand, 'left, right, left, right', I don't think he was even looking at the people. He looked bored,"" laks recalled with a slight smirk of contempt.
""I WON THE WAR""
Mengele, an SS doctor, would also pick prisoners whom he subjected to pseudo-medical experiments. He had a particular interest in twins.
On the platform, he picked her sisters for labor and sent Laks to die. But when Chana begged Mengele not to separate her twin sisters he seized the opportunity for new guinea pigs and sent an SS officer to retrieve Laks from the crematorium.
""I was lucky,"" said Laks. ""Or maybe unlucky,"" she added after a moment.
""I sometimes wonder whether animals could survive the inhumane cruelty we were subjected to,"" she told Aldar as they walked slowly towards Block number 10, which served as Mengele's laboratory. ""I don't think they could.""
Outside Block 10 was an execution courtyard where prisoners were sometimes put up against the brick ""wall of death"" and shot. ""From inside, we would hear the screams of those being murdered,"" said Laks.
But standing with her granddaughter outside the shuttered barrack, Laks was overcome by a sense of triumph.
""I'm here with my granddaughter and I overcame. I won the war. We have a future,"" she said."

""With the last remaining survivors among us, I apologize on behalf of the government for the actions of the government at the time"", Rutte said at an event in Amsterdam to mark the 75th anniversary on Monday of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.
""I do so, realizing that no word can describe something as enormous and awful as the Holocaust.""
Earlier Dutch governments have made apologies for the way Jews who survived World War Two atrocities were treated when they returned home from concentration camps, but have shied away from condemning the country's part in the persecution of Jews and other minorities during the German occupation.
Too many people in government institutions at the time simply followed German orders, without realizing the consequences of their actions for the people concerned, Rutte said.
Around 102,000 of the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust came from the Netherlands.
""We ask ourselves: how could this have happened?"", Rutte said.
""In all, we did too little. Not enough protection, not enough help, not enough recognition."""

World leaders will gather on Monday at Birkenau and the nearby Auschwitz camp to mark the 75th anniversary of their liberation.
""This protest for us is very much part of the commemoration. For there to be a commemoration ceremony without an expression of deep, deep outrage that the church is still here would send a message that we're ok with this,"" Weiss said.
The rabbis argue the church should not be on the site of one of the largest Jewish cemeteries in the world and it violates a 1987 agreement between European cardinals and Jewish leaders that there will not be any permanent Catholic place of worship on the site of the Auschwitz or Birkenau camps.
""This (the church) in my mind is the greatest desecration of the history of the Holocaust,"" Weiss said.
""Beneath this ground is a cemetery ... their bloods are crying out from the ground demanding justice.""
The rabbis want the church to be moved elsewhere in Oswiecim.
Weiss was making his first visit to the church since 1995, when at the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz he was arrested for orchestrating a sit-in in to protest against what he sees as attempts to portray it as a place mainly of Christian martyrdom.
On Sunday, as mass ended, the rabbis tried to enter the church and speak with some of the parishioners, as well as with the priest. The priest turned away from them. He did not want to speak with them and slammed the door.
Some parishioners raised their voices and expressed displeasure at the rabbis' presence but didn't want to speak to Reuters.
Weiss led a long and ultimately successful campaign in the 1980s to secure the removal of a Carmelite convent from outside the Auschwitz grounds. It had been set up in a building just outside the wire once used as a store for poison gas.
Jews were brought from all over Europe to Auschwitz-Birkenau to be murdered during the war as part of a Nazi genocide campaign in which six million perished. Tens of thousands of Catholic Poles, including priests and resistance fighters, were tortured and killed there too."

BEIRUT (Reuters) - When she heard Lebanese banks would limit cash withdrawals, Rita, a doctor, rushed out to buy a $10,000 Rolex watch on her credit card, anxious to protect some of her savings. ""It's better than keeping my money in the bank,"" she said.
Every week, account holders line up for their quota of cash - for some less than $200 - from their banks, which have also blocked foreign money transfers as Lebanon sinks deep into economic crisis.
Dollar shortages have pushed up prices, the Lebanese pound has slumped on the parallel market and confidence in the banking system has collapsed.
People with savings in the bank are scrambling to get the money out, buying jewelry, cars and land with credit cards or cashier's checks. 
Several people told Reuters they feared even tighter controls, a haircut on their deposits, bank failure or a devaluation of the Lebanese pound, which has been pegged to the U.S. dollar for 22 years.
They asked not to be fully identified due to safety concerns.
The central bank says deposits are safe and pledges to maintain the dollar peg, while the head of the country's banking association said the limits on withdrawals and other measures aimed ""to keep the wealth of Lebanon"" in the country.
STASHING CASH AT HOME
Many ordinary Lebanese had already started stashing cash at home months before protests erupted in October against the ruling elite that plunged Lebanon into its worst crisis in decades.
In the capital, Beirut, staff at several jewelry stores said customers had poured in recently looking to buy gold and diamonds, sometimes to sell them abroad, though most jewelers are now only accepting cash.
At a Rolex store in the city, sales will only be made if half the payment is in cash in U.S. dollars, an employee said.
When the crisis first began to bite, Lucy, a housewife in her 60s, worried about the money her late husband had left her. She and her daughters pooled all the cash they could get and bought $50,000 worth of gold, hiding it at home.
""It's my father's life savings. I don't want to keep a single penny in the bank,"" one of the daughters said.
An advisor at a Beirut auction house, who asked to remain anonymous, said she was fielding daily calls from people who want to ""put their money into paintings instead of in the bank.""
""For the first time, I'm getting calls from people who don't know anything about art,"" she said. 
Abdallah, a doctor in his 50s, bought three cars worth more than $80,000 with a cashier's check.

His bank only allows him to withdraw $100 a week and he fears the controls could be further tightened. ""I have no trust in the bank,"" he said.

251,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 26, 2020 08:35AM ET</span>","Iraq security forces clash with protesters in Baghdad, other cities","By Aziz El Yaakoubi
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces fired teargas and live bullets in renewed clashes with protesters in Baghdad and other cities on Sunday, a Reuters witness and security sources said, following a push to clear a sit-in camps across the country.
Demonstrators are demanding the removal of what they see as a corrupt ruling elite and an end to foreign interference in domestic politics, especially by Iran, which has come to dominate state institutions since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion. 
Iraqi populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr called for demonstrations against the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Sunday and in other cities. 
This followed a large march on Friday in which tens of thousands protested against the U.S. military presence in Iraq.
Protesters on Sunday threw petrol bombs and stones at security forces which responded by firing tear gas canisters and live rounds into the air. 
The authorities' latest attempt to push back protesters and restore order came after Sadr, who has millions of supporters in Baghdad and the south, said on Saturday he would end his involvement in anti-government unrest.
""We protest because we have a cause, I don’t think Moqtada Sadr or any other politician will change our mind,"" said a protester in Baghdad who declined to give his name. 
Sadr's supporters had bolstered the protesters and sometimes helped shield them from attacks by security forces and unidentified gunmen, but began withdrawing from sit-in camps on Saturday following his announcement.
Security forces then removed concrete barriers near Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), where demonstrators have camped out for months, and across at least one main bridge over the Tigris River.
""I don’t go to protests often but I came out today because of what they did yesterday, I want to express my solidarity with my brothers in Tahrir,"" said Hussain Ali, a student.
Protesters in the capital were coughing and washing their faces and eyes to rid themselves of the effects of the gas while Iraqi Red Cross workers provided first aid, as the site was inaccessible to ambulances, a Reuters reporter said.
At least 14 protesters were injured in the clashes in the capital, security and medical sources said.
Tuk tuks evacuated wounded protesters in clouds of tear gas and black smoke from burning tires. 
Earlier on Sunday, hundreds of university students gathered in Tahrir square, the main protest camp, chanting slogans against the U.S. and Iran. 
UNREST IN THE SOUTH
Clashes with security forces in the southern city of Nassiriya left at least 17 protesters wounded, four of them by live bullets, police and medical sources said. 
Protesters set fire to two security vehicles in the city center and as hundreds of other demonstrators controlled the key bridges in the city, a Reuters witness said.
In the southern city of Basra, more than 2000 students from different universities pooled into the protest camp, another Reuters witness said.
Protests also continued in the cities of Kerbala, Najaf, and Diwaniya in defiance to attempts by security forces to end their months-long sit-in, police sources and Reuters witnesses said.
The unrest resumed last week after a lull of several weeks, following U.S. air strikes that killed Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia commander. 

The killing of Soleimani, to which Iran responded by ballistic missile attacks on two Iraqi military bases, has revived tensions in Iraq's domestic politics and delayed the formation of a new government.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Sunday asked the world's 1.3 billion Catholics to stop for a moment of prayer and reflection on the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz and say ""Never Again"".
The pope mentioned Monday's anniversary during his weekly noon address and blessing to tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ).
""Indifference is inadmissible before this enormous tragedy, this atrocity, and memory is a duty. Tomorrow, we are all invited to stop for a moment of prayer and reflection, each one of us saying in our own heart: 'never again, never again,'"" he said.
More than one million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp during World War Two. Overall, some six million Jews died in the Holocaust.
At Francis' orders, the Vatican in March will open its secret archives on the wartime pontificate of Pope Pius XII, a historic move that Jews have sought for decades.
Some Jews say Pius, who reigned from 1939 to 1958, did not do enough to help those facing persecution by Nazi Germany and turned a blind eye to the Holocaust. The Vatican maintains that Pius chose to work behind the scenes.
The pope's appeal to his own flock on Sunday comes amid a backdrop of rising anti-Semitism in Europe and the United States. Last week, Francis called the rise a ""barbaric resurgence"".
On Friday, anti-Semitic graffiti was found scrawled on the door of the home of a son of a Holocaust survivor in northern Italy.
The words ""Juden Hier"" (Jews Here) were written above a Star of David on the door, recalling the signs put on buildings in Nazi Germany to mark the homes and businesses of Jews.
Last month in eastern France, scores of Jewish graves were found desecrated in a cemetery, hours before lawmakers adopted a resolution equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism.
France has Europe’s biggest Jewish community - around 550,000 - and anti-Semitic attacks are common, with more than 500 alone in 2018.
A global survey https://global100.adl.org/about/2019 by the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League in November found that anti-Semitic attitudes had increased in many places around the world and significantly in Eastern and Central Europe. It also found that large percentages of people in Eastern and Western European countries think Jews talk too much about the Holocaust.
Before he became pope and was still archbishop of his native Buenos Aires, Francis co-authored a book with his friend, Argentine rabbi Abraham Skorka.
In 2016, Francis visited Rome's main synagogue, in the former ghetto established by his predecessor Pope Paul IV in 1555 and where Jews were confined until the 19th century."

ROME (Reuters) - Voters in two Italian regions, Emilia Romagna in the north and Calabria in the south, went to the polls on Sunday in local elections that could help propel far-right opposition leader Matteo Salvini to national power.
Both regions are currently controlled by the center-left and while opinion polls have long predicted a win for the right in the underdeveloped Calabria, the result in the north is far less certain and politically much more significant.
One of Italy's wealthiest regions, Emilia Romagna is home to the Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) sports car and Parmesan cheese and has been a left-wing stronghold since World War Two.
Salvini has spent weeks relentlessly campaigning in the area and hopes that an upset victory for his League party and its rightist partners would so destabilize the coalition government in Rome that it could even collapse.
""Friends of Emilia-Romagna and Calabria... I'm counting on you. Let's liberate these wonderful regions from the (center-left Democratic Party) PD and then let's liberate the whole of Italy,"" Salvini tweeted on Sunday.
At 1100 GMT turnout in Emilia Romagna was 23.44%, more than double that at the previous regional elections in the region in 2014, indicating very high interest in the vote. 
Turnout in Calabria at the same time was 10.49% of voters, up from the previous 8.84%.
Salvini's anti-immigrant, anti-European message has resonated in the region during the campaign, especially in the smaller towns and cities, as has his pledge to slash taxes.
Underscoring his confrontational style of politics, Salvini caused a stir last week by ringing the interphone at the apartment of a family of Tunisian migrants and, in front of TV cameras, asked if they were drug dealers.
Salvini served as interior minister until last August, when, in a rare miscalculation, he walked out of government with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, expecting to trigger a national election that polls predicted he would easily win.
Instead, 5-Star joined up with the PD and shunted him into opposition. Looking to exact revenge and confirm his ascendancy in Italy, Salvini has since concentrated all his efforts on winning a stream of local votes. 
The PD has dismissed suggestions that Sunday's vote is a de-facto referendum on its often fractious coalition. It hopes the high approval rating of Emilia Romagna's incumbent governor Stefano Bonaccini will eventually win the day.
""Salvini is trying to make the campaign about national issues because he has nothing to say about Emilia Romagna. He is using the vote for his own personal ends to bring the government down,"" Bonaccini told Reuters.

Voting in both Calabria and Emilia Romagna ends at 11 p.m. (2200 GMT), when the first exit polls will be released. A definitive result from Emilia Romagna is expected by early Monday.

ELAZIG, Turkey (Reuters) - A major rescue operation to pull survivors from collapsed buildings in eastern Turkey began winding down on Sunday, a day and a half after a powerful earthquake killed dozens.
Teams had worked through the night to rescue 45 people from the rubble, Turkey's disaster authority said, using drills, mechanical diggers, buckets and bare hands in the search for survivors at three sites in Elazig province.
The magnitude 6.8 quake struck on Friday evening, killing 32 people there and four in the neighboring province of Malatya, with more than 1,600 sustaining injuries. It was followed by more than 700 aftershocks, Disaster and Emergency Authority AFAD said.
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the rescue operation was largely concluded, though emergency teams had located six people still trapped under rubble.
""It has been around 36 hours (since the quake), but we are still in the hours where we can hope,"" he told a news conference in Elazig, some 550 km (340 miles) east of the capital Ankara.
He also said aftershocks were continuing, and AFAD said 20 of the 733 registered so far were of magnitude 4 or more.
Health Minister Fahrettin Koca, speaking alongside Soylu, said 104 people were being treated in hospitals, of whom 13 were in intensive care. None were in a critical condition, however.
Other provinces had earlier sent thousands of emergency workers to support rescue efforts, which were also supplemented by hundreds of volunteers, officials said. Tents, beds and blankets were provided to shelter those displaced by the quake.
'PLEASE GET ME OUT'
Those rescued overnight included a 35-year-old woman and her infant daughter, who broadcast footage showed emerging from rubble in the Mustafa Pasa district of Elazig.
Rescuers who heard their screams had taken several hours to reach them in temperatures as low as -4 degrees Celsius (24.8°F), state media said. The woman's husband was among those who died.
""Can you hear me?"" footage showed a rescuer calling to the mother. ""We are coming. We will save you,"".
She replied: ""Please get me out, I cannot stand it anymore. Get my daughter, I am nothing without my kid."" She was later pulled out from under the rubble with a crane, safe but crying in pain.
In a nearby neighborhood, others stood on mountains of debris where the quake had split an apartment building in half. They dug through using buckets, blowing whistles when they needed silence to listen out for trapped people.
Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum told the same news conference the quake had damaged buildings in several provinces and 12 structures needed to be demolished immediately.
Kurum later said the government would begin a reconstruction process, and there were 1.5 million structures needing ""immediate renewal"".
Soylu said those affected by the quake would start receiving financial support from Monday, while AFAD urged residents not to return to damaged buildings because of the potential risk of collapse.
Speaking on Saturday during a visit to Elazig and Malatya, President Tayyip Erdogan said steel-framed houses would be rapidly built for displaced residents.
The country has a history of powerful earthquakes.
More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck Izmit, a city southeast of Istanbul. In 2011, a quake in the eastern city of Van killed more than 500."

Israeli Interior Minister Aryeh Deri, after consulting the country's security establishment, issued a statement saying that Israelis would be allowed to travel to Saudi Arabia under two circumstances: for religious reasons on pilgrimage on the haj, or for up to nine days for business reasons such as investment or meetings.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) would still need an invitation and permission from the Saudi authorities, the statement said.
Israel has peace treaties with two Arab countries -- Egypt and Jordan -- but concerns over Iran's influence in the region have led to thawing ties with some Gulf states as well.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been looking to capitalize on common interests like Iran while also marketing Israeli technologies to try and further normalize relations.
Israelis -- mostly Muslims going on pilgrimage -- have been traveling to Saudi Arabia for years but usually with special permission or using foreign passports.
Saudi authorities did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Saudi Arabia launched a new tourism visa last year for visitors from 49 countries as part of its bid to diversify the economy and open up society. Israel is not one of the eligible countries.
However, in 2018 Saudi Arabia opened its airspace for a commercial flight to Israel with the start of a new Air India route between New Delhi and Tel Aviv, although national carrier El Al Israel Airlines may not use Saudi airspace for eastward flights."

Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Idlib in recent weeks amid stepped up air strikes by Russian and Syrian forces aimed at clearing the opposition from its last redoubt after almost nine years of civil war.
The Syrian Observatory, a war monitor, said on Sunday that six towns in the Idlib countryside had fallen to Syrian government forces in the past 24 hours.
The Observatory said the government advance, backed by heavy Russian airstrikes, has brought Assad's forces to the outskirts of Maarat al-Numan, a strategic urban center about 33 km (20 miles) south of the city of Idlib on a highway that connects Damascus to Aleppo.
The push deeper into rebel-held territory has taken place despite a deal between Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides in the conflict, for a Jan. 12 ceasefire.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday that around 400,000 people from Idlib province were moving towards the Turkish border as a result of the surge in violence.
Turkey, which has a presence in the area and is seen by many civilians as a protector against Russian strikes, already hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees and fears that millions more could cross the border.
Moscow and Damascus say they are fighting jihadist militants that have stepped up attacks on civilians in Aleppo city in northern Syria, but rescue workers and rights groups say air strikes have hit civilian areas including hospitals and schools.
""The army's response will not be limited to the origins of attacks by armed terrorist organizations and will include devastating field operations that will not cease until the remnants of armed terrorism is uprooted,"" a military source was quoted as saying by state news agency SANA."

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The ability of the new coronavirus to spread is strengthening and infections could continue to rise, China's National Health Commission said on Sunday, with nearly 2,000 people in China infected and 56 killed by the disease.
A handful of cases have been reported outside China, including in Thailand, Australia, the United States and France, with health authorities around the world racing to prevent a pandemic.
The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.
China's National Health Commission Minister Ma Xiaowei said the incubation period for the virus can range from one to 14 days, and the virus is infectious during incubation, which was not the case with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
SARS was a coronavirus that originated in China and killed nearly 800 people globally in 2002 and 2003.
""According to recent clinical information, the virus's ability to spread seems to be getting somewhat stronger,"" Ma told a packed media briefing on the second day of the Lunar New Year holiday, adding that knowledge of the virus was limited.
Containment efforts, which have thus far included transportation and travel curbs and the cancellation of big events, will be intensified, Ma said.
The virus, believed to have originated late last year in a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan that was illegally selling wildlife, has spread to cities including Beijing and Shanghai. Hong Kong has six confirmed cases.
President Xi Jinping said during a politburo meeting on Saturday that China was facing a ""grave situation"".
On Sunday, China announced a temporary nationwide ban on the sale of wildlife in markets, restaurants, and e-commerce platforms. Wild and often poached animals packed together in Chinese markets are blamed as incubators for viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans.
Snakes, peacocks, crocodiles and other species can also be found for sale via Taobao, an e-commerce website run by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).
The New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society called on China to make the ban permanent.
The U.S. State Department said it will relocate personnel at its Wuhan consulate to the United States and will offer a limited number of seats to private U.S. citizens on a Jan. 28 flight to San Francisco.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Sunday the government was working with Chinese authorities to arrange a charter flight for any Japanese nationals who wish to return from Wuhan.
The World Health Organization this week stopped short of calling the outbreak a global health emergency, but some health experts question whether China can continue to contain the epidemic.
On Sunday, China confirmed 1,975 cases of patients infected with the new coronavirus as of Jan. 25, while the death toll from the virus has risen to 56, state broadcaster CCTV reported.
No fatalities have been reported outside China.
The outbreak has prompted widening curbs on movements within China, with Wuhan, a city of 11 million, on virtual lockdown, with transports links all-but severed except for emergency vehicles.
CANCELLATIONS AND MISTRUST
Health authorities in Beijing urged people not to shake hands but instead salute using a traditional cupped-hand gesture. The advice was sent in a text message that went out to mobile phone users in the city on Sunday morning.
Beijing also postponed the reopening of the city's schools and universities after the Lunar New Year holiday, state radio reported. Hong Kong had already delayed the reopening of schools to Feb. 17.
Health officials in Orange County, California, reported that a third case of the virus had been registered in the United States, in a traveler from Wuhan, who was in isolation and in good condition.
On Saturday, Canada declared a first ""presumptive"" confirmed case in a resident who had returned from Wuhan. Australia confirmed its first four cases.
China has called for transparency in managing the crisis, after a cover-up of the spread of the deadly SARS virus eroded public trust, but officials in Wuhan have been criticized for their handling of the current outbreak.
""People in my hometown all suspect the real infected patients number given by authorities,"" said Violet Li, who lives in the Wuhan district where the seafood market is located.
""I go out with a mask twice a day to walk the dog - that's the only outdoor activity,"" she told Reuters by text message.
The outbreak has overshadowed the start of the Lunar New Year, when hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad to be with families, with public events canceled and many tourist sites shut.
Overall passenger travel declined by nearly 29 percent on Saturday, the first day of the Lunar New Year, from a year earlier, with air passengers down nearly 42 percent, a transportation ministry official said.
Many cinemas across China are also closed with major film premieres postponed.
Cruise operators including Royal Caribbean Cruises, Costa Cruises, MSC Cruises and Astro Ocean Cruises said that they canceled a combined 12 cruises that had been scheduled to embark from Chinese ports before Feb. 2.
Hong Kong Disneyland and the city's Ocean Park were closed on Sunday. Shanghai Disneyland, which expected 100,000 visitors daily through the Lunar New Year holidays, has already closed.
Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, although some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of these efforts."

Ndayishimiye, 52, also heads the department of military affairs in the president's office and has served as minister of the interior and security.
Current President Pierre Nkurunziza will not seek re-election.
Nkurunziza's decision to run for a third, five-year term in 2015 sparked widespread protests and violence. His party has welcomed his decision to stand down, conferring on him the title of ""Supreme Guide of Patriotism"" and lavish send-off perks including a villa worth $530,000.
Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries and lost donor funding after the political violence following the 2015 election. Its GDP per capita was $270 per person in 2018, World Bank statistics show.
In September, the United Nations warned that police, security forces and the ruling party's youth league, the Imbonerakure, were committing serious human rights violations.
Those included killings, disappearances, torture and gang rape of alleged political opponents, and that violence was likely to spike as polls approached. Burundi condemned these accusations."

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan forces used ground attacks and air strikes in multiple operations against the Taliban during the last 24 hours, killing 51 fighters in an escalation that signaled renewed deadlock in peace talks.
Afghanistan's Defense Ministry said on Sunday that government forces had conducted 13 ground offensives and 12 air strikes in nine provinces, adding that 51 ""terrorists"" had been killed, 13 wounded and six arrested.
Local officials in the northern province of Balkh said at least three women and four children were killed in the air strikes, prompting protests in front of the provincial governor's office.
The government pledged to send a fact-finding mission to investigate the reports of civilian deaths.
Meanwhile, the Taliban said it had staged two more attacks targeting security forces over the weekend, following sporadic assaults last week.
Afghan security forces' checkpoints in Kunduz were attacked on Saturday night, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said in a statement, adding that 10 members of the security forces were killed and three wounded. Taliban fighters also captured a large weapons cache, he said.
In a separate statement, the Taliban said its fighters had ambushed an Afghan forces patrol in Balkh, killing eight security personnel.
The spike in hostilities comes as U.S. and Taliban negotiators in Doha take a two-day break for consultations about how to overcome recent hurdles in the talks, a source close to the process told Reuters.
Negotiations between the two sides began last year in Doha but have been interrupted at least twice after Taliban attacks on U.S. military personnel in September and December.
Last week, another round of talks kicked off with U.S. Special Representative on Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad meeting repeatedly with the Taliban's chief negotiator Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar.
Multiple sources close to the talks said the Taliban had agreed internally to halt attacks against U.S. forces and ""reduce"" assaults against Afghan government interests.
Over the last week, however, reports of attacks by Taliban fighters on government installations, including police stations continued to filter in from different parts of Afghanistan."

Despite efforts by Turkey and Russia, Haftar abandoned talks on a ceasefire in Moscow earlier this month and his blockade of Libyan oilfields overshadowed a summit in Berlin last week aimed at agreeing on a permanent truce.
His Libyan National Army (LNA) faction aims to capture the capital, Tripoli, through the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russian mercenaries and African troops.
Turkey meanwhile backs Fayez al-Serraj's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).
Fighting has abated in the past weeks but picked up at the weekend at the frontline in southern Tripoli, where artillery fire could be heard, a Reuters reporter said. More than 150,000 people have been displaced by the months of fighting.
Speaking before leaving on a visit to Algeria, Erdogan said Haftar's forces had repeatedly violated the ceasefire, adding that international support for the LNA was ""spoiling"" Haftar.
""At this point, we need to see clearly what Haftar's identity is. He is a man who has betrayed his superiors before as well,"" Erdogan said. ""It is not possible to expect mercy and understanding from someone like this on the ceasefire.""
""He's continuing attacks with all his resources. However, he will not be successful here.""
Libya has had no stable central authority since the toppling of strongman Muammar Gaddafi by NATO-backed rebels in 2011. It has had two rival governments, in the east and the west, for more than five years, with streets controlled by armed groups.
Turkey has repeatedly said Haftar must choose a political solution to the conflict and has urged foreign powers to press the commander into a truce. It has also sent military advisers and trainers to help the GNA fend off Haftar's assault on Tripoli. 
Ankara has said that it will abide by a United Nations arms embargo on Libya as long as the ceasefire is maintained, but has said it could also deploy troops if necessary.
In Berlin, foreign powers agreed to form a special committee made up of five military officials from each side to shore up the shaky truce. They are due to meet for the first time this week in Geneva.
Erdogan said on Sunday he did not expected a result from that committee due to Haftar's stance.

Turkey, the UAE, Egypt, Russia and western countries agreed in Berlin to uphold an existing arms embargo. But the U.N. mission in Libya said on Saturday numerous cargo flights bringing advanced weapons, trucks and fighters from countries who took part in the summit have been landing in western and eastern Libya.

The Sunday Business Post/Red C poll showed support for Varadkar's Fine Gael party had fallen seven percentage points to 23% since its last poll in November while fellow center-right rival Fianna Fail was up two points to 26%.
It is the first time Varadkar's party has fallen behind its rival in the Red C poll series since he came to power in 2017. The two other major polls published since the start of the campaign showed the party trailing by 12 and 2 points respectively.
While Fine Gael has been praised for its handling of Brexit negotiations and overseeing years of strong economic growth, the poll indicated few voters trust the party on the issues of housing and health which have dominated the campaign so far.
The poll showed just 12% felt Fine Gael was the best party equipped to handle Ireland's housing crisis over the next five years, half the level of those who chose Fianna Fail.
The poll showed left-wing Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein was up eight points to 19% in the poll, while the Green Party was up one point to 8%.

Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif responded on Sunday by tweeting an excerpt from the interview with Der Spiegel published on Friday, where he said Iran is still open to negotiations with America if sanctions are lifted.
""@realdonaldtrump is better advised to base his foreign policy comments & decisions on facts, rather than @FoxNews headlines or his Farsi translators,"" Zarif said in the tweet with the interview excerpt.
Tensions between Iran and the United States have reached the highest levels in decades after the U.S. killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to fire missiles days later at bases in Iraq where U.S. troops are stationed. 
Tensions between the two have been increasing steadily since Trump pulled the United States out of Iran's nuclear pact with world powers in 2018 and reimposed sanctions that have driven down Iran's oil exports and hammered its economy."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia Day celebrations on Sunday saw thousands of people flock to beaches and music festivals, but festivities were clouded by the tragedy of bushfires which have killed 33 and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Thousands also rallied in support of indigenous Australians who regard Australia Day, the day which marks the start of white settlement, as ""Invasion Day"".
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia Day was a time to acknowledge the country's stories, both ancient and recent.
""And, as we have been reminded especially in these most recent times, stories of drought, bushfires, adapting to the many challenges that come with living in this great continent,"" Morrison said in his Australia Day address.
""But we would have it no other way as Australians because we love this land, its beauty and, yes, we know its terror, in all of its riches and all of its blessings, and we are a free, diverse and accepting people.""
Australia Day marks the anniversary of the 1788 arrival of the ""First Fleet"" of British ships at Sydney Cove. Britain claimed Australia, declaring it an empty land, but indigenous Australians trace their lineage back 50,000 years.
Indigenous Australians want Australia Day abolished, but the prime minister has promised to defend the holiday's date.
Australia's 700,000 or so indigenous people track near the bottom of its 25 million citizens in almost every economic and social indicator.
Protesters rallied on Sunday carrying red, black and yellow indigenous flags and signs ""No Pride in Genocide"".
""January 26 is a bad day, a hurtful day, but we come here for solidarity,"" Bundjalung elder Gwen Williams-Heckling told Australian Broadcasting Corp. ""We need a new day because we can never celebrate the day of invasion.""
Fires across Australia's bushland have scorched an area nearly the size of Greece since early October, killing 33 people, including several firefighters and volunteers, and millions of animals.
Morrison announced The National Emergency Medal will be awarded to emergency responders battling the 2019-20 bushfires.
""The response to the bushfire situation has been unprecedented with thousands of volunteer and paid responders working around the clock, day and night, week after week to protect property and save lives,"" he said, acknowledging some firefighters were battling blazes on Australia Day.
Rao Asim, a Pakistani who became an Australian citizen on Sunday with his wife Hina and their two children, said during the broadcast ceremony that his family had changed their plans on how to celebrate.
""We had big (party) plans,"" he said. ""But we have decided as a family to donate the money for the bushfires relief effort."""
268,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2020 11:55PM ET</span>",Cuba says Trump administration pressured Bolivia to worsen ties,"HAVANA (Reuters) - A day after Bolivia suspended diplomatic relations with Cuba, Havana accused its interim government of having sought to sabotage bilateral ties ever since it took power last year, partly under pressure from the Trump administration.
Communist-run Cuba was a key ally of Bolivia's former leftist President Evo Morales - who resigned amid a political crisis and protests in November - and has supported his assertion that he was toppled in a foreign-backed ""coup"".
Bolivia's conservative interim President Jeanine Anez, meanwhile, has tried to align the country more closely with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, which is cranking up sanctions on Cuba.
""The acting authorities unfurled a ferocious campaign of lies against Cuba ... in particular against the Cuban medical cooperation, inciting violence against our staff,"" the Cuban foreign ministry said in a statement on Saturday.
""It is not casual that the facts described here coincide with a brutal, politically-motivated U.S. campaign against the international medical cooperation Cuba provides to dozens of countries.""
Cuba's foreign ministry also said U.S. officials had, since the departure of Morales, ""applied pressure on Bolivia to impose a deterioration in relations with Cuba"".
The U.S. State Department was not immediately available for comment.
Cuba's health service is the country's most important hard currency earner, sending more than 50,000 health workers to more than 60 countries.
That program, though, has come under increased fire over the past two years, with critics accusing Cuba of treating doctors as ""slave labor"" or using them to fuel unrest abroad. Cuba denies the accusations.
Thousands of Cuban doctors have returned home after agreements with Brazil and Ecuador were ended over the past year and a half.
Bolivia's foreign ministry said in November: ""There have been a number of accusations that Cuban citizens have been involved in these aggressive acts that have tormented our country in recent days.""
Cuba responded by terminating its medical mission, saying Bolivian officials were fostering violence against the around 700 doctors by claiming they were instigating rebellion.
The spat was revived on Wednesday, when Anez said the Cuban government kept 80% of the payments that Bolivia made for the work of Cuban doctors in the country.
Cuba's foreign ministry denied this, saying on Saturday that from 2006 to 2012, the Caribbean island nation had actually covered all the costs of medical cooperation with Bolivia, at more than $200 million per year.
It was from then that Bolivia started paying for the medical services due to its improved economic situation.
""But it never transferred one dollar to Cuba, nor did Cuba receive any revenue,"" the ministry said."

TORONTO/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Canada on Saturday declared the first ""presumptive"" confirmed case of the deadly coronavirus in a resident who had returned from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak of the viral disease.
Ontario health officials told a news conference the patient is a male in his 50s, who arrived in Toronto on Jan. 22 and was hospitalized the next day after developing symptoms of respiratory illness.
Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, told reporters that the man is being treated in a public hospital and is in a stable condition.
Ontario health officials are investigating the details of the man's contact with others since arriving in Toronto. Early indications are that he took private transportation home after arriving at Toronto airport and then paramedics brought him to the hospital, they added.
The health officials said it is a relatively small family situation, though they declined to give a number, and there is very little by way of contact. They said his family members have been put into self isolation.
Officials said the results from the provincial laboratory confirming the positive case arrived earlier on Saturday. Once the results from the local laboratory are confirmed by Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory, the case will be declared the country's first confirmed case of coronavirus.
Canada is on high alert to prevent the spread of coronavirus and avoid the repeat of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, that killed 44 people in Canada, the only country outside Asia to report deaths from that virus in 2002-2003. Government health officials say Canada is better prepared this time.
The deadly coronavirus has infected more than 1,975 people and killed at least 56 in China. The virus has spread to several countries including the United States, Thailand, South Korea, Japan, Australia and France."

SEOUL (Reuters) - The influential aunt of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un made her first public appearance in six years, state media reported on Sunday, years after her husband was executed in a purge.
Kim Kyong Hui is the sister of former North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il, and took a leading role during the first years of current leader Kim Jong Un's rule.
She had largely disappeared from public view since 2013, after Kim Jong Un ordered the execution of her husband, Jang Song Thaek, seen as the second most powerful man in the North at the time.
On Sunday, state media showed Kim Kyong Hui sitting near Kim Jong Un at a performance celebrating the Lunar New Year in Pyongyang.
""Many North Korea watchers had assumed that Kim Kyong Hui had gone into exile or even killed in the wake of her husband’s death, so to see her pop up by the leader’s side some six years later is certainly a surprise,"" said Oliver Hotham, managing editor of NK News, a Seoul-based organization that monitors North Korea.
Kim Kyong Hui and her husband were once a power couple that formed a kind of regency in the political world of the North behind its young and mercurial leader, who succeeded his father in December 2011.
Kim Kyong Hui's reappearance in a position of prominence suggests she has retained, or at least regained an influential position behind the scenes, Hotham said, noting that state media listed her after North Korea's nominal No. 2, Choe Ryong Hae.
""That she’s sitting right next to the leader and is listed second after Choe Ryong Hae suggests she might have been granted a significant new position, potentially advising Kim Jong Un on economic or political issues,"" he said.
""It’s also a reminder of how weird and brutal North Korea is, after all she’s sitting next to the man who ordered her husband’s execution.""
Kim Jong Un is facing a year of sensitive international and domestic politics, as denuclearization talks with the United States remain stalled and international sanctions restrict North Korea's economy."

TAPACHULA, Mexico (Reuters) - Guatemalan migrant Wilfredo Gomez said on Saturday he had been asking God to make him ""invisible"" as Mexican security forces started rounding up and detaining other U.S.-bound Central Americans who had illegally crossed into the country.
Mexican security forces started taking a much tougher approach to Central American migrants earlier this week after hundreds entered the country illegally from Guatemala in an attempt to reach the U.S.-Mexican border.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is under intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to stop the number of migrants but his handling of the situation near the southern border has draw criticism.
Critics accused Lopez Obrador of doing Trump's bidding after essentially erecting a ""wall"" of security forces that resulted in chaos. Gomez was one of the many Central American migrants who got caught up in the scramble earlier this week.
When Mexican authorities started rounding up and detaining others, Gomez said he prayed and threw away his backpack in an attempt to pass as Mexican. ""I even told them good afternoon,"" Gomez said. ""God covered me, he made me invisible to them.""
Reuters was unable to determine how many of the migrants who had crossed into Mexico were still in the area. Even as chances of succeeding looked increasingly slim, many were clinging to hopes they would eventually reach the United States.
Gomez said he had been in Tapachula for two days, roaming the streets for food, sleeping alternately in the park, at the market or on the street. Mostly, he said, he had been contemplating how to reach the United States or Canada.
Though for now, with no money left, Gomez is staying put at the local migrant shelter. ""I can't stand the cold, the hunger and all that,"" the 42-year-old said. ""Here, at least I've got a place to sleep."""

BEIJING (Reuters) - China confirmed another 15 deaths in the province at the center of the deadly coronavirus outbreak that has now infected more than 1,000 people globally, highlighting the challenges for health authorities around the world working to prevent a global pandemic.
The Health Commission of Hubei Province said in a statement published early Saturday that 180 new cases had been reported as of end-Friday, putting the total number of confirmed patients in the province at 752.
All 15 deaths reported by the commission occurred in Wuhan, the province's capital and epicenter of the outbreak that has been in virtual quarantine as China scrambles to contain the virus spread.
There has been no new national-level data available yet from Chinese authorities. The National Health Commission on Friday had confirmed 830 cases.
The vast majority of the cases and all of the 41 confirmed deaths to date have been in China, but the virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, France and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an ""emergency in China"" this week but stopped short of declaring it of international concern. The virus continues to spread globally, however: French authorities reported Europe's first confirmed cases on Friday evening.
Wuhan, a city of 11 million at the center of the outbreak, is in virtual lockdown. Nearly all flights at Wuhan's airport have been canceled and checkpoints block the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed similar lockdowns on more than 10 cities near Wuhan as part of the ongoing containment effort.
As Wuhan slides into isolation, pharmacies have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been flooded with nervous residents. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday, state media said.
The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.
Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing conditions, the WHO said.
Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, though some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings and of the lockdown. The virus's symptoms are also similar to other respiratory diseases, adding to difficulties in screening.
Hubei's health authority said there were 658 patients affected by the virus in medical care, 57 of whom were critically ill."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Saturday accused a National Public Radio reporter of lying to him and violating ""the basic rules of journalism and decency"" after she said Pompeo repeatedly cursed at her following a testy interview.
NPR reporter Mary Louise Kelly said on Friday that Pompeo cursed at her and repeatedly ""used the F-word"" in a shouted diatribe after she questioned him about Ukraine and the ousted American ambassador to Kiev during a nine-minute interview.
Pompeo, who is due to make an official visit to Ukraine on Thursday, said in a statement on Saturday that Kelly had lied to him twice - once in setting up the interview, and then again in agreeing to conduct their post-interview conversation off the record.
""It is shameful that this reporter chose to violate the basic rules of journalism and decency. This is another example of how unhinged the media has become in its quest to hurt President (Donald) Trump and this Administration,"" Pompeo said. 
""It is no wonder that the American people distrust many in the media when they so consistently demonstrate their agenda and their absence of integrity.""
The dispute centers on an interview Kelly conducted with Pompeo for NPR's ""All Things Considered"" program in which she asked him about Iran and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was ousted by Trump last May.
Yovanovitch's removal was a key event in the actions that prompted the Republican president's impeachment last month by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.
Kelly said she had informed Pompeo's aides that she would ask about Iran and Ukraine. During the interview, she posed several questions, including whether Pompeo owed an apology to Yovanovitch, who testified last year in the House impeachment inquiry about her ouster. The incident also has figured in Trump's impeachment trial in the Republican-led Senate.
During the interview, Pompeo said he had only agreed to discuss Iran. Afterwards, Kelly told NPR, he shouted and repeatedly cursed at her. He also had aides bring an unmarked map of the world and asked Kelly to point to Ukraine, which she did, she told NPR.
Kelly said Pompeo's staff did not stipulate that the post-interview meeting was to be off the record. ""That same staffer who stopped the interview reappeared, asked me to come with her — just me, no recorder — though she did not say we were off the record, nor would I have agreed,"" Kelly told NPR.
Asked about Pompeo's allegations against Kelly, NPR Senior Vice President of News Nancy Barnes said in a statement, ""Mary Louise Kelly has always conducted herself with the utmost integrity, and we stand behind this report.""
Four Democrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee wrote a letter to Pompeo on Saturday in which they said, ""your insulting and contemptuous comments are beneath the office of the Secretary of State.""
In November, Pompeo declined to defend Yovanovitch after Trump attacked her on Twitter.
Yovanovitch was removed by Trump following a campaign against her by his personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and others. Giuliani at the time was pushing to have Ukraine investigate Trump's political rival Joe Biden.
Without elaborating, Pompeo also noted in his statement that ""Bangladesh is NOT Ukraine,"" in an apparent reference to Kelly's account of the unmarked map episode.

The State Department did not respond to questions about Pompeo's statement.

Last Sunday, foreign powers backing opposing camps fighting over Libya's capital Tripoli agreed at a summit hosted by Germany and the United Nations to push the parties to a lasting ceasefire and respect an existing U.N. arm embargo.
""Over the last ten days, numerous cargo and other flights have been observed landing at Libyan airports in the western and eastern parts of the country providing the parties with advanced weapons, armored vehicles, advisers and fighters,"" the U.N mission to Libya (UNSMIL) said in a statement.
""The mission condemns these ongoing violations, which risk plunging the country into a renewed and intensified round of fighting,"" UNSMIL said.
It blamed several countries which were present at the Berlin conference, without naming them.
The United Arab Emirates and Egypt support eastern forces of Khalifa Haftar which have been trying to take Tripoli in a near-ten month campaign. The internationally recognized administration based in Tripoli trying to fend off Haftar's forces is backed by Turkey.
Fighting had abated in the past two weeks but on Saturday heavy artillery could be heard in Tripoli, a Reuters reporter said.
The Berlin summit had gathered top officials from the UAE, Egypt, Turkey as well as western countries such as the United States, France, Britain and European Union.
Germany also invited Haftar and Tripoli Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj, who both met separately with Chancellor Angela Merkel but refused to sit down together.
Libya has been engulfed in chaos since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in a NATO-backed uprising in 2011. Haftar is backing a rival administration based in the east."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. war veteran group is ""expecting"" an apology from U.S. President Donald Trump for his comments that downplayed traumatic brain injuries, an official said on Friday.
Speaking in Davos on Wednesday, Trump said he did not consider the brain injuries suffered by U.S. service members in Iran's recent attack on a base in Iraq as serious.
But the Veterans of Foreign Wars group ""expects an apology from the president to our service men and women for his misguided remarks,"" William Schmitz, VFW National Commander said in a statement on Friday.
The White House did not immediately respond to request for comment on Saturday.
Earlier on Friday the Pentagon said 34 service members had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury following missile strikes by Iran on a base in Iraq, a number higher than the military had previously announced.
The Veterans of Foreign Wars, a group with 1.6 million members, said traumatic brain injury (TBI) is serious and cannot be taken lightly. ""TBI is known to cause depression, memory loss, severe headaches, dizziness and fatigue — all injuries that come with both short- and long-term effects,"" the group said."

Speaking in a central square packed with supporters holding signs calling for 'democracy', Guaido emphasized the importance of international support in unseating Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro from power.
""We need the support of the world to fight against the groups operating in Venezuela. We have the opportunity to get Venezuela back because we are together. We can heal Venezuela,"" he told a crowd of people waving Venezuelan flags and chanting ""Yes we can"".
""It is the struggle of a whole country in favor of democracy,"" he said.
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez did not meet Guaido, a decision that angered right-wing opposition parties but was welcomed by Unidas Podemos, the far-left coalition partners of Sanchez's Socialists. Podemos members have voiced support for Venezuela's leftist ruling party in the past.
Instead, Guaido met Spanish Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya as well as Madrid's mayor and regional president, both from the conservative People's Party (PP).
Guaido's visit coincided with a political spat in Spain over reports that Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos secretly met a senior Maduro aide who is subject to a European Union travel ban at Madrid's Barajas airport on Monday.
PP leader Pablo Casado criticized Sanchez for not meeting Guaido and called on him to dismiss Abalos.
Sanchez told reporters earlier in the day that Spain's government wanted elections in Venezuela ""as soon as possible"" but criticized Spanish opposition parties for using the crisis in Venezuela ""against the government"".
He also voice his backing for Abalos, saying ""he put all his efforts into avoiding a diplomatic crisis and succeeded"".

278,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 25, 2020 03:48PM ET</span>",Defense at Senate trial says ousting Trump would be 'massive interference' in election,"By David Morgan and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Lawyers for U.S. President Donald Trump told his Senate impeachment trial on Saturday that Democrats' efforts to remove the president from office would set a ""very, very dangerous"" precedent in an election year.
White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, the head of the defense team, told senators they would be denying voters their right to give their opinion on Trump at the Nov. 3 presidential election if they found him guilty and ousted him now.
In only the third presidential impeachment trial in U.S. history, Democrats argued earlier this week that Trump should be removed for encouraging Ukraine to interfere in the election by pressuring its leader to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading 2020 Democratic presidential contender. 
The defense tried to turn that election interference line against the Democrats in its opening argument on Saturday by warning against removing a president less than 10 months before Americans vote on whether to give him a second term.
""For all their talk about election interference ... they're here to perpetrate the most massive interference in an election in American history, and we can't allow that to happen. It would violate our Constitution. It would violate our history. It would violate our obligations to the future,"" he said in a session that ran two hours, far shorter that the Democratic arguments of the preceding days.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives impeached Trump last month on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, setting the stage for the trial in the Republican-led Senate.
Trump is expected to be acquitted in the Senate, where a two-thirds vote is required to convict and remove a president from office. No Republican senator has voiced any support for his ouster.
Democrats rejected Cipollone's concerns about impeaching a president in an election year.
""They argue that we must not impeach the president and remove him from office, because this would upset the election, and after all, there's another election coming up. That argument would say that the impeachment process does not belong in the Constitution,"" said Representative Jerrold Nadler, part of the team that presented the House case.
While the main thrust of the defense's argument on Saturday was to warn about the consequences of ejecting Trump from the White House, his lawyers also tried to chip away at the Democrats' portrayal of a president who put U.S. national security goals at risk by trying to enlist a foreign country to help his own political career.
A major focus of the Democrats' case is a phone call last July in which Trump pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to investigate Biden on unsubstantiated corruption allegations.
Democrats contend that Trump was trying to find dirt on Biden and his son Hunter Biden, who had served on the board of a Ukrainian gas company, to help the president win a second term. 
Democratic Representative Adam Schiff, the head of the prosecution, told Senators this week that the campaign of pressure on Ukraine was a ""corrupt scheme"" in which Trump also temporarily froze almost $400 million in military aid to Ukraine. 
'VERY, VERY CONSEQUENTIAL'
Cipollone said removing Trump and taking him off the ballot in November would mean having to ""tear up all of the ballots across this country on your own initiative, take that decision away from the American people."" 
""They are asking you to do something very, very consequential and, I would submit to you ... very, very dangerous,"" he said. 
The articles of impeachment -- or formal charges -- against Trump call not only for his removal from office but also his ""disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of honor, trust, or profit under the United States.""
Schiff wrote on Twitter that the defense was trying to deflect from discussing what witnesses have described as Trump's pressure campaign against Ukraine.
""They don't contest the facts of Trump's scheme. They're trying to deflect, distract from, and distort the truth. And they are continuing to cover it up by blocking documents and witnesses,"" he wrote.
Trump denies any wrongdoing. He wrote on Twitter on Saturday: ""Any fair minded person watching the Senate trial today would be able to see how unfairly I have been treated and that this is indeed the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax that EVERYBODY, including the Democrats, truly knows it is. This should never be allowed to happen again!""
Mike Purpura, part of Trump's team, said most of the witnesses who testified in the House inquiry that led to Trump's impeachment had never actually spoken to the president. 
Democrats counter that argument by saying the only reason the Senate did not hear from first-hand witnesses, such as former National Security Adviser John Bolton, was because Trump blocked them from testifying.
In wrapping up the prosecution's opening arguments on Friday, Schiff urged Republican senators to show ""real political courage"" and subpoena witnesses and new documents.
Trump's defense said on Saturday that subpoenas issued by Democratic-run committees for witnesses and documents in the inquiry were not valid, alleging that the probe itself lacked authority. 
""All of those subpoenas were invalid,"" lawyer Patrick Philbin said. ""That was the reason for not responding to them."" 

No president has ever been removed through impeachment, a mechanism the nation's founders devised to oust a president for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors. One, Richard Nixon, resigned in the face of a looming impeachment.

Some protesters among the hundreds who had gathered for a planned march managed to open a metal gate blocking their way but were pushed back.
After Lebanon's Internal Security Forces used Twitter to warn peaceful demonstrators to leave for their own safety, riot police fanned out to disperse dozens of remaining protesters.
""We want the demonstrations to be peaceful so they can prevail,"" said Abdo Saadeh, criticizing a government formed this week as a ""masquerade"" by a political elite that protesters blame for driving the country towards collapse.
The Iranian-backed group Hezbollah and its allies formed a cabinet of technocrats nominated by their parties under Prime Minister Hassan Diab, who was tapped for the job after protests forced former premier Saad al-Hariri to resign on Oct. 29.
""We came here today because there is no trust in this government,"" Saadeh said. ""They brought their cronies, their consultants.""
The new government must tackle a financial emergency that has sunk the currency, pushed up prices and driven banks to impose capital controls. Security conditions have deteriorated, with hundreds injured last weekend in clashes between demonstrators and security forces.
""We want a government of independents, not parties,"" said demonstrator Reema Ajouz. ""Independents can save the country. With the politicians we have we are headed to the precipice."""

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Chinese communities around the world greeted the Year of the Rat on Saturday with dances and parades, although celebrations were marred by worries about the coronavirus outbreak that has upended Lunar New Year festivities in China.
In Sydney, which welcomed in the year with golden rat statues set up at the entrance to its downtown Chinatown precinct, authorities said crowds might be smaller than usual.
""We don't know if quite as many people will come this year because of the coronavirus and I'd like to especially acknowledge Wuhan city government,"" said Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore, referring to the central Chinese city at the epicenter of the virus.
Some 100 community events were planned across Sydney until Feb. 11, including dragon boat races and the annual lunar lantern display. Last year, the festivities in the city, home to a large and growing Chinese population, attracted 1.5 million people.
In Manila, and in London's brightly decorated Chinatown, some revelers wore protective face masks.
'FRIGHTENING'
For China's 1.4 billion people, the holiday is the most important of the year and millions of people travel thousands of miles back to their hometowns to gather with family and friends. 
But China, seeking to control the spread of the illness, canceled many large-scale celebrations of the holiday, closed part of the Great Wall and suspended public transport in many cities, stranding millions.
Chinese state television's traditional Lunar New Year extravaganza on Friday paid tribute to the people of Wuhan and to medical staff fighting the coronavirus crisis.
Many events, such as making offerings at temples, wandering around at outdoor festival fairs, and even family reunion dinners at restaurants, have been canceled as public gatherings were discouraged.
    Young people posted on social media appeals to reduce family gatherings or to at least wear masks when greeting one another with New Year's wishes, which is typically seen as disrespectful in the Chinese culture.

""There's so much news, so much data, every 10 minutes there's an update, it's frightening, especially for people like us in a severely hit area,"" Lily Jin, 30, a resident of the city, told Reuters.
In Thailand, Zhao Xiaoli, a tour guide from Eastern China's Anhui province, said that precautions have been taken. 
""(We have advised tourists to) avoid crowded places, take care of personal hygiene, and go to see a doctor immediately if they show symptoms of flu, fever and coughs,"" he said.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi security forces fired bullets and tear gas on Saturday in raids on protest camps in Baghdad and southern cities, killing four people and wounding dozens more, police and medical sources said.
The new push to end the sit-in protests and restore order came hours after populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who has millions of supporters in Baghdad and the south, said he would end his involvement in anti-government unrest.
Sadr's supporters, who had bolstered the protesters and sometimes helped shield them from attacks by security forces and unidentified gunmen, began withdrawing from sit-in camps early on Saturday after his announcement.
Clashes erupted later in the day as authorities removed concrete barriers near Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), where demonstrators have camped out for months, and across at least one main bridge over the Tigris River, Reuters reporters said.
In the southern city of Basra, demonstrators began returning to the main protest site following a raid by security forces the night before, burning tires and cutting off a main road, security sources said. At least 16 protesters were arrested.
In the capital, at least one person was killed and more than 30 hurt as police and protesters clashed near Tahrir Square.
Another three died and 14 were wounded in the southern city of Nassiriya when security forces seized back control of a bridge occupied for days by demonstrators, security sources and medics said.
Iraqi security forces have used tear gas and live ammunition against mostly peaceful protesters since the unrest broke out in Baghdad on Oct. 1. More than 450 people have died in the violence, according to a Reuters tally from police and medics.
MONTHS OF UNREST 
The demonstrators are demanding the removal of what they see as a corrupt ruling elite and an end to foreign interference in domestic politics, especially by Iran, which has come to dominate state institutions since the toppling of Saddam Hussein in a 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
Saturday's multiple raids appeared to be an attempt by authorities to fully clear the sit-ins and end months of unrest.
The security operations were launched hours after Sadr said he would halt the involvement of his supporters.
Sadr had backed the demands of protesters for the removal of corrupt politicians and for the provision of services and jobs soon after the demonstrations began in October, but stopped short of calling all his followers to join in.
Many of Sadr's millions of supporters, often hailing from Baghdad's slums, have however been involved in the protests.
Sadr's followers, in a rally on Friday separate from the anti-government protests, called for the removal of U.S. troops from the country. The march dissipated after several hours.
Sadr wrote on Twitter late on Friday he would ""try not to interfere in the issue (of protesters), either negatively or positively, so that they can shepherd the fate of Iraq."" He did not elaborate.

In Basra, protesters urged him to reconsider. In a letter circulated on social media, they called for the support of Sadrists, without which they feared attacks by security forces.

BRUMADINHO, Brazil (Reuters) - Exactly one year ago a tailings dam in the Brazilian town of Brumadinho collapsed, killing more than 250 people in one of the world's worst mining disasters.
For survivors and relatives of the victims still searching for answers and justice, time has been no healer.
""It's the same today as it was the day of the tragedy. The same feeling of pain, betrayal, loss,"" said Rafaela Cavalcante Andrade, who lost her sister in the tragedy.
""My sister was a person who loved life. She didn't deserve this. 365 days later, the feeling is the same.""
Brazilian state prosecutors this month charged Fabio Schvartsman, Vale SA's (SA:VALE3) former chief executive, and 15 other people with homicide, according to the charging document seen by Reuters.
Responding to the charges, Vale said it was ""perplexed by the accusations of willful misconduct,"" while a representative for Schvartsman pointed out that a federal police report on the matter was not due until June.
A panel of experts appointed by the Vale's lawyers concluded in December that the dam collapse was partially triggered by ""a persistently high water level"" that caused the structure to lose strength and stability, and that there was no warning the dam was unstable.
Andresa Rodrigues, who insists her 26-year-old son Bruno Rocha Rodrigues was ""murdered by Vale"", says there can be no recompense for her loss.
""The last year has been one of pain, regret and sadness, revolt and indignation. There's no compensation. All the mitigation efforts have been nowhere near enough to ease the pain,"" she said."

""At the moment, if (Iranian authorities) make the decision, the Atomic Energy Organization, as the executor, will be able to enrich uranium at any percentage,"" Ali Asghar Zarean said.
Iran said earlier this month it would scrap limitations on enriching uranium, taking a further step back from commitments to a 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers, but pledged to continue cooperating with the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
Since Iran took the latest step in reducing commitments to the accord, the country's stock of uranium produced has passed 1,200 kilograms and it will quickly be added to the stock of enriched uranium, Zarean said. 
Washington withdrew from the nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions to throttle Iran's oil exports as part of a ""maximum pressure"" policy.
The United States says it aims to force Tehran to agree a broader deal that puts stricter limits on its nuclear work, curbs a ballistic missile program and ends regional proxy wars. Iran says it will not negotiate while sanctions remain in place.
Tehran has steadily been reducing its compliance with the deal, which prompted Britain, France and Germany to formally accuse it in mid-January of violating the terms and activating a dispute mechanism in the deal, which could eventually lead to the reimposition of U.N. sanctions.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said last week that if Iran's nuclear file is sent to the U.N. Security Council, the country will withdraw from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), according to the official IRNA news agency.

Iran denies any intent to acquire nuclear weapons and says its breaches of the deal would be reversed if Washington lifts sanctions.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - As he does every year, ethnic Chinese Indonesian Purnama celebrated Lunar New Year on Saturday at a dinner with his extended family of more than 50 in Jakarta where they exchanged traditional red envelopes containing money.
But the 49-year-old Purnama, who uses one name, is unlike most of his ethnic Chinese family: he is a Muslim. 
At the dinner, he and his immediate family were at a table where all the food was halal, while the rest of the tables featured non-halal dishes for the non-Muslims. But the difference in the food was not a big deal for Purnama. 
""Lunar New Year just means hanging out with the family. There are no extraordinary traditions for me,"" he told Reuters.
Ethnic Chinese Muslims like Purnama, who converted in 1994, have a peculiar identity in Indonesia: a minority within a minority. 
Chinese Indonesians make up less than 5% of the 260 million people in the world’s biggest Muslim-majority country. Chinese Muslims number around 131,000 out of 2.8 million ethnic Chinese, according to a 2010 census.
Agni Malagina, an expert on the Chinese community in Indonesia, said Chinese Indonesians are usually Christian, Buddhist, or follow Confucianism.
""But we've seen cases of assimilation, while the Chinese embrace of Islam has also has a long history,"" she said. ""They're heterogeneous, their motivations vary.""
She has observed ethnic Chinese Muslims who have identified as such for generations.
Chinese Indonesians have been the targets of ethnic violence in the past, and Chinese cultural expressions were heavily restricted during the presidency of the late strongman Suharto, said Malagina.
It was not until 2000 after the fall of Suharto that President Abdurrahman Wahid lifted a ban on celebrating the Lunar New Year.
Naga Kunadi, 44, also an ethnic Chinese Muslim, said that after converting to Islam in 2002 some of his non-Muslim family made fun of him not eating pork, but he still celebrates the Lunar New Year.
""I also still get looks from mosque-goers sometimes, until they see that I pray in the right way,"" he said. 
Kunadi is a member of the Haji Karim Oei Foundation, named after a renowned ethnic Chinese Muslim, which is based in the Lautze mosque in Jakarta. 
Kunadi said it can be easier for Chinese Indonesians to be accepted when they convert to Islam.

""But my principle has always been when I converted to Islam, I'm still Chinese,"" he said.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis met Iraq's president on Saturday and the two agreed that the country's sovereignty must be respected, following attacks on Iraqi territory this month by the United States and Iran.
President Barham Salih held private talks for about 30 minutes with the pope and then met the Vatican's two top diplomats, Secretary of State Cardinal Pietro Parolin and Archbishop Paul Gallagher, its foreign minister.
The talks ""focused on the challenges the country currently faces and on the importance of promoting stability and the reconstruction process, encouraging the path of dialogue and the search for suitable solutions in favor of citizens and with respect for national sovereignty,"" a Vatican statement said.
On Jan. 8, Iranian forces fired missiles at two military bases in Iraq housing U.S. troops in retaliation for Washington's killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike a Baghdad airport on Jan. 3.
The Iraqi parliament has passed a resolution ordering the 5,000 U.S. troops stationed in Iraq to leave the country.
Soon after the Iranian attack, Francis urged the United States and Iran to avoid escalation and pursue ""dialogue and self-restraint"" to avert a wider conflict in the Middle East.
The pope discussed the Middle East with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Friday.
The recent tensions in Iraq could make it impossible for Francis to visit the country, which he has said he would like to do this year.
The Vatican said the pope and Salih also discussed ""the importance of preserving the historical presence of Christians in the country"".
The Christian presence in Iraq and some other countries in the Middle East has been depleted by wars and conflicts. 

Iraq's several hundred thousand Christians suffered particular hardships when Islamic State controlled large parts of the country, but have recovered freedoms since the jihadists were pushed out.

ELAZIG, Turkey (Reuters) - The death toll from a powerful earthquake in eastern Turkey reached 22 on Saturday, as rescuers searched for survivors trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings. 
The magnitude 6.8 quake late Friday shook Elazig province, about 550 km (340 miles) east of the capital Ankara, and was followed by more than 390 aftershocks, 14 of which had magnitudes over 4.
Eighteen people were killed in Elazig and four more in the neighboring province of Malatya, said Turkey's Disaster and Emergency Authority (AFAD), adding 1,103 others were injured and in hospitals in the region. It said rescue efforts were underway at three different sites in Elazig.
Turkish broadcasters showed footage of rescuers pulling people out from under the debris, some around 17 hours after the quake.
Speaking in Elazig, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said an estimated 22 people were still trapped under debris. AFAD later said 40 people had been rescued so far.
Speaking alongside Soylu, Health Minster Fahrettin Koca said 128 wounded people were receiving treatment and that 34 of those were in intensive care, but not in critical conditions. He said additional medical centers would be set up if necessary.
Rescue teams worked through the night with their hands, drills and mechanical diggers to remove bricks and plaster from collapsed buildings in Elazig, where the overnight temperature dipped to -8 degrees Celsius.
""Our houses collapsed ... we cannot go inside them,"" said a 32-year-old man from the town of Sivrice, epicenter of the quake which struck shortly before 9 p.m. (1800 GMT).
""In our village some people lost their lives. I hope God will help us,"" said the man, who gave only his first name, Sinasi. ""Our animals died. Our families gathered around the fire to spend the night, covered with blankets,"" Sinasi said as he and a relative tried to warm themselves by a small fire.
State media said on Saturday President Tayyip Erdogan had canceled his plans in Istanbul and would travel to Elazig.
RESCUE EFFORT
State media in Syria and Iran both reported the earthquake was felt in those countries. Local media in Lebanon said the cities of Beirut and Tripoli also felt the quake.
On Friday night, Soylu described it as a ""Level 3"" incident according to the country's emergency response plan, meaning it called for a national response but did not require international help.
He said Turkey, which straddles seismic faultlines and is prone to earthquakes, had learned lessons from previous disasters which helped it address Friday's incident. Drones were deployed in search operations and to communicate between provinces.
Emergency teams and rescue equipment were sent from other provinces to Elazig, with thousands of rescuers and medical personnel on the ground to look for and help survivors. Flag-carrier Turkish Airlines (IS:THYAO) started additional flights to Elazig from Ankara and Istanbul to help transport rescuers.
AFAD warned residents not to return to damaged buildings because of the danger of further aftershocks. It said beds, blankets and tents were being sent to the area, where some people sheltered in sports gymnasiums. Turkey's Kizilay aid group also sent food, heaters and other materials to the region.
""I wish God's mercy to our brothers who lost their lives in the earthquake, and urgent healing for those who were injured,"" Erdogan said on Twitter on Friday. 
Environment and Urbanization Minister Murat Kurum, who spoke alongside Soylu on Saturday, said five buildings in Elazig had collapsed in the quake and there were several heavily damaged structures.
Soylu also said on Saturday a prison in the nearby Adiyaman province was being evacuated due to damage to the building. Justice Minister Abdulhamit Gul said the inmates were being transferred to prisons in three nearby provinces.
Turkey has a history of powerful earthquakes. More than 17,000 people were killed in August 1999 when a 7.6 magnitude quake struck the western city of Izmit, 90 km (55 miles) southeast of Istanbul. About 500,000 people were made homeless.

In 2011, an earthquake struck the eastern city of Van and the town of Ercis, some 100 km (60 miles) to the north, killing at least 523 people.

YANGON (Reuters) - Two women, one pregnant, were killed and seven other people injured after Myanmar troops shelled a Rohingya village on Saturday, according to a lawmaker and a villager, two days after the U.N.’s highest court ordered the country to protect the minority.
Maung Kyaw Zan, a national member of parliament for Buthidaung township in northern Rakhine state, said shells fired from a nearby battalion hit Kin Taung village in the middle of the night. Government troops have been battling ethnic rebels in the state for more than a year.
""There was no fighting, they just shot artillery to a village without a battle,"" he told Reuters by phone, adding it was the second time this year that civilians had been killed.
The military denied responsibility, blaming the rebels who they said attacked a bridge in the early hours of the morning. 
More than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims were forced to flee northern Rakhine state in 2017 after a military crackdown that the U.N has said was executed with genocidal intent.
More recently, the region was plunged into further chaos by fresh fighting between the military and the Arakan Army, a rebel group that recruits from the mostly Buddhist majority in the state. That conflict has displaced tens of thousands and killed dozens.
Of the several hundred thousand Rohingya still in Rakhine, many are confined to apartheid-like conditions, unable to travel freely or access healthcare and education. They are caught in the middle of the fighting, and travel restrictions mean they are less able to flee than Buddhist neighbors.
In early January, four Rohingya children died in a blast the military and rebels blamed on each other.
Two military spokesmen did not answer phone calls from Reuters seeking comment on Saturday's deaths. In a statement posted on the Russian social media network VK, the army confirmed the deaths but blamed the Arakan Army, saying its artillery had hit the village during clashes.
Accounts belonging to the Myanmar military were removed from Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and other social media networks in 2018 over spreading ""hate and misinformation"".
Soe Tun Oo, a Rohingya villager living a mile from the village, told Reuters by phone two houses were destroyed in the explosion.
""The military always shoots heavy weapons… They shoot heavy weapons around the area they suspect. It is impossible to flee to other places, even though we are scared.""
The Hague-based International Court of Justice ordered Myanmar on Thursday to protect the Rohingya against further atrocities and preserve evidence of alleged crimes, after west African nation the Gambia launched a lawsuit in November accusing the country of genocide.
A spokesman for the ruling party told Reuters the country was already protecting Rohingya, but the civilian government had limited power over the military.
Civilian authorities govern jointly with the military in an awkward constitutional arrangement that reserves great powers for the commander-in-chief.

ELAZIG, Turkey (Reuters) - A powerful earthquake struck eastern Turkey on Friday, killing at least 18 people and collapsing buildings in affected towns near the center of the tremor, which was strong enough to be felt in several neighboring countries.
The magnitude 6.8 quake shook Elazig province, about 550 km (340 miles) east of the capital Ankara, and was followed by dozens of aftershocks.
Thirteen people were killed in Elazig and five more in the neighboring province of Malatya, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said after rushing to the region with other ministers to oversee the rescue operation. 
Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said emergency workers were searching for 30 people under the rubble, and more than 500 people were injured.
State broadcaster TRT showed footage of police and emergency workers searching a partly collapsed building in Elazig. Windows were smashed and balconies had crashed to the ground. 
At another collapsed building, teams worked with their hands to remove bricks and plaster from the ruins. Elsewhere emergency workers used drills and mechanical diggers to clear the debris, while injured people were carried on stretchers to ambulances.

""I can confirm that the bodies have been recovered,"" a New South Wales Police spokesperson told Reuters in an e-mail. ""They have been taken for a post mortem examination to confirm ID.""

The crash of the C-130 tanker plane on Thursday added to national grief in Australia over bushfires that have since October killed 33 people and millions of animals as well as charred vast swaths of land.
Officials said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the crash of the plane that went down just after it dumped a large load of retardant on a huge wildfire in a national park in the mountains south of Canberra, the Australian capital.
The Americans were a part of a multi-national contingency that has been helping Australia to combat the devastating bushfires that have in three months scorched a land area about one-third the size of Germany, razing thousands of homes. 
There were 57 bush and grass fires burning in New South Wales, 23 of which were yet to be contained as of early Saturday, New South Wales Rural Fire Service said on Twitter.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The official death toll from the coronavirus in China jumped on Saturday to 41 from 26 a day earlier, as local media reported a doctor on the frontline of the battle to contain the virus in Wuhan city had died.
More than 1,300 people have been infected globally, as health authorities around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic.
Doctor Liang Wudong, 62, at Hubei Xinhua Hospital in Wuhan, the city where the virus first appeared and which is in virtual quarantine, died from the virus, China Global Television Network reported in a tweet.
It was unclear if his death was already counted in the official toll of 41, 39 of which were in the central Hubei province.
The total number of confirmed cases in China now stands at 1,287, the National Health Commission said in a statement on Saturday.
The virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, France, the United States and Australia.
Australia on Saturday announced its first case of coronavirus, a Chinese national in his 50s, who had been in Wuhan and arrived from China on Jan. 19 on a flight from Guangzhou. He is in a stable condition in a Melbourne hospital.
""Given the number of cases that have been found outside of China and the significant traffic from Wuhan city in the past to Australia, it was not unexpected that we would get some cases,"" Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy told a news conference.
""This is the first confirmed case. There are other cases being tested each day, many of them are negative, but I wouldn't be surprised if we had further confirmed cases.""
French authorities reported Europe's first confirmed cases on Friday evening.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Friday it had 63 patients under investigation, with two confirmed cases, both in people who had traveled to Wuhan. Human-to-human transmission has been observed in the virus, which health authorities believe originated in a market in Wuhan that traded illegally in wildlife.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an ""emergency in China"" this week but stopped short of declaring it of international concern.
Wuhan, a city of 11 million, is in virtual lockdown. Nearly all flights at the airport have been canceled and checkpoints block the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed similar lockdowns on more than 10 cities near Wuhan as part of the ongoing containment effort.
As Wuhan slides into isolation, pharmacies have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been flooded with nervous residents. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday, state media said.
Hubei's health authority said on Saturday there were 658 patients affected by the virus in medical care, 57 of whom were critically ill.
The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.
Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing conditions, the WHO said.
NEW YEAR DISRUPTIONS
Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, though some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings and of the lockdown.
Health officials fear the transmission rate could accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for the Lunar New Year, which began on Saturday.
As China scrambles to contain the outbreak some sections of the Great Wall near Beijing will be closed from Saturday.
Beijing's Lama Temple, where people traditionally make offerings for the new year, has closed, as have some other temples and the Forbidden City, the capital's most famous tourist attraction.
Shanghai Disneyland will close from Saturday. The theme park has a 100,000 daily capacity and sold out during last year's Lunar New Year holiday.
Film premieres have been postponed and McDonald's suspended business in five cities in Hubei province.
Shanghai has shut down all cinemas during the Lunar New Year holidays, which last until Jan. 30, the Liberation Daily said on its online channel on Saturday."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Pentagon said on Friday that 34 service members had been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury following missile strikes by Iran on a base in Iraq earlier this month, a number higher than the military had previously announced.
President Donald Trump and other top officials initially said Iran's attack had not killed or injured any U.S. service members.
Last week the U.S. military said 11 U.S. troops had been treated and transferred out of Iraq for concussion symptoms after the attack on the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq and this week said additional troops had been moved out of Iraq for potential injuries.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman told reporters that 17 service members diagnosed had already returned to duty in Iraq.
Eight service members who had been previously transported to Germany had been moved to the United States and would receive treatment at either Walter Reed military hospital or their home bases.
Hoffman said the service members were being treated on an outpatient basis and were transported back to the United States in order to be closer to their pre-deployment bases. 
Nine service members remain in Germany and are undergoing evaluations and treatment. 
Hoffman said the military had seen symptoms like headaches, dizziness, sensitivity to light and nausea. 
On Wednesday, Trump appeared to play down the injuries, saying he ""heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things.""
Pentagon officials have said there had been no effort to minimize or delay information on concussive injuries, but its handling of the injuries following Tehran's attack has renewed questions over the U.S. military's policy regarding how it deals with suspected brain injuries.
While the U.S. military has to immediately report incidents threatening life, limb or eyesight, it does not have an urgent requirement to do so with suspected traumatic brain injury, or TBI, which can take time to manifest and diagnose.
Hoffman said U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper had directed the Pentagon to review the process for tracking and reporting injuries.
""The goal is to be as transparent, accurate and to provide the American people and our service members with the best information,"" Hoffman said.
Various health and medical groups for years have been trying to raise awareness about the seriousness of brain injuries, including concussions.

According to Pentagon data, about 408,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury since 2000.

""We respect the decision of those who have yet to join, I extend a hand to them and assure them the door remains open to join this broad and diverse front that seeks to work for all.""
Anez assumed the presidency in November by invoking a constitutional clause that dictated she would be next in line to rule as interim leader after Morales, vice president Alvaro Garcia Linera, and other lawmakers from his socialist party resigned.
Her conservative caretaker government has shifted sharply away from policies under Morales, sparking some criticism, including cutting ties with traditional allies like Cuba and Venezuela and reforming broken alliances with the United States.
Anez, 52, a TV presenter and lawyer before shifting into politics, is a strong critic of Morales. The former president in return has criticized her administration over alleged excessive use of military force and hurting indigenous rights.
Anez had previously said it would not be correct for her to run. She told Reuters this month she was focused on unifying a fragmented opposition to Morales, who while not running himself is directing his party's campaign.
Under her leadership, the interim government has calmed a volatile situation in Bolivia which saw scores killed in street battles late last year, established a new electoral tribunal and paved the way for new elections, to be held on May 3.
Morales, who was the country's first indigenous president, currently lives in Argentina. He resigned on Nov. 10 after an audit by the Organization of American States found serious irregularities in the October vote. Morales denies any wrongdoing and maintains he was ousted in a coup.

The leftist, who is barred from running himself in the May election, has named his former economy minister Luis Arce Catacora as the candidate for his Movement to Socialism (MAS) party alongside former foreign minister David Choquehuanca.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China confirmed another 15 deaths in the province at the center of the deadly coronavirus outbreak that has now infected more than 1,000 people globally, highlighting the challenges for health authorities around the world working to prevent a global pandemic.
The Health Commission of Hubei Province said in a statement published early Saturday that 180 new cases had been reported as of end-Friday, putting the total number of confirmed patients in the province at 752.
All 15 deaths reported by the commission occurred in Wuhan, the province's capital and epicenter of the outbreak that has been in virtual quarantine as China scrambles to contain the virus spread.
There has been no new national-level data available yet from Chinese authorities. The National Health Commission on Friday had confirmed 830 cases.
The vast majority of the cases and all of the 41 confirmed deaths to date have been in China, but the virus has also been detected in Thailand, Vietnam, Singapore, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Nepal, France and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the new coronavirus an ""emergency in China"" this week but stopped short of declaring it of international concern. The virus continues to spread globally, however: French authorities reported Europe's first confirmed cases on Friday evening.
Wuhan, a city of 11 million at the center of the outbreak, is in virtual lockdown. Nearly all flights at Wuhan's airport have been canceled and checkpoints block the main roads leading out of town. Authorities have since imposed similar lockdowns on more than 10 cities near Wuhan as part of the ongoing containment effort.
As Wuhan slides into isolation, pharmacies have begun to run out of supplies and hospitals have been flooded with nervous residents. The city is rushing to build a 1,000-bed hospital by Monday, state media said.
The newly-identified coronavirus has created alarm because there are still many unknowns surrounding it, such as how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can cause pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.
Symptoms include fever, difficulty breathing and coughing. Most of the fatalities have been in elderly patients, many with pre-existing conditions, the WHO said.
Airports around the world have stepped up screening of passengers from China, though some health officials and experts have questioned the effectiveness of such screenings and of the lockdown. The virus's symptoms are also similar to other respiratory diseases, adding to difficulties in screening.
Hubei's health authority said there were 658 patients affected by the virus in medical care, 57 of whom were critically ill."

BELFAST (Reuters) - Former Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Seamus Mallon, one of the architects of the 1998 Good Friday peace agreement, died on Friday aged 83, drawing tributes from across a political divide he helped to bridge.
Mallon was a major political figure in Northern Ireland during the three decades of violence between Catholic nationalists seeking union with Ireland and Protestant unionists wanting Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom.
He went on to jointly head the devolved power-sharing administration that followed the peace deal and was remembered as a peacemaker who recognized, in his words, that Northern Ireland's divided communities could ""live together in generosity and compassion or we can continue to die in bitter disharmony"".
Former U.S. President Bill Clinton, whose hands-on role was central to bringing an end to the conflict that killed some 3,600 people, called Mallon a hero of Northern Ireland's peace process and a profoundly good man.
""Seamus never wavered from his vision for a shared future where neighbors of all faiths could live in dignity,"" Clinton said in a statement.
""A teacher in practice and in heart, the lessons of his life and power of his example are as important today as ever.""
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar praised Mallon for his unswerving commitment to constitutional nationalism when others in his community advocated violence, calling him ""a peacemaker who put us on the path to reconciliation.""
Mallon died at his home in the Northern Irish county of Armagh, a spokesman for his Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) said. 
""THIRST FOR JUSTICE""
A marcher in the 1960s civil rights movement that preceded Northern Ireland's violent ""Troubles"", Mallon said his activism was influenced by the injustices he perceived Catholic children suffered during his time as a headmaster.
He grew up in a mainly unionist area in the British region and broke the mould when - at the height of the Troubles - he attended funerals of murdered police officers from the then British-run force when many Irish nationalists dared not.
""In the darkest days of conflict, when hope was in short supply, Seamus represented the fierce thirst for justice... Ireland has lost one of its most fierce champions for justice, equality and peace,"" SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said.
Mallon famously described the 1998 accord as ""Sunningdale for slow learners"", in reference to the short-lived Sunningdale Agreement brokered 25 years earlier that sought to set up a power-sharing government.
In a 2018 interview with the Press Association, he recalled sleeping on a table during the ""frenetic"" final days that led to the peace deal still revered around the world.
Mallon served under John Hume as deputy leader of the SDLP for more than two decades when it was the largest Irish nationalist party in the province, and also alongside Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble of the rival Ulster Unionist Party until 2001.
Trimble, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize with Hume for their efforts in ending the conflict, said he had visited the dying Mallon in recent days and while they didn't always agree during their political life, ""it worked"", he told the BBC.
Politicians past and present lined up to pay tribute to a man remembered as much for his bluntness as his integrity.
Former Irish Foreign Minister Micheal Martin, favorite to become next Irish prime minister after a Feb. 8 election, described Mallon as his ""friend and long time political hero"".

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the former deputy first minister made an extraordinary contribution to democracy and peace in Northern Ireland. His minister for the region, Julian Smith, said that together with Trimble, Mallon had set Northern Ireland on a new democratic course.

HOUSTON (Reuters) - A massive explosion at a machine shop ripped through a Houston neighborhood early on Friday morning, killing at least two people and damaging homes while sending out blast waves for miles.
The pre-dawn explosion devastated two working-class neighborhoods surrounding the Watson Grinding and Manufacturing facility in northwest Houston, leaving behind collapsed and smoldering wreckage on the grounds and knocking several nearby homes off their foundations.
Houston Fire Chief Samuel Pena said early indications pointed to a leak of propylene gas, a colorless, flammable, liquefied gas with several industrial uses. But Police Chief Art Acevedo said that was ""just a huge assumption"" and cautioned that the investigation could take several days, weeks or months.
Officials stressed that they had no reason to believe the explosion was intentionally triggered. 
The multi-agency probe will focus primarily on whether any regulatory violations were committed by either Watson Grinding or its vendors, Acevedo said, adding the company was cooperating fully. 
While investigators sought to positively identify the two victims, there is a ""high probability"" they were two men who worked for the company, Acevedo said.
Numerous homes had windows blown in. Others were surrounded by shattered piles of debris. 
""I thought it was thunder,"" said Bruce Meikle, 78, an owner of nearby manufacturer ChemSystems, who heard the explosion from his home about a mile (1.6 km) from the scene.
The force of the blast bent the metal loading doors at his business and caused minor damage inside, he told Reuters.
Paul Crea, 59, a chemist who works for Meikle, said the blast woke him 10 miles (16 km) away in Katy, a Houston suburb, and his dogs bellowed at the sound.
Acevedo asked people as far as a mile (1.6 km) away to search their yards and neighborhoods for evidence.
""Look for any debris, any body parts, anything that may be related,"" Acevedo said.
Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the blast was felt as far away as 14 miles (22 km), based on social media reports. 
The moment of the explosion, around 4:25 a.m. CST (1025 GMT), was captured on video by a home security camera. It showed a blinding flash in the distance followed by a fireball.
Firefighters secured a 2,000-gallon propylene tank outside the building and would allow any remaining fires to burn out, Pena said.
Rescue crews fanned out to examine nearly 200 homes.
""Some of them are off the foundation, the ones especially that are closer to the explosion site,"" Pena said.
A temporary shelter was established for people left homeless.

Houston, an oil and gas industry hub, is the fourth largest city in the United States with a population of some 2.3 million.

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - A retired Salvadoran general on Friday acknowledged for the first time that the armed forces were responsible for a notorious 1981 massacre of more than 1,000 people during the country's civil war.
Juan Rafael Bustillo, a former commander of the Air Force, told a court the elite Atlacatl Battalion carried out the El Mozote massacre in eastern El Salvador in which unarmed villagers, most of them women and children, were slaughtered.
According to a U.N. report, soldiers tortured and executed over 1,000 residents of El Mozote and surrounding hamlets in the Morazan department, 180 km (110 miles) northeast of San Salvador, as they searched for guerrillas in December 1981.
At a court hearing in the eastern town of San Francisco Gotera in Morazan, Bustillo testified he had had no part in the operation which he said was conducted at the behest of Colonel Domingo Monterrosa, commander of the feared Atlacatl Battalion.
""War sometimes gives rise to something in the minds of people that attaches no value to the lives of others. I think it was on his initiative (Monterrosa's),"" Bustillo said.
""That's my reasoning, it was on his initiative that he gave the order to kill the people of El Mozote, and the other surrounding cantons,"" the retired general told the court.
""I almost feel it was like a moment, some instance of madness on the part of Colonel Monterrosa to have committed that offense, because it was an offense,"" he added.
Monterrosa, a highly regarded officer in his day, died in 1984 during a helicopter explosion in the east of the country.
The 1980-1992 civil war, which pitted leftist guerrillas against the U.S.-backed Salvadoran army, lead to the deaths of an estimated 75,000 people and left 8,000 more missing.
In 2016, a judge ordered the case of the El Mozote massacre to be re-opened. Sixteen military officials including ex-defense minister Guillermo Garcia are being tried over the killings.
Representatives of the victims hailed Bustillo's testimony.
""General Bustillo has confirmed many of the excesses demonstrated by evidence and which were denounced by victims,"" David Morales, one of the victims' lawyers, told reporters. ""He fully accepts that this massacre was carried out."""
299,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 05:14PM ET</span>",Mexico is the wall: president under fire over migration clampdown,"By Julia Love and Lizbeth Diaz
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican leader Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador faces growing criticism he is doing U.S. President Donald Trump's bidding after erecting a ""wall"" of security forces who clashed with Central American migrants near the Guatemala border this week.
Mexico, under the threat of punitive U.S. tariffs, has bowed to Trump's demands to contain mass movements of migrants traveling through the country toward the U.S. border.
Such concessions previously stirred little criticism from the Mexican public, due to president Lopez Obrador's reputation as a leftist supportive of the poor and foreign migrants.
But footage of Mexico's National Guard military police marching into Central Americans and using tear gas has triggered growing condemnation, including from the United Nations.
""It's a wall of riot shields,"" said Duncan Wood, director of the Wilson Center's Mexico Institute in Washington. ""I didn't think I would live to see the day when Mexico would do this kind of thing.""
Lopez Obrador defended the National Guard and migration officials at his regular news conference. He said the caravan of Central American migrants was not spontaneous, hinting that Honduran activists were driving it for political ends.
Previous Mexican governments have also faced criticism they were bending to Washington's will on migration.
Trump has made immigration a key issue in his re-election campaign and wants a wall built along the U.S-Mexico border.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Roberto Velasco rejected the notion that his government had effectively created Trump's wall along the Suchiate River separating Mexico and Guatemala.
""That's totally wrong,"" he said in response to a question on Mexican radio. ""Unfortunately, Mexico has never developed a border, which means we inherited poor infrastructure.""
Mexican offices of several U.N. agencies said they were worried about the impact Thursday's operations would have on children and other ""vulnerable"" groups.
""Mexico has the right to control the entry of foreigners as long as there is no excessive use of force,"" the groups wrote in a joint statement, urging Mexico not to separate families.
On Thursday, National Guard members corralled families onto buses for detention and deportation.
Enrique Vidal of human rights group Fray Matias de Cordova, who witnessed the scenes, said National Guard members began clashes by marching on the migrants. Some migrants were beaten, while pepper spray affected pregnant women, children and people with disabilities, and one minor passed out, he added.
As Mexico put migrants into detention centers on Monday, Fray Matias recorded three cases of children separated from their parents from a few hours to up to two days, Vidal said.
He said Fray Matias and other rights groups have been stopped from visiting detention centers to monitor conditions, or have had to conduct interviews with security forces present. 
Lopez Obrador has offered migrants jobs. But Vidal said that when they reached the southern border, migrants found ""a military operation of containment and detention.""
Under pressure from Trump, Mexico has deployed thousands of National Guard to stem migrant flows. Apprehensions at the U.S.-Mexico border have fallen about 70 percent over seven months. 
However, Mexico's response has pushed migrants to take more dangerous routes, said Christopher Gascon, head of the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration's (IOM) Mexico mission.
""They put themselves in even riskier situations,"" he told Reuters.
As of Thursday, Mexico said it had transferred at least 800 migrants, including unaccompanied minors, to migration centers where they would be given food, medical attention and shelter.

Thousands of migrants have entered Guatemala from Honduras in recent days, one of the biggest surges since three Central American governments signed agreements with Washington obliging them to take on more of the burden of dealing with migrants.

(Reuters) - U.S. Senator Ron Wyden said on Friday he will move to compel America's intelligence chief to release information about the murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi if the administration does not produce a report on the killing before the end of the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.
Wyden was invoking the Senate's power to unilaterally declassify intelligence material to push the Trump administration to release a report into the October 2018 killing of Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Such a report was due by law to have been released earlier this month, a deadline the Democratic senator said the administration had flouted.
The goal, Wyden told reporters, was ""naming names with respect to who ordered it, who was complicit, and what might have been done to prevent it.""
Wyden is unlikely to get his way - at least not directly. 
Even though the Senate has the power under a 1970s-era authority to unilaterally declassify information, no such move has ever made it out of the Intelligence Committee on which the Oregon Democrat serves as a member.
Steven Aftergood, with the Federation of American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, said threatening to use the authority might push the administration to find ""an acceptable middle ground - an unclassified version of the assessment, a classified briefing, or something else.""
Wyden said an unclassified assessment was what he was after, predicting that the push would draw support from at least some Republicans on the committee. 
""I don't think there's a lot of Republican support for carrying water for nondisclosure here,"" he said.
The CIA believes Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ordered the killing of Khashoggi, sources told Reuters weeks after his death. Even an unclassified version of that assessment could be explosive, given close ties between the United States and Saudi Arabia and between the Trump administration and bin Salman in particular.
A spokesman for the Senate Intelligence Committee declined comment. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence said in an email that its response to Congress was ""in process.""

The Saudi Embassy in Washington, which rejects allegations bin Salman was involved in Khashoggi's killing, did not immediately return messages seeking comment.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivians are dreaming big and hoping investments in miniature models of houses, tiny dollar bills and even pocket-sized roosters will help bring them luck for the year ahead.
The colorful Aymara Festival of Alasita - which means ""buy me"" - held on Friday, is an annual tradition, with local artisan fairs dealing in miniatures, which are then blessed under the auspices of the indigenous god of abundance, Ekeko.
People buy lucky charms related to their personal wishes for the year. Want professional or educational success? There are mini diplomas and qualifications. Hoping to find a bride or groom? Snap up some mini-rings or a wedding certificate.
""These miniatures come true every year with the blessing of God,"" said Geovana Jimenez, a seller of the tiny models in La Paz, adding though that people could not rely on luck alone.
""It's also, more than anything, the effort a person makes.""
Fernando Villa, who believes in the good fortune the miniatures can bring, said the festival was about having faith in what could be achieved in the year ahead.
""This celebration and this tradition is all about hoping that our biggest wishes become a reality,"" he told Reuters at the fair, while holding a colorful model of a shop.
Bolivians face some uncertainty in 2020 with a slowing economy and new elections slated for May after long-standing leftist leader Evo Morales resigned under pressure in November, leaving something of a political vacuum.
Jimenez, the miniature seller, said people came from far and wide to join the festivities.

""They come from their homes to buy property deeds, cars, bills (of money), hampers and everything else so they won't be lacking,"" she said. ""That's the tradition, so in the year they can achieve their dreams.""

The territorial waters Morocco has claimed include the coast off Western Sahara, a territory that has been contested between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario Front since the Spanish colonial period ended in 1975.
Morocco's parliament passed two bills this week to give domestic legal cover to a coastal area the North African country already controls, causing concern in Spain's Canary Islands, where the government warned of overlaps with Spanish territorial waters.
Morocco's foreign minister Nasser Bourita said that defining territorial waters was a ""sovereign right"" and that his country aimed to upgrade domestic law in compliance with the UN law of the sea convention.
""In case of overlaps, international law requires states to negotiate,"" said Bourita following talks with his Spanish peer, Arancha Gonzalez Laya.
""Morocco rejects unilateral acts and fait accompli,"" he said, adding that Spain was a ""strategic partner"" and Morocco's largest trading partner.
Gonzalez Laya said Morocco's willingness to negotiate ""reassures the Canary Islands"".
""Morocco is a source of stability for Spain,"" she said, citing ""close cooperation"" in the fight against jihadists and illegal migration. "

The fire started on Thursday afternoon in the rural district of Cagua, outside the city of Maracay, according to Douglas Rico, director of Venezuela's CICPC forensic police. Rico said authorities were investigating if the fire was accidental or arson.
""There was a strong wind that changed the direction of the flames and they were trapped by the fire,"" Rico said on state television.
Aragua's governor, Rodolfo Marco, told a news conference that the boys, all aged between 10 and 18, died from second and third degree burns. Two other boys remain hospitalized.
Farmers often burn cane fields in the region this time of year during harvest, authorities said, and locals try to catch animals as they run out of the undergrowth to escape the flames.

MADRID (Reuters) - Opposition parties rebuked Spain's government on Friday over an encounter at Madrid's international airport between a minister and a senior aide to Venezuela's President Nicolas Maduro subject to a European Union (EU) travel ban.
Spain, along with most EU nations, does not view Maduro's leftist government as legitimate, instead recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as president of Venezuela. 
However Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos said he met Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodriguez, briefly at the airport after midnight on Monday.
""I said 'Hello' to her on behalf of the Minister of Tourism and that's it, nothing more,"" he told reporters on Friday evening. He said he reminded Rodriguez that ""she could not enter Spanish territory"".
""There was no meeting and no stepping onto Spanish territory,"" Abalos said.
A Transport Ministry source earlier told Reuters ""it was a greeting forced by circumstance"" on the airport tarmac, adding that Abalos was there to meet Venezuelan Tourism Minister Felix Plasencia, a friend and Spanish citizen traveling on the same plane as Rodriguez.
""The transport minister had no formal contact with the Venezuelan vice-president and his intention in heading to the airport was not to meet with her,"" the source added.
That did not, however, stop a shower of criticism.
""If this is confirmed, Abalos cannot continue to lead the ministry for even one more day,"" Pablo Casado, leader of the conservative People's Party (PP), told reporters. ""Spain's image and compliance with EU resolutions is very important.""
The 28-nation bloc slapped travel bans and asset freezes on Rodriguez and other officials in mid-2018. 
Tourism minister Plasencia is not on the list. 
SANCTIONS
According to Spanish news site VozPopuli, a flight carrying Rodriguez left Caracas on Sunday, landing in Madrid's Barajas airport nine hours later. After some 14 hours in Madrid, it went on to Istanbul's Ataturk airport.
Venezuela and Turkey are allies.
Two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters that Rodriguez was confined to an area of the airport not considered Spanish soil. A spokeswoman for the EU's executive Commission said it was up to individual nations to interpret how sanctions apply to airport areas prior to passport controls.
Critics were not placated. 
""Did Abalos meet with the vice-president of the Maduro totalitarian regime? With someone banned from entering the European Union as a high-ranking official of that tyranny?"" the center-right Ciudadanos party's spokesman Edmundo Bal tweeted, demanding that Abalos give an explanation to parliament.
Abalos is a senior member of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez' Socialist party that rules in coalition with junior party Unidas Podemos, a far-left movement which has supported Venezuela's leftist ruling party in the past.
The controversy came days ahead of a planned visit to Spain by Venezuela's opposition leader Guaido.
Sanchez does not have plans to meet him, which has angered right-wing opposition parties but been welcomed by Podemos. 
Guaido this week met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and attended the World Economic Forum in Davos. 
He also saw French President Emmanuel Macron on Friday. Spanish right-wing parties plan to rally for Guaido's visit. 

Venezuela's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rodriguez' stopover in Spain.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday confirmed a second U.S. case of the new coronavirus from China in a Chicago woman, and said as many as 63 potential cases were being investigated as the sometimes deadly illness continues to spread around the globe.
Of the 63 people under investigation from 22 states, 11 have so far tested negative, CDC said on a conference call with reporters.
News of the woman in Chicago infected with the virus that originated in Wuhan, China, followed the announcement earlier this week of a man from Washington state who was diagnosed with the virus after returning from Wuhan.
The newly discovered virus has killed 26 people and infected more than 800. Most of the cases and all of the deaths so far have been in China, where officials have imposed severe restrictions on travel and public gatherings.
The virus has created alarm, but there are a still many unknowns surrounding it, such as just how dangerous it is and how easily it spreads between people. It can lead to pneumonia, which has been deadly in some cases.
""CDC believes the immediate risk to the American public is low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC's Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said on the call.
More U.S. cases are likely, she added.
Dr. Julie Gerberding, a Merck & Co executive who was CDC director during the 2003 SARS outbreak, said it is too early to predict the course the disease.
""I would caution against jumping to any premature conclusions about the severity of this because the epidemic is still unfolding,"" she said in a phone interview.
""As we learn from basically every new outbreak, we don't know where it's going to end up until it gets there.""
The 60-year-old woman from Chicago had traveled to Wuhan in December and returned Jan. 13. 
Dr. Allison Arwady, commissioner of the Chicago Department of Public Health, said on a conference call that the woman is in stable condition and remains in an unnamed Chicago hospital primarily for infection control purposes. 
She had not taken public transportation and was not ill when she traveled, Arwady said.
A few days after arriving home, the patient began to feel unwell and called ahead to alert her doctor to her illness. The physician asked about her travel history, quickly put a mask on the patient, and directed her to a hospital with infection control capabilities, Arwady said.
Hospital staff performed a full clinical examination and worked with public health officials to arrange testing for the novel coronavirus at the CDC.
Dr. Michael Ison, an infectious disease expert at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, which is not caring for the patient, said the announcement of the second U.S. case means the system is working. ""I don't think the severity of the threat has changed,"" he said.
In a local news briefing, Arwady said the health risk to Chicago residents remains low, adding there is no need for people to change their behavior in any way.

The World Health Organization on Thursday declared the virus an ""emergency in China"", but stopped short of declaring it a global health emergency.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Cyprus is blocking new European Union sanctions against several officials from Russia-annexed Crimea in a bid to secure EU backing for tougher action against Turkey in a separate row over drilling for hydrocarbons, three diplomatic sources said.
Nicosia denied linking the two issues and said it needed time to review the proposed measures against the Crimean officials.
Cyprus, backed by the EU, accuses Turkey of drilling illegally for oil and gas in its territorial waters. The EU has prepared the ground for travel bans and asset freezes but has postponed saying which Turkish officials they would target in order to give Ankara time to change tack.
The EU has also agreed to blacklist more officials in Crimea, which Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014, but the sanctions require unanimous support from all 28 member states and Cyprus has recently blocked the process at the technical level, the sources said.
""The way Cyprus is hijacking the Russia listings has deeply irritated its friends and partners around the table. It is all the more surprising since Cyprus has enjoyed unparalleled solidarity from its EU partners over the last few months (in the dispute with Turkey),"" said one EU diplomat.
A second diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said Poland and Germany were among those pushing Cyprus to stop blocking the new Crimea measures.
""The Cypriots want to have sanctions on Turkey for drilling and have been frustrated that it is taking time,"" said the second diplomat. ""This is why they are meddling with the Crimea listings.""
""NO CONNECTION""
Cyprus' foreign ministry rejected the criticism.
""There is no connection made between the two sanctions regimes. We are in the process of reviewing the information provided with regard to the Ukraine sanctions,"" Cypriot foreign ministry spokesman, Demetris Samuel told Reuters.
On Turkey, Samuel added: ""Our aim is to see the (EU decisions) implemented. We feel that it is important... to expedite and finalize this work with regards to the listings.""
A third EU diplomat said he still hoped the list of sanctioned Crimean officials would be approved ""early next week"", or the matter would have to go before EU ambassadors.
""Everything depends on Cyprus and whether they will drop their objections,"" he said.
If sanctions are imposed, the asset freezes and travel bans are likely to target the Turkish military and captains of the drilling ships, rather than senior Turkish officials, diplomats said. The decision aims to punish Ankara for violating Cyprus' maritime economic zone by drilling off the divided island.
Cyprus was divided in 1974 after a Turkish invasion triggered by a brief Greek-inspired coup. Several peacemaking efforts have failed and the discovery of offshore resources has complicated the negotiations."

The words ""Juden Hier"" (Jews Here) were written above a Star of David on the door, recalling the signs put on buildings in Nazi Germany to mark the homes and businesses of local Jews.
The house in Mondovi used to belong to Lidia Rolfi, who joined the resistance against Nazi invaders in World War Two but was swiftly captured and deported to the Ravensbrueck concentration camp in Germany in 1944.
She managed to survive and later wrote several books denouncing the horrors of the camps in an effort to raise awareness of the Nazi atrocities. She died in 1996 and her son Aldo now lives in the house.
He published an article in a local newspaper earlier this week to mark the forthcoming Jan. 27 Holocaust Memorial Day.
""This is a very serious sign of intolerance and provocation right at the time when we remember the Shoah,"" said Milena Santerini, national coordinator for the fight against anti-Semitism in Italy.
Politicians also expressed outrage.
""This is where the culture of hate leads. What else has to happen to make people understand that we must all mobilize against this madness?"" said Nicola Zingaretti, head of the center-left coalition Democratic Party (PD).
Another Holocaust survivor, Liliana Segre, was placed under police protection in November after she received threats from far-right fanatics, highlighting a rise in anti-Semitism in Italy.
The Anti-Semitism Observatory registered 251 episodes of anti-Semitism across the country in 2019 up from 181 in 2018."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The heir to the British throne expressed sadness on Friday over the suffering and hardship faced by Palestinians and called for ""a just and lasting peace"" in the Middle East on the third day of his visit to the Holy Land.
Prince Charles met Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Bethlehem, prayed with Christian clergy and visited the grave of his grandmother, who is buried on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives and is honored by Israel for saving Jews during the Holocaust.
""It breaks my heart... that we should continue to see so much suffering and division. No one arriving in Bethlehem today could miss the signs of continued hardship and the situation you face,"" Charles, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth, said on his first official visit to the occupied Palestinian Territories.
""...I can only join you, and all communities, in your prayers for a just and lasting peace... It is my dearest wish that the future will bring freedom, justice and equality to all Palestinians, enabling you to thrive and to prosper.""
His five-mile (eight-km) journey to Bethlehem involved traversing an Israeli military checkpoint to reach the other side of a concrete wall that Israel built through West Bank territory it captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
BUILDING BRIDGES
Charles, 71, said it would be ""the greatest tragedy"" if the ancient Palestinian Christian communities were to disappear from the Holy Land, an apparent reference to the departure of many Arab Christians from the Middle East.
Britain's royal family steers clear of politics, though Charles, who will become governor of the Church of England when he ascends the throne, has long spoken out on issues such as inter-faith dialogue and the environment.
""I have endeavored to build bridges between different religions, so that we might learn from each other and be stronger together as a result,"" he said on Friday after visiting in Bethlehem the Mosque of Omar and the Church of the Nativity, where according to tradition Jesus Christ was born.
Earlier, Charles bowed his head in remembrance before the tomb of his grandmother, Princess Alice, a devout Christian who sheltered a Jewish family in Nazi-occupied Greece.
On Thursday Charles spoke of the inspiration he drew from his grandmother during a Holocaust memorial ceremony attended by dozens of world leaders to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.
Charles, Prince of Wales, stood in prayer with local clergymen around his grandmother's crypt inside the golden-domed, Russian Orthodox Church of Mary Magdalene, where a female choir chanted motets from a vantage above the Old City.
In 1993, Princess Alice of Battenberg received the highest honor Yad Vashem bestows on non-Jews - Righteous Among the Nations - for hiding three members of the Cohen family in her palace in Athens during World War Two.
She died in London in 1969 and had asked to be buried in Jerusalem, next to her aunt.
They are both laid to rest on the Mount of Olives, a biblical hilltop holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims. At its foot is the Garden of Gethsemane, revered by Christians as the place where Jesus Christ prayed before he was crucified."

Nkurunziza, whose decision to run for a third, five-year term in 2015 sparked widespread protests and violence, has pledged not to stand in the polls. His party, the CNDD-FDD, will pick a presidential candidate this Sunday.
Prosper Ntahorwamiye, the government's spokesman, said the council of ministers would send legislation confirming Nkurunziza's title to parliament, which is controlled by the ruling party. It's unclear what powers the title will confer.
""Nkurunziza deserves consideration for services he did for the Burundian people, who decided to elevate him to the rank of the supreme guide in patriotism,"" Ntahorwamiye said on state television.
The proposed new bill comes after parliament passed another bill earlier this week, granting Nkurunziza hefty pension perks including a 1 billion Burundi franc ($535,000) retirement villa.
In September, the United Nations warned that police, security forces and the ruling party's youth league, the Imbonerakure, were committing serious human rights violations.
Those included killings, disappearances, torture and gang rape of alleged political opponents, and that violence was likely to spike as polls approached. Burundi condemned these accusations.
Burundi is one of the world's poorest countries and lost donor funding after the political violence following the 2015 election. Its GDP per capita was $270 per person in 2018, World Bank statistics show.
Party members in the CNDD-FDD said potential candidates in the party primary on Sunday include the party's Secretary General Evariste Ndayishimiye and the speaker of the national assembly, Pascal Nyabenda.
The winner will face off with the opposition Frodebu and CNL parties in the May election."

Angola named dos Santos a formal suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds during her time as chairwoman of state oil company Sonangol, while Portugal's market watchdog has launched inquiries into various firms in which she holds stakes. 
Dos Santos has denied any wrongdoing and, in a statement sent to Reuters on Thursday, said she ""always operated within the law and all my commercial transactions have been approved by lawyers, banks, auditors and regulators"".
The attorney generals of Portugal and Angola, Lucilia Gago and Pitta Gros, met in Lisbon on Thursday to discuss, among other things, how both countries could collaborate on the dos Santos' case, Gros told Portuguese broadcaster RTP during a television interview. 
Asked by RTP if Angola could ask Portugal to seize dos Santos' assets, namely her shares in Portuguese companies and Portuguese bank accounts, Gros said: ""It could happen... It could happen.""
""I will not say this is a reality now...but when teams start working they could reach that conclusion,"" he said.
One of the companies where dos Santos held shares, Efacec, said on Friday that dos Santos would offload her controlling stake in the firm - her second such move this week.
Efacec said in a statement that dos Santos had told the board she had decided to withdraw from the company's shareholding structure. It did not specify a reason and made no mention of any accusations against her.
On Wednesday, small Portuguese lender Eurobic, in which dos Santos was the largest shareholder with a 42.5% stake, said the businesswoman had decided to sell her share. 
Dos Santos bought her controlling stake in Efacec for around 200 million euros in 2015 through offshore company Winterfell Industries. 
The decisions to withdraw from Efacec and Eurobic come during increased scrutiny of dos Santos after hundreds of thousands of files - dubbed the ""Luanda Leaks"" - were released by several news organizations on Sunday.
Dos Santos still holds significant indirect stakes in several important Portuguese firms such as oil firm Galp Energia and telecoms company NOS.
Dos Santos and Portuguese retailer Sonae each own 50% of holding company ZOPT-SGPS, which controls 52.15% of NOS.
Following the scandal, three non-executive board members at NOS stepped down from their roles on Thursday, the company said in a statement. 

NOS shares fell by more than 5% on Friday morning before recovering most of the losses to trade 0.9% lower.

Turkey has sent a training and cooperation team to Libya as part of a military cooperation agreement signed in November with Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA).
""We sent, are sending our military delegation to there ... We will not leave Serraj alone. We are determined to provide all the help we can on this point,"" Erdogan said. 
Last week, Germany hosted a summit on Libya involving the rival camps, their main foreign backers and representatives which agreed that a permanent ceasefire has to be achieved in Tripoli to allow a political process to take place.
Speaking in Istanbul after talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Erdogan also said countries which attended the Libya summit in Berlin on Sunday should not favor Serraj's opponent, Khalifa Haftar, after he left the meeting without signing a ceasefire deal.
Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) faction is supported by Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, which have for years provided training and weapons, according to U.N. reports.

Libya has had no stable central authority since Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed rebels in 2011. For more than five years, it has had two rival governments, in the east and the west, with streets controlled by armed groups.

Turkey agreed with the European Union in 2016 to stem the flow into Europe of migrants fleeing Syria's civil war, in return for financial support for some 3.6 million refugees in Turkey.
The deal, under which the bloc committed 6 billion euros up to the end of last year, sharply curtailed the number of Syrian refugees arriving in Europe.
Speaking after a week of talks in Turkey, Nacho Sanchez Amor said the agreement had delivered results but the Syrian refugee crisis persisted and could get worse.
Renewed bombardments by Russia-backed Syrian government forces in the country's northwestern province of Idlib, home to some 3 million Syrians, have raised fears of a new migrant wave into Turkey.
""We register that the problem is still there,"" the rapporteur told a news conference. ""It could be even worse with people coming from Idlib. We are open to discuss the situation.""
The refugee accord was one positive element in an otherwise difficult relationship, he said. ""The migration deal is the main island of normalizing relations between Turkey and the European Union.""
Turkey says EU membership remains one of its top goals even though accession talks, formally launched in 2004, have been stalled for years.
Some EU leaders and officials have called for them to be ended after a crackdown in Turkey, in which thousands of people were detained, following a failed 2016 military coup. President Tayyip Erdogan's government says the response was justified by the scale of threats which the country faced.
Sanchez Amor said the EU was committed to Turkey's accession process but that there was a lack of trust on both sides, urging Turkey to work with the EU on reforms to improve the rule of law, judicial independence and freedom of expression and media.
He singled out the cases of pro-Kurdish figure Selahattin Demirtas and philanthropist Osman Kavala, both in jail on terrorism charges as their trials continue. Critics have said the charges are politically motivated.
The rapporteur said the cases were ""excellent opportunities"" for Turkey to show it is committed to human rights and is approaching EU standards."

China has faced an outcry from activists, scholars, foreign governments and U.N. rights experts over what they call mass detentions and strict surveillance of the mostly Muslim Uighur minority and other Muslim groups who call Xinjiang home.
""As we speak, the Communist Party of China is using artificial intelligence to repress Muslin minority communities and pro-democracy demonstrators,"" Esper said during a speech in Washington.
""In fact, the party has constructed a 21st century surveillance state with unprecedented abilities to censor speech and infringe upon basic human rights,"" Esper added. ""George Orwell would be proud.""
Orwell's ""1984"" novel features a ""Big Brother"" government that spies on its citizens and forces them into ""doublethink,"" or simultaneously accepting contradictory versions of the truth.
The Chinese government has ramped up personal surveillance in Xinjiang over recent years, including the construction of an extensive video surveillance system and smartphone monitoring technology.
China says Xinjiang is its internal affair, and the issue there is not a religious or ethnic one, but about preventing terrorism and separatism.
Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has been embroiled by more than seven months of turmoil sparked by a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent to China for trial.
The youth-led protests, including mass marches, petrol bomb attacks and battles on university campuses, have since morphed into a broader revolt against authorities and strong-arm Chinese rule."
319,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 10:49AM ET</span>",Trump's peace plan may polarize the Middle East it seeks to calm,"By Stephen Farrell and Rami Ayyub
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - As U.S. President Donald Trump prepares to host Israeli leaders in Washington to reveal details of his long-delayed Middle East peace plan, Palestinians warned on Friday that no deal could work without them on board.
Trump invited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his chief rival centrist former general Benny Gantz to the White House next week, saying he would unveil the plan before his Tuesday meeting with Netanyahu.
But Nabil Abu Rudeineh, spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said there had been no communication with the Trump administration, and that no peace deal could be implemented without ""the approval of the Palestinian people and the Palestinian leadership"".
""This is the only way if they are serious, if they are looking for stability in the whole region,"" Rudeinah said.
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 and Palestinians have called Trump's proposal dead in the water, even before its publication, citing what they see as his pro-Israel policies.
The Palestinians have boycotted political dealings with the Trump administration since it reversed decades of U.S. policy on the conflict, splintering the international consensus.
It has refused to endorse the two-state solution - the longtime international peace formula that envisages a Palestinian state established in territory that Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war. 
The Trump administration also recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved its embassy there, and announced that Washington no longer views Israeli settlements on occupied West Bank land as ""inconsistent with international law"".
Palestinians and most of the international community see the settlements as illegal under the 1949 Geneva Conventions that bar populating land captured in war. Israel disputes this, citing historical, biblical and political connections to the land, as well as security needs.
Palestinians obtained limited self-rule in parts of the West Bank under mid-1990s interim peace accords. They now seek East Jerusalem as the capital of a future state comprising the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Israel withdrew from tiny Gaza in 2005.
Trump, speaking to reporters on his flight home from the World Economic Forum in Davos, acknowledged Palestinians might react negatively to his plan at first but that ""it's actually very positive for them"". 
""It's a great plan. It's a plan that really would work.""
By contrast Netanyahu immediately accepted Trump's invite.
""I think the president is seeking to give Israel the peace and security that it deserves,"" Netanyahu said on Thursday,
Gantz's office did not immediately confirm whether he accepted Trump’s invitation.
CLASHING PERSPECTIVES
The political aspects of Trump's peace initiative have been kept under wraps. Only the economic proposals have been unveiled, anchored by a $50 billion regional development plan - which Palestinians spurned as it did not address an end to Israeli occupation.
Israeli headlines on Friday referred to the ""Trump Summit"" and ""Trump Deal"". Nahum Barnea, a political analyst in Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper, expected ""an American green light"" for Israel to annex West Bank settlement blocs and the Jordan Valley, which forms the border with Jordan to the east.
Palestinian newspapers highlighted warnings that such moves would end peace chances and pitch the region into a ""new phase"".
In Tel Aviv, Israelis appeared generally supportive of their leaders going to Washington, even without Palestinians.
""We don't have to go back to the previous peace process that was signed over 25, 30 years ago,” said Yael Rozencwajg, 41, a tech executive from Tel Aviv. ""The situation has completely changed since then. Trump has started recognizing that."" 
In explaining the U.S. change of stance on settlements this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the new approach would actually advance peace with the Palestinians ""by (speaking) the truth when the facts lead to it"".
Palestinians challenged the U.S. and Israeli stances.
In al-Auja, a Jordan Valley village flanked by Israeli settlements, Salim Abu Kharbesh, 59, said: “We are the inhabitants of the land, and they have come to us in spite of us, and in violence. They own nothing in this land.""
In Gaza, now ruled by Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas which has fought several wars with Israel, Hamas spokesman Fawzi Barhoum said no U.S. plan could alter realities on the ground.
""Our people will not accept it, and will confront it with all their might,"" he said.

LIMA (Reuters) - Peruvians will head to the polls on Sunday to choose a new Congress that will be in place for just over a year, as the copper-rich South American nation seeks to overcome a political crisis that led to the closure of parliament.
The ballot represents a political showdown, with 22 parties vying for 130 seats in Congress, which was dissolved in September by President Martin Vizcarra amid a long-running standoff with lawmakers over anti-corruption reforms.
The shutdown of Congress, which garnered support from the armed forces, the police and voters, was deemed legal by Peru's top court on Jan. 14 in response to a lawsuit brought by the former Congress president.
Peru's electoral authorities organized new legislative elections for Jan. 26, a time frame proposed by Vizcarra.
Peruvians, who typically mistrust politicians and have seen four former presidents investigated for corruption, have so far been lackadaisical about the elections. Almost half of voters said they still do not know who they will vote for, according to the latest polls.
The polling has also not clearly indicated which political party could nab the largest swath of seats in Sunday's elections, but pollsters said about seven parties will likely emerge with Congressional presence.
""Many decide who to vote for on the same day as the vote, but we will have a high percentage, perhaps historic, of people who will not vote or annul their vote,"" said Manuel Saavedra, managing director of local polling firm CPI.
The elections will also serve as a thermometer for political parties, which will measure their support with a view toward presidential and Congressional elections in April of 2021.
The fresh Congress will have to address outstanding issues, including the long-running battle over corruption and electoral and political reforms, at a time when the mining nation's economy recorded growth by 2.2% in 2019, far below expectations, analysts said.
The challenge for Vizcarra will be forging an improved relationship between the government and Congress, which would reduce tensions in a country racked by social conflicts, particularly in poorer and indigenous areas that fight against new mining and oil projects on their lands.
""The agenda that could guide this short legislative period is one of political reforms that were raised last year and that were based on the confrontation between the parliamentary majority and the government,"" said David Sulmont, a professor at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - If making headlines and drawing flak is a measure of success at Davos, then Greta Thunberg probably came out on top of this year's edition of the Alpine business-meets-politics gathering.
The 17-year-old climate activist has already attended the World Economic Forum twice. She and her team have shown themselves adept at shaping the debate, even managing to turn criticism from the U.S. treasury secretary to her advantage.
This year's program was weighted toward discussion of the climate crisis, partly reflecting Thunberg's rising global influence as well as the deepening concerns of big business.
As the summit wrapped up on Friday, Thunberg lead a protest with young people in the center of Davos, flagging her message to the end, after most world leaders had left.
With European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen focusing her address on the EU's 'Green Deal' - a plan to make Europe carbon-neutral by 2050 - and Britain's Prince Charles adding his voice to calls for urgent action, combating global warming was kept at the top of the agenda.
U.S. President Donald Trump used his headline speech on Tuesday to criticize ""prophets of doom"" over climate fears, but his views were largely drowned out by the end of the week.
There were even signs of Trump shifting in his attitude toward the Swedish teenager, who was joined in the ski resort by a dozen other young activists from as far afield as Bali, Zambia and Puerto Rico, including 13-year-old American anti-gun campaigner Naomi Wadler.
Whereas in the past Trump has told Thunberg she needs ""anger management"", when he left Davos on Wednesday he told reporters he ""would have loved"" to hear her speak. Asked if he thought climate change was still a hoax he replied, ""No, not at all"". 
TRUMP GREENING?
In a further sign the U.S. president may want to keep his mind open on climate issues in an election year, business leaders who met him for breakfast directly addressed the topic.
When asked if he had been responsible for convincing Trump to sign up to an initiative to plant one trillion trees, Salesforce chief executive Marc Benioff acknowledged a key role.
""It's fair. More than fair. But I just don't want to be the one taking credit,"" he told Reuters on Friday.
The CEO of Siemens said he had told Trump he needed to start listening to young activists.
Meanwhile, both Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and the European Commission's climate chief, Frans Timmermans, said they detected hints that the Trump administration was coming round on the climate, in part because of concerns raised by business and shifting voter attitudes.
""A sensible politician looking for reelection would, of course, look with a lot of interest at these types of (climate-oriented) policies,"" Rutte told Reuters. 
""In my experience with Donald Trump he is a very practical politician -- he wants to do good stuff for his country.""
The strongest criticism of Thunberg, in fact, came not from Trump but from his treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin.
Asked about Thunberg's previous calls to divest from fossil fuels, Mnuchin told a news briefing: ""Is she the chief economist? I'm confused ... After she goes and studies economics in college, she can come back and explain that to us.""
But the remark quickly backfired as Thunberg responded on Twitter, saying it did not take a degree to know the world was not meeting its climate goals.

""So either you tell us how to achieve this mitigation or explain to future generations and those already affected by the climate emergency why we should abandon our climate commitments,"" she wrote, a riposte that quickly gained more attention than Mnuchin's criticism.

""We need to put a stop to this perverse man,"" Sonia Guajajara, leader of the Association of Indigenous Peoples (APIB), wrote on Twitter. ""APIB will go to court against Jair Bolsonaro for the crime of racism.""
Racism is considered a serious crime in Brazil and can carry a sentence of up to five years.
The controversial comments, the latest in a series of presidential outbursts on Brazil's tribes, came in a video posted on social media on Thursday.
""The Indian has changed, he is evolving and becoming more and more, a human being like us,"" Bolsonaro said. ""What we want is to integrate him into society so he can own his land.""
The presidency did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the potential lawsuit.
Bolsonaro has previously said indigenous reserves are too large and his government wants to allow commercial mining and agriculture on these reservations.
He has said they live in poverty like ""animals in zoos"" and wants to assimilate them into Brazilian society and economy. Tribal leaders decry this as planned ethnocide aimed at eliminating their cultures.
A former army captain who was a congressman for 28 years before becoming president, Bolsonaro has a history of making racist, misogynist and homophobic statements.
He once said on the floor of the lower house that Brazil should have followed Colonel George Armstrong Custer's example in dealing ""efficiently"" with indigenous peoples in the United States.
Brazil has some 850,000 indigenous people, most of whom live on reservations that account for 12% of the national territory in Latin America's largest country.
Bolsonaro has said he will not approve ""a single centimeter"" more of indigenous land claims and has suggested that some of the larger reservations could have their boundaries reviewed.
Environmentalists warn that these moves to assimilate indigenous peoples could speed up deforestation in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) where the reservations are considered effective means of preserving the forest.
Indigenous leaders meeting in the Xingu reservation last week issued a rallying call to protect the Amazon rainforest and its indigenous people from the ""genocide, ethnocide and ecocide"" they accuse Bolsonaro of planning."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence quipped that Pope Francis had made him ""a hero"" during an unusually long audience with the pontiff on Friday at the Vatican.
Pence, a former altar boy who had a strict Irish Catholic upbringing but later converted to evangelical Protestantism, appeared to be referring to the fact that the rest of his family had stayed in the Roman Catholic Church and that his departure from the faith had put some strain on family relations.
Pence's talks with Francis in the papal library lasted about an hour, twice as long as the meeting between the pope and President Donald Trump in the same frescoed room in May, 2017.
""I want to extend the warmest greetings on behalf of President Donald Trump, who so enjoyed his visit here,"" Pence told Francis before reporters and photographers were ushered out of the room.

During an exchange of gifts after the private talks, Francis gave Pence a small white box with a medal inside.
""I didn't want to ask,"" Pence said with a laugh as the pope handed him the box. ""This is for mom.""
As he was leaving the papal library, Pence, still clutching the small white box, said: ""Thank you, Your Holiness, you have made me a hero ... God bless you.""
Francis gave Pence some of his recent writings, including his World Day of Peace message for this year. 
Pence flew to Italy from Israel, where he had attended events commemorating the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.

He was due to meet Italian President Sergio Mattarella and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte before leaving Italy.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - A short walk from where she spent the week rubbing shoulders with world leaders, Greta Thunberg showed solidarity with the climate strikers of Davos on the last day of the World Economic Forum (WEF).
Davos high school students with signs reading ""wake up WEF"" and ""stop (f)lying to us"" chanted in the hope that they would be loud enough for the business leaders and politicians to listen.
""We want to show the people from WEF who want to make money that even though we're young, we still care about the issues. We want to show them its not only about making money,"" 17-year-old Miriam Alther told Reuters.
At a protest of around 50 people, Miriam said at least 20 were from her school. All had skipped classes for the day.
""We wanted to take action because it's a real problem,"" 17-year-old Anna Stricker said.
A silent Thunberg did not even join in the songs, letting the worldwide movement she began speak for itself.
Alongside the teens were parents with small children and activists who had trekked from all parts of the world to join Thunberg. Vanessa Nakate, a teen activist from Uganda, marched alongside her to the protest following a WEF panel.
""There's someone from Brazil, someone from China, someone from UK, we have someone from Greenland,"" Nakate said.
""We've left our comfort zones to show you that it is time for all of you to leave your comfort zones because it's the uncomfortable things that we do that will be able to save the planet,"" Nakate said during the panel.
She has been camping in the cold each night as attendees return to their hotels and apartments."

TANAUAN (Reuters) - Ash from a rumbling Philippine volcano has inspired an artist and instructor to paint watercolors using the grey powder that had covered the plants in her backyard.
Janina Sanico, who lives in a town near the Taal volcano, collected the ash, mixed it with water and binder, and started painting images, some of them depicting the devastation caused by the small but dangerous volcano.
""So that was the pain that I felt. So when I saw the animals, that's where I got my inspiration for my paintings"", said the 24-year old Sanico.
More than 140,000 people have been evacuated after Taal, one of the Philippines’ most active volcanoes, erupted more than a week ago, blanketing homes, schools and farms with ash.
Sanico, a promoter of natural pigment water colors, said she has been selling her paintings and donating the profits to help thousands of people who had been displaced.    
""Since this ash came from the earth, I experimented and I studied. Then when I posted my artwork on social media, I found that it was widely received by people,"" said Sanico.
Sanico has used different mediums such as coffee for painting, but ash, she said surprisingly worked well enough as long as it had enough water.
Volcanologists have kept the danger level of Taal at 4 out of a possible 5, meaning that a “hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days”.
Just 311 meters (1,020 feet) high, Taal is one of the world’s smallest active volcanoes. It killed more than 1,300 people in an eruption in 1911."

Under a 1998 peace deal that settled 30 years of sectarian violence in British-run Northern Ireland, Britain's minister for the region can call a referendum if it appears likely that a majority of those voting would seek to form a united Ireland.
The Good Friday Agreement mostly ended three decades of violence between predominantly Catholic nationalists seeking union with Ireland and mainly Protestant unionists who want Northern Ireland to remain part of the United Kingdom. Some 3,600 people died.
While a withdrawal from the United Kingdom remains a distant prospect according to opinion polls, Britain's exit from the EU has increased calls for a unity poll after Northern Ireland voted 56% to 44% to remain in Europe in the 2016 Brexit referendum.
A referendum would also be required in the Irish Republic.
Both Fianna Fail and the governing Fine Gael, the two clear favorites to lead the next government, have said they would ultimately like to see the unification of the island, which was partitioned almost a century ago, but that now is not the time.
Sinn Fein, the third largest party in Ireland and the only party with lawmakers in Northern Ireland, where it is part of a power-sharing government, is pushing for a unity poll by 2025 and for preparations to be stepped up significantly in advance.
In its election manifesto, Fianna Fail said it would set up a unit in the prime minister's office to lead a formal study and cross-community consultation that would set out how an Irish government should approach the handling of a future referendum.
Without mentioning Sinn Fein, it said Northern Ireland's future constitutional status could not be allowed to become a party-dominated issue, exploited for short-term reasons, and that the focus must be on a neutral and factual discussion of the impact of ""various approaches"" to Northern Ireland's future."
328,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 24, 2020 07:59AM ET</span>",Norway PM shakes up Cabinet after right-wing party exit,"OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg on Friday announced the biggest shake-up of her Cabinet since she took office in 2013, replacing or repositioning two-thirds of ministers in the hope of reviving the Conservative-led coalition's prospects.
Solberg lost her majority in parliament this week following the shock exit from government by the right-wing Progress Party over a decision to bring a woman suspected of Islamic State affiliation home to Norway from Syria.
While Progress has said it will still back Solberg as prime minister, opinion polls point to an overwhelming lead for center-left opposition parties ahead of a general election in 2021.
Solberg said the government would seek to cut the country's carbon emissions, boost security and help modernize the economy.
But working with a minority could make day-to-day management more complex, she told a news conference, adding ""deliberations in parliament will no longer have a foregone conclusion"".
The overall size of the Cabinet was cut by two jobs, and there will be a newcomer in 13 out of the 20 posts, either from inside or outside the current government lineup, including those of finance, oil and energy, justice and transport.
Veteran Conservative Party lawmaker Jan Tore Sanner is moving from the education ministry to become finance minister, in charge of fiscal policy and of overseeing the world's largest sovereign wealth fund with $1.1 trillion in assets.
Tina Bru, 33, a rising star among the Conservatives, will take charge of the oil and energy portfolio, charting the course for western Europe's largest petroleum industry at a time of rising concern over climate change.
Bru said last November that Norwegian oil firms should speed up their work to replace gas turbines that power many offshore installations, replacing them with power from renewable sources.
Norwegian oil and gas platforms should thus stop emitting carbon dioxide, preferably by 2035, which could cut Norway's overall emissions by a third, Bru told public broadcaster NRK at the time.
Emission cuts from platforms operated by Equinor and others cover only the carbon dioxide related to operations however, and not those that stem from the consumption of oil and gas when used by customers.
SURPRISE DEPARTURE
Analysts had expected Solberg to shake up her government later this year, but the sudden departure of Progress, including the party's leader, Finance Minister Siv Jensen, led to the moves being brought forward.
Jensen's exit followed Solberg's decision, announced last week, to help a Norwegian woman and her two children return from Syria so that one of the children could receive medical treatment.
Progress had offered to help the children but opposed any assistance for the mother. 
Decisions on whether to help women with ties to Islamic State return from Syria has caused controversy in Europe, including in Finland where the recently appointed government settled on a compromise to decide each case individually.

The woman, who has not been named, has denied being affiliated with the Islamist group, her lawyer has said. She remains in police custody at an Oslo hospital, and could eventually be separated from her children and transferred to prison while awaiting trial, police have said.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - With dim sum, cocktails and gold chocolate coins, Hong Kong wrapped up its Davos charm offensive confident the financial hub is back on track, even as officials fly home to tackle a deadly flu-like virus.
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam arrives back to Hong Kong on Saturday, the first day of the Year of the Rat, to face with what could be a perfect storm - an outbreak of coronavirus, lingering protests and an economic downturn.
Wearing a dress and pink jacket, Lam appeared unfazed as she mingled with some of the 200 business and political leaders on the Hong Kong Night of her trip, which her deputy Matthew Cheung described as a ""very important diplomatic visit"".
Flanked by her commerce secretary Edward Yau, Lam listened as HKEX chairwoman Laura Cha reinforced a message that ""Team HK"" delivered to A-list global investors, corporate and political leaders at the World Economic Forum this week.
""Last year we had experienced one of the global, big black swans that captured world attention,"" Cha said, referring to anti-government protests that plunged the Chinese-ruled city into its biggest crisis in decades.
""Every time we came out of a crisis ... we became stronger. We are resilient and we will come out of the current one as well,"" she said. ""Our message tonight is clear. Hong Kong is open for business.""
Cha's message was echoed by Hong Kong officials including commerce secretary Yau, HKEX chief executive Charles Li and Beijing-backed Lam, whose approval rate is around 14%, the lowest of any post-colonial Hong Kong leader.
As the delegation spoke in a conference room decorated with red lanterns at the Ameron Hotel in the Swiss mountain resort, officials in Hong Kong were scrambling to contain the spread of a coronavirus that threatens to inflict even more pain.
There are two confirmed cases of the virus in Hong Kong, where events have been canceled and authorities are considering extending school holidays to contain the infection, which has killed 26 people in mainland China.
The rapid spread of coronavirus has rattled global markets and prompted travel warnings, with authorities concerned it could spread rapidly as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel to be with relatives over the Lunar New Year.
Some social media posts slammed Lam for going to Davos amid the health crisis, with one reading: ""Clearly going to Davos to promote herself is more important than staying in Hong Kong to fight #WuhanCoronavirus.""
The protesters are now also calling for a ban on all mainland Chinese travelers into Hong Kong.
Lam acknowledged in Davos that the rapid flow of people across the border with mainland China made Hong Kong vulnerable, although the government has not yet implemented controls.
She said on Thursday in Davos that Hong Kong had learned valuable lessons from an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 300 people in the former British colony in 2003.
""I am cautiously confident that the system we have built up over these years and well tested over these years, will take us out of this current problem,"" Lam said.
In Hong Kong, the Hospital Authority Employees Alliance said incompetent handling by the government was responsible for the confirmed cases in the city and slammed authorities for not implementing border controls."

LONDON (Reuters) - British police are to start operational use of live facial recognition (LFR) cameras in London, despite warnings over privacy from rights groups and concerns expressed by the government's own surveillance watchdog.
First used in the capital at the Notting Hill carnival in 2016, the cameras will alert police when they spot anyone on ""wanted"" lists.
""The use of live facial recognition technology will be intelligence-led and deployed to specific locations in London,"" the city's Metropolitan Police said in a statement on Friday.
""This is an important development for the Met and one which is vital in assisting us in bearing down on violence.""
The cameras will be clearly signposted and officers will hand out leaflets about what is happening.
Facial recognition cameras have been deployed in other British cities and shopping centers but their use has prompted privacy concerns and opponents have questioned the accuracy of the technology.
Last year, a Cardiff man took South Wales Police to the High Court, arguing that his human rights had been breached by officers using automated facial recognition without his knowledge when he was shopping.
The court ruled that using the technology was lawful but civil rights group Liberty are appealing the decision.
Responding to the ruling last September, the government's Surveillance Camera Commissioner, Tony Porter, said that police should not see it as a ""green light"" for generic deployment of automated facial recognition.
""It is an intrusive tool with human rights and public confidence implications which have to be considered,"" Porter said.
The EU is considering banning the technology in public places for up to five years to give it time to work out how to prevent abuses.
Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Nick Ephgrave said in a statement: “We are using a tried-and-tested technology, and have taken a considered and transparent approach in order to arrive at this point.
“This is an important development for the Met and one which is vital in assisting us in bearing down on violence.""
He said police will begin operationally deploying LFR in places where intelligence suggests they are most likely to locate serious offenders."

Britain, France and Germany formally accused Iran on Jan. 14 of violating the terms of its 2015 agreement to curb its nuclear program, which eventually could lead to the reimposing of U.N. sanctions lifted under the deal.
""There is agreement that more time is needed due to the complexity of the issues involved. The timeline is therefore extended,"" Borrell said in a statement. Under the agreement between Iran and world powers, Borrell serves as guarantor. 
Borrell was notified earlier this month by Paris, London and Berlin that they had triggered the dispute mechanism, in theory starting a 15-day process to resolve issues with Iran.
There are some questions over when the 15-day period should start because Iran has not formally recognized the consultation process, officials have said.
China and Russia are also signatories to the deal signed in Vienna in 2015 and have publicly expressed misgivings about the Europeans' decision to trigger the mechanism. All sides say they want to save the deal, which U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from in May 2018, reimposing economic sanctions on Iran.
After months of gradual steps to reduce compliance, Iran said on Jan. 6 it would scrap limits on enriching uranium.

Borrell said the joint commission that regulates the Iran nuclear deal will meet in February. He did not give a date.

The trash-strewn pools are perfect breeding grounds for the mosquito that spreads dengue fever, which aid workers say is killing people every day near the frontlines in Hodeidah.
War has complicated efforts to fight the world's fastest-spreading mosquito-borne virus, wrecked Yemen's health system and public sanitation, and made an impoverished and displaced population more vulnerable to the disease.
In a crowded children's hospital, flies crawled over the eyes and mouths of children struggling to breathe under the pain caused by the virus. Walid Yahya Mansour sat with two family members; two others had stayed home, too sick to travel.
""Dengue has been spreading fast,"" he said.
The World Health Organization (WHO) says the number of reported cases of dengue fever worldwide has increased six-fold from 2010-2016. It describes the disease as one of the top 10 global public health threats.
Dengue causes fever, headache, vomiting and pain in the muscles and joints. A severe form can result in internal bleeding. There is no specific treatment and no widely available vaccine yet, although one is being trialled.
Hodeidah, which has an active frontline on its eastern edge where the United Nations is trying to enforce a ceasefire and troop withdrawal, is reporting the highest number of suspected dengue cases and deaths, an International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) report said.
The WHO said 76,768 suspected cases, including 271 deaths, were recorded last year across Yemen, although numbers started to fall in recent weeks.
""The dengue cases began in mid-November,"" said Ahmad Mu'ajam, a doctor at Thawra hospital in Hodeidah. ""With time, there were fewer cases in the countryside areas, but they increased inside the city.""
Authorities in the parts of Hodeidah city controlled by the Iran-aligned Houthi group have been filling in pools of stagnant water to remove mosquito breeding grounds, said Abdrahman Jarallah, the head of Hodeidah's health department.
But frontline areas are hard to access, and most cases in Hodeidah are coming from those areas, the WHO said. Communities there, who collect rainwater for drinking in open basins, are being advised on how to reduce mosquito breeding grounds themselves.
""We are getting reports of deaths on a daily basis in remote areas of (Hodeidah),"" aid organization Save The Children said last week about dengue.
Yemen's conflict began in 2015 when a Saudi-led military coalition intervened to try to restore the internationally recognized government after it was ousted from power in the capital Sanaa by the Houthi movement.
The war has killed thousands, pushed millions to the brink of famine and also caused major cholera outbreaks."

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly ruled out an extension, which could by law last one or two more years from the end of 2020 but must be agreed by Britain and the remaining 27 EU states before the start of July.
""We can assume at this point that the transition period will end on December 31, 2020,"" the person said under condition of anonymity.
However, the EU official added that any prolongation of the time, which is meant to negotiate a new deal between Britain and the EU on everything from trade to security, would mean London having to keep paying into the EU coffers.
The official said any agreement to extend the transition period ""presupposes an agreement on continued financial participation and contribution from the UK to the EU."""

LAGOS (Reuters) - The men in naval uniforms charged into the Nigerian waterfront village of Okun Glass in the morning, chased out the residents, then called in the bulldozers.
De facto village leader, 75-year-old Dauda Musa, said he fled as the men fired guns into the air. ""They demolished our homes,"" he said, standing in the rubble of what was once home to 3,000 people down the coast from the megacity Lagos.
Nigeria's navy said it had moved in to clear an illegal settlement - and accused some of the residents of vandalizing nearby pipelines to steal crude. ""This operation was not conducted in secrecy,"" naval commander Thomas Otuji said.
Musa said his fellow villagers were farmers and fishermen, not thieves. And rights groups say the raid on Jan. 3 was part of a much wider trend where the government, backed by the military, clears informal settlements to make way for luxury housing and other developments.
The accusations and counter-accusations highlight an increasingly fraught confrontation between officials, activists and small communities, exacerbated by the dramatic expansion of Nigeria's cities, most of all Lagos - a coastal giant that dwarfs the capital Abuja inland.
""There has been persistent evictions across Lagos. Dozens of communities on the island have been evicted,"" Akinrolabu Samuel, a campaigner with the Nigeria Slum/Informal Settlement Federation, said at a rally against the evictions this week.
""It's because of real estate,"" he added. ""It's for real estate development.""
HOUSING CRISIS
Around 600,000 new people arrive in Lagos every year, according to the stats group BudgIT, many of them pouring into ramshackle settlements, joining thousands of others impoverished families who have lived their for generations.
The United Nations said in September Nigeria was struggling to deal with a mounting housing crisis - and mass evictions were making the situation worse.
In 2017, a coalition of communities won a court judgment against Lagos state government, arguing that evictions without notice and resettlement were cruel, inhumane and degrading.
The government appealed, and the case was this week adjourned to June 2021.
The Nigerian government has regularly defended the evictions and demolitions, saying the have targeted settlements that are homes to criminal gangs, making them a security threat.
The ""administration is law-abiding ... But that does not mean it will allow indiscriminate erection of shanties on the right of way for roads and other projects,"" said Gbenga Omotoso, commissioner for information and strategy for Lagos state government.
In this case, he said, the state government had not ordered the demolition of Okun Glass. ""It may have been a security matter on which the Navy can speak,"" Omotoso added.
Back on the coast, villagers picked through broken wood and crushed concrete, looking for anything salvageable underneath the coconut and mango trees that they said they had harvested for decades.
""They chased us into the lagoon with our wives and children,"" said Dauda Musa. ""We are left with nothing."""

The system inherited from the Soviet era in effect barred those living in the provinces from seeking jobs in Tashkent, with the result that many people have chosen to find employment abroad instead.
""We have kept our people shackled for 30 years, it's true,"" Mirziyoyev said in his annual address to parliament.
Tashkent, which is undergoing a construction boom and offers higher wages compared with the provinces, has a population of 2.5 million, and more than 30 million Uzbeks live elsewhere in the Central Asian country.
Unemployment is one of the biggest concerns for Mirziyoyev's government which has been implementing a series of economic reforms over the last three years that have increased demand for labor in the capital.
In another move aimed at reducing unemployment, Uzbekistan plans to train a million people in software programming skills, Mirziyoyev said on Friday."

""Economic politics will surely change toward a social policy that returns hope for the unemployed youth and for improving public services,"" he said at a news conference.
""The result of the presidential election was a strong message in favor of big change,"" he said, indicating he would only seek to bring into his government parties ""aligned to the values of the revolution"".
However, he said he would keep up with economic reforms that the country has been carrying out for years aimed at tackling big deficits and a growing public debt burden.
President Kais Saied designated Fakhfakh as the next prime minister on Monday, giving him a month to form a government that can win majority backing in the deeply fragmented parliament.
His attempt to form a government follows an unsuccessful bid by Habib Jemli, whose proposed coalition lost a confidence vote on Jan. 10. If Fakhfakh is also unsuccessful there will be another parliamentary election.
The young democracy, which threw off autocratic rule in a 2011 uprising, held two separate elections for parliament and president in September and October.
The votes took place against a backdrop of economic troubles that have undermined public trust in politics with years of high unemployment and declining services as the government attempted to control the debt by reining in spending.
Saied, an independent, won the presidency with a modest campaign that emphasized his belief in the principles of the revolution and that compared his personal integrity to the widespread perception of corruption in the political class.
The failure of Jemli, who was nominated by the biggest party in parliament, to push through his proposed government meant Saied had the right to nominate Fakhfakh, a former finance and tourism minister."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Andrew Funk has been shivering through the nights in a tent pitched in the snow of Davos this week as political and business leaders returned to their cozy hotels and apartments nestled in the swank Swiss ski resort.
Funk, who heads Spanish charity Homeless Entrepreneur, has spent his days trawling the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) hoping to make contacts and highlight the plight of people without places to live around the world.
""We're sleeping out in Davos because we believe that there are decision-makers here that need to, instead of think differently, they need to act differently to end homelessness,"" he told Reuters.
Sitting in his tent, Funk said night-time temperatures since his arrival in Davos had dipped to -17 Celsius (1.4 Fahrenheit) but that the chance to lobby delegates was worth it.
Born in the United States and now living in Barcelona, Funk says he was homeless for a time, hopping from sofa to sofa.
He made his first visit to Davos two years ago, turning up with nowhere to stay and no clue how harsh the conditions would be. He and two friends now sleep in a teepee which in the daytime serves as a shelter for children when they're skiing.
The conditions are harsh, with a freezing draught, and passing noises which make sleep near impossible.
""Sleep is not the right word. We rest every once in a while... You see car lights going by and you don't really know what to expect. That level of insecurity, of the unknown, exists. This happens to homeless people all the time,"" he said.
His charity focuses on the skills of homeless people to get them back on their feet through a mentoring program where they are advised by volunteers on issues from housing to health.

The aim in coming to Davos is to meet delegates and raise funds, but also to get people talking about homelessness, he said.

British authorities are seeking Eamonn Harrison, 23, on charges of human trafficking and immigration offences, as well as the 39 offences of manslaughter in a case that has shone a light on the illicit human smuggling trade.
Judge Donald Binchy deferred ordering Harrison's handover to Britain until Feb. 4. Binchy said the lengthy judgment would not be available until early next week and granted a request from Harrison's lawyer for more time to consider it. 
The discovery of the bodies in the back of a refrigerated truck after being smuggled into Britain highlighted how poor citizens of Asia, Africa and the Middle East pay large sums of cash to middlemen for perilous, illicit journeys to the West.
The UK authorities, citing mobile phone analysis, cell tower data, and CCTV footage, allege that Harrison delivered the trailer in which the people were found to a Belgian port before its onward journey to Britain, a lawyer for the Irish state said last month.
Harrison had challenged the extradition order. His lawyer argued that a lack of information in the warrant about the place of death and how Harrison was involved made it ""fundamentally defective"".
Police in Vietnam arrested 10 people last year in connection with the deaths. The British driver of the truck has admitted plotting to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property.

Another man from Northern Ireland has been charged with conspiring to arrange the travel of people with a view to their exploitation, and conspiracy to break immigration laws. Two other men from the British-run region are also wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking.

Carlo Bertazzo's predecessor was heavily criticized by politicians for a delay in apologizing for the death of 43 people and also took a more confrontational approach to Rome's threat to strip Atlantia of its highway concession.
""First of all, we apologize to the families of the victims and to all Italians,"" Bertazzo told La Stampa newspaper in his first interview since taking over at Atlantia, which is 30% owned by the Benetton family.
Following the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa, operated by Atlantia's Autostrade per l'Italia unit, Rome has threatened to remove the group's motorway concession, which generates about a third of Atlantia's core earnings.
The company has previously warned the government it would legally challenge any revocation and Bertazzo reiterated that without the concession, Autostrade would likely go bankrupt.
However, he signaled an openness to negotiate.
""We give concrete availability to the government to find a balanced solution in the general interest,"" he said.
Sources told Reuters last week Atlantia would be prepared to discuss reducing road tolls and revising the terms of the contract of its concession, which expires in 2038.
Bertazzo, who has worked for 25 years as top executive in the Benetton family holding company Edizione, also said the group did not exclude selling even a majority stake in some of its units, which, besides Autostrade, include airport operator Aeroporti di Roma and motorway electronic payment unit Telepass.
""Nothing is taboo, it depends on the quality of the partners and on the possibility of creating greater value with them"", he said.
Last week Gianni Mion, another manager close to the Benetton family, said Atlantia was open to talks about an investment in its businesses by state-backed infrastructure fund F2i.
On Friday, Italian daily Il Sole 24 Ore said the idea of spinning off Autostrade had re-emerged, adding it was an option that appealed to politicians and investors.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - A trickle of passengers at the train station in the Chinese city of Wuhan put on a brave face on Friday as they arrived in the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed 26 people, infected hundreds and raised fears of a pandemic.
Authorities have all but shut down Wuhan, a city of 11 million and a major transport hub, at what is normally the busiest time of year - the Lunar New Year holiday - when millions of people travel home to visit their families.
Millions of people in surrounding cities are virtually stranded after public transport networks were shut to stop the spread of the virus, believed to have originated at a Wuhan market illegally selling wildlife.
On one high-speed train carrying a Reuters journalist that stopped in Wuhan station on Friday afternoon, about 10 passengers got off and nobody got on before the train resumed its journey to Changsha.
Although it stopped there, Wuhan had been removed from the train's schedule.
""What choice do I have? It's Chinese New Year. We have to see our family,"" said a man getting off the train who gave his family name Hu.
Wuhan's airport is not closed, but nearly all flights have been canceled. Three international flights arriving on Friday would leave with no passengers, an airport official said.
China's biggest ride-hailing company, Didi Chuxing, shut down all services in Wuhan from midday on Friday, adding that service resumption depended on government orders.
""Please reduce going out as much as possible, and look after yourselves and your families,"" the company told its drivers in a statement.
A traffic control map on Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) maps - China's equivalent of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) maps - showed a swathe of highways into and around the city closed. Police at one highway checkpoint said special permission would be needed to leave the city.
Police also checked incoming vehicles for wild animals.
FACE MASKS, CANCELED PLANS
Lying on the banks of the mighty Yangtze River and historically prone to devastating floods, Wuhan stretches across 8,500 square kilometers (3,300 square miles) - five times the size of Greater London - and includes rural areas as well as the sprawling urban conurbation.
Some images circulated on social media showed packed hospital corridors, as people - all wearing face masks - waited for consultations. Hospitals made public appeals for supplies.
The government has pledged to ensure the city is properly equipped, and on Friday flew in two planes with 32 tonnes of supplies, mostly medical gear and masks.
China's second-largest e-commerce firm, JD.com Inc, said it was donating one million medical masks and other supplies like disinfectant.
""My family has hoarded much food, and when we need something, we go downstairs to a supermarket nearby with masks on,"" a 30-year-old city resident who works in financial services told Reuters via social media, declining to provide her name.
Authorities have warned against price-gouging.
Zou Tianjing, 30, an alcoholic drinks distributor, said she was resigned to spending the Lunar New Year at home, reading and watching movies.
""A lot of people did not realize how serious the situation was. Just the day before, people were wearing masks but would still go to bars,"" she said, speaking on Thursday.
Hugo Guo, a 22-year-old university student who had returned home to Wuhan for the holiday, said the restrictions were not having much of an impact on him, although all his dinner plans with friends and family had been canceled.
""I'm most worried about whether I will be able to return to school at the right time,"" he said, referring to the start of term next month at his university in Shanghai.
One foreign resident, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the transport lockdown was causing problems though he was able to get around, albeit slowly.
""I can go anywhere I want to go. I just can't leave Wuhan."""

ZOMBA, Malawi (Reuters) - Malawi's Rastafarians are cheering a court ruling that will allow their children to go to school with dreadlocks.
Rastafarianism was upheld as a religion and banning dreadlocks - a Rasta religious symbol - is now unconstitutional.
The ruling was a vindication for Ali Mcroy Nansolo, who lives beneath a mountain peak called the ""Emperor's View"" in honor of a visit by former Ethiopian ruler Haile Selassie.
Like other Rastafarians, Nansolo believes Selassie was a prophet descended from the biblical King Solomon, sent by God to liberate black Africans from colonialism.
But until last week, Malawi's couple of thousand Rastas were still awaiting liberation from a peculiar legacy of it: a ban on dreadlocks in Malawi's British-modeled state school system.
That came when the High Court ruled on Jan. 14.
""Our constitution is clear, it gives everyone the right to education ... without discrimination,"" said Nansolo, sitting beneath a portrait of the emperor.
For more than a decade the 45-year-old father of five had campaigned, written letters to school teachers, lobbied the education minister and organized protests.
He traveled to the capital Lilongwe to meet ministry officials, who told him they could do nothing.
""They used to say: 'you Rasta children, go back. No class for you until you cut back the dread,"" recalled his son Ishmael, now 18.
Nansolo, a dress maker and part time actor, found lawyers to fight the case. A court ruled in their favor in 2017, allowing Ishmael to go to school - albeit very late. Emboldened, Nansolo sought a more general ruling for all children of Jah, as Rastafarians call God.
The movement's blend of Old Testament prophecy and pan-African nationalism has its roots in the Caribbean diaspora, but its dreadlocked adherents can be spotted across the continent from Zanzibar to Senegal.
Nansolo joined in the 1980s, converting from Islam after being inspired by the reggae music he loved.
Despite Rastafarianism's enthusiasm for Africa, it has not always been treated kindly by African governments. Rastas have faced persecution, even in their revered Ethiopia, and their use of marijuana used as a pretext to lock them up.
In Malawi's main city Blantyre, Ras Wisdom Mbewe's daughter, Makeda, now eight, was banned from school when her hair began to matt at the age of five. This week she re-starts school.
""After a lengthy discussion, she has been cleared to resume classes,"" her beaming father told Reuters."

YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar has put in place measures to protect Rohingya Muslims, a spokesman for the ruling party said on Friday, shrugging off an order from the International Court of Justice a day earlier to stop genocidal acts against the ethnic minority.
The Hague-based court ordered Myanmar to protect the persecuted Rohingya against further atrocities and preserve evidence of alleged crimes, after mostly Muslim Gambia launched a lawsuit in November accusing Myanmar of genocide.
""The government is already doing most of the orders,"" Myo Nyunt, a spokesman for the ruling National League for Democracy, told Reuters by phone, without elaborating.
""One more thing we need to do is submit reports,"" he said, referring to one of several measures approved by the court requiring Myanmar to write regular summaries of its progress.
But he said the civilian government, who rule jointly with the military in an awkward constitutional arrangement that reserves great powers for the commander-in-chief, could not control troops.
""Under the current political circumstances, we have difficulties solving some issues - such as the (order) that the government must ensure its military or armed insurgents do not commit genocide or attempt to commit genocide against Rohingya or Bengali,"" he said.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled western Rakhine state for neighboring Bangladesh in 2017 to escape a military-led crackdown that the U.N has said was executed with genocidal intent. Myanmar says the military campaign was a legitimate counter-insurgency operation launched in response to militant attacks on security forces.
Some 600,000 Rohingya remain inside Myanmar, confined in apartheid-like conditions to camps and villages, unable to freely access healthcare and education.
They are derided as ""Bengalis"", implying they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, despite tracing their history in Rakhine back centuries.
The court said in its judgment on Thursday it did not accept Myanmar’s assertion that it has been taking steps to facilitate the return of refugees, promote peace in Rakhine, and hold the military accountable through domestic mechanisms.
""In particular, the Court notes that Myanmar has not presented to the Court concrete measures aimed specifically at recognizing and ensuring the right of the Rohingya to exist as a protected group under the Genocide Convention,"" it said.
""THERE WAS NO GENOCIDE""
While Thursday's ruling was an emotional victory for the minority, who have for decades fought to prove their existence as an ethnic group, legal analysts said it will be difficult to force Myanmar to comply.
In a statement late Thursday, the ministry of foreign affairs said it had noted the ruling but did not mention specific steps it was taking. The next morning the front page of state-run newspaper the Global New Light of Myanmar read: ""Myanmar takes note of ICJ decision. There was no genocide in Rakhine"".
While the measures are legally binding, there is no enforcement mechanism.
In separate statements on Friday, Britain and Malaysia urged Myanmar to fully implement the measures. U.N. human rights spokeswoman Liz Throssell told a U.N. briefing in Geneva the office ""calls on Myanmar to immediately and unconditionally implement them in full"".
""We know that there are limitations but it’s very important for the Rohingya community in Bangladesh and in Myanmar to know that the world has heard them, the highest court in the land has made this decision,"" said human rights lawyer Antonia Mulvey.
Kobsak Chutikul, a Thai diplomat who in 2018 quit a government-appointed panel set up to probe the alleged atrocities, said he feared the government would ""delay and obfuscate"" once the spotlight faded.
Of dozens of people interviewed by Reuters in Yangon, Myanmar's commercial capital, only two were aware of the judgment, and neither of them paid much heed.
""I already knew that Myanmar would lose this case since the other side is funded by the Islamic countries,"" said a civil servant, who also asked not to be named."

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Thousands of Iraqis rallied at two central Baghdad intersections on Friday after a prominent cleric called for a ""million strong"" protest against the American military presence, following the U.S. killing of an Iranian general and an Iraqi militia chief.
The initial march appeared not to gather further steam, however, largely dissipating after several hours. Some protesters headed to join separate anti-government demonstrators at Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), and others boarded buses to go home.
The march called by Moqtada al-Sadr aimed to press for a pullout of U.S. troops. Many anti-government protesters feared it could overshadow their separate, months-long demonstrations that have challenged Iran-backed Shi'ite groups' grip on power.
Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, later called in his weekly sermon for political groups to form a new government as soon as possible to bring stability to the country and enact reforms to improve Iraqis' lives.
Sadr, who commands a following of millions in vast Baghdad slums, opposes all foreign interference in Iraq but has recently aligned himself more closely with Iran, whose allies have dominated state institutions since a 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
Sadr supported anti-government protests when they began in October, but did not publicly urge his followers to join them. 
The demonstrations have since taken aim at all groups and figures that are part of the post-2003 system including Sadr, who although often considered an outsider is part of that system, commanding one of the two largest blocs in parliament.
Some lawmakers and protesters say the new, anti-U.S. element to public unrest distracts from the aim of toppling the corrupt political elite and could fuel more violence.
Throngs of marchers started gathering early on Friday at al-Hurriya Square in central Baghdad and near around the city's main university, Reuters witnesses said. Marchers avoided Tahrir square, symbol of mass protests against Iraq' ruling elites.
""We want them all out - America, Israel, and the corrupt politicians in government,"" said Raed Abu Zahra, a health ministry worker from southern city of Samawa, who arrived by bus at night and stayed in Sadr City, a sprawling district of Baghdad controlled by the cleric's followers.
""We support the protests in Tahrir as well, but understand why Sadr held this protest here so it doesn't take attention from theirs,"" he added.
Men and women marched waving the red, white and black national colors, and chanted slogans against the United States, which leads a military coalition against the Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.
""DO NOT CROSS THIS BARRIER""
Some were wearing symbolic white robes indicating they're willing to die for their country while others sat looking out over the square from half finished buildings, holding signs reading ""No, no, America, no, no, Israel, no, no, colonialists"".
Marchers were protected by Sadr's Saraya al-Salam brigades and Iraq's Popular Mobilization Forces, an umbrella grouping of Iran-backed Shi'ite militias, witnesses said.
The march looked unlikely as initially feared to end up at the gates of the U.S. Embassy, the seat of U.S. power in Iraq and the scene of violent clashes last month when militia supporters tried to storm the compound.
Sistani, who condemned the killing of Iranian military mastermind General Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 3, repeated his opposition to foreign interference in Iraq.
""Iraq's sovereignty must be respected ... and citizens should have the right to peaceful protest,"" he said.
Sistani, who comments on politics only in times of crisis and wields great influence over Iraq's Shi'ite majority, urged reform and a new government as soon as possible.
Under the government of caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who said he would quit in November, security forces and unidentified gunmen believed to be linked to powerful Iran-backed militias killed nearly 450 anti-establishment protesters.
Main roads in Baghdad were barricaded on Friday by security forces and the city's Green Zone, which houses foreign missions, were blocked off with concrete barriers. Outside the U.S. embassy, a sign read ""Warning. Do not cross this barrier, we will use pre-emptive measures against any attempt to cross"".
The killing of Soleimani has raised the specter of more civil strife in a country torn by years of sectarian conflict.

For the first time in nearly two years, parliament voted along sectarian lines to press the government to kick out U.S. forces. Shi'ite parties voted in favor, while Sunni Muslim and Kurdish lawmakers boycotted the session.

LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain on Friday scolded the United States for refusing to extradite a U.S. diplomat's wife who was involved in a car crash that killed a British teenager.
British prosecutors had requested the extradition of Anne Sacoolas over the crash last August in which 19-year-old Briton Harry Dunn was killed while riding his motorbike.
But the State Department said on Thursday that Sacoolas had ""immunity from criminal jurisdiction"" and that to extradite her would set a precedent. 
""If the United States were to grant the UK’s extradition request, it would render the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity and would set an extraordinarily troubling precedent,"" the State Department said.
British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the U.S. ambassador in London to express British disappointment. 
""We feel this amounts to a denial of justice, and we believe Anne Sacoolas should return to the UK,"" Raab said. ""The UK would have acted differently if this had been a UK diplomat serving in the U.S. ...
""We are now urgently considering our options.""
Dunn's family have said Sacoolas was driving on the wrong side of the road at the time of the crash, near an air force base in central England used by the U.S. military.
Sacoolas was given diplomatic immunity and left Britain shortly after the accident. Her lawyer has said that she will not return voluntarily to Britain possibly to face jail for ""a terrible but unintentional accident"". 
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Sacoolas was wrong to use diplomatic immunity to leave Britain and has urged U.S. President Donald Trump to reconsider the U.S. position.

Dunn's parents met Trump at the White House in October. Trump hoped to persuade them meet to Sacoolas, who was in the building at the same time, but they declined.

Last week, the group, Lawyers for Liberty (LFL) said Singapore prison officers were allegedly instructed to snap prisoners' necks by kicking them in the event of a rope breaking during hangings.
It said the report was based on information from an unidentified prison officer in Singapore.
On Wednesday, Singapore's minister for home affairs, K. Shanmugam, denied the accusations as ""untrue, baseless and preposterous"" and ordered the group and several websites to attach ""fake news"" notices to posts and articles carrying them.
In their suit, the Malaysian lawyers say Shanmugam's directive cannot be carried out because it oversteps Singapore's jurisdiction.
""He gave direction asking them to publish a correction, failing which (Singapore's government) can take action against them, which includes ultimately being charged in Singapore's courts,"" said the group's lawyer, Gurdial Singh Nijar.
""We are saying that direction...is of no effect, null and void, and cannot be enforced,"" Gurdial said, adding that the group hoped to serve notice on Shanmugam as soon as possible.
Singapore's home affairs ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Not long after Shanmugam's directive, Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) Singapore, owned by  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ), posted the correction notice on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, adding that it was legally required to do so by the government's order.
In a statement on Thursday, Singapore's communication and information ministry said it had blocked access to the rights group's website after it refused to comply with the directive.
The Singapore ""fake news"" law, seen as one of the most far-reaching measures of its kind, took effect in October amid concern among rights groups and opposition politicians that it could be used to silence government criticism.
The government has denied such suggestions, saying the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act only targets falsehoods and legitimate criticism and free speech would not be affected."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif skipped this year's Davos, but Tehran was still a hot topic for many Western and Middle Eastern powers hoping for detente less than three weeks after the United States killed Iran's top general.
Zarif, normally a regular at the World Economic Forum, canceled on Monday, with his ministry citing program changes. Organizers of the annual gathering in the Swiss ski resort did not comment on the reason given.
While Iran was absent from the corridors of the conference center, there was an urge for de-escalation among those present.
Iraqi President Barham Salih said he had a productive conversation on Iran with U.S. President Donald Trump, who made few public comments on the issue while in Davos, after signaling this month he was ready to de-escalate the situation.
""We had a very candid conversation (about) the need for basically restraint, calming things down... This is not time for another conflict,"" Salih said on Wednesday.
Washington blamed Qaseem Soleimani, Iran's top general, for masterminding attacks by Iran-aligned militias against U.S. forces in the region. His killing in a U.S. drone attack left regional analysts concerned it could spark a war.
Iran responded to Soleimani's killing by launching missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq, although it flagged that the attack was coming and no U.S. soldiers were killed.
In Davos, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud told Reuters the kingdom was open to talks with Tehran and that ""many countries"" had offered to mediate.
Riyadh has accused its arch-rival of attacking its oil facilities in September 2019, an attack that briefly knocked out half of Saudi's oil production. Tehran denies any involvement.
Saudi finance minister Mohammed al-Jadaan said Riyadh, which holds the G20 presidency role, was calling for dialogue.
""If you look at history, we in this region have managed to weather through worse geopolitical situations, including actual, real wars,"" he told Reuters.
""We in Saudi have to focus on the economy and reform ... We firmly believe the disputes can only be resolved by dialogue.""
OPEN FOR DIALOGUE
Zarif tweeted on Thursday that Iran remained open for dialogue: ""We announce our readiness to participate in any complementary work that is in the interest of the region.""
Iran has said it will not abide by the nuclear deal it signed with six global powers. Washington pulled out of it in 2018 and wants Europe to work on a new, tougher agreement.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel warned in Davos against prematurely scrapping the deal, saying that it would be wrong to abandon something ""imperfect"" with nothing better in place.
Despite de-escalation efforts, nerves remain on edge.
As Davos began on Tuesday, Iran's semi-official news agency reported that lawmaker Ahmad Hamzeh had announced a $3 million award to ""whoever kills Trump"".
And the U.S. special representative for Iran, Brian Hook, said Soleimani's successor would suffer the same fate if he followed a similar path by targeting Americans.
Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said he had told Trump that a war with Iran would be ""a disaster for the world"". It is not clear how the U.S. president responded.
As well as wishing for tensions to calm, one Saudi official made clear the weigh of that obligation rest with Iran.
""The escalation is really coming from the Iranian side,"" Adel al-Jubeir, Saudi's minister of state for foreign affairs, told a Davos panel on ""The Unsettled Middle East"".
""We can't deescalate because there's nothing to deescalate from on our side... It's up to the Iranians to decide if they want to provoke a reaction from the international community or not."""

Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objection of China, which considers it a Chinese province with no right to participate in international organizations as a separate entity.
Taiwan was not allowed to participate in an emergency WHO meeting on Wednesday about the new virus, which has killed at least 25 people since originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan last month. Taiwan has only reported one case.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, re-elected by a landslide this month on a platform of standing up to China, this week called on the WHO to set aside political considerations and grant it full access to virus updates.
""Taiwan is at the forefront of global epidemic prevention. There needs to be room at the WHO for Taiwan's participation,"" she told reporters.
Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China, expressed its anger saying that epidemic prevention should know no boundaries.
""Please could the WHO cast aside political considerations. If Taiwan is alone in being left out of epidemic prevention work it will leave a gap, and is not beneficial to promoting epidemic prevention work around the world,"" it said in a statement.
Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je, a doctor by training who is no friend of either Tsai's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party nor the Kuomintang, added his voice of disapproval.
""In recent years, Taiwan has been placed outside the world's epidemic prevention system, and has no way of getting first hand information. This is a problem,"" said Ko, whose Taiwan People's Party won its first parliamentary seats this month.
China says such concerns are nonsense. China's foreign ministry said this week nobody cares more about Taiwan's people than China's central government.
Taiwan's Centres for Disease Control also say they have smooth channels with China, though it has also complained about its inability to get first hand information from the WHO.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO emergencies program, told a news conference in Geneva on Thursday they work closely with technical partners in what he termed ""China, Taiwan"".
""And I believe the authorities in Taiwan are working very closely with China in the mainland and I believe there have been joint missions and joint approaches to the response,"" he said."

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian officials were working on Friday to extricate the bodies of three U.S. firefighters from a plane that crashed in remote bushland, as the area's ""active"" bushfire status complicated an investigation into the accident. 
Officials said it was still too early to speculate on the cause of the crash of the C-130 Hercules tanker plane on Thursday, killing its entire crew, just after it dumped a large load of retardant on a huge wildfire in a national park.
""We are very much into the evidence gathering phase of the investigation,"" Greg Hood, chief commissioner of the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB), which is leading the investigation, told reporters. ""We will not be speculating.""
However, he added that ""we have nothing to suggest there was a systemic fault"" when asked whether other aircraft in use were safe. 
Coulson Aviation, the Canadian firm that owned the plane and employed its crew, revealed on Friday that all three were former U.S. military members with extensive flight experience: Captain Ian H. McBeth, 44; First Officer Paul Clyde Hudson, 42; and Flight Engineer Rick DeMorgan Jr., 43.
Firefighters in Australia held a minute's silence and flags on official buildings in New South Wales (NSW) state, where the plane crashed, were flown at half-mast as a mark of respect on Friday.
""We will forever be indebted to the enormous contribution and indeed the ultimate sacrifice that's been paid as a result of these extraordinary individuals doing a remarkable job,"" NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said at a farewell near Sydney airport for 32 U.S. firefighters who were returning home after weeks on duty on Australia. 
ATSB investigators had to be escorted to the one-kilometer-long crash site by firefighters on Friday and police were still in the process of securing the area, Hood said. Little of the plane was intact and potential hazards included aviation fuel and unexploded pressurized canisters, he added. (Graphic: https://tmsnrt.rs/30O47Eq)
Hood said the ATSB expected to retrieve the plane's black box cockpit voice recorder, use a drone to 3D map the site, analyze both air traffic control and the plane's data and review the weather at the time of the crash.
""We understand there were several witnesses to the accident,"" he said. ""We hope that some of the witness statements will actually be able to shed light on the sequence of events following the dropping of the retardant."" 
A team from Coulson Aviation was due to arrive in Australia on Saturday, along with the aircraft history and maintenance records. 
Coulson grounded its other large air tankers immediately after the crash but said on Friday they would be returning to work ""in the very near future"". 
There have been two previous crashes involving C-130 Hercules aircraft while fighting wildfires. In a 2002 accident in California the wings of the aircraft folded upward, breaking off the plane before the fuselage rolled and hit the ground upside down, killing all three crew. In 2012, another C-130 crashed in South Dakota, killing four of the six crew, in an accident that was later determined to be weather-related.
""Unfortunately, aircraft are one of the riskiest parts of wildland firefighting,"" said Eric Kennedy, a disaster and emergency management expert at York University in Toronto, Canada.
Kennedy said there many possible causes for Thursday's crash, but noted that a well-known risk in the C-130 fleet was metal fatigue-induced wing failure. 
""Reduced visibility, high turbulence, and low flying can all be contributing risk factors for air tanker crashes,"" Kennedy said in emailed comments.
MORE U.S. FIREFIGHTERS ARRIVE
The death toll from Australia's devastating bushfires rose to 33 on Friday after police found a body in a home completely destroyed by fire in New South Wales south coast. The body has not yet been formally identified but it is believed to be of the 59-year-old male occupant, state police said in a statement.
The toll includes eight firefighters.
The fires have also killed millions of animals, razed thousands of homes and destroyed a land area about one-third the size of Germany since September. 
Around 250 firefighters from the United States and Canada have undertaken deployments in Australia since the start of the season.
A 41-strong U.S. team arrived in Melbourne from the United States on Friday to help in eastern Victoria, the state's Country Fire Authority said.
While fire conditions eased in southeastern Australia on Friday, Sydney was choking on a new smoke haze, blown in by a baking hot wind from the fires burning in the south of the state. 

In New South Wales, firefighters were tackling 65 blazes with only one at the ""watch and act"" category, meaning there was no immediate threat. In Victoria state, all 37 fires were rated at the lowest level.

Comedian Alexander Dolgopolov this week posted a picture of an Interior Ministry notice sent to St. Petersburg's HopHead Tap Room, where he performed last February, that asked the establishment to provide information about him.
In that performance, which has garnered nearly 2.8 million views on YouTube in nine months, Dolgopolov made off-color jokes about the Virgin Mary and Jesus, and ridiculed his own faith as a child.
Leonid Solovyov, Dolgopolov's lawyer, told Reuters the police investigation into his client was linked to a complaint that his jokes had offended religious beliefs.
""He has decided to leave Russia for security reasons,"" Solovyov said, adding that the situation was temporary. 
He would not disclose Dolgopolov's location. But later on Thursday Dolgopolov posted a picture of himself on Instagram in what appeared to be Israel and said he was safe. 
Russia has adopted laws that make it illegal to insult the feelings of religious believers and affront the authorities online. Critics say they have been used to smother dissent and curb freedom of speech in the country, where atheism was the norm during the Soviet era. 
""They are clearly not looking for me because they are big fans of my work,"" Dolgopolov, who left Russia on Thursday morning, said in a video posted on his YouTube channel. ""I'm very frightened... I'm sure that problems are beginning for me.""
The Russian Interior Ministry told Reuters that police were following up on a complaint that Dolgopolov's performance had insulted religious feelings. It said a decision on the case would be made following a police probe. 
Dolgopolov's manager, Armen Gandilyan, told Russian media that all his performances would be canceled until his legal situation was clarified.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's push to resume tourism with the North is aimed at resetting border ties, but must overcome Pyongyang's skepticism and chart a careful course around U.S. efforts to pressure leader Kim Jong-un into eliminating his nuclear arsenal.
South Korea's Unification Ministry unveiled plans this week for individual tours in the North's major tourist sites. The effort is meant to appease Pyongyang, which has criticized the South for lacklustre progress after their leaders agreed to restart economic cooperation in 2018.
Tourism is not subject to international sanctions imposed over North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, and the proposals are designed to avoid breaching U.N. bans on bulk cash transfers and joint business ventures with North Korea.
Seoul says the United States knows of its plans, and South Korean officials are seeking to sound out Pyongyang about them, albeit quietly given the sensitivity of relations, officials said.
After Moon called for reopening North Korea tours in his New Year speech, Seoul diplomats led by nuclear envoy Lee Do-hoon visited Washington. U.S. officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun, reacted well to the idea, a diplomatic source told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
""Biegun practically gave a blank check. But of course it doesn't mean that they want to see a million dollars written down on it right away,"" the source said, referring to sanctions concerns.
Officials and businessmen are concerned that the North will not welcome the offer.
In November, Pyongyang threatened to bulldoze ""backward, shabby"" South Korean tourist facilities at its Mount Kumgang resort. At a key policy-making meeting last month, it vowed to overcome economic difficulties on its own through ""an offensive for frontal breakthrough.""
""It would be a policy shift if the North accepts it,"" a South Korean official told Reuters, referring to the tourism plan. ""And frosty relations aside, they don't really like South Koreans roaming through their country.""
Amid stalled nuclear talks with Washington, the North has effectively halted formal inter-Korean dialogue after three summits and a flurry of diplomacy in 2017-18, criticizing what it calls the South's U.S.-reliant policy.
""I'm not sure if restarting tourism with the South is in line with their 'frontal breakthrough' campaign, but there can always be a surprise, and some of the plans such as invitation-based visits are already taking place on a limited scale,"" said an official at a South Korean company previously involved in the initiative.
SANCTIONS
South Korean officials and those who are close to Moon have increasingly grumbled about Washington's position that it will maintain sanctions until Pyongyang takes substantial steps toward denuclearisation.
Harry Harris, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea, has recently become the face of that discontent after suggesting Seoul run its tourism idea through a joint working group. Jeong Se-hyun, a former unification minister who advises Moon, even called for designating Harris as a ""persona non grata.""
During the recent meeting led by Biegun and Lee, both sides shared concerns the United States was being perceived as a potential obstacle to inter-Korean ties, the diplomatic source said.
""So we'll try to give the impression that the consultations are working and helpful, and we can also speed up the way we handle things,"" the source said on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Kumgang tourism was a joint venture, now banned by sanctions, that provided a rare source of cash for Pyongyang worth millions of dollars a year.
The number of visitors peaked in 2007 to a total of some 350,000, with up to 2,000 crossing the border daily, the industry official said.
Seoul's new proposal includes not only Kumgang but also new areas built up under Kim, including the Wonsan coastal tourist zone, the Samjiyon alpine town and Yangdok hot spring resort.
A coalition of pro-engagement groups in border areas, which has been taking tentative applications for individual tours, told Reuters that nearly 800 South Koreans have expressed interest since late October.
""Sanctions are the most powerful tool the United States has to keep the negotiations alive, so they would have reservations about anything that could possibly undermine the spirit of sanctions,"" another diplomatic source said.
""But now that there's clearance from Washington, Seoul would need to craft a smart strategy to convince North Koreans before throwing the ball back into their court."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Australia's bushfires are contributing to one of the biggest annual increases in the concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere since record-keeping began more than 60 years ago, according to a forecast published by Britain's Met Office on Friday.
While human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are responsible for the bulk of the increase in CO2 levels, Australia's bushfires have made the problem measurably worse, underscoring the impact of the catastrophe on the global climate system.
""A forecast of the atmospheric concentration of carbon-dioxide shows that 2020 will witness one of the largest annual rises in concentration since measurements began at Mauna Loa, in Hawaii, 1958,"" the Met Office said in a statement.
It said the atmospheric concentration of CO2 is expected to peak above 417 parts per million in May, with the average for the year forecast to be 414.2 ± 0.6ppm. This annual average represents a 2.74 ± 0.57 ppm rise on the 2019 average.
Concentrations of CO2 in the Earth's atmosphere have already far surpassed what scientists consider to be safe limits.
At a climate summit in Madrid in December, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned that 400 ppm had once been considered ""an unthinkable tipping point.""
The last time there was a comparable concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere was between 3 and 5 million years ago, when the temperature was between 2 and 3 degrees Celsius warmer and sea levels were 10 to 20 meters higher than today, scientists say.
Although the data series started in 1958 has always shown CO2 concentrations increasing year-on-year, driven by fossil fuel burning and deforestation, the rate of rise has not been perfectly even, the Met Office said.
Fluctations in the amount of CO2 absorbed by tropical forests and other natural carbon sinks can affect overall levels of the gas in the atmosphere.
""Overall these are expected to be weaker than normal for a second year running,"" said Richard Betts, of the Met Office Hadley Centre and University of Exeter.
This year, the Met forecasts that the impact of weather patterns on global ecosystems will increase the annual human-caused rise in CO2 concentration by 10%, with emissions from the Australian fires accounting for one-fifth of that increase.
Australia's fires are themselves a foretaste of the kind of catastrophes that are liable to become normal as the planet warms, with prolonged drought and low humidity making arid landscapes more vulnerable to huge blazes, scientists say.
The CO2 forecast underscored the urgency of the task facing negotiators trying to persuade big countries to cut emissions under the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change, which is still nowhere near on track to spare the world from devastating temperature increases.
The accord enters a crucial implementation phase this year, with governments due to submit more ambitious plans for climate action ahead of a summit in Glasgow in November. Australia's government is regarded as among the main laggards.
Last month, the 2020 Climate Change Performance Index rated Australia as one of the worst performers among 57 high-emitters, awarding it 0 out of 100 possible points for its policies."

FRONTERA HIDALGO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican authorities on Thursday adopted tougher measures against Central American migrants, detaining 800 of them who had entered Mexico illegally from Guatemala intending to reach the border with the United States.
Mexico is under intense pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump to contain mass movements of migrants, most of them from Central America, who have been crossing through Mexico on their way to the U.S. border. 
The National Migration Institute (INM) said it had transferred 800 migrants, some of them unaccompanied minors, to immigration centers where they would be given food, medical attention and shelter. 
If their legal status cannot be resolved, they will be returned to their home countries. The INM also said it was looking for another 200 migrants who had remained in the area.
Earlier in the day, security forces with riot shields corralled migrants, including families with small children, after they had entered Mexico across the Suchiate River from Guatemala. 
Some migrants in the caravan had been given forms to seek asylum with Mexico's asylum agency, COMAR. Many of the migrants heading north say they are fleeing economic hardship and violence at home.
The current group is the largest surge of people to test Mexico since its president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, reached agreements with Trump and some central American governments to reduce pressure on the U.S. border.
Trump has threatened to punish Mexico and Central American countries economically if they fail to rein in migrant flows.
Migrants crossing into Mexico this week faced tear gas from security forces, in a firmer response than seen in previous mass crossings.

Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said several hundred of the new arrivals were immediately deported.

(Reuters) - Twenty U.S. states sued the Trump administration on Thursday to block what they called its latest effort to allow blueprints for making guns from 3-D printers to be released on the internet, threatening a proliferation of ""ghost guns"" that spread violence.
Led by Washington state and controlled primarily by Democrats, the states, along with the District of Columbia, said they sued in federal court in Seattle, after the government published final agency rules earlier in the day allowing the necessary files to be posted.
According to the states, the new rules transfer oversight of 3-D printed guns to the Commerce Department from the State Department, effectively ending Congressional oversight of the blueprints and leaving behind a loophole-filled regulatory scheme allowing their distribution ""with ease.""
The blueprints can be used to create ghost guns, which can be difficult to detect even with metal detectors, and difficult to trace because they lack serial numbers.
“Ghost guns endanger every single one of us,"" New York Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. ""We're filing this lawsuit to stop the Trump Administration from further facilitating the spread of gun violence at our schools, our offices, and our places of worship.""
The State Department, the Commerce Department and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The lawsuit followed U.S. District Judge Robert Lasnik's decision on Nov. 12 striking down an administration effort to let the Texas nonprofit Defense Distributed publish the blueprints, as part of an earlier legal settlement.
Lasnik, who sits in Seattle, cited the State Department's prior view that making the blueprints available could threaten foreign policy and national security by enabling terrorists and other criminals to obtain firearms.
Gun rights advocates have said fears about posting blueprints were overblown.
The lawsuit concerning Defense Distributed was filed in July 2018.
President Donald Trump, a Republican, tweeted the next day that he was looking into the public sale of 3-D guns and had spoken to the National Rifle Association. He also said the guns did not ""seem to make much sense!""

The other plaintiffs in Thursday's lawsuit are California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia.

360,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 09:07PM ET</span>",Justice Department says it should not have continued spying on former Trump adviser,"By Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department has told a court it did not have enough evidence to justify continued surveillance of one of President Donald Trump's former campaign advisers in 2017, in a sign it believes the FBI on occasion went too far when it investigated Russian influence in the 2016 election.
The department's assessment, made public on Thursday, came after an in-depth review by the Justice Department's internal watchdog found the FBI manipulated evidence and otherwise overstepped its bounds as it explored possible links between the Trump campaign and Moscow in 2016.
The watchdog's review, made public in December, found that FBI agents acted legally when they asked in 2016 for court approval to begin surveillance of former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. But it determined that they left out evidence that could have weakened their case against Page as they sought renewed approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in the months that followed.
The Justice Department has since tried to set the record straight, telling the secretive surveillance court that in the later stages of surveillance ""there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause to believe that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power,"" according to a court opinion released in an unclassified version on Thursday.
Based on that assessment, Judge James Boasberg wrote that he thought the Justice Department no longer viewed some of the continued surveillance of Page in 2017 as legitimate.
""The Court understands the government to have concluded, in view of the material misstatements and omissions, that the Court's authorizations ... were not valid,"" Boasberg wrote.
The Justice Department has not concluded whether its prior surveillance of Page was justified, he wrote in an opinion dated Jan. 7.
The Justice Department and Page did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The FBI declined to comment. The agency's chief, Christopher Wray, has said he has taken steps to fix problems highlighted in the review.
The FBI investigation was taken over in May 2017 by Special Counsel Robert Mueller. 

His report, released in April 2019, detailed a Russian campaign of hacking and propaganda to sow discord in the United States and help Trump defeat Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Mueller documented numerous contacts between Trump campaign figures and Moscow but found insufficient evidence of a criminal conspiracy.

361,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 08:49PM ET</span>",North Korea confirms former defense commander is new foreign minister,"SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's state media on Friday confirmed that Ri Son Gwon, a former defense commander with limited diplomatic experience, has been appointed the country's new foreign affairs minister.
The official KCNA news agency reported Ri, the latest military official to be promoted under North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, gave a speech as minister at a New Year dinner reception hosted by the ministry on Thursday for embassies and international organizations.
A diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters North Korea informed countries with embassies in Pyongyang last week that Ri, a former military officer and now a senior official of the ruling Workers' Party, had replaced Ri Yong Ho as Pyongyang's top diplomat.
The appointment came as a surprise to North Korea watchers amid stalled denuclearisation talks with Washington, as Ri does not have any experience in dealing with nuclear issues or U.S. officials. His predecessor was a career diplomat and seasoned nuclear negotiator, though he often took a backseat to military officer-turned-party envoys during the last two years of diplomacy.
The new foreign minister did, however, lead high-level inter-Korean talks in 2018 as chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country, which handles South Korea affairs."
362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 08:43PM ET</span>","Pentagon could start global troop rebalance this year, Esper says","By Phil Stewart
MIAMI (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper suggested on Thursday he could be ready to start a highly anticipated global force repositioning this year as part of an effort to refocus the Pentagon on challenges from China and Russia.
Esper said he did not want to put a firm timeline on the completion of his so-called ""defense-wide review,"" which is expected to trigger those troop movements.
""If I had to put an end-date (on the review), I want to make sure we are in some type of better posture by the beginning of the next fiscal year,"" Esper told reporters, referring to the government's calendar year for spending, which begins on Oct. 1. ""So I want to move fairly quickly.""
Esper made the remarks during a trip to Miami as he began a review of military missions in Latin America, part of a sweeping global examination of deployments that he hopes will allow him to redirect more forces to Asia and send others back to the United States from overseas.
Many experts say the effort is overdue, given military advances in China during the past two decades as America focused on counter-terrorism operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere. 
Still, at a time of heightened tension with Iran and Iran-backed groups, it's unclear how big of a shift can be expected, particularly in an election year.
The review is being closely watched by proponents of U.S. military engagement in Latin America and Africa - two of the typically worst-resourced regions for the U.S. military.
The Africa review sessions, another of which is slated for Friday, are already triggering expectations within the Pentagon of at least a modest reduction in U.S. troops in West Africa, where many U.S. officials are concerned about the growing strength of Islamist militants. No decisions have been made.
A significant reduction in U.S. forces dedicated to U.S. Southern (NYSE:SO) Command could be felt quickly. U.S. deployments to Latin America for activities like training are often measured in the dozens, instead of the thousands that can move in and out of the Middle East. 
Esper sought to ease any concerns on Thursday as he visited the Miami-based Southern Command headquarters.
""Everybody always assumes that when we talk reviews, it means reduction. Not necessarily,"" he said.
""That's one of the notions I've been trying to dispel ... While it may mean right-sizing, it also could mean the addition of forces into a region, if we need them.""
As the U.S. military seeks to more aggressively address China, Southern Command is arguing that Latin America should be central to that effort.
Chinese naval port calls have increased 70 percent in the past five years in the region, and Beijing is ramping up weapons sales, infrastructure investment and trade with Latin American countries, according to U.S. military data.
Southern Command counted $615 million in Chinese weapons sales to Venezuela alone over the past decade.
Still, it's unclear whether those arguments will sway Pentagon leadership, which is seeing similar trends globally. 
One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, noted that there had been other rounds of cuts and reprioritizations at Southern Command.
""Just anecdotally, 10 years ago, if you came here, for intel, we had a Colombia (intelligence) division. A division of analysts working Colombia. Right now, we've got two analysts working Colombia,"" the official said.

Fewer analysts on some issues, and a shifting focus to growing challenges from Russia and China, means ""we're assuming risk in a number of areas in order to meet the present challenge,"" the official added. ""And that's what you do.""

363,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 07:39PM ET</span>",Trump to unveil long-stalled Middle East peace plan ahead of Israeli leaders' visit,"By Jeff Mason and Maayan Lubell
MIAMI/JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he will release details of his long-delayed peace plan for the Middle East before Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his election rival Benny Gantz visit the White House next week.
The political aspects of the peace initiative have been closely guarded. Only the economic proposals have been unveiled.
Trump discussed the timing of the plan's release with two architects of the plan, senior advisers Jared Kushner and Avi Berkowitz, on Air Force One while returning to Washington from Switzerland on Wednesday.
Speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to the Miami area for a political event, Trump said Palestinians might react negatively to his plan at first, but that ""it's actually very positive for them.""
""It's a great plan,"" said Trump, who will meet with Netanyahu at the White House on Tuesday. ""It's a plan that really would work.""
Vice President Mike Pence, on a visit to Jerusalem, extended an invitation to Netanyahu and Gantz to make the visit. It was not immediately clear whether Trump would meet the two leaders separately or together.
The Trump Middle East peace proposal is a document, dozens of pages long, that addresses in detail the thorny political issues between Israel and the Palestinians, such as the status of Jerusalem.
U.S. officials made no mention of inviting the Palestinians, and Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, said: ""We warn Israel and the U.S. administration not to cross any red lines.""
Trump indicated his administration had spoken ""briefly"" to the Palestinians and would speak to them again ""in a period of time.""
Netanyahu said he had accepted the U.S. invitation. His office said he would fly to the United States on Sunday. A Gantz spokesman did not respond when asked whether Gantz had accepted Trump’s invitation. 
Netanyahu, a veteran right-wing Israeli leader, faces political and legal troubles at home - he is heading for his third election in less than a year, and was indicted on criminal charges in November. He denies any wrongdoing.
Israeli political analysts viewed Trump's invitation as a boost to Netanyahu, his right-wing ally. 
Netanyahu's principal domestic political rival Gantz, a centrist former general, this week lifted his objection to having the peace plan be published before Israel's March election. He had previously objected to it as interference in the vote.
LONG-DELAYED PLAN 
The launch of Trump's plan to end the decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinians has been delayed numerous times over the last two years.
A source familiar with the peace team's thinking said bringing both Netanyahu and Gantz in on the details is aimed at defusing any suggestion that Trump might be favoring one Israeli candidate over another. 
Trump is facing his own political clock, preoccupied with his bid for re-election in November, and could ill afford to wait for months for Israel to decide who its next prime minister will be, the source said.
""If we waited we could be in the same position four months from now and never put out the plan,"" the source said.
The political proposal is the product of three years of work by Kushner, Berkowitz and former envoy Jason Greenblatt. Kushner proposed a $50 billion economic plan for the Middle East last July at a conference in Bahrain.
Kushner and Berkowitz had been scheduled to visit Israel and Saudi Arabia after attending the World Economic Conference in Davos, Switzerland, this week, but opted instead to discuss the issue with Trump on his flight home, the source said.
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks collapsed in 2014 and Palestinians have called Trump’s proposal dead in the water, even before its publication, citing what they see as his pro-Israel policies.
The Trump administration has reversed decades of U.S. policy on the conflict, refraining from endorsing the two-state solution - the longtime international formula which envisages a Palestinian state co-existing with Israel.
It has also recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital and moved its embassy there. More recently, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced in November that the United States no longer viewed Israel’s settlements on West Bank land as ""inconsistent with international law"".
Palestinians and most of the international community view the settlements as illegal under international law. Israel disputes this, citing historical, biblical and political ties to the land, as well as security needs. 
Netanyahu announced during an election campaign last September that he intends to annex the Jordan Valley, a large swathe of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.
Israel captured the West Bank in a 1967 war and Palestinians, who signed interim peace deals with Israel in the 1990s, seek to make the area part of a future state. 
Abbas's Palestinian Authority, which exercises limited self-rule in the West Bank, has publicly refused to engage politically with the Trump administration.
They fear the plan will dash their hopes for an independent state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and the Gaza Strip.

Trump, who will seek a second term in a Nov. 3 election, faces his own problems at home with Democrats seeking to oust the Republican president on impeachment charges of abusing power and obstructing Congress.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition politician Henri Falcon's party is seeking the United States' blessing for a deal with President Nicolas Maduro to overturn and repeat a 2018 vote in which Maduro trounced Falcon, the party's lobbying firm said in a filing.
Canadian lobbying firm Dickens & Madson in its bi-yearly report to the U.S. Department of Justice said it was in ""regular, ongoing communications with U.S. intelligence and the executive branch"" to ensure Washington would not oppose the plan as long as Maduro relinquishes his claim to the presidency. 
The United States, dozens of other countries and the mainstream Venezuelan opposition argue Maduro stole the 2018 vote and is no longer the legitimate president. They recognize Juan Guaido, the leader of the opposition-held National Assembly, as the rightful head-of-state. 
Any such deal would face many obstacles, namely Guaido allies' aversion to negotiations with Maduro, who they argue uses such talks as tactics to buy time and cement his grip on power. 
Opposition politicians often criticize Falcon's willingness to engage with Maduro and his decision to take part in the 2018 vote, which the mainstream opposition boycotted over concerns it would not be free and fair.
But it nonetheless comes after a series of behind-the-scenes contacts between allies of Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump. 
Last year, prominent Trump supporter and private security executive Erik Prince met with Vice President Delcy Rodriguez in Caracas, while a wealthy Venezuelan businessmen who forged a profitable relationship with the socialist government has engaged Trump's unpaid personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.[nL1N29Q20Y][nL1N28N196]
The U.S. State Department and a spokesman for Falcon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dickens & Madson could not be reached for comment.
Under the plan, Maduro and Falcon ""would agree to the invalidation of the results of the most recent presidential election by the Supreme Court of Venezuela to enable a repeat of the election,"" according to the Jan. 21-dated document. 
Falcon retained the firm in July to promote its efforts. 

In one filing at the time, the lobbyist said it ""intends to pursue Henri Falcon's election as President of Venezuela."" Falcon at the time called that filing false and said it had been filed due to an administrative error. [nL2N24Q1PL]

Pompeo did not specify which elections he was referring to, but Haiti failed to hold scheduled legislative elections last year.
""We need to have the elections. That is important,"" Pompeo said in an interview with the Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald. ""Once those elections will be held, there'll be a duly elected government. We won't have to be concerned about ruling by decree.""
The U.S. State Department provided a transcript of Pompeo's interview with the newspapers.
Pompeo said he voiced concerns about the political situation with his Haitian counterpart in a meeting in Kingston, Jamaica, on Wednesday.
The Haitian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Haitian President Jovenel Moise is three years into a five-year term, which began in 2017 after the results of an initial vote, in October 2015, was scrapped over fraud allegations.
Moise's support in the country has never been overwhelming. Electoral turnout for the re-run election was low, with Moise receiving only 600,000 votes in a country of 10 million people. Last year, the country was mired in anti-corruption protests for months, with the opposition calling for Moise to step down.
Nevertheless, Moise has outlived his political opposition for now. The mandate of all deputies and most senators expired earlier in January and there were no successors as parliament failed to approve an electoral law last year necessary for holding legislative elections. In this situation, under Haitian law, the president rules directly.
Moise has blamed parliament for failing to approve the electoral law last year, though his opponents have accused him of trying to take advantage of the law.
The last two elected Haitian presidents, Rene Preval and Moise's political benefactor, Michel Martelly, both ruled by decree at some points.
Moise has said he wanted to overhaul the constitution. Though the precise changes he is seeking are not clear, it would be aimed at strengthening the presidency, which was weakened after the 30-year Duvalier family dictatorship."

VICTORIA, British Columbia (Reuters) - Prince Harry and wife Meghan have settled, for now, into a seaside home near the most royal of Canadian cities - Victoria, British Columbia (B.C.)- named after a queen who reigned until 1901, during a great expansion of the British Empire. 
In the summer, tourists pile onto red double-decker buses like the ones that criss-cross London. Every afternoon, hundreds flock to tea at the magnificent Fairmont Empress Hotel, or one of the city's many other tea rooms that fly the British flag.
""Victoria is probably more British than (the) British,"" said resident Bill Bray.
Indeed, thousands of British pensioners have chosen to retire on Vancouver Island, part of the province of B.C., which has a milder climate than the rest of Canada.
Prince Harry, 35, arrived on Monday, just a few days after reaching an arrangement with his grandmother Queen Elizabeth and other senior royals that will see him and Meghan, 38, quit their royal roles to seek an independent future. 
Their move has led to questions about what it will mean for Canada. If they settle on Victoria, local residents said they would feel at home and enjoy more privacy than in Britain. 
Victoria has often been a stop for members of the royal family who visit Canada, a former British colony whose head of state officially remains the British Sovereign.
George VI, who was Queen Elizabeth's father and Harry's great grandfather, hosted a dinner for 250 guests at the Empress in 1939, according to the hotel's website, and in 1951, a year before she became queen, Princess Elizabeth stayed at the hotel.
In 1966, the queen's mother visited Victoria and dedicated the cornerstone of the city's most important museum, the Royal B.C. Museum. In 2016, Harry's brother Prince William brought his wife, Kate Middleton, and their children to the city during an official visit to Canada.
""When I was a child... we used to sing 'God Save the Queen' before school started every morning,"" said Helena Isherwood, who works in a boutique shop at the Empress.
Harry and Meghan, with baby Archie, will like Victoria because ""it's beautiful and I think they'll get some privacy here, and space,"" Isherwood said.
That would probably be a welcome change for the couple who on Tuesday issued a warning over harassment by paparazzi photographers after the Sun newspaper published images of Meghan taking a stroll through a park near Victoria. 
""We don't have a big paparazzi culture in Canada, so I do think they will find some contrast to what they're familiar with coming from the U.K.,"" said Mischelle vanThiel, a royal expert at the Royal B.C. Museum. 

Local resident Bray said Prince Harry would be ""just another bloke on the street"" in Victoria.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The U.S. government will deport a planeload of Brazilians on Friday, the second such chartered flight since October to return an increasing number of migrants trying to enter the United States illegally from Mexico.
The flight from El Paso will arrive in Belo Horizonte in central Brazil early on Saturday morning, Brazil's Foreign Ministry told Reuters. The October flight had 70 deportees aboard.
The two deportation flights in October and this week are the first authorized by Brazil since 2006 and mark a policy change by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro who has sought closer ties with the Trump Administration, two Brazilian officials said on condition of anonymity.
Brazil has previously refused to receive mass deportations from the United States and is now allowing these transfers to help President Donald Trump's policy of speeding up deportations of illegal migrants at the Mexican border, they said.
Brazil's Foreign Ministry confirmed the Brazilian government had been notified of the repatriation of Brazilian nationals who were not admitted to the United States.
""What else can we do? They are being detained at the border and aren't going to be able to enter the United States. We have to bring them home,"" a third official told Reuters when asked about the deportations.
Trump has made restricting legal and illegal immigration a central focus of his presidency and his 2020 reelection campaign. His administration has issued a series of sweeping policies seeking to limit access to U.S. asylum at the Mexico border and has pledged to ramp up deportations of migrants living illegally in the United States.
Matthew Albence, acting director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which coordinates deportation flights, said larger flights were more efficient, but did not provide details of the flight set to depart for Brazil on Friday.
""We can put 70 [people] on a plane and get them all at one time, as opposed to flying 70 individuals by themselves,"" Albence said during an interview at the agency's headquarters in Washington. ""That's certainly a lot cheaper and more efficient.""
The number of Brazilians arrested by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Agency (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) at the U.S.-Mexico border surged to 17,900 in fiscal 2019, a more than tenfold increase from the previous year, according to the U.S. government.
Brazilian diplomats believe this surge was due to Brazilians wanting to live in the United States anticipating tougher rules for visas under Trump and deciding to enter from Mexico.
The two Brazilian government sources told Reuters Brazilian diplomats were told not to place hurdles in the way of U.S. deportation of Brazilians because that could hurt closer ties with Washington.
Few Brazilians have a valid reason to request asylum as the country is neither at war nor seen as dangerous for minorities, according to Brazilian officials, so they are mostly denied entry and held in U.S. detention at the border.
The increase in Brazilians arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking asylum has led the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to consider sending Brazilian migrants back to Mexico to await court hearings under a new Trump administration program that currently applies only to Spanish speakers, a U.S. official and a Mexican official familiar with the discussions told Reuters last week.
The Trump administration has also explored the possibility of sending Brazilian asylum seekers to other nations, according to the U.S. official."

LIMA (Reuters) - A truck carrying natural gas exploded on Thursday in Peru's capital, killing at least two people and injuring 48 in an accident that Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra labeled a ""tragedy.""
The truck burst into flames after it hurtled off a ramp on a street in Lima, breaking a valve, leaking gas and igniting several nearby homes. At least 11 children were sent to local hospitals with severe burns, authorities said.
""Given the magnitude of the consequences, we can qualify this as a tragedy,"" Vizcarra told reporters.
Health Minister Elizabeth Hinostroza said more than 50% of the victims were in ""very critical"" condition, with burns covering more than 80% of their bodies.
Peru restricts the shipping of gas to homes and industry via pipelines, and relies heavily on trucks for distribution of the fuel.
The accident comes just days before a Sunday election to replace the country's Congress, which Vizcarra dissolved last year."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Nelson Perez, the Latino Roman Catholic bishop of Cleveland who has criticized U.S. President Donald Trump's immigration policy, was named on Thursday by Pope Francis to replace an outspoken conservative who recently retired as archbishop of Philadelphia.
Perez, 58, succeeds Archbishop Charles Chaput, a hero with the church's traditionalist wing for his reputation as a ""culture warriors"" on issues such as homosexuality and abortion.
Perez, who will be installed in February, said he was ""deeply grateful"" to the pope for picking him to head the Philadelphia archdiocese, home to about 1.4 million Catholics. He had served there as a parish priest decades earlier.
""It is with great joy tinged with a sense of sadness that I accept the appointment - joy that I will be returning to serve
@ArchPhilly, sadness in that I will be leaving
@DioceseofCLE,"" he said on Twitter.
Perez, who criticised Trump's policy of separating migrant families, was born the son of Cuban exiles in Miami. He grew up in New Jersey and began working as a priest in Philadelphia in 1989.
Perez will be the first Latino archbishop of Philadelphia, one of the most important dioceses in the United States, and the third to head any American archdiocese.
His appointment reflects changing demographics. Thomas Groome, professor of religious studies and former director of the Boston College Center on the Church, said Hispanics made up the backbone of the U.S. church.
""The American church, for 100 years, had been predominantly Irish,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""That era has passed. I think it is a new day for the Hispanic ministry of the church.""
About 55 percent of Latino adults in the United States, about 19.6 million people, identify themselves as Catholic, according to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center.
At a press conference in Philadelphia Thursday morning, Perez frequently addressed the audience in Spanish, translating some of his remarks into English.
He said he would like people to call him ""Father Nelson"" as he was known by members of the Hispanic community when he was a young priest in Philadelphia.
He also acknowledged the still-unfolding sexual abuse crisis that continues to rock the church. The scandal, including a decades-long cover-up by senior prelates of sexual misconduct by hundreds of priests, has spurred lawsuits and criminal investigations.
""I'd like to say to the victims of the church, that we hold you deep in our hearts and we are sorry,"" he said."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican rights groups and leftist President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's opponents are pushing back against a sweeping new judicial reform designed to combat soaring crime, warning that the proposed changes threaten individual freedoms.
The reform is a cornerstone of Mexico's attempts to get a grip on its unwieldy judicial system after a previous overhaul in 2016 failed to end rock-bottom conviction rates and record murder numbers.
Drafts of the proposed changes first reported by Reuters earlier in January include plans to allow private communications to be used as evidence and to limit legal challenges to avoid extradition delays for suspects, two issues seen as vital to Mexico's security partner, the United States.
The publication of the reforms bill was delayed to February after the draft became public. Rights defenders are raising alarm bells about proposals that include an expanded use of preventive detention and could validate illegally obtained evidence.
""It is an extraordinarily regressive reform that seriously threatens human rights and processes given as basic, such as presumption of innocence,"" said independent Senator and rights activist Emilio Alvarez.
""It is surprising that a government that identifies with the left presents such an authoritarian model of justice.""
In part, the reforms are aimed at addressing concerns by authorities that the 2016 switch to a U.S.-style accusatorial system made it harder for ill-prepared police and prosecutors to make cases stick.
They would also remove obstacles long criticized for gumming up criminal proceedings.
Many Mexicans have lost faith in the justice system. Murder rates hit a record high of 34,582 deaths last year, while less than one in 10 homicides results in a conviction.
Mexico's prosecutor's office on Wednesday said it will present a bill in February ""to resolve the grave situation which exists in the country."" It distanced itself from the draft bills, saying they had not been signed off by the attorney general.
It was not clear whether the government will change the drafts before presenting them to Congress.
In earlier comments, Attorney General Alejandro Gertz told lawmakers the reform would create a single criminal code, replacing 32 state and regional codes. He said the goal was to end corruption, crime and impunity.
The government did not respond to a request for comment.
The proposals seek to restrict legal challenges known as amparos to avoid delaying extraditions, something used to draw out the legal process of several drug traffickers, including Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzman, currently serving a life sentence in the United States.
Also concerning activists is a proposal that would allow ""illicit"" evidence to ""be taken into consideration and evaluated"" by a judge, raising fears that wiretaps without warrants and even torture could be used in trials.
Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) said it was alarmed by a proposal to allow detention of suspects for 40 days without trial on corruption and ""socially linked"" cases, previously only permitted with organized crime cases.
Article 19, a freedom of speech group, said the proposed reform would ""modify the justice system with alarming setbacks in terms of freedom of expression and information."""

A masked protester stretches his arm out through a cloud of tear gas, trying to reach a comrade fatally injured by a blow to the head during clashes with security services in Iraq.
Others crowd round the young man's limp body. One grabs at his shirt, as they lower him to the ground.
It was the moment captured by Reuters photographer Khalid al-Mousily during a series of rallies and running street battles in the center of Baghdad.
Mousily, who has been covering the surge of anti-government protests since they erupted in October, got to the scene early on Tuesday as youths gathered at the Mohammed al-Qassim highway to try and block the key route into the city.
All was quiet, so he stood back and scanned both sides of the demonstrations with his telephoto lens.
""I saw signs that the security services were planning an advance ... Minutes later protesters started to scream 'Look out everybody tear gas canisters'.
""I ran towards a blast wall to take shelter and started to take images of the running protesters ... I could hear bullets ... whizzing over my head.""
He kept changing positions, first behind an electricity pole, then to another part of the highway where protesters were starting to gather.
One group of youths started advancing, carrying a large metal sheet in front of them to shield them against bullets.
He spotted one thin youth trying to climb up the side of a wall on his own to reach the security forces gathered above him. 
""I pointed the camera in his direction, then I saw his body roll down the wall. I kept pressing the shutter and the protesters around me started screaming with grief: 'A protester down. A protester down!' 'Hit by a tear gas canister!'.""
It was obvious the young man was badly wounded and probably dead.
""I had seen before what happens, when a protester gets a direct hit from one of those canisters,"" Mousily said.
The young man was one of two people killed in that day's protests, which had surged over the weekend after a lull of several weeks.
Iraqi authorities declined to comment on the incident. Reuters could not determine the identity of the victim.
Iraqi security forces deny they have deliberately killed peaceful protesters. The government has blamed many violent escalations and deaths on unidentified infiltrators it says aim to stir up sedition.
The violence came amid mounting tensions in the region following the U.S. killing of Tehran's top general in an air strike inside Iraq.

""I still can't get the image of him out of my head, of his face covered with blood and his body rolling down the wall,"" Mousily said. ""I feel sorry for him, he was too young to die.""

ACAPULCO, Mexico (Reuters) - A human rights group on Thursday slammed an armed vigilante group' training of children to use guns in a violent region of Mexico after images of the armed minors sparked widespread consternation.
The video footage and photos of small children bearing rifles in the southwestern state of Guerrero were the latest shock to a country that has become increasingly accustomed to troubling news after two years of record levels of violence.
The images, which showed around 20 children doing military style drills, emerged days after 10 local musicians were murdered by suspected cartel hitmen in Chilapa de Alvarez, one of the most violent municipalities in Guerrero, one of Mexico's most violent states.
Bernardino Sanchez Luna, a leader of so-called community police in the town, said the ongoing failure of federal security forces to protect the area had led residents to instead arm themselves, including local children.
Ramon Navarrete, head of Guerrero's state human rights commission, urged vigilante groups to desist from using children in such local community policing initiatives.
""We thoroughly reject the involvement of minors in security operations which puts at risk their development, their physical safety and their lives,"" the rights commission said in a statement issued by the Guerrero state government.
Guerrero permits indigenous towns to form their own police according to traditional customs. In recent years such groups have flourished, along with other armed self-defense forces as rural communities seek alternatives to often corrupt state security forces, or to stand up to drug cartels.
Such self-defense groups enjoy uneasy relations with state authorities. Some have been effective in reducing the power of organized crime in some areas. However, critics say they often serve as a front for rival criminal interests.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador referred indirectly to the children during a regular news conference on Thursday, saying some security experts believed that the arming of minors showed armed groups were running out of adult recruits."

Residents were left grappling with the wreckage of Storm Gloria, including collapsed bridges, damaged railway lines and entire beaches wiped away by waves. 
Catalan authorities confirmed the two latest deaths on Thursday evening. A man was swept out to sea while fishing in the coastal town of Ametlla de Mar and another was found dead in his car inland in Cabaces, where there has been flooding. Four people are still missing. 
""I think what's important right now is that we're all united, that we work shoulder-to-shoulder and cooperate, as we are doing,"" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told reporters after flying over areas of eastern Spain that have been hit.
The national weather authority said the storm had begun to recede but more than 100 roads remained closed and tens of thousands of students were kept out of school. 
Noting that the storm had hit just as the area readied itself for the tourist season, Sanchez said his government had called the emergency meeting to help reestablish normality, guarantee security and address short- and medium-term needs.
The storm tightened its grip on parts of the peninsula on Sunday, unleashing winds of up to 144 kmh (90 mph) and waves up to 13.5 meters (44 feet) high that slammed into seafront shops, wiping out beaches and boardwalks. 
Near Barcelona, frothy sea foam carpeted several streets in the small town of Tossa de Mar.
Hundreds of thousands were left without power as the storm covered roads in snow, flooded farmlands and poured saltwater into the Ebro delta in northeastern Spain, swallowing thousands of hectares of rice paddies. 
Those killed by the storm ranged from a 69-year old man pulled into the sea by a wave in Catalonia to another who died as hail pounded the greenhouse in the province of Almeria where he had been working. 
The prime minister said that while every meteorological phenomenon could not be attributed to climate change, it was evident it was having an impact. 

""Public administrations have to reflect on how to shift gears and focus our economic resources and public policies ... on a new element - and that is climate change,"" said Sanchez.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Lawyers for U.S. journalist Glenn Greenwald urged a Brazilian court on Thursday to dismiss criminal charges against him for allegedly aiding hackers who accessed the private phone messages of Sergio Moro, Brazil's current justice minister.
In a federal court filing in the capital Brasilia, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, the lawyers argue that prosecutors' decision to charge the journalist was an act of ""scandalous disrespect.""
They point to an injunction by Brazil's Supreme Court that barred prosecutors from investigating Greenwald for having received or obtained ""information published in the media, due to the constitutional right to the protection of journalistic sources.""
Greenwald, a resident of Brazil and fierce critic of far right President Jair Bolsonaro, is best known for his work on the disclosures of Edward Snowden, the American former National Security Agency contractor who leaked secret documents about U.S. telephone and internet surveillance in 2013.
Greenwald was charged on Tuesday with criminal association with a group of six people, all of whom face charges of hacking the phones of Brazilian officials, as well as bank fraud and money laundering.
Last year, Greenwald and the Intercept Brasil website, which he helped found, published stories based on leaked chat messages involving prosecutors and Moro, then a judge working on high profile corruption cases and now minister of justice in Bolsonaro's cabinet.
In support of their case, federal prosecutors said in a statement that an audio feed found on the seized laptop of one of the alleged hackers showed Greenwald advising him to erase all messages linked to the Intercept, at a time when the hacking was still taking place.
The leaked conversations between Moro and prosecutors showed the judge advising them on the corruption case against former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, raising questions about Moro's independence.
Moro has dismissed the messages as coming from illegal hacking and has questioned their authenticity, saying they may have been doctored.
Greenwald, part of a team that won a Pulitzer Prize for stories involving Snowden, lives in Rio. He is married to David Miranda, a left-leaning politician who was elected to Congress last year."

Poland's top court ruled on Thursday that judges appointed under new government rules do not have the right to issue judgments there. The governing nationalists Law and Justice (PiS) believe it has no right to make such a decision.
At the same time, Polish lawmakers voted in favor of a bill that would allow judges who criticize the government's reforms to be disciplined, setting the stage for fresh conflict with Brussels which says the law is designed to muzzle judges.
The Supreme Court ruling underlines the divisions around the Polish judiciary, with some judges questioning the legitimacy of judges appointed by a reformed body which critics say is politicized.
""Such a person does not have the right to issue judgments in criminal cases... in civil cases a panel of judges including a person appointed in this way is against the law,"" said Supreme Court president Malgorzata Gersdorf, referring to judges appointed under the new rules.
PARLIAMENT VOTE
Lawmakers in the lower house of parliament voted 234-211 to disregard the rejection by the Senate of a law which would allow judges who criticize the government's reforms to be disciplined.
The opposition-dominated Senate voted 51-48 to reject the bill on Friday, but it is not able to block the reform, which will become law if it is signed by President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally.
Duda, who faces a presidential election this year, offered a strident defense of PiS's reforms on Friday, saying he would not allow anybody to tell Poland ""in foreign languages"" what system it should have.
PiS says the bill, which was rejected by the opposition-controlled Senate, is necessary to avoid chaos in the legal system, as some judges have started questioning the legality of the appointment of others.
But Brussels, human rights activists and lawyers believe the bill is designed to stop criticism of the government's wide-ranging reforms, which they say aim to increase government control over the judiciary."

The U.S. Treasury Department said it imposed sanctions on the Hong Kong-based Triliance Petrochemical Co. Ltd and Sage Energy HK Limited, China-based Peakview Industry Co Ltd and United Arab Emirates-based Beneathco DMCC.
The sanctions would freeze all assets held by the companies that fall under U.S. jurisdiction, generally bar U.S. companies and individuals from dealing with them, and potentially subject non-U.S. financial institutions that knowingly facilitate ""significant transactions"" for them to U.S. sanctions.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's administration rolled out a new rule on Thursday that aims to limit ""birth tourism"" by women who enter the United States on tourist visas with the intention of obtaining citizenship for their babies born on American soil.
Under the State Department regulation, which will take effect on Friday, pregnant women applying for visitor visas could be required to prove they have a specific reason for travel beyond giving birth, such as a medical necessity.
Trump faces re-election in November and has made restricting legal and illegal immigration a focus of his 2020 campaign. During his presidency, he has criticized the right to citizenship for any person born in the United States, which applies even to children born to tourists. But scrapping that right would require a change in the U.S. Constitution.
No U.S. law bars foreign women from traveling to the United States to give birth, although consular officers previously could require visitors to prove they have the financial means to pay for a medical procedure if that is the reason for the trip.
In some cases, alleged operators and customers of companies promoting ""birth tourism"" in the United States have been charged with providing false information to immigration authorities in order to conceal plans to give birth in the United States. 
A State Department official said in an emailed statement that the new rule aims to address national security risks, including criminal activity associated with the industry for birth-related trips.
The final rule says consular officers must scrutinize female travelers to determine whether they might be pregnant, but does not explain how officers will make such determinations. 
The State Department official said U.S. officials will not ask all female visa applicants if they are pregnant, or intend to become pregnant, but instead will only raise the issue if they have ""a specific articulable reason"" to believe the sole purpose of the U.S. visit is to give birth. 
But critics worried the new rule could lead to discrimination. 
""It is absurd that the Trump administration is turning embassy employees into reproductive policemen,"" Kerri Talbot, a director with the Immigration Hub, a Washington-based advocacy organization, said on Thursday. ""Women will have to conceal their pregnancies just to get a tourist visa to visit the U.S.""
Statistics from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) show that approximately 9,300 children were born in the United States to mothers who live overseas in 2017, with an additional 900 born in U.S. territories. However, the CDC did not examine births to tourists specifically.

The State Department said that precisely estimating the number of individuals who give birth in the United States after entering the country on tourist visas ""is challenging"" since the agency does not publish data regarding applicants' reasons for travel. But the agency said there were increasing reports of the practice from U.S. embassies and consulates abroad.

Among the group, mostly Chihuahuas and Pomeranians, police found two dead animals whose frozen bodies had been wrapped in newspaper. Police said the breeders had cut some of the dogs' vocal chords, possibly to prevent them from barking and alerting neighbors. 
Two of the five people arrested were veterinarians who helped give the operation a veil of legitimacy by providing stamped certificates and fitting the dogs with identification microchips.
The group had become one of Europe's largest distributors of Chihuahuas and Pomeranians and sold dogs across Spain, using social media to market the animals. Police believe the group generated profits of more than 2 million euros ($2.22 million) over more than a decade in operation.
The dogs, many of them found three-to-a-cage in cramped suburban basements, are now in the care of various animal charities, awaiting a court decision on their fate.

Visibly upset, Duterte vented his anger over the U.S. decision to deny entry to Ronaldo dela Rosa, a former police chief who is now a senator.
Dela Rosa said the U.S. embassy in the Philippines did not explain why his visa had been canceled but that he believed it was most likely because of allegations of extrajudicial killings during his more than two-year term as police chief.
Dela Rosa was the chief enforcer of Duterte's anti-narcotics crackdown, which has resulted in deaths of more than 5,000 people, mostly small-time drug dealers. Police say victims were shot by officers in self-defense.
""If you do not do the correction, one, I will terminate the bases, the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA). I will finish that son of a bitch,"" Duterte said in a wide-ranging speech before former Communist rebels. ""I am giving the government and the American government one month from now.""
The Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), signed in 1998, accorded legal status to thousands of U.S. troops who were rotated in the country for military exercises and humanitarian assistance operations.
Delfin Lorezana, Duterte's defense minister, declined to comment when asked if he agreed with the president's plan.
Duterte makes no secret of his disdain for the United States and what he considers its hypocrisy and interference, though he acknowledges that most Filipinos and his military have high regard for their country's former colonial ruler.
The United States is the Philippines' biggest defense ally and millions of Filipinos have relatives who are U.S. citizens.
Last month, Duterte banned U.S. senators Richard Durbin and Patrick Leahy from visiting the Philippines after they introduced a provision in the U.S. Congress.
The provision calls the ban on U.S. entry to anyone involved in locking up Philippine senator Leila de Lima, a former justice minister and Duterte's top critic who was jailed in 2017 on drug charges after leading an investigation into thousands of deaths during the anti-narcotics campaign.

After Britain formally leaves the EU on Jan. 31, it enters a transition period until the end of 2020 during which it will remain an EU member in all but name while both sides try to hammer out a deal on their future relationship.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists he will not seek an extension of the transition period. That leaves a tight deadline to avoid a potentially damaging ""no-deal"" outcome at the end of the year.
An agreement would have to be struck by the middle of October to leave time needed to translate the treaty into the EU's 23 official languages and the possible need for ratification in the bloc's parliaments before year-end.
A senior diplomat said he expects little progress in negotiations between the European Commission and Britain in the months ahead, and there will be just a few weeks left after the Brussels summer break to get a deal across the line.
""Usually in the EU things don't get moving until there is a real crisis,"" the diplomat said on Thursday.
Diplomats said an agreement would have to include deals on aviation, transport and fisheries, a politically thorny issue - and one where London could have the upper hand in negotiations because, after Brexit, fishing boats from EU countries will no longer be able to operate in British waters as they do now.
SWISS MODEL RULED OUT
They said other elements could be negotiated and added later because only a ""bare bones"" deal is possible in such a short time.
The EU does not want to replicate its arrangement with Switzerland, with which it has more than 100 bilateral agreements to cover various aspects of the relationship.
""The idea is to have one treaty by end-2020, which would also have a governance structure and an openness to add supplementary treaties,"" an EU diplomat involved in the talks said.
The EU is worried that once out of the bloc, Britain may try to undercut EU firms by lowering labor or environmental standards or by subsidizing certain industries.
To prevent that, the EU wants a non-regression clause in the new relationship treaty and a joint committee with London that would consider realignments of British rules if EU standards change.
""The more aligned Britain's rules are with the EU's, the better access it will have to the EU's single market,"" an EU official said.
If Britain were to lower its labor, tax, state aid or environmental standards to gain a competitive advantage over EU firms, the EU could revoke its easy access to its market by imposing tariffs, the diplomats said.
If the future relationship treaty only deals with purely EU competencies like trade or fisheries, it could be ratified by the European Parliament only, making the process faster and simpler.
But if it includes agreements on aviation, security, transport of mobility of citizens - areas of competence of EU member state governments - national parliaments would have to have a say, increasing the risk of delays and a ""no deal"".

386,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 11:45AM ET</span>",U.S. to send ambassador to Bolivia for first time in over a decade,"MIAMI/LA PAZ (Reuters) - The United States intends to send an ambassador to Bolivia to help restore a ""normal relationship"" between the two countries, Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs David Hale said in a video statement posted online on Thursday.
The move, which would mark the return of a U.S. ambassador to La Paz for the first time in over a decade, underscores rapidly improving relations since the current interim government took over after the resignation of leftist leader Evo Morales.
The United States has had a lower-ranking diplomat in the South American country since Morales ordered the last ambassador Philip Goldberg to leave in 2008, blaming him for opposition protests against his rule.
Morales stepped down under pressure in November after a disputed election sparked widespread protests and led to allies and security forces pulling their support. Morales contends he was toppled in a coup, orchestrated by the United States.
Hale said in the video statement posted on the U.S. embassy website that he welcomed the new opportunity to ""strengthen our relationship and mutual understanding.""
""As the next step the United States will once again send an ambassador to La Paz to continue these conversations and restore a normal relationship between our people,"" he said.
Bolivia's conservative caretaker President Jeanine Anez has looked to draw a line under the foreign policies of Morales' administration, shifting away from old allies like Venezuela and Cuba and rekindling ties with the United States.
The country is now heading toward new elections in May, with Morales' socialist party looking to run without him for the first time in 14 years against a range of opposition candidates.
""This is a critical time for Bolivia and the Bolivian people as you work towards free and fair elections on May 3,"" Hale said. ""This is an opportunity to build a foundation for a stable, secure, prospering and democratic Bolivia.""

Jeffrey said U.S.-led coalition operations have been on pause in Iraq as the focus has been on force protection and talks with the Baghdad government on the way forward after Iraq's parliament voted to expel foreign troops.
The lawmakers were furious at the Jan. 3 drone strike on Iraqi soil that killed Soleimani, the architect of Iran’s drive to extend its influence across the region, and Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.
""We have not seen an uptick in violence in Iraq by Daesh in this period,"" Jeffrey told reporters at the State Department, using a term for Islamic State.
Jeffrey said officials will meet in Copenhagen on Wednesday to discuss the way forward in the U.S.-led operation against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
""The coalition is very, very much committed to this mission,"" Jeffrey said.
Jeffrey acknowledged the pause in Iraq could hamper the fight against Islamic State if it continues.

""Over time, obviously there is a possibility of a degradation of the effort against Daesh if we're not able to do the things that we were doing so effectively up until a few weeks ago,"" he said.

388,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 11:20AM ET</span>",Russia says it missed U.N. deadline to repatriate North Korean workers,"By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia said on Thursday it had missed a United Nations deadline to repatriate North Korean workers due to what it called objective difficulties, but said it was scrupulously complying with U.N. sanctions on Pyongyang.
A 2017 U.N. Security Council resolution demanded that all countries send home all North Korean workers by Dec. 22 last year to stop them earning foreign currency for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
The United States has estimated Pyongyang was earning more than $500 million a year from nearly 100,000 workers abroad, of which some 50,000 were in China and 30,000 in Russia.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told reporters on Thursday that Moscow had missed the U.N. deadline and that around 1,000 North Korean workers were still in Russia.
She said it had proved impossible for all of the workers to leave by the deadline because of limited transport options. There were only two flights a week between Russia and North Korea operated by one airline, she said, and limited train connections.
Zakharova said Moscow was rigorously complying with U.N. sanctions on North Korea nonetheless.
""The majority of North Korean workers have left our country. The rest, about 1,000 people, are in reality no longer workers since their work permits have expired and they don't receive income in Russia,"" said Zakharova.
She said North Korean officials were taking measures to organize the departure of the remainder of their own citizens.
""It wasn't possible due to objective difficulties to send everyone home by Dec. 22,"" said Zakharova.
Russian Interior Ministry statistics released on Wednesday showed that the number of tourist and student visas issued by Russia to North Koreans surged last year.
The data showed Russia issued 16,613 tourist and 10,345 student visas. That compared with 2,035 tourist and 2,610 student visas granted to North Koreans in 2018. 
Experts suspect that many of those issued tourist visas are working illegally in Russia. 
Moscow and Beijing pushed unsuccessfully in the United Nations in December for a raft of sanctions on North Korea to be lifted.
The Chinese and Russian proposal would have lifted a ban on North Korea exporting statues, seafood and textiles, and have eased restrictions on infrastructure projects and North Koreans working overseas, according to the draft seen by Reuters. 

A senior U.S. official said on Wednesday China had also failed to send home North Korean workers by the December deadline, saying that was why Washington had blacklisted two entities involved in Pyongyang’s labor export.

Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has been rocked by more than seven months of protests. Initially sparked by a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent to China for trial, they have since morphed into a broader revolt against Beijing's rule.
The sculpture, which weighs around three tonnes, depicts 15 bodies twisted around each other. Its plinth bears the messages ""Denmark stands with Hong Kong"" and ""The old cannot kill the young forever"".
""This represents... support from the Danish people to the struggle in Hong Kong, to keep democracy and freedom of expression,"" Danish sculptor Jens Galschioet told Reuters TV.
He produced the sculpture in collaboration with a Danish political party, the environmentalist Alternative, and the Danish wing of the human rights group Amnesty International.
On poles around the base of the statue are sculptures of protesters' heads, complete with yellow helmets and gas masks, which Galschioet said the protesters had sent him.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 with sweeping promises of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms.
But the protesters say Beijing has failed to honor its commitments and say the rule of law and democratic freedoms are being eroded. Beijing denies meddling in Hong Kong and blames the West for stirring up trouble."

SOFIA (Reuters) - Bulgarian prosecutors have charged three Russians with the attempted murder of three men whose poisoning is being investigated by Sofia for possible links with the 2018 nerve-agent attack on ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal.
The prosecutors did not name the three Russians, but said European arrest warrants had been issued and that they would seek their extradition to Bulgaria. 
The three are accused of trying to kill arms factory owner and trader Emilian Gebrev and two other Bulgarians in Sofia between April 28 and May 4, 2015 by ""intoxication with an unidentified organophosphorus substance,"" the prosecutors said in a statement. 
They said the method used was ""dangerous to the lives of many"".
Gebrev and the two other victims fell ill but survived. 
The investigation into the poisoning was reopened in 2018 after Gebrev told prosecutors he had reason to believe the substance used on him might have been similar to Novichok, the nerve agent used against Skripal in Salisbury in England. 
In February last year, Bulgaria said it was investigating a possible link between their poisoning and the attack on Skripal and his daughter, both of whom survived.
At the time, prosecutors said a Russian man by the name of Sergei Fedotov visited Bulgaria three times in 2015 and was there in April when Gebrev was poisoned.
In October 2018, Russian news website Fontanka named Fedotov, who it said worked for the country's GRU military intelligence service, as a suspect in the Skripal case. 
Moscow never comments on the identity of GRU staff, but has denied involvement in the poisoning of Skripal. 
A Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman declined to give detailed comment on Thursday but said the Russian embassy in Bulgaria was probably following developments. 
Investigative website Bellingcat has said Fedotov was an alias for a GRU officer called Denis Sergeev. 
In December, Sotir Tsatsarov, at the time Bulgaria's chief prosecutor, said he saw a close link between the people involved in the crimes in Bulgaria and England as a suspect in the Skripal case was in Sofia when Gebrev was poisoned. 

The Bulgarian prosecutors have said they are cooperating with the FBI and Britain on the investigation.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani said on Thursday that Pakistan continued to give sanctuary to an insurgent group that helps the Taliban in its war against Kabul and the United States, directly contradicting an earlier statement by Pakistan's prime minister.
On Wednesday, Prime Minister Imran Khan of Pakistan told reporters at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, that the Haqqani network, which the United States has designated as a terrorist group, had no activities or bases in Pakistan.
""And you believed him?"" Ghani, also at Davos, asked on Thursday. ""One can also say that the earth does not revolve around the sun.""
""This is a denial that is not helpful. We need to engage in a constructive engagement where the special relation between the Taliban and Pakistan ends. It is good for both countries and it is good for the region and the world.""
Reuters has contacted Pakistan's Foreign Ministry for comment.
Ghani also said that talks between the United States and the Taliban showed few signs of progress.
Afghanistan has long said it wants a full ceasefire before Kabul will join the talks.
""The outcome the public seeks is an end to violence,"" he said. ""We want to see that the Taliban accepts a political process.""
Ghani, who has led Afghanistan for six years, said that there was no chance the country would collapse when the United States withdraws its troops, as President Donald Trump has promised to do.
Violence in Afghanistan has increased in the past three years. But Ghani said his country's military forces are stronger than they were.
""The majority of the world thought we would collapse (following the withdrawal of 100,000 NATO troops in 2014),"" he said. ""Our military forces will not collapse.""
""The capacity to uphold the state has been created.""
While Afghanistan has seen four decades of conflict, the president said the country's biggest challenge was the environment.
""The elephant in the room is the environment, even more than conflict,"" Ghani said.
Warning that global warming, access to clean water and other environmental threats could push hundreds of millions around the world back into poverty, Ghani urged a regional approach to tackling climate change and said the environment could unite South Asia much as the community of steel and coal did Europe.
""Everybody is responsible (for dealing with climate change),"" he said. ""Nobody is innocent.""

The Greek justice minister had in December ordered the extradition of Alexander Vinnik, who is accused of masterminding a $4 billion bitcoin laundering ring and is wanted by both France and the United States.
Vinnik's lawyer called the decision unfair and appealed against it, calling the move ""a death sentence"", while the detained 40-year-old Russian launched a hunger strike.
But the top administrative court concluded the minister had the authority to make the decision, the judicial official said. The higher court ruling cannot be further appealed in Greece.
U.S. authorities accuse Vinnik of running BTC-e - a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin - to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011.
Vinnik has denied the charges, saying he was a technical consultant to BTC-e and not its operator.
Since his arrest in a village in northern Greece in 2017, Moscow has requested that Vinnik be returned home, as it has done before with other nationals wanted by the United States.
The Greek ministerial decision mentioned that a second destination should be the United States and lastly Russia, meaning that when Vinnik's judicial proceedings are done in France he could be extradited further to the United States.
Vinnik has agreed to be returned to Russia, where he is wanted on lesser fraud charges amounting to 10,000 euros."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The Vatican has been fully re-admitted to the Egmont Group of world financial intelligence units after a suspension two months ago sparked by an investigation into the purchase of luxury London real estate.
Carmelo Barbagallo, president of the Vatican's Financial Information Authority (AIF), said on Thursday the AIF would ""resume its collaboration with foreign financial intelligence units in full transparency and in the spirit of active cooperation"".
The Egmont Group's president, Mariano Federici, had notified the AIF that it had been re-admitted to the use of Egmont's secure communications network, Barbagallo said in a statement. 
Egmont is a Toronto-based informal organization with about 165 members. Its secure network allows members to share information about crimes such as money laundering, tax fraud and terrorism financing.
Egmont’s acceptance of the Vatican six years ago was seen as a major step forward in cleaning up the Vatican’s negative image following years of scandals, particularly involving its bank. 
The suspension on Nov. 13 was a major setback for the Vatican, which risked again being seen as a pariah by the international financial community.
On Oct. 1, Vatican police entered the offices of the AIF and of the Secretariat of State - the administrative heart of the Catholic Church - as part of their investigation of an investment the Secretariat had made in London real estate.
The officers, operating under a search warrant secured by the Vatican’s own prosecutor, seized documents, computers and cellphones during the raids.
The raid prompted concerns in the international financial community about the AIF’s ability to keep confidential documents secure and led to the suspension from Egmont.
The suspension was lifted after the signing of a memorandum of understanding with Vatican prosecutors, the AIF statement said.
Barbagallo, 63, a respected senior Bank of Italy official, was appointed by Pope Francis in November to succeed Swiss lawyer and anti-money laundering expert Rene Bruelhart.
Bruelhart had headed the AIF for five years and the pope decided not to renew his mandate.
Five Vatican employees were suspended after the Oct. 1 raids, including AIF director Tommaso di Ruzza.

Domenico Giani, Vatican security chief and the pope's bodyguard, resigned later over the leak of a document related to the investigation.

""Libya's neighbors have the responsibility to facilitate a political solution,"" he added before the start of his meeting with foreign ministers or other officials from Egypt, Tunisia, Chad, Niger, Sudan and Mali. 
Heiko Maas, the foreign minister of Germany, which hosted a summit on the Libyan crisis on Sunday, also joined the meeting. 
The eastern Libyan military commander Khalifa Haftar launched an assault last year with his Libyan National Army (LNA) to capture Tripoli with backing from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russian mercenaries and African troops. 
The internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) is backed by Turkey, which has sent military advisers and trainers to help its armed forces ward off Haftar's attack. 
In Berlin, foreign powers active in Libya agreed to shore up a shaky ceasefire but the meeting was overshadowed by Haftar's blockade of energy fields.
The conflict's recent escalation has alarmed some of Libya's neighbors, who fear it may provide more space for armed militant groups to operate across the Sahara and the Sahel region. 
""The Sahel is suffering from this crisis. Proliferation of arms in the region has facilitated the spread of terrorism,"" said Chad's Foreign Minister Mahamet Zene Cherif. 
Tunisia, located between Algeria and Libya, is also concerned about a possible influx of refugees. It was not initially invited to the Berlin summit this month, causing anger among many Tunisian politicians.

Angola has named dos Santos, the daughter of former President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and reputedly Africa's richest woman, as a suspect over alleged mismanagement and misappropriation of funds while she was chairwoman of state oil firm Sonangol in 2016-2017. She denies wrongdoing.
""At this moment, the concern is to notify (the suspects) and assure that they voluntarily come to face justice,"" Helder Pitta Gros said in Luanda late on Wednesday before traveling to Lisbon on Thursday, according to Portugal's Lusa news agency. 
Failing that, his office would resort to legal instruments at its disposal, one being an international warrant.
Portuguese newspaper Expresso said several people linked to dos Santos were also named as formal suspects, including Nuno Ribeiro da Cunha, director of private banking at small Portuguese lender Eurobic and manager of Angola's oil firm Sonangol's account at the bank.
Police said on Thursday Ribeiro da Cunha was found dead at the garage of his house in Lisbon on Wednesday night, after apparently committing suicide by hanging. He had tried to commit suicide earlier this month, police said. 
No one at Eurobic was immediately available for comment. Eurobic, in which dos Santos has owned a large stake, said on Thursday she had decided to sell the stake. 
Mario Leite da Silva, who resigned as chairman of Banco de Fomento Angola (BFA) on Monday, was also named a formal suspect by Angola's public prosecutors. Silva could not immediately be reached for comment. 
'TAKE ACTION' 
In his resignation letter, which was seen by Reuters, Silva made no reference to recent events linked to dos Santos, citing instead a December decision by BFA's controlling shareholder Unitel not to name him among board members for the next three years.
Telecoms firm Unitel is part-owned by dos Santos. Portuguese Banco BPI , a unit of Spain's Caixabank (MC:CABK), is another major shareholder in BFA.
Separately, auditors PwC said the firm had ""taken action to terminate any ongoing work for entities controlled by members of the dos Santos family"" following what it said were ""very serious and concerning allegations"", and had begun an inquiry.
Isabel dos Santos, who amassed her fortune during her father's decades-long presidency, has said allegations against her are politically motivated. She could not immediately be reached for further comment on Thursday.
In Portugal, Angola's former colonial power, dos Santos holds significant stakes in several major firms including NOS and oil firm Galp Energia. Pitta Gros arrived in Lisbon on Thursday to meet his Portuguese counterpart Lucilia Gago.
He told reporters upon arrival he would seek help from the Portuguese prosecutor's office ""on many matters"", but would not comment specifically on the dos Santos case. 
Angolan authorities froze dos Santos' assets there in late December. On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of files about dos Santos that were obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) were released by several news organizations. 

The media reports focused on alleged financial schemes used by dos Santos to build her business empire, including transfers between Angola and Dubai. Dos Santos, who has been living abroad, said on Sunday that allegations made against her were ""completely unfounded"".

Varadkar said for the first time on Wednesday that he would consider entering an unprecedented coalition government with the country's second-largest party and historic rival if the election produced an inconclusive result.
Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin rebuffed a similar offer from Varadkar's predecessor, Enda Kenny, after Fine Gael emerged as the bigger party following the last election in 2016. Fianna Fail instead entered a co-operation deal to facilitate a Fine Gael-led minority administration from opposition.
""Our response is we will not be in a grand coalition, people want change in this country, they want Fine Gael out of office. I've made it clear we have, we want to go into government with other center parties, clearly Labour and the Green Party would be ones we'd be interested in,"" Martin told reporters.
""For the last four or five months we've had Leo Varadkar and Fine Gael attacking Fianna Fail, demonizing Fianna Fail and then hey presto, overnight, you know what we'll go into government with Fianna Fail. That doesn't make sense to the public, I don't think it has credibility.""
Fine Gael trails its fellow center-right rival in opinion polls that suggest whichever party finishes on top on Feb. 8 would struggle to form a coalition government with a collection of smaller parties.
As both refuse to govern with the third-largest party, Sinn Fein, that leaves another minority government where one of the main parties props up the other from the opposition benches as the only alternative to a grand coalition."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - The European Union will not agree to a political solution to Libya's factional conflict unless Turkey and Libya abandon a maritime accord they signed in November, Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Thursday.
Libya's internationally recognized prime minister, Fayez al-Serraj, said this week that his country will face a ""catastrophic situation"" unless foreign powers put pressure on eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar to lift a blockade of oilfields that has cut output to almost zero.
Serraj inked an agreement with Turkey in November that seeks to create an exclusive economic zone from Turkey's southern Mediterranean shore to Libya's northeast coast. It carves out a slanting sea corridor, potentially clearing the way for oil and gas exploration in the area.
Greece, which is at odds with Turkey over decades-old issues ranging from mineral rights in the Aegean Sea to ethnically-split Cyprus, says the accord is void and violates the international law of the sea.
Athens sees it as a cynical grab designed to scupper the development of East Mediterranean gas and destabilize rivals.
""I have made it very clear to everyone concerned that there is not going to be a political solution in Libya to which the EU will have to agree, where will agree, unless these agreements are scrapped,"" Mitsotakis told a conference panel at the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland.
The EU also opposes Turkey's and Libya's maritime deal. European Council President Charles Michel said this month he told Sarraj that the agreement ""infringes upon the sovereign rights of third states and does not comply with the (United Nations) Law of the Sea.""
Libya has been torn by civil strife since dictator Muammar Gaddafi’s fall to a NATO-backed uprising in 2011. Haftar, who was a general in Gaddafi's army and whose forces hold much of Libya’s east and south, has made a renewed attempt to capture Tripoli, the capital located in the northwest.
The stakes are high - lawlessness in Libya has in recent years disrupted the OPEC member’s oil output, fueled migrant smuggling to Europe and given space to Islamist extremists.
""We all know that this agreement was signed in exchange for Turkey's military support to the Serraj government, and, on top of that, it's an agreement that has not been recognized by the Libyan legislature,"" Mitsotakis said."

The houses are being erected near a Syrian village next to the Turkish border, an area so far spared from the air strikes and fighting which have uprooted hundreds of thousands of people.
Syrian and Russian forces have bombarded rebel-controlled targets in Idlib this week despite a deal between Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides in the conflict, for a Jan. 12 ceasefire. On Thursday Russia said hundreds of Syrian militants launched attacks on Syrian government forces in Idlib.
Turkey already hosts more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees and fears that the fighting in Idlib - the last notable rebel stronghold in Syria after almost nine years of conflict - could drive millions more across the border.
But last week Ankara suggested it could reach a deal with Moscow to prevent another refugee wave.
Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said the two countries were discussing the establishment of a secure zone in Idlib to host the displaced Syrians over the winter.
Turkish aid group Humanitarian Relief Foundation (IHH) said that more than 450,000 people had fled toward the Turkish border over the past five months and that it was aiming to build 10,000 houses around 5 km (3 miles) from the frontier.
""We provide food and clothes to the families on the migrant trail, but we also need to provide them shelter throughout the winter months,"" IHH Deputy Chairman Serkan Nergis said.
Nergis said the houses would provide better shelter than the existing tent camps near the border. The houses ""will begin hosting their guests in a few days"", with the goal of accommodating 60,000 people, Nergis said.
Images from the project showed several rows of houses under construction next to the tents currently housing the displaced Syrians, in Idlib's Kafr Lusin region, near the Turkish border.
Turkey's Kizilay aid group also said this week it will build 1,000 emergency housing units in Idlib, which would be completed in 2-3 weeks.
President Tayyip Erdogan said last week Turkey was working to provide better conditions for the displaced Syrians in Idlib during the freezing winter."

Assange, 48, faces 18 counts in the United States including conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He could spend decades in prison if convicted.
Following applications from Assange’s legal team and lawyers representing the United States, Judge Vanessa Baraitser at Westminster Magistrates' Court agreed that his extradition hearing would start on Feb. 24 for a week, with the remaining three weeks taking place from May 18.
Both sides in the case argued that they needed more time to prepare for the hearings and gather evidence. Assange's lawyers said it was hard to speak to their client, who is currently being held at Belmarsh Prison in east London and appeared on Thursday by videolink. 
""We simply can't get in as we require to see Mr Assange and take instructions ... we need time to deal with that,"" his lawyer Edward Fitzgerald said.
The first part of the full hearing in February at Woolwich Crown Court will cover arguments that the extradition is politically motivated and an abuse of process.
Clair Dobbin, the lawyer representing the U.S. authorities, said they would oppose allowing Assange to call anonymous witnesses as his legal team intends. The hearing will also hear psychiatric evidence about his mental state. 
To some, Assange is a hero for exposing what supporters cast as abuse of power by modern states and for championing free speech. To others, he is a dangerous rebel who has undermined U.S. security by WikiLeaks having published hundreds of thousands of secret U.S. cables.
In 2012, Assange took refuge in Ecuador’s London embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden where he was accused of sex crimes which he denied and which were later dropped, saying he feared he would ultimately be sent on to the United Sates.
After seven years, he was dragged from the embassy in 2019 and jailed for 50 weeks for skipping bail before the U.S. launched its extradition request.

Baraitser was clearly unhappy about the ""lengthy"" three-month delay to the hearing but reluctantly agreed, telling both sides they would need to stick to the amended timetable.

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services attributed the change to the termination in October 2018 of a treaty of amity with Iran, which is the target of U.S. sanctions over its nuclear and missile programs.
The E-1 and E-2 nomimmigrant visas allow citizens of other countries to be admitted into the United States to engage in international trade or to invest a large sum of capital.
Iranians are no longer eligible for such visas, the service said. Those already in the country with these visas must leave once their authorized stay expires, it said. It was not clear how many Iranians will be affected.
The little-known agreement was signed long before Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution that turned the two countries into archenemies.
President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers in May 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran. The U.S. killing this month of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and an exchange of military strikes has raised tensions to a new level."

Gunter Demnig, 72, has set the plaques, called Stolpersteine, or ""stumble stones"", in 26 countries, and he laid his 75,000th such stone last month, in the town of Memmingen in southern Germany.
Demnig, from Cologne, sets the stones outside homes of victims of Nazi persecution. They aim to remind passers-by of the Nazis' systematic persecution of ethnic and other minorities, mainly Jews, but also homosexuals, the disabled, political dissidents and Roma.
""An evangelical pastor in Cologne said to me 'Gunter, you'll never manage (to honor) the millions. But one can start small'. And 75,000 as a symbol is already something,"" Demnig told Reuters after a trip to set more plaques in Italy.
By tying a victim's fate to a capsule biography, the 'stumble stones' seek to reduce the epic scale of the Holocaust to a more comprehensible human story.
Demnig has already set stones in 26 countries - including Austria, Greece, Poland, the Netherlands, Romania, Switzerland and Ukraine - and plans to add Serbia to the list in August."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday France was determined to combat the hatred and intolerance that have fueled a sharp rise in anti-Semitism in his country as he met Holocaust survivors during a visit to Israel.
Macron is one of dozens of world leaders attending events at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem to mark the 75-year anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.
""The dark shadow of anti-Semitism is being reborn,"" Macron told members of the roughly 100,000 French-Israeli citizens.
""Anti-Semitism is back. It is here and its cortege of intolerance and hate is here. France won't accept.""
""I responded to the call to come to Yad Vashem to say this shall never happen again. It's a battle that is never won,"" Macron said. ""My determination to act on this is total.""
Earlier on Thursday, Macron met French survivors of the Holocaust at a memorial near Jerusalem to some 76,000 Jews who were arrested in France during World War Two and transported in terrible conditions in railway boxcars to death camps such as Auschwitz, where most died.
In 1995 France’s then-president, Jacques Chirac, officially acknowledged for the first time French complicity in the wartime deportations. But it was only in 2009 that France’s highest court recognized the state’s responsibility.
A survey published on Tuesday by French think-tank Fondapol and the American Jewish Committee found that 70 percent of Jews living in France today had been victims of anti-Semitism.
France has Europe’s biggest Jewish community - around 550,000 - and anti-Semitic acts have risen by 70 percent in each of the last two years. More than 500 were reported in 2018 alone.
Last month, scores of Jewish graves were found desecrated in a cemetery in eastern France, hours before lawmakers adopted a resolution equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism.
""UNCERTAIN FUTURE""
Commentators have blamed the surge in anti-Semitic attacks on incitement by Islamist preachers, others on the rise of anti-Zionism - opposition to the existence of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people.
Macron and the French survivors of the Holocaust were joined by young college students at a solemn ceremony at the Roglit memorial, west of Jerusalem, to remember the French Jews deported between 1942-1944.
Serge Klarsfeld, an 84-year-old Nazi hunter, welcomed the participation of Macron and the young people in the ceremony.
""Your presence today with the education minister and the children from the banlieues (suburbs) who are bravely engaged in studying the Shoah and drawing the consequences touches us deeply and allows us to look with hope toward an uncertain future,"" said Klarsfeld."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China put on lockdown on Thursday two cities at the epicenter of a new coronavirus outbreak that has killed 17 people and infected nearly 600, as health authorities around the world scramble to prevent a global pandemic.
Health officials fear the transmission rate will accelerate as hundreds of millions of Chinese travel at home and abroad during week-long holidays for the Lunar New Year, which begins on Saturday.
The previously unknown virus strain is believed to have emerged late last year from illegally traded wildlife at an animal market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Most transport in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, was suspended on Thursday morning and people were told not to leave. Hours later, neighboring Huanggang, a city of some 7 million people, announced a similar lockdown.
""The lockdown of 11 million people is unprecedented in public health history, so it is certainly not a recommendation the WHO has made,"" Gauden Galea, the World Health Organization's representative in Beijing, told Reuters
There is no vaccine for the virus, which can spread through respiratory transmission. Symptoms include fever, difficulty in breathing and cough, similar to many other respiratory illnesses.
Preliminary research suggested the virus was passed on to humans from snakes, but government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has also identified badgers and rats as possible sources.
The WHO has said it will decide on Thursday whether to declare the outbreak a global health emergency, which would step up the international response.
If it does so, it will be the sixth international public health emergency to be declared in the last decade. A WHO news conference is expected some time after 1800 GMT. 
Chinese authorities gave no new details on the numbers of virus infections but it has been reported in Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong, and several other countries including the United States, stoking fears it is already spreading worldwide. 
WUHAN LOCKDOWN
Wuhan's city government said it would shut down all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from 10 a.m. (0200 GMT). Domestic media said some airlines were operating after the deadline, however.
State media broadcast images of one of Wuhan's transport hubs, the Hankou rail station, nearly deserted, with gates blocked or barred. The government urged citizens not to leave the city.
State media reported highway toll booths around Wuhan were closing down, which would effectively cut off road exits. Guards were patrolling major highways, one resident told Reuters.
As the city slipped into isolation, residents thronged into hospitals for checks and scrambled for supplies, clearing out supermarket shelves and queuing for petrol.
Authorities in Huanggang ordered indoor entertainment venues including cinemas and internet cafes to close and were asking citizens not to leave other than under special circumstances.
Authorities had confirmed 571 cases and 17 deaths by the end of Wednesday, China's National Health Commission said. Earlier, it said another 393 suspected cases had been reported. 
Of eight known cases worldwide, Thailand has confirmed four, while Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and the United States have reported one each.
In a report on Wednesday, Imperial College London said it estimated a total of 4,000 cases of the coronavirus in Wuhan alone as of Jan. 18, an infection rate based on the number of cases reported in China and elsewhere.In contrast with its secrecy over the 2002-03 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that killed nearly 800 people, China's Communist Party government has provided regular updates to avoid panic ahead of the holidays.
During a visit to Wuhan, Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said authorities needed to be open about the virus and efforts to contain it, the official Xinhua news agency said.
FACE MASKS
Some experts believe the new virus is not as dangerous as previous coronaviruses such as SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which has killed more than 700 people since 2012.
""The early evidence at this stage would suggest it's not as severe,"" Australia's Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy told reporters.
Despite China's response, stock markets across Asia were on the back foot on Thursday, led by drops of roughly 1.5% in Hong Kong and Shanghai while China's yuan fell to a two-week low. 
The economic impact of such outbreaks are hard to quantify but a 2006 estimate by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) calculated that SARS shaved just over 1 percentage point off the GDP of China in 2003.
Many Chinese were cancelling trips, buying face masks and avoiding cinemas and shopping centers, and even turning to an online plague simulation game as a way to cope.
The release of seven movies over the Lunar New Year has been postponed. The holiday is the high season for distributors and cinemas attract huge crowds.
In Beijing, neighborhood authorities called residents to ask if they had any recent visitors from Wuhan, a resident said. 
Airports globally stepped up screening of passengers from China and the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention said the further global spread of the virus was likely.
""Obviously this is a huge concern for the world,"" Britain's business minister, Andrea Leadsom, told Sky.

ATHENS (Reuters) - Mayors of three Greek islands bearing the brunt of intensely overcrowded refugee and migrant camps demanded the transfer of thousands to the country's mainland during a meeting with the new migration minister in Athens on Thursday.
During a second day of protests over the plight of the camps and the conservative government's plans to replace them with holding centers, the mayors of Lesbos, Samos and Chios pressed for a swift resolution to the problem.
Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said after the meeting that the concerns were justified as the migrant crisis has placed a heavy burden on island communities.
""Our priorities include the decongestion of islands, the reduction of migrant inflows, their (migrants') return to Turkey and trust-building measures between the central government and the islands,"" Mitarachi told reporters.
On Wednesday island shops remained shut and public services disrupted by a walkout as part of the protest.
Greece, via neighboring Turkey, was the main gateway into the European Union for more than a million mainly Middle East and Asian migrants fleeing conflict in 2015-16.
Last year, 59,726 migrants and refugees reached Greek shores, according to the U.N. refugee agency UNHCR. Nearly 80% of them arrived on Lesbos, Chios or Samos, which lie in Aegean waters not far from the coast of Turkey.
Athens has repeatedly called for a cohesive policy from its European Union partners to ensure an equitable distribution of challenges posed by arriving refugees and migrants.
Other EU states have been loath to accept significantly more migrants since the 2015-16 crisis. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has promised to present a proposal for a revamp of EU migration policies next spring.
Last year the Greek government pledged to shut overcrowded refugee camps on its outlying islands and replace them with more restrictive holding centers, in a marked hardening of its stance toward asylum seekers.
Aid groups have described the living conditions of about 36,000 people in camps operating far beyond their capacity as appalling. The Moria camp on Lesbos, set up to accommodate 3,000 people, hosts at least five times that number.
Medical assistance group Doctors Without Borders (MSF) on Thursday accused the Greek government of ""deliberately depriving"" at least 140 children with life-threatening diseases in Moria on Lesbos of adequate medical care.
""We see many children suffering diabetes, asthma, heart disease, who are forced to live in tents, in abysmal, unhygienic conditions, with no access to the specialized medical care and medication they need,"" said Hilde Vochten, MSF's medical coordinator in Greece."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Dozens of activists held a rare protest on Thursday over air pollution in Bangkok, a day after Thai officials closed schools due to concern over the impact.
Levels of air pollution in the capital, the world's most visited city, have hovered at unhealthy levels over the past month - over 100 on the air quality index.
The index breached the 151 threshold seen as dangerously unhealthy for the general public late last week, and continued to climb until it hit 163 on Monday, according to monitor AirVisual.
Schools were closed for the day on Wednesday, and by Thursday the index dropped back to 121.
The activists, wearing pollution masks, said they were marching to the Government House because of authorities' inaction.
""Air pollution affects everyone ... it is life and death for all of us,"" said Tara Buakamsri, Thailand director for environmental group Greenpeace, as cars and motorcycles sped by emitting smoke.
Particles found in dust, soot and smoke and small enough to lodge deep in the lungs and enter the bloodstream, known as PM 2.5, were measured at unhealthy levels for 23 of the past 30 days in Bangkok, data from AirVisual showed.
Earlier this week, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said healthy people such as himself could manage and those in risky groups should be aware of their tolerance levels and wear masks.
His comment angered some of the activists.
""Pushing the burden on the people like this is not something an efficient government would do,"" said Chonlatorn Wongrussamee, one of the protesters.
Tara said protecting the environment and health did not damage economic development but went hand in hand with it at the demonstration, which the activists said was the first such protest in two years.
When they reached the government headquarters, a senior official in the Natural Resources and Environment Ministry, Nopadol Phonsen, came out to speak to them, telling them officials were meeting to discuss measures to tackle the issue.
""We're all under the same sky. We want the air we breathe to be clean and healthy,"" he said.
The city's last moderate air quality day, when the index was between 51 and 100, was Jan 4., and there has been no ""good"" air reading in the past 30 days, according to AirVisual data."

A new Lebanese government that took office on Tuesday must grapple with an unprecedented financial crisis, Banks have imposed controls on withdrawals and transfers and the Lebanese pound has sunk against the dollar.
""We will ask the international donors to provide Lebanon with $4 billion to $5 billion in soft loans to finance the purchasing of wheat, fuel oil and pharmaceuticals,"" said Wazni.
""This injection will cover the country's needs for one year,"" he added.
The government was set up with backing from the powerful Iran-backed group Hezbollah and its political allies. Former prime minister Saad al-Hariri, a traditional ally of the West and Gulf Arab states, and his party are not part of the cabinet.
Wazni was picked by Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.
Analysts believe the influence of Hezbollah over the cabinet may complicate its bid to secure foreign funding, particularly from Gulf Arab states that have provided aid in the past but see Hezbollah as a threat.
Foreign governments and institutions have consistently demanded Lebanon enact long-delayed reforms to curb state waste and corruption before any new financial support is released to the heavily indebted Beirut government.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday only a Lebanese government ""capable and committed to undertaking real and tangible reforms will restore investor confidence and unlock international assistance.""
Speaking at Davos on Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said: ""We're monitoring carefully and speaking with the government about various different economic alternatives"".
Prime Minister Hassan Diab was set to meet several foreign ambassadors on Thursday as the country looks to rally support. It must decide on how to deal with maturing Eurobonds, including a $1.2 billion bond due in March.

Lebanon won pledges exceeding $11 billion for a program of infrastructure investment at an international conference in 2018, conditional on reforms that the previous government failed to implement.

416,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 05:33AM ET</span>",Putin's political shake-up backed by Russian parliament in initial vote,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's lower house of parliament unanimously gave its initial backing on Thursday to sweeping constitutional changes proposed by President Vladimir Putin which are widely seen as an attempt to extend his influence after he steps down. 
The reforms, which Putin unveiled last week, were backed by all 432 lawmakers who took part in the vote in the State Duma, as the lower house of parliament is known. Nobody voted against or abstained. The Duma is controlled by the ruling pro-Putin United Russia party. 
The changes are seen as giving Putin scope to retain influence once his current presidential term expires in 2024, though he said at the weekend he did not favor the Soviet-era practice of having leaders for life who die in office. 
The legislation would for the first time enshrine the status of the State Council, now a low-profile body that advises the president, in the constitution. Some of the president's broad powers would also be clipped and parliament's powers expanded.
Putin, 67, has not disclosed what he plans to do once he leaves the Kremlin.
Before they become law, the constitutional amendments must be approved by the lower house of parliament in two further votes before being voted on by the upper house, examined by regional parliaments, and then signed by Putin. 
Russia's constitution has not been changed since 1993. 
Parliament speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said the lower house would hold its next reading of the legislation on Feb. 11 and that parliament might manage to complete the overall approval process by the end of February, Russian news agencies reported. 

Putin has said that the changes should also be put to a nationwide vote. But it remains unclear what form such a vote would take and when it will be held though some Russian media have suggested it will take place in April.

DUBAI (Reuters) - The successor to the Iranian commander killed in a U.S. drone strike would suffer the same fate if he followed a similar path by killing Americans, the U.S. special representative for Iran said, according to Asharq al-Awsat newspaper.
Washington blamed Qassem Soleimani for masterminding attacks by Iran-aligned militias against U.S. forces in the region. U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Jan. 3 drone strike in Iraq after an escalation that began in December with missile strikes that killed an American contractor, which Washington blamed on an Iran-aligned militia in Iraq.
Iran responded to the killing of Soleimani by launching missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq on Jan. 8, although no U.S. soldiers were killed.
After Soleimani's death, Tehran swiftly appointed Esmail Ghaani as the new head of the Quds Force, an elite unit in the Revolutionary Guards that handles actions abroad. Ghaani has pledged to pursue Soleimani's course.
""If (Esmail) Ghaani follows the same path of killing Americans then he will meet the same fate,"" U.S. envoy Brian Hook told the Arabic-language daily Asharq al-Awsat.
He said in the interview in Davos that Trump had long made it clear ""that any attack on Americans or American interests would be met with a decisive response.""
""This isn't a new threat. The president has always said that he will always respond decisively to protect American interests,"" Hook said. ""I think the Iranian regime understands now that they cannot attack America and get away with it.""
After his appointment, Ghaani said he would ""continue in this luminous path"" taken by Soleimani and said the goal was to drive U.S. forces out of the region, Iran's long stated policy.
The Revolutionary Guards aerospace commander said four U.S. military bases in the region were used to deploy aircraft and drones that played a role in the Jan. 3 attack that killed Soleimani, including two bases in Iraq and another in Kuwait.
""Most of the drones"" had taken off from Kuwait, Amirali Hajizadeh, who heads the Guards' aerospace unit, told state television, although he did not say if a drone from Kuwait was ultimately responsible for attack on Soleimani.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have steadily increased since Trump withdrew from Iran's nuclear deal with world powers in 2018 and imposed tough news sanctions that have hammered the Iranian economy.

This month's military flare-up began in December when rockets fired at U.S. bases in Iraq killed a U.S. contractor. Washington blamed pro-Iran militia and launched air strikes that killed at least 25 fighters. After the militia surrounded the U.S. embassy in Baghdad for two days, Trump ordered the drone strike on Soleimani.

In an opinion piece published in the Financial Times ahead of an initial International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruling on the issue, she said Myanmar was the victim of ""unsubstantiated narratives"" by human rights groups and U.N investigators.
She also said the country could itself punish perpetrators through domestic mechanisms.
The ICJ said it had jurisdiction to hear the case, which is seeking emergency measures to prevent Myanmar from committing genocide against the Rohingya minority.
""The international justice system may not yet be equipped to filter out misleading information before shadows of incrimination are cast over entire nations and governments,"" she said. 
""Human rights groups have condemned Myanmar based on unproven statements without the due process of criminal investigation.""
The ICJ is ruling on Thursday on a request by Gambia for emergency measures in Myanmar to halt violence immediately against Rohingya, to protect the ethnic minority and to preserve evidence of past abuses.
The small, mostly Muslim West African country launched the lawsuit in November at the highest U.N. body for disputes between states, accusing Myanmar of genocide against Rohingya in violation of a 1948 convention.
The case has not been heard in full and Thursday’s ruling deals only with Gambia’s request for so-called preliminary measures, the equivalent of a restraining order for states. It gives no indication of the court’s final decision, which could take years to reach.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017 and were forced into camps across the border in Bangladesh. U.N. investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with “genocidal intent”.
During a week of hearings last month, Suu Kyi, Myanmar’s civilian leader, asked the ICJ to drop the case.
She conceded that disproportionate military force may have been used and civilians killed but said the acts did not constitute genocide.

This week, a government-appointed panel in Myanmar said that, while the military had probably committed crimes, there was no indication of an intent to commit genocide.

The prime minister's office gave no detailed reason for the cancellation of the trip but said Conte would be remaining in Rome to work on ""urgent issues"".
Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio, who has been in government since the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement won 33% of the national vote in the 2018 election, quit on Wednesday following a wave of defections that had threatened the stability of the government.
His resignation had added to growing political uncertainty in Italy ahead of local elections at the weekend where the right-wing opposition League party is hoping for big gains to add weight to its demands for new national elections.
Italian government bonds have remained steady and on Thursday, Finance Minister Roberto Gualtieri said the ruling coalition remained strongly committed to government stability and that the 5-Star Movement had assured its support.
""The party's already said it was committed to the stability of the government. So nothing will change,"" he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV.
Di Maio, who remains in office as foreign minister, has been replaced as caretaker by the head of 5-Star's internal rules committee Vito Crimi, until a permanent successor is chosen at a party conference in the next few months.
The party has been hit by a series of high profile defections from its parliamentary party, losing more than 30 lawmakers since 2018, amid deep disagreements on policies including its partnership with the centre-left Democratic Party."

424,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 04:14AM ET</span>",World Court to rule on emergency measures in Rohingya genocide case,"By Stephanie van den Berg
THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The International Court of Justice will rule on Thursday on a request by Gambia for emergency measures in Myanmar to halt violence immediately against Rohingya Muslims, to protect the ethnic minority and to preserve evidence of past abuses.
The small, mostly Muslim West African country launched the lawsuit in November at the United Nations' highest body for disputes between states, accusing Myanmar of genocide against Rohingya in violation of a 1948 convention.
The case has not yet been heard in full and Thursday's ruling deals only with Gambia's request for so-called preliminary measures, the equivalent of a restraining order for states. It gives no indication of the court's final decision, which could take years to reach.
Gambia has requested that Myanmar take action to prevent violence, including murder, rape, or other atrocities that could constitute genocide. It has also asked judges to order Myanmar to grant access to U.N. bodies investigating alleged crimes against Rohingya.
The World Court's rulings are final and without appeal, but it has no real way of enforcing them. 
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Myanmar after a military-led crackdown in 2017, and were forced into squalid camps across the border in Bangladesh. U.N. investigators concluded that the military campaign had been executed with ""genocidal intent"".
More than 100 Myanmar civil society groups published a statement saying they hoped international justice efforts would ""bring forth the truth"" and end impunity.
""Political and military policies have always been imposed with violent force and intimidation upon the people of Myanmar, systematically and institutionally, on the basis of their political and religious beliefs and ethnic identities and continue until the present,"" the statement said.
""We understand very clearly that the ICJ case against Myanmar is directed towards those responsible for using political power and military might, and not to the people of Myanmar.""
'PRAYING FOR JUSTICE'
The camps outside Cox's Bazar in Bangladesh are home to more than one million Rohingya, making them the world's largest refugee settlement.
Hopes were running high there for a favorable ruling after years of persecution.
""The entire Rohingya community is praying for justice,"" said Dil Mohammad, 52, a Rohingya community leader.
During a week of hearings last month, Myanmar's civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi asked the 17-judge panel to drop the case.
She conceded that disproportionate military force may have been used and civilians killed, but said the acts did not constitute genocide.
Just this week, a government-appointed panel in Myanmar said that, while the military had probably committed crimes, there was no indication of an intent to commit genocide.
Myanmar’s military, known as the Tatmadaw, said it would probe allegations of wrongdoing within its ranks and chain of command, and take action ""in conformity with military justice"" if credible evidence emerged.
""The Tatmadaw in carrying out its duty to defend the sovereignty of the state and protect the life and property of the local people from terrorist attacks launched by ARSA and its collaborators did so spontaneously,"" it said in a statement. ""The action was not premeditated.""
A spokesman told reporters at a news conference in the capital, Naypyitaw, that the military would follow the orders of the government if the court ruled against Myanmar.
Although the Myanmar case in The Hague is only at an early stage, human rights lawyer Akila Radhakrishnan said it had already had an impact.

""Since the case was filed, we've seen the government take some action to ensure accountability, like issuing a court martial. Now, the military justice system is deeply flawed - but it's something that wasn't there before.""

MAKURDI, Nigeria (Reuters) - Thomas Tyavwva Maji is planting rice on more of his land in Nigeria's Benue State than ever to take advantage of a surge in prices since the country shut its land borders in August.
But he says he cannot go much further. With no machinery or irrigation, limited manual labor and no spare cash for fertilizers, the 45-year-old is not expecting any dramatic change in his fortunes.
""We work until we get exhausted, manually we get exhausted,"" said Maji, as a woman nearby beat hand-harvested stalks on the ground to separate the grains from the chaff.
The constraints Maji faces have bedeviled many rice farmers and millers across Nigeria for years. Despite government measures designed to spur production, farmers in Nigeria get far less from their land than other major rice growers and the West African country is only marginally less reliant on imports.
That's a problem for a government that wants to grow all of its own food and boost the country's agriculture, a sector that accounts for nearly a third of gross domestic product in Africa's biggest economy.
When he came to power in 2015, Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari pledged to help the nation become self-sufficient in rice – once a luxury but now a staple for millions of Nigerians.
In 2015, Nigeria's central bank banned the use of its foreign exchange to pay for rice imports and has backed loans of at least 40 billion naira ($130 million) to help small-holders boost output. It also banned rice imports across land borders and kept hefty 70% tariffs on imports coming through ports.
In August last year, Nigeria went a step further and closed its land borders altogether to stamp out smuggling, often from neighboring Benin, with rice being one of the main targets.
(GRAPHIC: Rice Imports from Thailand - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8155/8137/Thai%20Rice%20exports%20WAF.png)
Buhari's spokesman, Garba Shehu, said the measures boosted rice production to 9.2 million tonnes last year from 7.2 million in 2015, making Nigeria more or less self-sufficient, though traders can import rice through ports if they pay the tariffs.
Agricultural data specialist Gro Intelligence, however, put Nigeria's rice output at 4.9 million tonnes in 2019, up 60% from 2013 but well below local consumption of 7 million tonnes.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture, meanwhile, expects Nigeria's 2020 rice imports to rise 9% to 2.4 million tonnes, in part due to the high cost of unprocessed Nigerian paddy rice and elevated operating costs at mills.
In Lagos, Nigeria's biggest city, supermarket shelves remain stocked with a plethora of imported rice brands.
In the markets where most Nigerians buy their food, sacks of Nigerian rice are piled high but imported rice is still available, even though some traders keep the foreign grain under wraps to prevent it being confiscated by customs agents.
(GRAPHIC: Nigerian Rice Production and Consumption - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8154/8136/Production%20v%20Consumption%20Rice.png)
LOW YIELDS
Small-scale farmers such as Maji account for 80% of Nigeria's rice production with a handful of large companies, such as Coscharis Group, Dangote and Olam, growing the rest, according to the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
In Benue state, virtually every aspect of Maji's farming manual, from planting to harvesting to leveling out roads to take the crop to market.
It's a similar story on many Nigerian farms, leaving the average yield per hectare at just over 2 tonnes - half the global average and a fraction of Egypt's 9.5 tonnes a hectare, according to U.N. data.
(GRAPHIC: Nigeria Lags in Rice Yield - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/editorcharts/NIGERIA-ECONOMY-RICE/0H001QXX9BHN/eikon.png)
Experts say there is little hope of improvement without significant investment in irrigation, mechanization, roads and storage. More than 12% of rice is also wasted due to poor roads and inefficient harvesting, milling and storage, consultants KPMG said in a review of the Nigeria's rice industry.
In a good year, Maji makes about 1.5 million naira ($4,900) – nowhere close to the 5 million, at least, a tractor would cost. Without irrigation, a goal so remote he doesn't even know the cost, he can only plant one crop a year.
""At this scale, we will not even be able to fetch a tractor. Talk less of fertilizer and other chemicals,"" Maji said.
According to the FAO, less than 1% of Nigeria's farmland is irrigated, compared with a global average of more than 20%.
Small- and medium-scale rice millers, who account for more than 80 percent of the local market, also say they're struggling to meet increased demand without proper equipment.
At Wurukum Rice Mill in Makurdi, Iveren Asan works alongside her sister, using a loud diesel-powered generator to drive machinery processing paddy grains into consumable rice.
Nearby, rice grains that have been parboiled in vats heated by firewood dry on tarps. She said new buyers from across the country had surfaced since the border closures - but producing more would require significant investment in new machines and the higher prices were not enough on their own.
""We can't meet the demand. We are doing the process manually, so we cannot meet the demand,"" she said.
(GRAPHIC: Nigeria's Incoming Foreign Direct Investment Slides - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/8176/8157/FDI%20flows.png)
'INCREDIBLY DISRUPTIVE'
More broadly, experts warned that extreme measures, such as border closures, taken in the name of food security were hurting Nigerians, stunting the development of other industries and holding back foreign investment.
""The border closure has been incredibly disruptive,"" said John Ashbourne, an economist at Capital Economics. ""It stops industries from getting the imports they need, and it pushes up prices.""
The border closure is set for review Jan. 31 but the presidency's Shehu said land frontiers would remain shut until Nigeria's neighbors stopped smuggling on their side - and there was ""no sign of compliance yet"".
Ashbourne said even some farming has taken a hit from government policies.
After glass was added to a central bank list of items importers cannot buy with foreign exchange, some tomato paste plants shut because they couldn't source the jars they needed.
On another farm in Benue State, Abraham Hon, 51, weaves through rows of melons and corn before reaching his rice, the crop that generates the most money.
""The prices look pretty good,"" he said, as men cut stalks of rice by hand and laid them in piles on the ground. ""We expect more money in the pocket this year.""
But while he and Asan are happy with their increased income, they worry about the impact of higher prices on consumers.
A 50 kg bag of rice can cost as much as 24,000 naira in Lagos - nearly double the price in July before the borders were shut and not far below the monthly minimum wage of 30,000 naira.
And consumers, who already spend more than half their income on food according to the World Bank, are feeling the squeeze.
""We will reach a point where people who are buying rice can't afford to buy rice. They will look at other alternatives to get energy and get food on their table,"" Hon said.
""That in the long term is not in the interest of we, the farmers.""

429,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 23, 2020 03:26AM ET</span>","Canadian air tanker crashes while fighting Australia bushfires, three dead","By Byron Kaye and Colin Packham
SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Canadian-owned C-130 Hercules air tanker crashed while fighting bushfires in Australia's alpine region on Thursday, killing all three of its crew, authorities said.
The victims were American residents, Australian authorities said, adding that they did not immediately know why the plane crashed while carrying a load of fire retardant.
""Tragically, there appear to be no survivors as a result of the crash down in the Snowy Monaro area,"" said Shane Fitzsimmons, the chief of rural fire services for the southeastern state of New South Wales.
""(The tanker) impacted heavily with the ground and initial reports are that there was a large fireball associated with the impact of the plane as it hit the ground. There is no indication at this stage of what's caused the accident.""
A spokesman for Australia's Civil Aviation Safety Authority said the aircraft went into a valley to drop the retardant and did not emerge.
Fitzsimmons said the plane had been leased by Canadian aerial firefighting company Coulson Aviation, which had a second C-130 Hercules working in the Australian bushfires operation.
Coulson had grounded its large air tanker fleet following the accident, he added, pending a review to rule out any systemic issue, such as a fuel problem.
The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said it was sending a team of investigators to the crash site to collect evidence and would analyze available recorded data, review weather information and interview any witnesses.
It would take about 30 days for the release of a preliminary report, it said, but if the investigation revealed a critical safety issue it would immediately notify stakeholders.
Coulson said the plane was on a firebombing mission with a load of retardant, and added that it would send a team to the crash site to assist.
""The accident is reported to be extensive and we are deeply saddened to confirm there were three fatalities,"" it said in a brief emailed statement.
""SMOKE ALL OF A SUDDEN""
The deaths take to 32 the toll from hundreds of wildfires in Australia since September. One billion animals are also estimated to have perished as the fires incinerated 2,500 homes and a total area of bushland one-third the size of Germany.
Authorities had previously said the tanker was flying in the Snowy Monaro region, south of the capital Canberra.
Tracking website Flightradar24 showed the path for an air tanker used in waterbombing operations suddenly stopping in Peak View, south of Canberra.
According to its flight data, the aircraft departed the Richmond air force base in western Sydney around 12:15 p.m. (0115 GMT). It dropped off radar just after 2 p.m.
Peak View is close to a blaze burning out of control in the Wadbilliga National Park, the fire service said.
The plane may have been ""aerodynamically overloaded"", said Geoffrey Dell, an expert in accident forensics and investigation, meaning it may have turned or changed altitude too quickly for its load, forcing it to lose altitude sharply. 
""It's designed to operate to certain G (gravity)-limits, and if you go over those, different parts of the structure can be overstressed,"" added Dell, a professor at Central Queensland University. 
Such air tankers typically carry 15,000 liters of water or fire retardant for release over blazes in areas that ground crews find hard to reach.
Belinda Greene, a receptionist at the Bredbo Inn Hotel near the crash site, said she heard police cars race by. 
""We saw a lot of smoke all of a sudden a couple of hours ago,"" she told Reuters by telephone.
The usually temperate mountain region has escaped some of the more devastating fires that have razed more than 11 million hectares (27 million acres) of Australia's wilderness, fanned by high winds and searing temperatures.
The capital, Canberra, located just over 100 km (60 miles) from the crash site, shut its airport for several hours on Thursday because of a fire threat, while many residents were forced to seek shelter as fires raged nearby.
Damaging winds are fanning flames in parts of the Gippsland area in the southeastern state of Victoria, authorities said, near the site of fires in December.
Dense smoke also shrouded Sydney, but fire authorities said high temperatures should ease overnight.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Derek Tai was arrested outside Hong Kong's Legislative Council building last June, early in the city's anti-government protests, which have seen millions join demonstrations over the past seven months. 
Tai, a soft-spoken 21-year-old philosophy major, was one of the first protesters to be arrested. Five months later, he was charged with unlawful assembly, a crime that carries a sentence of up to three years in jail. In past cases, defendants have been sentenced to eight months. 
""I didn't really think they would charge me,"" he said. Tai had planned to study in Germany this year, but like many of his peers, he now faces a potential prison term and an unpredictable future in Hong Kong.
More than 7,000 protesters have been arrested amid seven months of unrest over a since-withdrawn extradition bill. Of those, 1,092 have been charged, Hong Kong police chief Chris Tang told district councillors recently.
Just 12 people have been sentenced, Tang said, with the longest sentence, 14 months, handed down to a protester who had a petrol bomb. 
For protesters like Tai, the scale of mass arrests and charges, longer-than-normal delays for hearings, and bail conditions that could land them in jail if they are arrested again have forced them to put their lives on hold - and discouraged them from returning to the streets.
The arrested demonstrators, 40 percent of whom are secondary school and university students, face a slew of charges, including rioting, arson, and possession of weapons. Protesters convicted of rioting, one of the most serious charges, can face up to 10 years in prison.
Tai has not told his mother he was charged. She lives in mainland China and could not understand why her son was arrested at a protest. 
""She was disappointed ... she thinks I'm capable of doing more things than getting arrested, and our relatives in the mainland think I'm a rioter,"" he said. 
Whenever he feels depressed, Tai tries to remember his favorite Chinese philosophers. 
""It really gives me strength,"" he said. ""Especially when they emphasize that I have the ability to see what's right and wrong,"" he said. 
Tai said he felt it was important to publicly discuss his case and use his full name so arrested protesters were not reduced to a statistic. 
MASS ARRESTS
Police have conducted dozens of mass arrests at protests and rallies - often with scant evidence, critics say - leaving the task of building winnable cases to the Hong Kong Department of Justice. 
A New Year's Day march this year ended with the arrest of more than 400 people after police ordered the dispersal of an officially sanctioned event, leading to street clashes. 
(Graphic: Hong Kong arrests - https://tmsnrt.rs/37hlBM0)
Protesters and rights groups say mass arrests are a powerful deterrent for demonstrators. People who are free on bail may fear attending even legally approved rallies because if they are arrested again, they risk being kept in custody until sentencing.
The Hong Kong Police Force said that it is politically neutral and that officers only make arrests if someone is suspected of breaking the law. The politics of the arrested person are never a consideration for arrest or prosecution, police wrote in an e-mail responding to questions.
Under Hong Kong law, arrestees can only be held for 48 hours without charges. Most protesters have been granted bail, but supporters say courts are setting tighter bail conditions, including restrictions on travel outside the city. 
Robert Godden, the co-founder of Rights Exposure, a local human rights consultancy, was arrested with a colleague in November during the siege of Hong Kong Polytechnic University, where they were acting as human rights observers.
He was questioned and detained for 16 hours before being granted bail. 
So far, Godden has not been charged. The Hong Kong police said it does not comment on individual cases. 
""There is an uncertainty that weighs on you; you don't know whether they'll contact our lawyers tomorrow and say we've decided to charge you with X, Y, or Z,"" he said. ""It's a low hum in the background that sometimes gets louder.""
Godden said the specter of possible charges has a chilling effect on human rights and political activists.
Police arrested three volunteers for the Civil Rights Observer, a human rights group, as they monitored the Jan. 1 march.
Later in January, Hong Kong denied entry to the global head of Human Rights Watch, who had traveled to the city to release the group's annual world report. Hong Kong's immigration department said it would not comment on individual cases.
(Graphic: Age of those arrested - https://tmsnrt.rs/2TMeC9A)
LONG DELAYS
The flood of arrestees has strained the courts, lawyers and advocates say.
Vannie Lau, a solicitor defending 10 arrested protesters, including Tai, said many lawyers are already volunteering for 25 cases, the maximum number for which the government will subsidize fees for defendants who can't afford representation.
Lau said it was not uncommon for court hearings to stretch long past normal hours, recounting a hearing for 96 people in a rioting case that lasted from 4:30 to 10:30 p.m. 
""It just shows that even the judiciary can't handle such a large amount of defendants,"" Lau said. 
The city's most senior judge, Chief Justice Geoffrey Ma, acknowledged the huge volume of pending cases at an event with Hong Kong and mainland Chinese lawyers, noting that most cases were not ready for trial. 
He said a task force had been set up to study how the courts can expedite matters.
The justice department did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Activists have come up with their own ways to track the glut of pending trials. A Telegram channel called ""You are not alone HK"" offers real-time summaries and updates of protest-related court hearings. The channel, set up last August, already has more than 50,000 subscribers. 
The group's 14 volunteers line up for public seats in court hearings and provide a transcription service for families, supporters and lawyers. A volunteer who helps run the group said it has covered more than 100 hearings involving 1,000 defendants.
In December, police arrested members of Spark Alliance, an organization that raised money to cover protesters' legal fees, on charges of money laundering and froze HK$70 million ($9 million) in donations.
Tai's legal fees are covered by the 612 Humanitarian Relief Fund. 
LIFE IN LIMBO
Ann, Tai's girlfriend of a year, recalled the anxiety she felt when she learned of his arrest. 
""It felt like time had stopped for 40 hours. I didn't cry or feel anything,"" when he was in detention, the 20-year-old university student said. ""When I saw him again, I felt relieved. But I also knew it was just the beginning.""
Ann, who declined to give her last name because she fears repercussions for speaking out, said 10 other friends had been arrested at protests. It has become routine for her to contact their families and find lawyers. 
""It's so terrible that I got used to it and I've started to feel numb already,"" she said.
Tai's next court hearing is scheduled for March. Not knowing whether he will spend months or years in jail, Tai has told Ann to be ready to move on. 
""I don't think the responsibility is on her to wait for me,"" he said. 
Classes at Chinese University of Hong Kong provided a distraction for Ann before they were suspended because of the protests. She finally broke down in the two weeks leading up to Tai's first court appearance on Nov. 8. 
""Before everything happened, I didn't really cherish his existence in my life,"" she said. ""I was so used to the fact that he would always be there for me.""
Defendants and their families say they are determined to keep protesting and are willing to serve months or years in prison for the cause. 
""I know that someone has to carry this responsibility because a thousand of us have already been charged,"" Tai said. ""Some of us have to do it, and it just happens to be me.""

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese government should forbid employers from retaining the passports of their foreign workers, a lawyer said on Thursday after a Filipino woman sued her former employer for refusing to return her personal documents.
The case comes at a time when the government is seeking to attract laborers from outside Japan in hopes of finding a solution to the country's severe labor shortage. A visa scheme introduced last year is projected to draw in 345,000 workers over five years.
""Unfortunately, it's common practice for companies to take the passports of the foreign workers they employ,"" Shoichi Ibusuki, the plaintiff's lawyer, told reporters.
""But to take someone's passport and then force them to work is forced labor, and should not be allowed under Japanese law,"" he said.
The 30-year-old woman, who has kept her name private, filed a lawsuit last week demanding the return of her passport, graduation certificate and other documents that she turned over when she started working at the company, a law office, in May 2019.
The woman asked for her passport back when she resigned in July 2019 but the company refused to return it, claiming it feared she would ""run away,"" said Makoto Iwahashi, a representative from a non-governmental organization that is assisting the woman with legal procedures.
Iwahashi said he believed the issue was not uncommon, but the breadth of the problem was hard to grasp because many cases went underreported because of the language barrier and fears of deportation threats.
""I'm standing up also for others to not be afraid and fight for what is right, so I'm standing not only for myself but for other foreign workers who are in the same situation,"" the woman said in a short video clip shown to reporters at the news conference.
AdvanceConsul Certified Administrative Procedures Legal Specialists' Office, her former employer, declined to comment when contacted by Reuters.
It is illegal in Japan for companies to confiscate the passports of technical trainees under a special intern program, but there is no law forbidding firms from taking the passports of foreign laborers in Japan under other visa schemes.
There is a government guideline advising against the confiscation of passports but it is not legally binding.
""I believe this guideline should become law, and also include a penalty clause,"" Ibusuki said.
""We're hoping that we can use this lawsuit as an opportunity to convince the government to create a law that would ban the confiscation of passports."""

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - A new coronavirus spreading from the city of Wuhan has put a spotlight on China's poorly regulated wild animal trade - driven by relentless demand for exotic delicacies and ingredients for traditional medicine.
China's markets, where wild and often poached animals are packed together, have been described as a breeding ground for disease and an incubator for a multitude of viruses to evolve and jump the species barrier to humans.
More than 500 people have been infected by the new flu-like virus that authorities say emerged from illegally traded wildlife in a seafood market in the central Chinese city, with the death toll at 17 and expected to rise.
""The origin of the new coronavirus is the wildlife sold illegally in a Wuhan seafood market,"" Gao Fu, director of China Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing.
Preliminary research suggested that in the most recent stage of its evolution, the Wuhan virus was passed on to humans from snakes. But Chinese government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan has also identified badgers and rats as possible sources.
Conservationists and health experts have long denounced the trade in wildlife for its impact on biodiversity and the potential for spreading disease in markets.
""The animal welfare part of this is obvious, but much more hidden is this stashing and mixing of all these species together in a very small area, with secretions and urine mixed up together,"" said Christian Walzer, executive director of the New York-based Wildlife Conservation Society.
China's wet markets have already been blamed for outbreaks of other infectious diseases in China and southeast Asia, including the virus responsible for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people worldwide in 2003.
""The other thing you have to consider is that these animals are massively stressed in these cages so their immune systems fail very quickly,"" said Walzer.
""It is a perfect system. You couldn't do it any better if you tried,"" Walzer said of the markets' propensity to generate viruses.
MARKET FORCES
Photographs taken at the Wuhan market before it was closed at the end of last year show cages packed with snakes, porcupines and foxes. Media said about 50 types of wild animal were on sale at the market, including endangered pangolins.
According to a report by the China Business Journal, a state-owned paper that interviewed the sister of a vendor infected by the virus, snakes, ducks and wild rabbits were popular at the market.
Since the outbreak began, authorities in Wuhan and elsewhere have shut down markets, zoos and forest parks, suspended trade in live poultry and the trade and transport of wild animals, though residents in some areas said the measures appeared to be largely symbolic.
The southeastern province of Guangdong, where a wide variety of animals are sold, has long been regarded as a prime source of new diseases.
Scientists believe SARS was caused by cross-species transmission in the province - with the blame initially falling on masked palm civets, which are considered a delicacy.
Authorities slaughtered thousands of the animals although bats were later believed to have been the source of SARS.
After SARS, China tried to improve the way the animal trade is regulated. At the same time, authorities have tried to curb the poaching of exotic species and has a long list of officially protected wildlife.
But efforts to protect animals often lose out to generations of tradition.
Environmentalists have long campaigned for new laws to restrict the use of wild animals in Chinese medicine and to develop synthetic alternatives.
But many animal products are still easily available.
Snakes, peacocks and even crocodiles are on sale via Taobao, a Chinese e-commerce website run by  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA).
Reuters contacted an Inner Mongolia resident named Gong Jian who sells snake, camel, crocodile and deer meat via WeChat.
Given booming business, he said he was aiming to expand his online marketing.
""Customers really like the crocodile - they stew it,"" he said."

China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be taken by force if needed. It has routinely sent bombers and other aircraft close to the island since President Tsai Ing-wen first took office in 2016.
Beijing believes Tsai is pushing for the island's formal independence.
Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name. She won re-election by a landslide this month on a platform of standing up to China.
In a short statement, the Defence Ministry said Chinese aircraft including H-6 bombers and KJ-500 early warning and control aircraft flew to the south of Taiwan through the Bashi Channel which separates the island from the Philippines.
After carrying out drills above the Pacific Ocean the aircraft returned to China, the ministry said.
Taiwan's armed forces have a well-honed system to monitor and respond to such drills, it added, without giving details or saying whether Taiwanese fighter jets were scrambled.
China's Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Following Tsai's re-election earlier this month, Chinese state media suggested the country could flex its muscles near Taiwan to register Beijing's continued displeasure with Tsai.
The seas around Taiwan are a closely-watched zone not only for Taipei and Beijing.
A U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait last week, and the U.S. Navy has been conducting sporadic sailings there since 2018.
China sailed its latest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, through the Taiwan Strait twice in the run-up to Taiwan's Jan. 11 election. Taiwan denounced that as attempted intimidation."

(Reuters) - A violent altercation that escalated into gunfire in downtown Seattle left one woman dead and six other bystanders wounded outside a fast-food restaurant on Wednesday, and police said they were searching for at least two suspects.
The precise circumstances of the shooting, what precipitated the bloodshed and the number of people involved remained murky hours after the incident, which unfolded in a busy shopping district during the evening rush-hour.
The violence, which investigators deemed was ""not a random incident,"" grew out of a dispute in front of a McDonald's restaurant, Seattle Police Chief Carmen Best told reporters at a briefing near the crime scene.
""People pulled out guns, shots rang out, people ran in various directions,"" she said.
The chief added there were ""multiple people involved as shooters"" who apparently fled the scene, but she declined to specify how many suspects police believed were at large.
""We've locked down the scene. We have no active shooting at this point ... so everything is safe for the night.""
Seattle television station KOMO-TV, citing witness accounts, reported that two men were seen arguing on the street before pulling guns on each other and opening fire as pedestrians around them scattered for cover.
All of those hit by gunfire were believed to have been bystanders, authorities said.
A Fire Department spokesman described the lone fatality as a woman about 40 to 50 years of age, who was found dead at the scene. Seven other victims were brought to Harborview Medical Center's emergency room, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
One of those patients was a woman in her 50s who was listed in critical condition as she underwent emergency surgery, according to Seattle Fire Chief Harold Scoggins. Another was a 9-year-old boy in serious condition, he said. 
An office worker identified only as Bill told KOMO-TV he heard gunfire and saw scores of people running away in terror as he watched the scene unfold from an upstairs office window .
""It was sheer panic,"" he said. ""I've never seen anything like it.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Dozens of world leaders will convene in Jerusalem on Thursday to mark the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp, amid a backdrop of rising anti-Semitism in Europe and the United States.
However, Poland's president will stay away due to rankling disputes with both Russia and Israel.
Israel has hailed the World Holocaust Forum at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center as the biggest international gathering in its history, and Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence are among the attendees.
Poland will host its own commemorative event at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial and Museum south of the country on Jan. 27. More than one million people, most of them Jews, were killed at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Nazi death camp. Six million Jews died in the Holocaust.
Speeches at the Jerusalem event are likely to focus on the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust as well as a more recent rise in anti-Semitism rhetoric and attacks worldwide https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-antisemitism/anti-semitic-attacks-rise-worldwide-in-2018-led-by-us-west-europe-study-idUSKCN1S73M1
A global survey https://global100.adl.org/about/2019 by the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League in November found that global anti-Semitic attitudes had increased, and significantly in Eastern and Central Europe. It found that large percentages of people in many European countries think Jews talk too much about the Holocaust.
Israeli President Reuven Rivlin addressed this at a reception he hosted on Wednesday for the visiting leaders.
""I hope and pray ... that the leaders of the world will stand united in the fight against racism, anti-Semitism and extremism, in defending democracy and democratic values. This is our challenge. This is our choice,"" he said.
In Jerusalem, the high-profile guest list, which includes French President Emmanuel Macron, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Britain's Prince Charles, could also burnish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's image as a statesman at home ahead of a March 2 election.
Fighting for political survival in Israel's third ballot in less than a year, Netanyahu has been using sideline meetings with international leaders at the conference to call for more sanctions against arch-enemy Iran.
France, along with Britain and Germany, declared Iran in violation of a 2015 nuclear pact last week. They launched a dispute mechanism that could lead to reimposition of U.N. sanctions lifted after the agreement to limit Tehran's atomic activities was signed.
Polish President Andrzej Dud turned down an invitation to the conference, expressing dissatisfaction that representatives of Russia, France, Britain, the United States and Germany would speak, while Poland was told it would not be able to.
Israeli organizers said only the four World War Two allies, and Germany, would address the gathering.
Polish leaders have also been angered by comments made by Putin last month suggesting Poland shared responsibility for the war.
Warsaw will be scrutinizing speeches by Putin and Netanyahu, who Israel's Channel 12 TV reported might echo some of the Russian leader's accusations against Poland in return for the pardon of an Israeli woman imprisoned in Russia on drug charges.
""Above all, we are asking that the memory of the Holocaust, that terrible crime, the memory of its victims, is not exploited for political reasons,"" Poland's deputy foreign minister, Szymon Szynkowski vel Sęk, said on Tuesday. That would be vile."""

441,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 10:31PM ET</span>","New Zealand PM commits to 'positive' election campaign, warns of fake news","WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Thursday she would wage a ""positive"" 2020 election campaign, announcing her party had signed up to Facebook's advertising transparency tool to fight misinformation.
Ardern's 2017 campaign focusing on positive messaging and connecting directly with voters unexpectedly brought her Labour Party-led coalition to power, and transformed her into a national and global icon, generating the phrase ""Jacinda-mania"".
""New Zealanders deserve a positive election,"" Ardern said in a statement released after a meeting with her Labour Party colleagues in Auckland on Thursday.
""I don’t want New Zealand to fall into the trap of the negative fake news style campaigns that have taken place overseas in recent years,” she added.
Facebook's ad transparency tools, set to motion after the 2016 U.S. election, allows voters to see who is behind paid advertising on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and how much was spent on it.
""If an ad appears in your Facebook feed you should know who it’s from and why you were targeted. By being transparent about who is behind ads there is likely to be a flow-on effect of parties ensuring they are accurate too,"" Ardern said.
Facebook's ad transparency tool is already compulsory in countries like Canada, the European Union, India, the U.K. and the U.S. but is currently opt-in in New Zealand.
Political commentators are predicting a tight election and have warned of misinformation campaigns like those seen in recent polls in the United States, Britain and Australia.
New Zealand 's Green Party, which is in coalition with Labour, is the only other party that has signed up for Facebook's transparency tools, while the opposition National Party is yet to comment on its position.
Green Party co-leader James Shaw told Reuters in an interview on Thursday that he expects it to be a ""nasty election"".
""I think New Zealand is not immune to what we have seen overseas with the influence of troll farms and putting out misinformation on social media....that really worries me,"" Shaw said. ""I am worried about the health of our democracy and the risks we are exposed to.""
New Zealand's election will be held in the second half of the year with an announcement on the poll dates expected in the coming weeks.
Ardern has been widely praised for tightening gun laws following a mass shooting in two Christchurch mosques last year, but has grappled with issues like housing, urban poverty and economic growth, which are expected to be key election topics.
The government announced infrastructure projects worth NZ$12 billion ($7.90 billion) last month, boosting capital spending to its highest in 20 years, as it seeks to fire up the economy.
Ardern told her party members in a speech earlier that the ""tone and value"" of her party's campaign in 2020 should be factual, honest and robust.
Costings of her party's major election policies would be independently verified, she said.
""One that is free from misinformation, where people can make honest reflections for themselves about what they want for the future of New Zealand,"" Ardern said."

Tecun Uman, GUATEMALA (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central Americans trying to reach the United States were stuck at the Mexico-Guatemala border on Wednesday after the Mexican government beefed up security to meet U.S. demands to contain migrant flows.
Under sustained pressure from President Donald Trump, Mexico's government has adopted tougher measures to reduce the number of people heading towards the U.S. border.
Migrants in Tecun Uman, on the Guatemalan side of the border, were taken by surprise.
""We thought we'd be allowed through just like with the October caravan when they reached Tijuana,"" said Honduran migrant Ritzy Anabel, who did not give her surname.
""People from Mexico and Guatemala treated them well. But now it's changed because Mexicans don't want (us) to enter.""
Many Central Americans migrants heading north are fleeing economic hardship and violence at home. A large caravan of migrants crossed into Mexico and went north in October 2018. Migrants crossing into Mexico earlier this week faced tear gas from security forces, who delivered a firmer response than in previous mass movements at the border.
Even so, about 1,000 migrants, most of them from Honduras, managed to reach Mexican soil on Tuesday. Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said several hundred of the new arrivals were immediately deported on planes and buses.
On Wednesday, Mexican authorities said that 460 Honduran migrants were deported throughout the day. Other migrants from the group, including families traveling with children, were pondering their next moves.
Honduran Carlos Amador said that while some of his compatriots were returning home, others were hoping for positive news.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to punish Mexico and Central American countries if they fail to clamp down on the migrant flows. That has resulted in a series of agreements aimed at delivering on Trump's campaign promises to curb immigration.

Department of Homeland Security Acting Secretary Chad Wolf called the measures put in place by the Mexican National Guard ""effective"", adding that dozens of his personnel was on the ground in Central America assisting local immigration and security officials. Trump tweeted: ""Sorry, if you come you will be immediately sent back!""

BENGALURU/ NEW DELHI (Reuters) - One of India's most famous universities is half-empty and some students who are on campus track each other on mobile devices to ensure people are safe, as violent clashes spill on to campuses that are seen as a hotbed of anti-government protests.
The country has been rocked by demonstrations against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new citizenship law that some say discriminates against Muslims. At least 25 people have died and thousands of people have been arrested.
Many of the most visible and persistent protests have been in and around universities, and some students now fear for their safety following clashes with police and unidentified mobs in recent weeks.
""I don't think I can ever feel completely safe, either in the girls' hostel or on campus,"" said Nayla Khwaja, a student at New Delhi's renowned Jamia Millia Islamia university.
Last month police smashed their way into the institution, firing tear gas shells as scores of terrified students barricaded doors and hid inside bathrooms.
Weeks on from the violence, large parts of the college remain deserted, with some parents refusing to allow students who flock to the university from all parts of India to return.
Less than half of the 20,000-strong student population is back on campus for the new semester, according to college chief proctor Waseem Ahmad Khan.
Beyond the capital, protests have also erupted in colleges in Mumbai, Bengaluru, Kolkata and Chennai.
In some cases they have spilled into nearby town squares, with citizens holding Indian flags and demanding the revocation of the law in the most sustained opposition to Modi since he first swept to power in 2014.
Students say they are concerned about further attacks which they blame on right-wing groups tied to the ruling Hindu nationalists.
""There is an environment of fear that was never seen before,"" said Saheb Samanta, a PHD scholar in Kolkata's Jadavpur University.
Students have taken to sharing live locations on WhatsApp with friends when attending a protest or going to class so they know who is where, a dozen students enrolled in universities in Delhi, Bengaluru and Kolkata told Reuters.
""We are keeping some basic checks in place. Letting friends know where we are and also sometimes walking in groups within campus. This really wasn't necessary before,"" said a masters student at Jadavpur University.
Like others who described the extra precautions, she declined to give her name out of concern for her safety.
DEEP ANXIETY AMONG MUSLIMS
Critics say that Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government is targeting universities to snuff out dissent before the opposition to his policies gets out of hand.
BJP spokesman Tom Vadakkan rejected the allegation and said rival political parties were trying to use students as a way to settle political scores with it.
""These parties are trying to stay relevant,"" he said.
The citizenship law lays out a path to Indian nationality for six religious groups from neighboring countries but not Muslims, prompting criticism it undermines the country's secular ethos.
It came months after the government withdrew the special status of Muslim-majority Kashmir and also after the country's top court ruled in favor of Hindus in a decades-old dispute over a place of worship that the ruling party has long campaigned for.
Such moves have stirred deep anxiety among India's Muslim population and liberals that Modi is promoting a Hindu-first agenda in a country that celebrated its rich diversity.
But the government has said the citizenship law is aimed at helping minorities like Hindus, Christians and Sikhs who face persecution in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
Even small colleges in cities like Bengaluru, far from the center of the protests in the capital, have been caught up in the unrest. Some government supporters accuse anyone opposing the citizenship law as anti-national.
This month, a group of 15 men showed up at the gates of Jyoti Nivas, a small all-women's college, demanding students sign up a charter supporting the citizenship law.
They held a banner with a picture of Modi and insisted women show support for the law.
""We said they can't force us to sign because we are not for the CAA ( citizenship amendment act),"" said Soorya, a 21-year-old student who did not want to share her last name.
There was an altercation and college authorities ordered classes to be suspended for the next two days."

Morales is living under asylum in Argentina after he resigned the presidency under pressure in November, following a contentious election that sparked widespread protests.
Speaking before a crowd of thousands of people in a sports stadium in the Argentine capital, Morales maintained that he won the disputed October election and touted his policies as president, such as nationalizing Bolivia's resources industries.
""It has not been an easy path and, it must be said, it has been necessary to make a profound change,"" said Morales, who was at the helm of Bolivia for nearly 14-years.

The new elections will serve as a re-run of the disputed October vote and be the first in some two decades without Morales.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - China has failed to send home North Korean workers by a December deadline in violation of United Nations sanctions, a senior U.S. official said on Wednesday, adding that this was why Washington blacklisted two entities involved in Pyongyang’s labor export. 
A 2017 U.N. Security Council resolution, which China backed, demanded that all countries repatriate all North Korean workers by Dec. 22 to stop them earning foreign currency for North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. 
The United States has estimated Pyongyang was earning more than $500 million a year from nearly 100,000 workers abroad, of which some 50,000 were in China and 30,000 in Russia.
""Many – most ... have actually taken this to heart and moved them,"" a senior State Department official told reporters, referring to the repatriation requirement. 
""But we know one particular country has the large majority of North Korean guest workers and has not taken action, hence the steps we had to take in terms of sanctions.""
In response to question, the official confirmed he was referring to China. 
China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Washington last week imposed sanctions on two North Korean entities, including China-based lodging facility Beijing Sukbakso, saying they were involved in sending North Koreans to work abroad in violation of U.N. sanctions.
Countries were required to submit a midterm report to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee early last year on compliance with the 2017 resolution and are now due to submit a final report in late March on how many North Korean workers they have repatriated. 
According to Russia's midterm report, it sent home nearly two-thirds of some 30,000 North Koreans working there during 2018, while Beijing said it had repatriated more than half but did not specify a figure.
""China will continue earnestly implementing its international obligations, carry out the repatriation work in an orderly manner and complete the repatriation on time,"" China's U.N. mission said at the time.
The State Department official also said Washington still hoped North Korea would engage in negotiations over its nuclear program, regardless of the apparent change in its foreign minister.
Last week, North Korea told countries with embassies in Pyongyang that Ri Son Gwon, a senior military officer and official of the ruling Workers' Party, had been appointed foreign minister. 
Asked whether this was the case, the U.S. official said: ""apparently, yes.""
""I don't have a lot of data on who he is, or what he represents,"" he added.
""But the hope is that they'll understand the importance of having a conversation and talking about these things as we agreed in the original Singapore agreement,"" the official said. 
""There's nothing to be gained by not talking. It's only to their benefit.

North Korea reiterated on Tuesday it was no longer bound by commitments to halt nuclear and missile testing, blaming the United States' failure to meet a year-end deadline for nuclear talks and ""brutal and inhumane"" U.S. sanctions.

NAVAL AIR STATION PENSACOLA, Fla. (Reuters) - With an FBI investigation underway, Navy security officer David Link still is not allowed to talk about what he saw when a Saudi gunman killed three U.S. sailors at this sprawling Florida naval base last month.
But Link, one of the first responders at the scene, makes clear he appreciates just how badly things could have gone for him on Dec. 6 at Naval Air Station Pensacola.
""When I got home, it was kind of immediate relief. I got to see my wife and daughter, to know that I got out of that situation -- and with my life,"" said Link, a master-at-arms 3rd class.
Link and other base personnel met U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday during a visit that highlighted the Pentagon's efforts to restore a sense of security at U.S. military bases across the country. The facilities host about 5,000 military students from 150 countries, including more than 800 from Saudi Arabia.
It is an uphill battle in Pensacola. Three U.S. sailors were killed in cold blood and eight other people were wounded before the gunman, Saudi Air Force Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani, was himself shot dead.
Families at the base were already on edge after the shooting. Then, earlier this month, U.S. Attorney General William Barr declared it an act of terrorism and announced 21 Saudi cadets training in the United States were being sent home after an investigation turned up child pornography or social media accounts containing Islamic extremist or anti-American content.
Twelve of them had been training at the Pensacola base.
""NATURAL APPREHENSION""
Navy Captain Tim Kinsella, commanding officer of the naval air station, acknowledged apprehension among families who live on the base and said his team has held around 25 town halls in the past six weeks to address their concerns.
""There's a natural apprehension. There's always the questions: what are we doing to make the base safer,"" Kinsella said.
Still, Kinsella played down calls for the Saudis to be sent home, including an online petition to move all training of students from countries outside NATO overseas, calling them ""outliers.""
Esper told reporters traveling with him there was no ""active"" consideration of sending Saudis back home to carry out their training. He noted recent Pentagon changes aimed at improving the vetting of foreign military students.
Asked about how he was addressing tensions between military families and the 140 Saudi students remaining at the Pensacola base, Esper said it was something local base leaders were ""working aggressively on.""
""We talked about maybe increasing roving patrols, stationary patrols,"" he said.
The Dec. 6 attack further complicated U.S.-Saudi relations at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival. It also cast the international military exchange programs the U.S. military believes help forge long-term partnerships in a negative light.
Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican, praised those relationships and Esper's efforts to strengthen security.
""At the same, though, we cannot be bringing people over here who want to do things like this with our country,"" DeSantis said, standing next to Esper.
Kinsella said he believed that the broader Pensacola community still supported the presence of international military trainees.
He recounted how one Pensacola resident gave an apple pie to a group of Saudi military officers, apprehensive of what the community thought of them after the shooting by a fellow Saudi.
""People here recognize that they (the foreign students) are victims of this as well,"" Kinsella said."

PARIS (Reuters) - France's Senate voted on Wednesday in favor of a bill that would allow single women and lesbian couples access to in-vitro fertilization (IVF), the first major social reform of President Emmanuel Macron's term.
The bill was passed 160-116 in the Senate, where Macron's centrist party is outnumbered by right-wing Republicans.
The bill is part of a broader bioethics law, which in October cleared its first reading in the National Assembly, the lower house where Macron's party commands a majority.
The law would unwind some of western Europe’s strictest rules governing medically assisted pregnancies, a campaign promise of Macron.
The senators, however, voted down an article approved by the lower house, that would have allowed IVF to be reimbursed by French social security.
Under existing law in France, IVF is available only to opposite-sex couples, and only for reasons of infertility or the risk of transmission of a disease or medical condition to the child or either parent.
Medically assisted reproduction - such as IVF - is widely available to all women in countries such as Britain, Belgium, Spain. But in France, it has fed into a broader debate about the commercialization of healthcare and gay rights.
""What was recognized to heterosexual couples must be recognized for homosexual couples,"" said Socialist party senator David Assouline.
The legalization of gay marriage in France six years ago sparked massive street protests even though the influence of the Catholic Church was thought to be in decline.
In a sign France has become more socially liberal, polls show a majority of French people back the bioethics reform.
Some opponents of the bioethics bill fear it will pave the way for the legalization of surrogacy - where a surrogate mother is either implanted with a sperm and egg or becomes pregnant using her own egg - whose popularity is soaring globally, particularly among LGBT+ couples who want to become parents. 
Last weekend 41,000 people marched peacefully through Paris to oppose the bill. 

Conservative party The Republicans Senator Pascale Bories said she regretted that Macron ""did not have the courage to do a referendum on this issue because debates transcend political parties.""

(Reuters) - Utah has became the 19th U.S. state to ban conversion therapy aimed at changing sexual orientation or gender identity in lesbian, gay, transsexual, bisexual and queer children.
The ban in the Republican-dominated state, which took effect on Wednesday, exempts members of the clergy, lay pastors, and spiritual counselors not licensed by the state from the ban.
Despite those limits, ""this is still a big victory in a very conservative state,"" said Mathew Shurka, 31, of Long Island, New York.
He describes himself as a ""survivor"" of such therapy and is co-founder of Born Perfect, a nonprofit group pushing for conversion therapy bans across the United States.
Conversion therapy involves a variety of psychological and spiritual practices aimed at changing sexual orientation and gender identity in the belief that homosexuality and transgender identity are mental illnesses.
The American Psychological Association has called the treatment harmful to young people. The American Medical Association has said that conversion therapy does not work and can trigger depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide attempts.
Virginia's state senate approved a ban on Tuesday, and the bill is now being sent to the Democratic-controlled House of Delegates, where it is expected to pass, said Shannon Minter, a San Francisco gay activist working with Born Perfect.
In Utah, the ban takes the form of a regulation. Craig Hall, a Republican state representative, championed legislation that would have banned the therapy, but it failed to pass last year.
He credited support from the influential Mormon Church, to which 62 percent of Utah's 3.1 million residents belong, for the governor's decision to enact the new regulation. The church, opposes same-sex marriage and its doctrine teaches that same-sex relationships are sinful.
Leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the Mormon Church's formal name, had previously opposed the legislation because it did not explicitly exempt clergy.
""We worked very closely with them on the (new) language,"" Hall said.
""The administrative rule has the same effect as law, and it governs all licensed therapists and doctors,"" he said.
A church representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hall noted that the state does not license pastors and ministers.
Utah Governor Gary Herbert, a Republican, had no comment on the issue on Wednesday, said spokeswoman Brook Scheffler.
In a press release in November, Herbert said the rule change was needed ""to end the harmful practice of conversion therapy on minors.""
“The stories of youth who have endured these so-called therapies are heart rending, and I’m grateful that we have found a way forward that will ban conversion therapy forever in our state,” he said.
Troy Williams (NYSE:WMB), executive director of the activist group Equality Utah, said that while the rule does not affect unlicensed counselors, he hopes it sends a message.
""There are a lot of therapists and life coaches still out there who run these camps, and they're dangerous,"" Williams said. ""But hopefully with Utah taking a strong stand, this will get the word out."""

Three people were arrested, one passerby was injured by fireworks and a policeman was hospitalized with unspecified injuries, Zurich police said in a news release after the demonstration broke up mid-evening. 
Several hundred people marched in the permitted demonstration entitled ""Zurich against WEF"" in the streets near the Swiss banking capital's downtown.
In addition to opposition to the annual confab of global business and political leaders in Davos, about 150 km (93 miles) from Zurich, that included a visit from U.S. President Donald Trump, demonstrators called for swifter action on climate change.
Some demonstrators marched with banners proclaiming ""Stop the Climate Crisis,"" while others ignited boxes in the middle of the street, and windows of surrounding shops were smeared with slogans including ""Smash WEF.""
Despite organizers calls for non-violence, police said, some of those marching ignited fireworks near crowds, including onlookers, and caused property damage in the ""thousands of Swiss francs"".

Varadkar's Fine Gael party trails its fellow center-right rival in opinion polls that suggest whichever party finishes on top on Feb. 8 would struggle to form a coalition government with a collection of smaller parties.
As both refuse to govern with the country's third-largest party, Sinn Fein, that leaves another minority government where one of the main parties props up the other from the opposition benches as the only alternative to a grand coalition.
Varadkar's predecessor, Enda Kenny, proposed entering such a coalition for the first time after the last election in 2016.
It took Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin less than 24 hours for Fianna Fail to reject that offer and it instead entered a ""confidence and supply"" arrangement, facilitating the Fine Gael-led minority administration from opposition.
""We have to be grown-ups and my preference would be to form a coalition with old partners, but if the only way that we can form a stable government is for Fine Gael and Fianna Fail to work together, well I'm willing to do that,"" Varadkar said in the first head-to-head televised debate with Martin.
""If it's the only way. ... I'm willing to work with Fianna Fail whether that means a confidence and supply agreement or whether it means coalition.""
Martin said he believed there was a need for a new government, but was not asked directly if he would consider a coalition with Fine Gael."

KINGSTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, on a visit to Jamaica on Wednesday, cautioned nations against taking ""easy money"" from China, warning it could be counterproductive, in a second attack in as many days against China's economic role in the region.
Pompeo has been a vocal critic of Chinese investments across the globe that the United States terms ""debt diplomacy,"" alleging that it leaves poorer nations saddled with too much debt.
On a final stop of his Western Hemisphere tour, Pompeo questioned what value Chinese money brings if it ""feeds corruption and undermines your rule of law.""
""Look into those investments if in fact they ruin your environment, and don't create jobs for your people,"" Pompeo added.
On Tuesday, he drew the ire of Chinese officials when he said ""flashy"" Chinese economic promises often produces debt dependency and erode the sovereignty of borrower nations.
China's embassy in Costa Rica responded in a statement that Pompeo spoke ""irresponsibly"" during his remarks in Costa Rica, saying his assertions were ""arbitrary and without grounds.""
While in Kingston, Pompeo also doubled down on his criticism of Venezuela's government, telling Caribbean nations that they should look to boost ties with Washington instead.
The days when Venezuela could use its petrodollars to win over neighbors are over, Pompeo said.
He predicted that Venezuela's oil program in the Caribbean, launched in 2005 and known as Petrocaribe, was ""fading into the sunset"" along with President Nicolas Maduro's administration.
Pompeo's remarks came after Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA announced in a statement that Maduro was ""committed to relaunching Petrocaribe with force."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court appeared divided on Wednesday in a major legal battle over taxpayer funds going to religious schools, with Chief Justice John Roberts emerging as the potential pivotal vote in a Montana case that could open the door to more public aid for faith-based institutions.
The nine justices heard about an hour of arguments over a Montana tax credit program beneficial to private religious schools. Three mothers of students at a Christian school in Kalispell, Montana challenged a lower court ruling that struck down the program as a violation of the state constitution's ban on government aid to religious schools and churches.
The ruling in the case, expected by the end of June, could narrow the separation of church and state.
Some conservative justices expressed sympathy for the challengers, suggesting that excluding religious schools from the tax credit program amounts to impermissible discrimination. Liberal justices countered that there was no discrimination because the entire program had been struck down. The court has a 5-4 conservative majority.
Roberts, a traditional conservative who is considered the court's ideological center, asked questions that reflected a concern for public education and for the protection of religious people. Roberts questioned how public school funding could be affected. He also wondered whether discrimination seen in this case is different from racial discrimination in a scenario such as officials shutting down all public swimming pools that could be used by African Americans. 
Roberts is doing double duty, afterward presiding over President Donald Trump's impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate.
The mothers of Stillwater Christian School students sued in 2015, arguing that excluding religious school pupils from a scholarship program that helped pay tuition costs violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution to free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law.
'SCHOOL CHOICE'
Churches and Christian groups in the United States have pushed for years to expand access to public dollars for religious schools and places of worship, testing the limits of secularism in the United States. 
Much of the litigation has involved attempts to create vouchers or other subsidies for private religious schools in states like Montana whose constitutions explicitly ban such funding. Republican President Donald Trump's education secretary, Betsy DeVos, is a prominent supporter of such ""school choice"" plans. The plaintiffs in the Montana case are backed by Trump's administration.
Critics of the programs have said they would siphon off scarce resources from public schools. These critics have said a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs would require taxpayers to underwrite religious institutions - despite the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on government establishment of religion. They also said some of these religious institutions may discriminate against LGBT students or employees.
The Montana case gives the court a chance to build on its major 2017 religious rights ruling in favor of a Missouri church, Trinity Lutheran, that challenged its exclusion from state playground improvement grants generally available to other nonprofit groups. 
The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 in that case that churches and other religious entities cannot be flatly denied public money even in states whose constitutions explicitly ban such funding. But the ruling was narrow and emphasized it was not addressing ""religious uses of funding or other forms of discrimination.""
On Wednesday, some liberal justices emphasized that while that case involved excluding a church from a secular benefit, the Montana case involves subsidizing religious activity. 
""That's a far cry from Trinity Lutheran,"" liberal Justice Elena Kagan said, adding that a state might not want to subsidize religious entities out of concern for burdening religion or promoting divisiveness.
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer wondered whether a ruling for the plaintiffs would require states to fund private religious schools as they do secular public schools.
The Montana tax credit program at issue in the case, created in 2015, provided up to $150 as an incentive for donations to groups that fund scholarships for private school tuition. The one such scholarship organization currently operating provides $500 payments to schools, primarily to help low-income students attend.
State tax officials limited the program to non-religious schools in order to comport with the state constitution, which forbids public aid to any ""church, sect or denomination."" Thirty-eight states have such constitutional provisions. 
Conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who is Catholic, noted that those provisions were historically ""rooted in grotesque religious bigotry against Catholics."" He wondered how barring religious people from the tax credit benefit is not ""telling them that they're not entitled to equal treatment under the Constitution?""

The Montana Supreme Court in 2018 struck down the scholarship program entirely because it could be used to pay for religious schools. Most private schools in Montana are religious.

""I’ll get to Ukraine before too long,"" Pompeo said in an interview with Bloomberg while visiting Kingston, Jamaica, as opening statements began in Trump's impeachment trial in the U.S. Senate.

Democrats have accused Trump, a Republican, of pressuring Ukraine to investigate former Democratic Vice President Joe Biden, a political rival, and impeding the inquiry into the matter.
Pompeo earlier this month postponed a scheduled trip to Ukraine, which was intended to reaffirm U.S. support for the country, in order to focus on the situation in Iraq after demonstrators attacked the U.S. embassy there.

Malawi opposition parties are challenging the state electoral commission's May 27 declaration of President Peter Mutharika as the victor despite complaints of irregularities including results sheets with sections blotted out or altered with correction fluid.
The small, landlocked country has since been plagued by protests and demands for Mutharika to resign.
On Dec. 8, the ACB received a complaint alleging that some people were attempting to bribe the five judges of the Constitutional Court. It arrested Thomson Mpinganjira on Wednesday in connection with the allegations, it said in a statement.
""Dr Mpinganjira will be taken to court after the ACB has recorded a statement from him,"" said ACB spokesperson Egrita Ndala.
Mpinganjira spent the afternoon at the ACB offices in Blantyre. Hundreds of people gathered and chanted ""Thief! Thief!"" as he was being whisked away by tight security to a police station.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Former Lebanese foreign minister Gebran Bassil appealed to world leaders on Wednesday to help save his country from becoming a ""failed state"" amid a spiraling financial crisis.
Lebanon is hoping a new government formed on Tuesday can win the financial support of donors it needs to climb from a deep economic emergency as increasingly violent protests threaten to tip the country into a more serious conflict at a time of wider regional turmoil.
Speaking to Reuters at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Bassil, who leads the largest Christian political bloc in Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system, said the country was a model of co-existence that could ""be the real antidote to terrorism"", if only kept stable.
""It's a country that we need to preserve in order to play that role and expand it, not to make it fail and become in the rank of failed states. This will not help the Lebanese. This will not help any country in the region,"" he said.
Analysts have said the influence of Iranian-backed Hezbollah in the newly formed cabinet, which is also supported by Bassil's party, could hurt Lebanon's ability to win foreign funds needed to meet debt obligations and stabilize its financial system.
Bassil, the influential son-in-law of President Michel Aoun, has been a top target of protesters who see him as a symbol of a corrupt political order that has driven the country to the brink of collapse through mismanagement and waste of public funds.
His attendance at the global Davos forum sparked online petitions by some Lebanese who say he does not represent them.
Bassil rejected the accusations as a ""generalization"" of corruption charges against the country's elite. ""I personally am the only politician in Lebanon who revealed his account statements, and no one dared to do the same.""
He said he had asked Switzerland, the United States and others to help uncover potentially illicit transactions of Lebanese public servants and political personalities, part of a broader effort to crack down on corruption.
""Let all the accounts of politicians and public servants now be revealed by the special commission that we have in the central bank,"" said Bassil."

""Disinformation has been weaponized to discredit democratic institutions, sow societal distrust, and attack political candidates,"" the report said.
The think-tank outlined a long list of proposals that would place government and industry checks on social media firm and would also require them to strengthen their internal controls.
""Social media has proved a useful tool for extremist groups to send messages of hate and to incite violence,"" the think-tank added, pointing to elections in the U.S., Kenya, the Philippines, and Nigeria, as examples.

""Yes I took a risk to leave ... my return will be risky,"" he told a news conference following talks with EU lawmakers. 
""It is sadistic what he (Maduro) is doing. He is torturing people, he is arresting people. Eighty percent of people in Venezuela can't get proper water supplies. There is no electricity.""
Comparing Venezuela's plight to Syria and Yemen, Guaido said Maduro's attempts to prevent him from being re-elected as the head of the opposition earlier this month had made him more determined to see the president unseated from power.
He said several of his assistants in Caracas had been arrested in his absence. Guaido went on Tuesday to London, where he met British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, then to Brussels and will go to the World Economic Forum in Davos on Thursday. 
""We need to put pressure on the dictatorship obviously. Sanctions will do that. We need to try to do everything possible to do that,"" he said, adding that he was ""hoping for a miracle.""
EU countries, which recognize Guaido as interim president of Venezuela, have imposed economic sanctions on 25 Venezuelans close to Maduro, but have opted for a softer approach compared to the United States, seeking to help mediate talks toward new elections with Norway and Latin American countries.

Guaido also appealed to EU governments to prohibit the trade of Venezuelan gold, a source of income for Maduro as oil production collapses, saying it was ""blood gold"" financing oppression.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's approval rating has surged, thanks to an improving economy and his government's efforts to fight corruption and make Brazil's cities safer, according to a poll released on Wednesday.
The CNT/MDA poll showed Brazilians are more worried about the economy, jobs and public security than controversies that surround Bolsonaro, who had to fire his culture secretary last week for copying Nazi propaganda chief Goebbels in a speech.
Reversing a steady decline in popularity in his first year in office, the number of Brazilians who viewed his government as great or good climbed to 34.5% from 29.4% in August, the survey showed, while 31% now see the government as bad or terrible, down from 39.5% previously.
Bolsonaro's personal approval rating jumped to 47.8% from 41% in August, while those who disapprove of the way he is governing Brazil dropped to 47% from 53.7% in August.
The areas in which his government is considered to have performed well include fighting corruption, boosting the economy and public security, while it is seen as falling short on health, education and the environment, according to the survey.
Though the next presidential election is not until 2022, if the vote was held today, Bolsonaro would have a solid lead over former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the poll found, backed by 29.1% of those surveyed versus 17.0% for the once-popular leftist leader.
""This poll is very good for Bolsonaro,"" said Lucas de Aragão, a partner in Brasilia's ARKO Advice consultancy.
Economic growth is expected to more than double its pace to 2.3% this year, there is a steady decline in unemployment and a significant drop in the world's highest homicide rate, he said.
""Brazilians are far more worried about public safety, employment, inflation and the real economy than with issues such as Nazism,"" Aragão said. ""If the economy continues to expand and Bolsonaro steers clear of corruption scandals, his popularity will rise further.""

Commissioned by transport sector lobby CNT, the poll was carried out by MDA and surveyed 2,002 people from Jan. 15-18. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia must remain a strong presidential republic, President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday when asked about a possible transitional period once he steps down in 2024. 
Last week Putin, who under the constitution cannot run for another presidential term, proposed constitutional changes that would give him scope to extend his grip on power after leaving the presidency.
The suggestions include reducing the powers of the presidency and beefing up those of the prime minister, prompting speculation that Putin might be eyeing a return to a job he held from 2008 to 2012.
""Our country, obviously, has to be a strong presidential republic. That's the first thing. And then, we have so many ethnic groups, nationalities, ways of life, it is practically impossible to integrate in the framework of a parliamentary republic,"" Putin said, in comments which seemed to contradict last week's message.
Putin, who is 67, was speaking at a televised meeting with Russian students in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Asked by one student whether Russia should consider setting up some kind of transitional institution as happened in Singapore, Putin said this was not appropriate for his country.
Lee Kuan Yew, the founding father of modern Singapore, was named the Minister Mentor, an advisory position, after his retirement from active politics, to help provide stability.
""He was an outstanding man... That's true, he was, I don't know, around 30 years in power, and he founded the country, that's true... You want me to be the Minister Mentor?""

DAVOS, Switzerland/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday said he did not consider the brain injuries suffered by 11 U.S. service members in Iran's recent attack on a base in Iraq to be serious, as the American military moved more troops out of the region for potential injuries. 
In a statement on Wednesday, U.S. Central Command said that more troops had been flown out of Iraq to Germany for medical evaluations following Iran's Jan. 8 missile attack on the base where U.S. forces were stationed after announcing the 11 injuries last week. 
Further injuries may be identified in the future, it added, without giving further details.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said about a dozen troops were being transported to Germany. 
Trump and other top officials initially said Iran's attack had not killed or injured any U.S. service members before the Pentagon reversed course on Thursday, saying 11 U.S. troops had been treated for concussion symptoms after the attack on the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq.
On Wednesday, Trump declined to explain the discrepancy.
""I heard that they had headaches and a couple of other things, but I would say and I can report it is not very serious,"" Trump told a news conference in Davos, Switzerland.
Asked whether he considered traumatic brain injury to be serious, Trump said: ""They told me about it numerous days later. You'd have to ask the Department of Defense.""
Pentagon officials have said there had been no effort to minimize or delay information on concussive injuries, but its handling of the injuries following Tehran's attack has renewed questions over the U.S. military's policy regarding how it handles suspected brain injuries. 
While the U.S. military has to immediately report incidents threatening life, limb or eyesight, it does not have an urgent requirement to do so with suspected traumatic brain injury, or TBI, which can take time to manifest and diagnose. 
According to Pentagon data, about 408,000 service members have been diagnosed with traumatic brain injury since 2000.
""I don't consider them very serious injuries relative to other injuries I have seen,"" Trump said. ""I've seen people with no legs and no arms.""

Various health and medial groups for years have been trying to raise awareness about the seriousness of brain injuries, including concussions.

Encouraged by a high turnout in last May's European Parliament elections, the Commission proposes that EU institutions and officials engage in discussions with the bloc's roughly half a billion citizens over the next two years on what kind of EU they want.
The project, called the Conference on the Future of Europe, aims to counter the kind of alienation and distrust of Brussels that helped fuel Britain's decision in a 2016 referendum to leave the EU after more than four decades of membership.
""The overarching aim of the Conference on the Future of Europe is to encourage European citizens and make it easier for them to get involved in democracy beyond the European elections,"" the Commission said.
The final concept, structure, scope and timing of the project are still to be agreed between the European Parliament, national governments and the Commission, but the initial idea is to gather citizens' feedback and views through conferences, panels and debates as well as a multilingual website.

The Commission, governments and the parliament would pledge to abide by the results in policy-making, and even change EU treaties if such was the conclusion of the process.

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - A confident Carrie Lam said on Wednesday that Hong Kong had several crises to manage, but insisted she was staying on as the Chinese-ruled city's leader, dismissing calls to step down.
At times laughing and smiling, Beijing-backed Lam told the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos that she had to stay on to tackle an economic crisis and the coronavirus, which has killed 17 people in mainland China.
Lam is on a mission to the Swiss Alps to reassure global leaders meeting there that the Asian financial center is open for business, despite months of anti-government protests and ""nothing is more important than the rule of law"".
""It would be very easy to just run away from a situation. It's very difficult to govern and implement policies. For those who understand the political structure, leaving that position vacant would only create more confusion,"" she said.
Lam's remarks contrast with comments made in August. In a recording obtained by Reuters she told a private meeting of business people she had caused ""unforgivable havoc"" by igniting the crisis and would quit if allowed to do so.
The coronavirus could not come at a worse time for Hong Kong, whose status as a financial center has come under scrutiny as images of sometimes violent street clashes between police and protesters have been beamed live to the world since June.
""While people focus on what has happened in Hong Kong, what has not happened in the last months is massive bloodshed on Hong Kong streets.... A curfew has not happened. The gagging of the media has not happened,"" Lam said.
Speaking hours after Hong Kong quarantined a man ""highly suspected"" to have contracted China's new flu-like virus, Lam said robust processes were in place and the city had learned lessons from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 300 people in the city in 2003.
""My health colleagues are really on guard. With this rapid flow of people across the border we are vulnerable,"" she added.
NEW YEAR FEAR
Tens of millions of Chinese start traveling this week to celebrate Lunar New Year, heightening fears of contagion of the coronavirus, which has killed 17 people in mainland China and rattled global markets.
Memories of the impact of SARS still haunt Hong Kong and any repeat would batter an economy that sank into recession in the third quarter as months of protests took a heavy toll.
Since its return to Beijing in 1997, the former British colony has been governed under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees it broad freedoms not seen in mainland China, including an independent judiciary and free press.
Some demonstrators accuse Beijing of meddling in the city's affairs, which it denies.
The revolt in the global financial center has dealt a major setback to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who said in December Hong Kong's situation in 2019 ""was the most complex and difficult since its return to the motherland.""
Lam said Xi was ""definitely"" committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula of governance, which was ""sacrosanct""."

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Longstanding plans to increase Ireland's statutory retirement age and the knock-on effects on pension payments have become an unexpected issue ahead of the Feb. 8 election, putting the government on the back foot.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called the election last week, but a pitch putting his diplomatic successes on Brexit at the center of the campaign has fallen flat with an electorate more concerned about deficits in housing and healthcare.
The issue of pensions has dominated the campaign in recent days amid anger from some private sector workers over being forced to retire at 65 but having to sign up for unemployment benefit until their state pension kicks in aged 66.
Similar to other countries, Ireland raised the retirement age to 66 in 2014 but it is the long laid-out plan to raise it again to 67 from next year that has exercised older voters. The threshold is due to increase again to 68 in 2028.
""It's the pension, stupid. That's what's going to win the election,"" Eugene, a 65-year-old caller to national broadcaster RTE's Liveline phone-in talk show, said on Wednesday.
He was referring to Bill Clinton's successful 1992 U.S. presidential slogan: ""It's the economy, stupid!""
""It's a bridge too far (moving the age to 67), and they thought they'd get away with it.""
The pension age has dominated Liveline, the second most listened-to radio program in the country, in recent days.
Sinn Fein, Ireland's third largest party which an opinion poll on Monday put just two points behind Varadkar's Fine Gael and four shy of the main opposition Fianna Fail, may have struck a chord with voters by calling for the retirement age to be brought back to 65.
While the two larger parties refuse to govern with Sinn Fein - the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), a potential government partner, the smaller Labour Party, also wants the qualifying age to return to 65.
The debate has resulted in Fine Gael and Fianna Fail committing to introduce a transition payment equivalent to the contributory state pension so that workers retiring at 65 do not need to claim unemployment benefit to make up the difference.
Fianna Fail, currently leading in the polls, has also said it will review the qualifying age if elected.
""It has to be acknowledged that this is a very significant issue at the doorsteps,"" Fianna Fail finance spokesman Michael McGrath, the favorite to become Ireland's next finance minister, told a news conference on Wednesday."

Waving Greek flags and banners reading ""We want our islands back!"" thousands of demonstrators participated in a protest organized by local authorities on the northern Aegean islands of Samos, Lesbos and Chios.
""There should be no more warehouses of suffering souls in the northern Aegean,"" said Costas Moutzouris, the regional governor.
Shops remained shut and public services were disrupted on the islands during a walkout on Wednesday as part of the protest. Protesters demand that migrants be moved to the mainland and that refugees be allowed to leave the country.
""Our islands can no longer be prisons. Along with migrants and refugees we are also being imprisoned,"" said Stratis Ververis, one of the protesters. ""The migration issue must be dealt with immediately."" 
Greece was the main gateway into the European Union for more than a million migrants fleeing conflict in 2015-16 and crossing through Turkey.
Last year, 59,726 migrants and refugees reached Greece's shores according to the UN agency UNHCR. Nearly 80% of them arrived on Lesbos, Chios or Samos.
Aid groups have described the living conditions of about 36,000 people in camps operating far beyond their capacity as appalling. 
""The situation is really bad. There is no water, no electricity, the weather is really cold. We cannot sleep in the tent to brave the cold,"" said one unnamed migrant.
The conservative government elected in July has announced plans to ""decongest"" the islands, shut down existing refugee camps and replace them with holding centers in roughly the same areas that will process new arrivals and people whose asylum applications have been rejected.
The centers that will close include the notorious Moria camp on Lesbos which was set up to accommodate 3,000 people but hosts at least five times that number.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - ""Go outside,"" French President Emmanuel Macron demanded in English in a melee with Israeli security men on Wednesday, demanding they leave a Jerusalem basilica that he visited before a Holocaust memorial conference.
The French tricolor has flown over the Church of St. Anne in Jerusalem's walled Old City since it was gifted by the Ottomans to French Emperor Napoleon III in 1856.
France views it as a provocation when Israeli police enter the church's sandstone complex, in a part of Jerusalem captured and annexed by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
Wednesday's incident was a case of deja vu all over again. In 1996, former President Jacques Chirac lost patience with Israeli security agents at the same church, telling one of them that his treatment was a ""provocation"" and threatening to get back on his plane.
Chirac refused to enter St. Anne until Israeli security left the site.
Video showed Macron, jostled in the center of a crowded circle between his own protective detail and Israeli security personnel, including several paramilitary policemen in uniform, under an archway leading into the church.
Macron then stopped the shoving and shouted at the Israeli security guards in English: ""I don't like what you did in front of me.""
Lowering his voice, he then said: ""Go outside. I'm sorry, you know the rules. Nobody has to provoke nobody.""
Asked about the incident, an Israeli police spokesman declined comment. An Israeli government spokesman did not immediately provide comment on behalf of the Shin Bet internal security agency, which also helps guard foreign dignitaries.
French diplomats had cautioned that they want to leave little room for mishaps on Macron's trip. Earlier on Wednesday, a separate squabble ensued when Israeli police tried to enter St. Anne ahead of Macron's visit.
Macron is one of dozens of world leaders due to attend Thursday's World Holocaust Forum at the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial center in Jerusalem, which will commemorate the 75-year anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp.
The 42-year-old head of state had seen his visit to St. Anne as a symbolic stop underscoring Paris' historical influence in the region.
Before heading to the church, Macron walked through the Old City, speaking to shopkeepers and stopping by the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
He later visited the Muslim Noble Sanctuary in Jerusalem that houses al-Aqsa mosque, a site revered by Jews as the Temple Mount, and Judaism's Western Wall."
470,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 11:06AM ET</span>",Soleimani killing adds dangerous new dimension to Iraq unrest,"By Aziz El Yaakoubi and Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iranian-backed Shi'ite factions have exhorted Iraqis to turn out for a ""million-strong"" march on Friday aimed at whipping up anti-American sentiment as the United States' struggle with Iran plays out on the streets of Baghdad.
Those behind the rally have two goals in mind - to pressure Washington to pull its troops out of Iraq, and to eclipse the mass anti-government protests that have challenged their grip on power.
It is likely to end up at the gates of the U.S. Embassy, the seat of U.S. power in Iraq and the scene of violent clashes last month when militia supporters tried to storm the compound. It could turn nasty again.
The U.S. killing of Iranian military mastermind General Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad this month has given renewed impetus to Iran's allies in Iraq.
But it has also raised the specter of more civil strife in a country torn by years of sectarian conflict, lawmakers, protesters and analysts say.
""The assassination threw the political classes, and Iran-leaning actors in particular, a lifeline,"" said Fanar Haddad, senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Middle East Institute.
""It created a counter-cause and a counter-crisis that pushed the protests out of the news cycle - albeit briefly.""
The call for Friday's ""million-strong"" march came from cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who opposes all foreign interference in Iraq but has recently aligned himself more closely with Iran.
Protesters who have separately camped out for months in Baghdad and southern cities demonstrating against the corrupt, Iran-allied government, fear the worst.
""This million-man march is different from what the street wants. It supports the current political system in the country, it doesn't oppose it,"" said Abdul Rahman al-Ghazali, a protester at Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ), a center of the uprising.
Ghazali and other demonstrators said their movement risked being sidelined by the strength in numbers – and weapons – of those marching against the United States.
""I am not going to take part in the upcoming protests against America,"" said student Hussein Ali.
BRINK OF WAR
The killing of Soleimani and Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone attack brought Iraq and the wider region to the brink of war between Tehran and Washington.
The biggest loser is Iraq, where both powers vie for influence. More than 5,000 U.S. troops remain in the country 17 years after the invasion that overthrew Saddam Hussein.
After an unlikely alliance of Iraqi forces, a U.S.-led coalition and the Iran-backed Shi'ite militias defeated Islamic State in 2017, Iraq went through two years of relative calm.
Unrest that broke out in October when security forces began killing mostly peaceful demonstrators shattered that calm, and U.S.-Iran tension has added to the chaos.
The protests have been dominated by young people, a generation blighted by rampant unemployment, a corruption-ridden political caste and the years of conflict. Despite Iraq's oil wealth, many people languish in poverty.
More than 450 people have been killed as security forces have fired live ammunition, rubber bullets and tear-gas canisters directly at protesters, with battles raging on three bridges over the River Tigris leading to Baghdad's Green Zone.
Friday's march risks clashes between the anti-government protesters and the militia supporters who back the parties that control government and parliament.
Analyst Haddad said the anti-government protests would persist, however. The authorities should not fail to form a new government, he added.
Iraqi factions have been wrangling for weeks over who will succeed caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned in November under pressure from the street.
SECTARIAN DIVISIONS RESURFACE
The fallout from Soleimani's killing also laid bare a further fracturing of Iraqi politics, both amongst Shi'ite Muslims and once again on the sectarian lines dividing Shi'ites and Sunnis.
Sadr and the Iran-aligned leaders intensified calls this month for U.S. troops to withdraw - a rare show of unity between rival Shi'ite groups. But such unity is not expected to last long and power struggles will continue, lawmakers say.
Disagreements between Sadr and his main political rival Hadi al-Amiri, whose alliance of Iran-backed militias holds vast sway in parliament, could delay the process further.
Sadr vetoed the imminent nomination of a new prime minister backed by Amiri this week, several lawmakers said.
For the first time in nearly two years, parliament voted along sectarian lines to press the government to kick out U.S. forces. Shi'ite parties voted in favor, while Sunni Muslim and Kurdish lawmakers boycotted the session.
""When Iraq faced the security challenge of IS, there was a healthy political process, but now the country is broken and this is gone,"" said a senior Iraqi politician who spoke on condition of anonymity.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has signaled he will not accept any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, which will enact Britain's departure from the EU on Jan. 31, facing down opposition lawmakers who say he has hardened its terms.
Earlier this week, the upper house of parliament, or House of Lords, made several changes to the legislation, including a clause to ensure protections for child refugees after Brexit.
But on Wednesday, the lower house, or House of Commons, where Johnson holds a large majority, voted to reject the changes proposed by the House of Lords, including over the rights of EU citizens in Britain after Brexit.
The bill will now return to the House of Lords, where peers could try again to change it in a process known as ping-pong, when legislation can bounce between the chambers until both sign it off.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Russian government reshuffle that brought in a new first deputy prime minister and a new economy minister is an attempt by President Vladimir Putin to secure his economic legacy, say two sources close to the government, but it also carries risks.
The reshuffle, which remodeled the government's economic decision-making bloc, is fuelling concerns about higher state spending and inflation risks, though analysts say they expect Russia's robust fiscal framework to survive.
Putin approved the new government on Tuesday and described it as a break with the past.
The sources said Putin hopes the reshuffle will help accelerate implementation of a vast state spending plan seen as the centerpiece of what may be his final presidential term.
The plan envisages breathing new life into Russia's stagnant economy by spending more than 25 trillion rubles ($404 billion) between now and 2024 on major projects in 13 areas, including health, education and infrastructure.
In the reshuffle, Andrei Belousov, Putin's economic adviser since 2013 and a key architect of the spending plans, was appointed first deputy prime minister, replacing Finance Minister Anton Siluanov who had held that role since May 2018.
Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Reshetnikov, a former regional governor, was appointed Russia's new economy minister, replacing Maxim Oreshkin.
Putin, 67, is due to step down as president in 2024, though many say a proposed constitutional shake-up he is pushing through at the moment is designed to allow him to continue wielding influence in another role.
Dmitry Medvedev, Russia's prime minister since 2012, had been in charge of implementing the economic plan until Putin abruptly replaced him last week with former tax chief Mikhail Mishustin.
""Putin could see (Medvedev) wasn't doing anything, it was infuriating that he was just sitting and waiting for the presidency to fall to him again,"" said one of the sources who regularly meets Russian officials.
Medvedev served as Russia's president from 2008 to 2012 as the constitution barred Putin for a third consecutive term.
VISIBLE REBOOT
Putin had grown unhappy with Medvedev's failure to deliver at a time when falling real wages and declining government popularity risked deepening public anger, another source close to the government said.
The second source said Putin was concerned about the impact of falling living standards and a plan to hike the pension age, and wanted a visible reboot to assuage public anxiety and speed up the roll-out of his national projects.
""We need to realize the national projects more actively so that people feel changes to their lives and around them soon,"" Mishustin, Putin's new prime minister, told his cabinet at their first meeting on Tuesday.
However, the promotion of Belousov, who has a reputation as a proponent of state capitalism, is causing concern among some investors.
His appointment ""implies a shift from the economic agenda and tight fiscal policy to spending and the National Projects,"" Alfa Bank said in a note to clients.
Higher state spending could create inflationary risks, which will limit room for further rate cuts by the central bank while wiping out Russia's budget surplus.
In the old set-up, Finance Minister Siluanov had been crucial in implementing a prudent fiscal policy, known as the budget rule, designed to shield the economy from swings in the price of oil.
But his demotion and Belousov's elevation open the door to possible change.
""The appointment of Belousov raises concerns about a softening of fiscal policy,"" said Kirill Tremasov, a former economy ministry official who heads research at Locko Invest firm.
However, Moody's credit rating agency said Russia would be able to cope with higher state spending, given its low public debt and the rebuilding of fiscal reserves following the implementation of its fiscal rule in 2018 and some spending under-execution in recent years."

The status of Abyei was supposed to have been resolved via referendum after a 2005 peace deal that preceded South Sudan's 2011 secession from Sudan, but the vote has never been held.
The area, which has oil reserves, is populated by the Ngor Dinka ethnic community and the Arab Misseriya, who usually foray from Sudan into South Sudan with their animals for grazing.
Wednesday's attack unfolded at 7 a.m. local time, said Kuol Alor Kuol, head of the Abyei administration, when the tribesmen stormed the Dinka village of Kolom near Abyei town and set some of its dwellings ablaze.
""Bodies got burned and you cannot recognize them,"" Kuol said.
It was not immediately clear whether all the dead died in burning homes. Kuol said another 18 villagers were injured in the assault before the tribesmen withdrew.
""The situation at the moment is calm and the (Abyei-area) residents ... have all gone back. They are now preparing mass graves for the victims,"" he said.
The attackers probably aimed to drive locals out of the remote, poorly governed area to enhance their access to grazing resources, Kuol said.
There was no immediate comment from the Misseriya.
Oil-producing South Sudan plunged into civil war two years after its 2011 independence when President Salva Kiir sacked former rebel leader Riek Machar as vice president.
After five years of fighting, Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal but they are still struggling to form a unity government.
The conflict killed an estimated 400,000 people, triggered a famine and created Africa's biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 genocide in Rwanda."

Three people remained missing four days after Gloria began pummeling the region with torrential rain and heavy snowfall alike. Rescue officials said the missing included a 25-year-old Briton on the island of Ibiza and a man who fell into the Mediterranean as he tried to moor his boat in Palamos port. 
The storm began receding on Wednesday after leaving more than 200,000 people without power at times, destroying rice paddies in the Ebro river delta and triggering weather alerts for three dozen provinces.
Gloria ranks as the worst sea storm since 2003 ""and likely of this century"", Dani Palacios, head of beach services for Barcelona in the northeast, told local broadcaster BETEVE. 
Spanish police said they had found the body of a person in an Alicante river while a source at rescue services said another person died after a building collapsed in nearby Alcoy, likely due to heavy rainfall. 
A man working in a greenhouse was killed as hail pounded the structure, a mayor in the province of Almeria told Efe news agency, while authorities in Valencia province blamed the death of a homeless person on frigid cold brought by the storm.
Sea water poured into the Ebro delta, one of Spain's most important wetlands, inundating thousands of hectares of rice plants. ""We can't remember anything similar ever happening,"" local mayor Lluis Soler told Cadena Ser radio. 
""It's dramatic to see how the river has overflowed and the sea has traveled kilometers inland."" 
Waves in the western Mediterranean hit a record-breaking height of 13.5 meters (44.5 feet), port authorities said, slamming into seafront shops flooding municipalities. 

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez tweeted his ""support and solidarity for the families of the victims of Storm Gloria and those suffering its the fatal consequences.""

SAN FRANCISCO/CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman may have been involved in a plot to hack the phone of Amazon's billionaire boss Jeff Bezos, United Nations experts said on Wednesday.
The U.N. special rapporteurs, Agnes Callamard and David Kaye, said they had information pointing to the ""possible involvement"" of the prince in the alleged 2018 cyberattack. Saudi officials have dismissed the allegations as absurd.
Cybersecurity experts hired by Bezos, the world's richest man, concluded his phone was probably infiltrated by a video file sent from a WhatsApp account purportedly belonging to Prince Mohammed in 2018, according to a person familiar with the matter.
They said the device began leaking massive amounts of data about a month afterwards, the source said.
Callamard, the special rapporteur for extra-judicial killings, and Kaye, special rapporteur for free expression, said the allegation of Saudi involvement ""demands immediate investigation by U.S. and other relevant authorities"".
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud dismissed the allegations on Wednesday.
""I think 'absurd' is exactly the right word,"" he told Reuters in an interview in Davos. ""The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos’ phone is absolutely silly.""
The allegations could nonetheless further damage relations between tech tycoon Bezos and Riyadh, and risk harming the kingdom's reputation with foreign powers and investors.
The alleged cyberattack is said to have taken place months before the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a fierce critic of the Saudi government and a columnist for the Bezos-owned Washington Post.
Prince Mohammed, or MbS, said last year that the killing was carried out by rogue operatives and that he did not order it.
NATIONAL ENQUIRER
In another previous flashpoint, Bezos' security chief said last year that the Saudi government had gained access to the Amazon CEO's phone and leaked messages to U.S. tabloid the National Enquirer between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, a former TV anchor who the newspaper said he was dating.
A month before, Bezos had accused the newspaper's owner of trying to blackmail him with the threat of publishing ""intimate photos"" he allegedly sent to Sanchez.
The Saudi government has denied having anything to do with the National Enquirer reporting.
The Guardian first reported the crown prince's alleged involvement in a phone hacking plot on Bezos.
Saudi Arabia's U.S. embassy also dismissed the allegations.

Dorin Florea, mayor of the central city of Targu Mures, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) the European Union state should screen would-be parents for stable jobs, financial resources, age and education levels, and even remove children from families who do not fit the criteria.
""I don't think we should boost demographics at any cost,"" Florea added. His comments came as parliament voted in December to double subsidies for school children.
""There are many underprivileged families in Romania, I am ... talking about people able to work who don't want to work and who are having children with the sole purpose of having a source of income. This environment generates high crime rates, (school) drop-outs, lack of an education.""
Asked to clarify what he meant, Florea later told online news publication HotNews.ro that ""gypsies are a serious problem for Romania and we're pretending we're not seeing it"".
The Roma are Europe's largest ethnic minority. Out of an estimated 10-12 million, more than half live in the EU, which Romania joined in 2007, and many are victims of prejudice and social exclusion.
In Romania, the World Bank has estimated nine out of 10 Roma live in severe material deprivation, most of them children, lacking access to basic education and healthcare.
Social inclusion programs and anti-discrimination laws are in place, but racism against the minority goes back centuries in the country, where Roma were kept as slaves by monasteries or local overlords until the 19th century.
Roughly 25,000 Roma were deported from Romanian-controlled territory during World War Two, when the country was an ally of Nazi Germany. Almost half of them died.
The anti-discrimination watchdog found Florea infringed on the right to dignity of an ethnic minority and fined him 10,000 lei ($2,320).
Florea, a 63-year-old doctor who has been mayor of Targu Mures since 2000, has said he will not retract his comments and that he will challenge the fine."
478,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 22, 2020 09:28AM ET</span>","Facing economic crisis, Lebanon's government weighs options","By Tom Perry and Ellen Francis
BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon's Hezbollah-backed government will walk a political tightrope as it moves to urgently secure foreign funding to ward off financial collapse and could look to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for assistance.
Formed by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and its allies, the cabinet faces an economic crisis at a time when Gulf states, who along with Washington label Hezbollah a terrorist group, appear no longer willing to bail out Lebanon.
President Michel Aoun tasked the government at its first meeting on Wednesday with restoring international confidence which could unlock funding and ease a liquidity crunch that hit the Lebanese pound, fueled inflation and forced bank controls.
A senior politician, Alain Aoun, told Reuters on Wednesday that an IMF program is an option for Lebanon depending on terms that should be bearable for the country and not trigger social unrest.
Prime Minister Hassan Diab, whose cabinet took final shape as long-running protests against the country's political elite continued on Tuesday, is backed by Hezbollah and allies including the Free Patriotic Movement (FPM) founded by President Aoun.
Lebanon had been without effective government since Saad al-Hariri, the country's main Sunni leader and a traditional ally of the West and Gulf states, quit as premier in October amid widespread protests against politicians who have led Lebanon into its worst crisis since the 1975-90 war. 
Lebanon sovereign dollar-bonds moved higher by as much as 1 cent on Wednesday with the formation of the new government after weeks of wrangling over portfolios.
""DELICATE MISSION""
Lebanon, burdened with a public debt equivalent to about 150% of GDP, won pledges exceeding $11 billion at an international conference in April 2018 conditional on reforms that it has so far failed to implement. 
""Your mission is delicate,"" Aoun's office cited him as telling the cabinet. ""It is necessary to work to tackle the economic situation, restore the confidence of the international community in Lebanese institutions and reassure the Lebanese about their future.""
Diab has said his first trip abroad would be to the Gulf Arab region, but he will have his work cut out to reassure U.S.-allied rulers there who are concerned about Hezbollah's rising influence in Beirut. 
The country's banking association said on Wednesday it expected the cabinet to put forward a clear economic and financial program, offering the banks' support.
Highlighting the challenges ahead, Finance Minister Ghazi Wazni told local media it was unlikely the Lebanese pound exchange rate to the U.S. dollar would ""return to what it was"" on the parallel market, referring to the official peg.
Wazni had, after the cabinet was formed on Tuesday, described forthcoming foreign currency sovereign debt maturities as ""a fireball"".
Lebanon should restructure its Eurobonds, including a $1.2 billion Eurobond maturing in March, and secure a multi-billion dollar IMF bailout, its former labor minister Camille Abousleiman told Reuters.

""I don't see the logic of the system leaking $500 to $600 million out of Lebanon on the March payment when an actual restructuring of the Eurobonds is next to inevitable,"" said Abousleiman, who drafted the legal framework for Lebanon's bonds from the mid-1990s onwards.

On Friday the court had called for a clarification of the tally hours after the electoral commission released the final results that showed Embalo's victory with 54% of votes cast versus Domingos Simoes Pereira's 46%.
""The Supreme Court ruling has been scrupulously followed,"" the commission said in a statement released on Wednesday. ""All that remains to do is follow the swearing-in procedure.""
Former Prime Minister and former army General Embalo had been hailed as the winner of last month's runoff vote. But runner-up and ruling party candidate Pereira had contested the results saying the election was marred by fraud.
There was no immediate reaction on Wednesday from both politicians to the commission's announcement."

The Basij are under the command of the Guards, the most powerful and heavily armed security force in the Islamic Republic.
IRNA said that Abdolhossein Mojaddami, a Basij commander in the city of Darkhovin in the southwestern province of Khuzestan, was shot on Tuesday in front of his home by two men riding a motorcycle.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack, IRNA said. It described Mojaddami as one of the “defenders of the shrine”, a reference used to describe members of security forces who have fought in recent conflicts in Iraq or Syria.
Soleimani, a general who oversaw Iran's drive to extend its influence across the Middle East, was killed at Baghdad airport on Jan. 3, prompting Iran to fire missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq in an escalation of their confrontation over Tehran's nuclear program and broader security issues in the region.
On Saturday, the United States said it had imposed sanctions on a Revolutionary Guards general in Khuzestan who commanded units Washington accused of responsibility for killing anti-government protesters in November.
The U.S. State Department cited “multiple” media reports and information submitted by Iranians through its ""Rewards for Justice"" tipline saying that Guards units killed as many as 148 protesters with machinegun fire and by setting fire to a marsh in which protesters took cover in the city of Mahshahr.
Iranian authorities disputed the U.S. account, saying security forces confronted “rioters” who they described as a security threat to petrochemical plants and to a key energy supply route that, if blocked, would have created a crisis.
Protests in November were initially sparked by hikes in gasoline prices but demonstrators quickly expanded their demands to cover calls for more political freedom and other issues.
The unrest prompted the bloodiest crackdown on demonstrators in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic, which blamed foreign enemies for rising tensions."

The move, which is expected to apply mostly to vigilante groups called koglweogo - ""guardians of the bush"" in the Moore language - has drawn concerns from the United Nations and human rights activists, who fear it could empower fighters accused of ethnic killings in the past.
The vigilantes grew significantly as a response to instability that followed the 2014 revolution that overthrew longtime President Blaise Compaore. There are an estimated 40,000 such groups across Burkina Faso, according to the U.N.
""This law was voted unanimously by the parliament,"" Defence Minister Moumina Cheriff Sy told reporters after the vote late on Tuesday. ""It shows that beyond our differences of opinion... we can be one when it comes to defending the homeland.""
Security deteriorated dramatically across Burkina Faso and its neighbors in the semi-arid Sahel region last year, as Islamist militants with ties to Islamic State and al Qaeda stepped up their attacks.
On Monday, militants killed 36 people at a market in a village in northern Burkina Faso.
Collaboration between state security forces and the vigilantes has previously been informal. The government said the new law would help defeat the ""terrorist Hydra"".
The law, which now goes to President Roch Marc Kabore for his signature, calls for volunteers to receive brief military training, unspecified equipment, healthcare and bonus payments. Recruitment is to be managed by village leaders.
A U.N. committee of experts on torture voiced concerns in November about a lack of oversight of the koglweogo, saying the groups were implicated in a massacre of dozens of Fulani herders in January 2019.
The jihadist violence in the Sahel has also fueled ethnic conflict, particularly between rival hunting and farming communities, with ethnic self-defense militias targeting civilians in reprisal for militant attacks.
In neighboring Mali, a vigilante group is believed to be responsible for an attack that killed about 160 Fulani civilians last March, the deadliest such incident in recent times."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's president told European powers on Wednesday not to copy the United States by undermining Tehran's strained nuclear pact with world powers, and said Tehran would not seek nuclear weapons whether or not the deal survived.
Britain, France and Germany launched a dispute mechanism in the 2015 nuclear deal this month, accusing Iran of violating the deal that has become increasingly frayed since Washington pulled out in 2018 and then reimposed sanctions on Tehran.
The dispute mechanism could ultimately lead to the case being referred to the U.N. Security Council to restore U.N. sanctions. Iranian officials have threatened a range of steps if this should happen, including quitting the 2015 deal or even withdrawing from the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), basis for global nuclear arms control since the Cold War.
Iran has gradually rolled back its commitments under the 2015 deal, arguing that it has a right to do so because European countries failed to protect it from U.S. sanctions.
This month, the escalating crisis briefly flared into a military exchange between Iran and the United States.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on his website President.Ir on Wednesday that the United States had made a mistake by quitting the 2015 pact.
""Do you want to make the same mistake? ... I am emphasizing that if the Europeans make a mistake and violate the deal, they will be responsible for the consequences of their actions.""
U.S. President Donald Trump says his ""maximum pressure"" campaign aims to drive Iran toward a broader deal that will further curb Tehran's nuclear work, end its missile program and halt proxy wars in the Middle East.
The three European powers have shown greater readiness to work toward what the British prime minister dubbed a ""Trump deal"". France has said it might be time for a broader pact.
""In the current context, France is determined that Iran never acquires a nuclear weapon, but also that we avoid all military escalation in the region,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said during a trip to Israel.
'COMMITTED TO THE DEAL'
Iran has always insisted its nuclear program was only for peaceful purposes, pointing to monitoring of its work by the U.N. watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
""With or without the nuclear deal or the IAEA's safeguards, whether our relation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog is good or bad, Iran is not seeking nuclear weapons,"" Rouhani said.
Rouhani's chief of staff, Mahmoud Vaezi, had earlier said one of Tehran's possible responses to the crisis would be to withdraw from the 2015 deal. Rouhani said of the pact: ""We do not want to destroy it and we are still committed to the deal.""
After months of rising tension, the crisis flared into open conflict this month. Trump ordered the killing in Baghdad of Iran's most prominent military commander on Jan. 3, prompting Tehran to launch missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq on Jan. 8.
In the tense aftermath, Iran's military shot down an airliner by mistake, igniting protests at home and adding to pressure on Tehran from abroad.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Europe had yielded to pressure from Washington by launching the dispute mechanism in the nuclear pact, the JCPOA. He has cited a threat of U.S. tariffs if European capitals did not take action.
""When E3 sold out remnants of #JCPOA to avoid Trump tariffs last week, I warned that it would only whet his appetite,"" he tweeted. ""EU would do better to exert its sovereignty.""
European diplomats say they would have triggered the dispute mechanism regardless of any U.S. tariff threats."

One of the eight, Murat Jashari, received a 10-year sentence for shooting at and wounding former politician and prominent lawyer Azem Vllasi on the doorstep of his house in March 2017.
The court said Vllasi was the first victim on a list of potential targets that included Thaci and Isa Mustafa, who was prime minister at the time.
""Their aim was to seriously destabilize or destroy the political, economic, constitutional or social structures of the Republic of Kosovo,"" presiding judge Naime Krasniqi Jashanica said in the verdict.

COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Rohingya refugees who fled persecution and violence in Myanmar are praying for justice as the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in The Hague prepares to deliver an initial verdict on Thursday in a genocide case filed against Myanmar.
More than 730,000 Muslim Rohingya fled an army offensive in Myanmar's Rakhine state in 2017. The United Nations says gang rapes and mass killings were carried out with ""genocidal intent"". Hundreds of villages were burned to the ground and later razed. Myanmar denies the charges of genocide.
Gambia has asked the ICJ to order ""provisional measures"" to prevent more harm, a first step in a legal case that is expected to run for years. It has also asked judges to order Myanmar to ensure any evidence of atrocities is preserved.
At the world's largest refugee camp in Bangladesh, where the Rohingya who fled are settled, many hope for a ruling in their favor after years of persecution.
""The Burmese (Myanmar) government and the army tried to wipe out the entire Rohingya community. We want justice,"" said 30-year-old refugee Nurul Amin, who fled to Bangladesh with his pregnant wife during the 2017 army crackdown.
Mohammed Zubair, a 19-year-old teacher living in the camps, said Myanmar ""must be held accountable for the horrific crimes"".
""We saw so many people killed before our eyes. All we could do was run while our villages were burned down,"" he said.
The refugees have urged Bangladesh authorities to restore internet connectivity in the camps - curtailed due to what the Bangladesh government says are security concerns - so they can watch the court deliver its verdict.
""ONLY JUSTICE CAN HEAL OUR WOUNDS""
The Rohingya are demanding to be allowed to return to their homes in Myanmar in safe and secure conditions.
Buddhist majority Myanmar says its forces have been waging a counter-terrorism operation against an armed insurgency in Rakhine state. Myanmar also says the U.N. court should have no jurisdiction on the issue and views its interventions as a violation of its national sovereignty.
A Myanmar government-appointed panel established to probe allegations of abuses against the Rohingya said on Monday it had found no evidence of genocide. Rohingya leaders branded the probe a ""whitewash"".
The quest for justice has been an intensely emotional one for many refugees at the camps who said they saw their family members killed.
""The killers of my son must all be punished,"" said 65-year-old refugee Nur Alam, whose son was allegedly shot dead by a Myanmar soldier. ""Only justice can heal our wounds."""

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodia's opposition leader admitted in a 2013 video clip played in court on Wednesday to receiving funding and advice from unspecified Americans but denied trying to overthrow the government of strongman Prime Minister Hun Sen.
Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 and his party banned in a crackdown by Hun Sen on opposition, civil society groups and the media in the run-up to the 2018 parliamentary election, in which the ruling party won every seat.
Sokha, 66, is on trial on charges of treason, accused of having conspired with the United States to topple Hun Sen. He denies the charges, calling them politically motivated. If convicted, Sokha would face up to 30 years in prison.
Some reporters were allowed to view trial proceedings on Wednesday after being barred from sessions last week.
In the video, which runs for over an hour and was submitted as evidence by Sokha himself, the defendant said he had received advice and financing from unidentified Americans to support ways of fostering democracy and human rights in Cambodia.
""I rented a radio station, America let me rent a radio station...to educate people at the grassroots,"" Sokha said in the video, citing a station owned by local former opposition politician Mam Sonando.
""I...brought him $50,000 of U.S. money for him to set up the radio, making its signal stronger (so as to) air my speeches every day from public forums,"" Sokha said.
He denied any intent to seek change through violence in Cambodia, which suffered bloody upheaval in which some two million people died under the brutal Maoist Khmer Rouge regime during the 1970s.
""Do we want Khmer blood to flow again? The answer is no, we don't want (that),"" Sokha said in the video. ""We, the National Rescue Party, absolutely do not use violence. Anyone who wants to use violence or force..., we do not do it because I regret Khmer blood, I do not want to do (that).""
A spokesperson at U.S. Embassy in Phnom Penh did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Wednesday.
Hun Sen himself is a former Khmer Rouge guerrilla who defected to the regime's eventual conquerors, Vietnam, and he has been in power since the mid-1980s. Hun Sen has cast his crackdown on opposition as vital to preserve law and order.
Sokha's trial continues on Thursday."

The ability to demobilize legally would be particularly important for fighters who are recruited as children and have few options to leave armed groups once they become adults.
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels largely demobilized under a 2016 peace deal, becoming a legal political party, but several top commanders last year rejected the peace deal and re-armed.
There are an estimated 2,500 FARC dissident fighters, according to intelligence sources.
Dissidents, the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels and Venezuelan armed group the Patriotic Forces of National Liberation (FPLN) are responsible for numerous abuses in the eastern Colombian province of Arauca and neighboring Venezuelan state Apure, HRW said in a report, including a rise in unlawful killings, forced labor and child recruitment.
The groups operate with almost total impunity, especially in Venezuela where they sometimes collude with security forces and local authorities, Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of HRW's Americas division, said in a statement.
""Residents in Arauca and Apure live in fear, as armed groups recruit their children and impose their own rules, threaten residents, and punish those who disobey, even with murder or months of forced labor in fields,"" Vivanco said.
Children recruited from both sides of the border can be as young as 12, the report said. While child recruitment by the FPLN appears to be uncommon, HRW said the ELN and FARC dissidents offered payment to encourage children to join up.
Because the FARC dissidents are considered criminals by Colombian authorities, children recruited by the group have no legal avenues to demobilize if they escape as adults, unlike their counterparts recruited by the ELN, the rights group said.
HRW also called on the United States, Canada, the European Union and governments across Latin America to impose targeted sanctions - including traffic bans and asset freezes - on senior Venezuelan officials complicit in abuses by armed groups.
""Increased international pressure on the Maduro regime remains key to preventing abuses and ensuring accountability in Venezuela,"" Vivanco said, referring to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called Venezuela a failed state and pledged further action during a visit to Bogota.
Colombia and the U.S. say Maduro harbors the ELN and has connections to drug traffickers and Hezbollah."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud said on Wednesday that an allegation the kingdom's crown prince had been involved in a plot to hack the phone of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos was ""absurd"".
""I think absurd is exactly the right word,"" Prince Faisal told Reuters in an interview at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos. ""The idea that the crown prince would hack Jeff Bezos' phone is absolutely silly.""
Two United Nations officials will report on Wednesday that there is enough evidence suggesting that Saudi Arabia had hacked Bezos' phone and both the kingdom and the United States should investigate, a person familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Wednesday.
Prince Faisal said the kingdom would investigate it were presented with evidence ""that substantiated these claims"".
The United Nations' officials plan a public statement asserting that they found credible a forensic report commissioned by Bezos' security team that concluded his phone probably had been hacked via a tainted video sent from a WhatsApp account belonging to Saudi's crown prince Mohammed bin Salman.
The report, by FTI Consulting, concluded that massive amounts of data began leaving Bezos' phone about a month after the video was shared in mid-2018, the person said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the subject.
The Guardian first reported the crown prince's alleged involvement. It said the encrypted message from the number used by the crown prince is believed to have included a malicious file that infiltrated the phone Bezos had used and extracted large amounts of data.
Bezos' security team began investigating the hack of his phone after text messages between him and a former television anchor, who the National Enquirer said Bezos was dating, were published in the tabloid.
The Saudi government has said it had nothing to do with that reporting.
Prince Faisal said he was not concerned that the hacking allegation would shake the confidence of investors in Saudi Aria. The kingdom has faced scrutiny for the 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who was also a columnist for the Bezos' owned Washington Post, and its handling of the case.
""We're very happy with our investment flow,"" Prince Faisal said. ""If there are concerns by some people, we will try to address those.""
Separately, Prince Faisal said Saudi Arabia was open to talks with Tehran and that ""many countries"" had offered to mediate talks between the two countries, but added that establishing the conditions for talks ""is really up to Iran"".
He said Iran would have to accept it ""cannot further its regional agenda through violence"" as a condition for any talks."

""In the whole world, men and women migrants face risky voyages to escape violence, to escape, war, to escape poverty,"" Francis said during his weekly general audience at the Vatican.
""Many times, they are not allowed to disembark in ports ... they are exploited by criminal traffickers, today! Some politicians treat them like numbers and see them as a threat,"" he said, partly departing from his prepared remarks.
The comments by the pope, who has made defense of migrants a key part of his pontificate, came two days after an Italian Senate committee decision that could lead to a trial of Salvini for alleged kidnapping of migrants.
In July 2019 Salvini, who had staked his political credibility on a vow to curb immigration from Africa, ordered 131 rescued migrants to remain on a ship off Sicily for six days until other European states agreed to take them in.
The court in the Sicilian city of Catania -- a special tribunal in charge of investigations into ministers -- recommended last month that he stand trial on charges of illegally detaining migrants on the coast guard ship Gregoretti.
If definitively found guilty, the head of the far-right League, currently Italy's most popular party, would face up to 15 years in jail. He could also be barred from political office, dashing his ambitions to lead a future government.
Salvini said he would face an eventual trial ""with my head high"".

MOSCOW (Reuters) - The biggest swimming pool in Russia's Muslim-majority North Caucasus region has banned women, prompting anger from rights activists and others who have accused the sports complex of discrimination.
The Anzhi Arena spa-complex near Makhachkala, the capital of the internal Russian republic of Dagestan, announced its policy change on the Instagram social media platform on Monday.
""From Jan. 20 onwards attendance of the pool is open only to men,"" it said.
The decision has sparked heated debate among residents of the mountainous region, where traditional social values and conservative interpretations of Islam often put it at odds with large parts of European Russia where more liberal values prevail.
The swimming pool said its decision to deny entry to women, who were previously only admitted on Fridays for women-only sessions, was financially motivated.
""Unfortunately, there were hardly any visitors during women's days,"" the RIA news agency cited the spa complex as saying on its Instagram page, which has now been set to private.
""Specifically because of this, after a thorough analysis and evaluation, the difficult decision was made that keeping days for women open in our pool was not viable.""
It is common in the North Caucasus region to find sports facilities offering men and women access on separate days of the week. But a complete ban on women using the pool goes against the Russian constitution, activists said.
Fatima Abdulkhalimova, 31, said she could no longer use the pool despite working there as an instructor.
""I do demonstrations, show people the correct technique, and now I'm not allowed to enter the water,"" Abdulkhalimova, a former professional swimmer, said.
""I think it's to do with religion, I believe it is because a lot of religious guys come here,"" she said.
Access to the pool had initially been permitted for both men and women, she said, before being restricted to Fridays only for women.
If having women-only days was not financially viable, then why not simply return to the earlier, mixed-gender system, Abdulkhalimova questioned.
Three women from Dagestan have now filed a complaint to the regional Prosecutor's Office accusing the sports complex of unconstitutional gender-based discrimination, a copy of the document, shared by Olga Gnezdilova, a lawyer with the Rights Initiative Project, showed.
One of the complainants is Svetlana Anokhina, editor of a local online media platform focused on women's rights. She said the practice of separating public spaces by gender was on the rise.
""I have a daughter here and she has three daughters too. I'm angry because... I'm afraid for them. I don't want them to live in a special ghetto for women,"" Anokhina, who is based in Makhachkala, said.
One woman, who said she frequently used the pool, said she had been refused a membership pass last month.
Commenting on a post on Instagram she wrote that the pool's administrators had told her she couldn't buy a pass because there was not enough locker room space for men."

He had attended a hearing between the Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN), a rights group, and the local parliament, it said.
Jacobson had entered Indonesia using a business visa for a series of meetings and on the day he was due to leave immigration authorities confiscated his passport and he was later ordered him to remain in the city pending an investigation, the statement said.

Officials at Indonesia's Immigration Directorate General did not respond to requests for comment.
Aryo Nugroho, Jacobson's lawyer, said by text message that his client was accused of violating his visa conditions by undertaking reporting activities in Palangkaraya.
Under Indonesia's immigration law, Jacobson could face up to five years in prison.
Rhett A. Butler, CEO and founder of Mongabay, said in a statement the company would support Jacobson and make every effort to comply with Indonesian immigration authorities.
Andreas Harsono, Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, said he believed immigration were acting excessively in seeking to prosecute Jacobson.
""Journalism is clearly not a crime. This case is an administrative matter, a visa problem, not a criminal one,"" Harsono said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - At a lavish August gathering at a private estate in Spain, a wealthy Venezuelan businessman under criminal investigation in the United States introduced Rudy Giuliani, President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer, to the father of Venezuela’s opposition leader, Juan Guaido.
The affair was part of a campaign for leniency for the businessman, Alejandro Betancourt, who sought to demonstrate his close ties to opposition figures looking to oust Venezuela's socialist President Nicolas Maduro - a key objective of the Trump administration.
Betancourt told Giuliani he secretly helped bankroll Guaido’s efforts to take over the leadership of Venezuela, according to four people familiar with the situation, two of whom provided  details about the meeting in Spain. Betancourt hoped those bona fides would enable Giuliani, his lawyer, to persuade Trump’s Justice Department to drop its probe of Betancourt in connection with a Florida money laundering and bribery case, the people said.
A month later, at a meeting in Washington, D.C., Giuliani urged Justice Department prosecutors to go easy on Betancourt, according to a person with direct knowledge of the meeting, and Lev Parnas, a former Giuliani associate, who said Giuliani told him about it soon afterward. Parnas and the other person said Giuliani told prosecutors that Betancourt had provided assistance for Guaido’s political efforts, and was therefore doing good work for the United States.
This is the first time Parnas detailed his story about Betancourt, Giuliani and Venezuela.
Giuliani declined to confirm meeting with U.S. prosecutors on Betancourt’s behalf and wouldn’t say whether the Venezuelan businessman is a client. “Lev Parnas has no right to be talking about that meeting,” Giuliani told Reuters in a brief phone interview. “It was a confidential meeting - if it did happen.”
“Lev Parnas’s credibility is worth nothing,” Giuliani said.
The Justice Department declined to comment. Betancourt and his attorney Frank Wohl did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
Reuters couldn’t determine whether Betancourt did provide financing to the U.S.-backed opposition or if he was just claiming he did.
Guaido and the main opposition political party, Popular Will, both denied receiving funding from Betancourt. Guaido was a member of Popular Will until he stepped back from it earlier this month.
“I do not know Mr. Betancourt, there is no relationship,” Guaido told Reuters. “As such, that is not possible.”
Wilmer Guaido, Guaido’s father, denied meeting Betancourt in Spain. “I only support my son like the whole family against that criminal dictatorship but I have not met anyone,” he said.
Giuliani’s meeting with Betancourt at the Spanish estate, and his efforts to lobby the Justice Department on the businessman’s behalf, were previously reported by the Washington Post. Reuters is the first to report that Betancourt told Giuliani that he provided financial support for Venezuela’s opposition, and that Giuliani touted that alleged assistance to U.S. prosecutors as a reason to remove the legal cloud dogging his client.
The episode speaks to the complex roles that Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, has played in Washington since Trump took office in 2017.
Giuliani frequently proclaims himself a business consultant and lawyer working on behalf of private clients. Yet he also enjoys extraordinary access to the halls of power as the president’s unpaid personal attorney - work that has landed him at the center of Trump’s impeachment trial.
Any attempt by a Giuliani client to avoid possible prosecution by claiming to have been backing an American foreign policy objective - the toppling of Maduro in this case - could prove embarrassing to the administration.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Parnas played a key role in Giuliani’s effort to dig up dirt on Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden in Ukraine for Trump. Now under indictment for campaign finance violations, Parnas has been sharing information with Capitol Hill impeachment investigators, as well as the media, about the extent of the work he did for Giuliani.
Betancourt said “he was backing Guaido financially,” Parnas told Reuters, and “was helping America with his cause.”
Since January 2019, the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s rightful president. But Maduro has remained firmly in power, much to the frustration of the Trump administration.
Maduro’s government cut off paychecks for opposition lawmakers in 2016 after the opposition took control of the National Assembly.
Claims that Betancourt helped finance his country’s opposition are potentially explosive in Venezuela, where the mogul forged a profitable relationship with the socialist government. Derwick Associates, his Caracas-based energy firm, obtained hundreds of millions of dollars in state contracts to build power plants under Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, according to local media.
In a statement to Reuters, the opposition Popular Will party said that ""information about the supposed remittance of funds by Alejandro Betancourt to our political organization is not true.”
The existence of the U.S. criminal probe of Betancourt was confirmed to Reuters by a source familiar with the matter.  The Miami Herald reported last November that the investigation is linked to a large money laundering case in Miami, and that Betancourt is an unindicted co-conspirator listed, but not named, in legal records. The 2018 charges accused eight defendants of embezzling $1.2 billion from Venezuela’s government-owned oil company PDVSA, then laundering it through schemes in Miami involving false real estate and security deals.
A representative of Betancourt who declined to be identified said the magnate “didn’t do anything and he has not been charged with any wrongdoing.” He also told Reuters that the businessman had provided “very substantial” financial support to Venezuela’s opposition.
PDVSA did not respond to a request for comment.
At the State Department, Elliott Abrams, the U.S. Special Representative for Venezuela, told Reuters the administration is aware of the lack of transparency in the opposition’s financing. 
“We’re concerned about who are all these people, and how did they make their money. And that is something we have raised with the opposition,” Abrams said.
Asked whether Betancourt was one of those individuals of concern, Abrams said: “No comment on individual names.”
He added that Giuliani had not been authorized to play any role in U.S. policy in Venezuela.
‘HELPING THE UNITED STATES’
Parnas said the August meeting at Betancourt’s estate outside Madrid, and the presence of Guaido’s father, were meant to demonstrate Betancourt’s strong ties to Guaido and his support for U.S. interests in Venezuela. It was to show Giuliani “that Betancourt is a really important person for the cause and that he is helping America,” Parnas said.
The lobbying took place in Washington the month after the Spain meeting. Giuliani met with Assistant U.S. Attorney General Brian Benczkowski, a Justice Department lawyer working on the case, and some other government lawyers, according to Parnas and the person with direct knowledge of that meeting.
Department of Justice spokesman Peter Carr, who handles communications for Benczkowski, said the department declined to comment. 
The person said Giuliani was there with two other Betancourt lawyers, and made his pitch that the prosecutors let Betancourt off the hook for the case in Florida.
Giuliani first insisted there wasn’t enough evidence to prosecute the case. He then moved to U.S. foreign policy, pointing to Betancourt’s alleged support for Guaido. “This guy’s been helping the United States,” the person with direct knowledge of the meeting said in describing Giuliani’s reasoning.

Giuliani argued that Betancourt was crucial to the survival of the Venezuelan opposition, and he urged the Justice Department lawyers to talk to Guaido themselves to corroborate his claims, the person said.

ROME (Reuters) - Luigi Di Maio will step down as leader of Italy's co-governing 5-Star movement on Wednesday, a senior party source said, as it seeks to stem a wave of defections that threatens the government's parliamentary majority.
Di Maio, who is also foreign minister, is expected to announce his resignation during the afternoon at a party meeting, several newspapers reported.
He and his spokesman declined to comment. 
While his resignation is not expected to bring down the government, it would underscore deep divisions within 5-Star and inject further uncertainty into already fractious relations with its coalition partner, the center-left Democratic Party (PD). 
Italian government bond yields rose 5-8 bps across the curve on the resignation reports, and the cost of insuring exposure to the country's sovereign debt also jumped
Di Maio's decision, if confirmed, would come just days before a regional election in Emilia Romagna in which the right-wing League is threatening to end 75 years of uninterrupted PD rule. That outcome could put the government's survival at risk. 
""Di Maio's resignation is very ominous for the future of the ruling coalition,"" said Francesco Galietti, head of political risk consultancy Policy Sonar.
""The PD has just announced a major rebranding is in the works and these things, leaders quitting and party overhauls, only happen in Italy when the house is on fire.""
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said he would respect any decision that Di Maio made. ""I am sure he would take such an initiative with great responsibility,"" Conte told Italian radio RTL 102.5, declining to comment further.
FALLING SUPPORT
The anti-establishment 5-Star won 33% of the vote in a national election in 2018, but since then its popularity has fallen sharply and recent polls put it at around 16%.
After that ballot yielded no clear winner, 5-Star initially formed a coalition with the League, switching to an alliance with the PD last September after League leader Matteo Salvini walked out of government.
Di Maio, who was just 31 when he was elected 5-Star leader in 2017, was skeptical about joining forces with the PD but, with many of the party's lawmakers opposed to fresh elections, he was reluctantly persuaded to sign up by 5-Star's founder Beppe Grillo.
As leader of the largest government party, Di Maio was deputy prime minister, industry minister and labor minister in the government with the League, leaving all three posts to take up the foreign ministry portfolio in the cabinet with the PD.
He is expected to remain as foreign minister should he quit the 5-Star leadership.
Tensions within the party have been fueled by a perception that Di Maio has failed to share power outside his inner circle of advisers. 
Since the election, more than 30 lower house and senate lawmakers have left 5-Star's parliamentary grouping, some defecting and some being ejected. That exodus has left the government with only a wafer-thin majority in the upper house Senate.
Vito Crimi, a little known lawmaker who heads 5-Star's internal regulations committee, is expected to take over from Di Maio as a caretaker until a new party chief is named, probably at a congress slated for March.

Among those cited as possible leaders are Conte, who was once the party's candidate for civil service minister, Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli and Alessandro Di Battista, a former lawmaker who did not stand at the last election but is still popular among party supporters.

Sakellaropoulou, 64, has been president of the Council of State, Greece's top administrative court. She will succeed Prokopis Pavlopoulos, whose five-year term expires in March. 
In an unusual demonstration of harmony in the fractious world of Greek politics, the conservative party nominee was backed by opposition parties, including the leftist Syriza party which lost power in an election last July.
She was backed by 261 MPs in the 300-member parliament.
Sakellaropoulou, from the northern city of Thessaloniki, became the first female head of the Council of State in 2018, supported for that position by the then leftist government. 
A divorcee who lives in central Athens and is active on social media, Sakellaropoulou has written numerous papers on environmental protection and chairs a society on environmental law. She is also an avid cat-lover.

For decades, failure by parliament to elect a president in Greece could lead to a snap election. Following a recent reform, the process to select a president can go up to five voting rounds in parliament with the threshold starting at 200 votes and gradually falling to the majority of those present in the room.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The contamination of U.S. drinking water with man-made ""forever chemicals"" is far worse than previously estimated with some of the highest levels found in Miami, Philadelphia and New Orleans, said a report on Wednesday by an environmental watchdog group.
The chemicals, resistant to breaking down in the environment, are known as perfluoroalkyl substances, or PFAS. Some have been linked to cancers, liver damage, low birth weight and other health problems.
The findings https://www.ewg.org/research/national-pfas-testing by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) show the group's previous estimate in 2018, based on unpublished U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, that 110 million Americans may be contaminated with PFAS, could be far too low.
""It's nearly impossible to avoid contaminated drinking water from these chemicals,"" said David Andrews, a senior scientist at EWG and co-author of the report. 
The chemicals were used in products like Teflon and Scotchguard and in firefighting foam. Some are used in a variety of other products and industrial processes, and their replacements also pose risks. 
Of tap water samples taken by EWG from 44 sites in 31 states and Washington D.C., only one location, Meridian, Mississippi, which relies on 700 foot (215 m) deep wells, had no detectable PFAS. Only Seattle and Tuscaloosa, Alabama had levels below 1 part per trillion (PPT), the limit EWG recommends. 
In addition, EWG found that on average six to seven PFAS compounds were found at the tested sites, and the effects on health of the mixtures are little understood. ""Everyone's really exposed to a toxic soup of these PFAS chemicals,"" Andrews said.
In 34 places where EWG's tests found PFAS, contamination had not been publicly reported by the EPA or state environmental agencies.
The EPA has known since at least 2001 about the problem of PFAS in drinking water but has so far failed to set an enforceable, nationwide legal limit. The EPA said early last year it would begin the process to set limits on two of the chemicals, PFOA and PFOS.
The EPA said it has helped states and communities address PFAS and that it is working to put limits on the two main chemicals but did not give a timeline. 
In 2018 a draft report from an office of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the risk level for exposure to the chemicals should be up to 10 times lower than the 70 PPT threshold the EPA recommends. The White House and the EPA had tried to stop the report from being published.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's first transgender soldier said on Wednesday she would sue the military after it announced it would dismiss her for undergoing gender reassignment surgery last year.
Byun Hui-su, who holds the rank of staff sergeant and is stationed in Gyeonggi Province, north of Seoul, had the operation in Thailand last year while on leave, and had expressed hope of continuing to serve in the female corps.
In her first public appearance since her case was publicized last week, Byun said she would pursue a lawsuit against the army, all the way to the country's highest court if necessary.
""I will continue to fight until the day I can remain to serve in the army,"" she said. ""I’ll challenge the decision until the end, to the Supreme Court.""
The army said in a statement that while it will make efforts to protect soldiers' human rights and prevent discrimination, the surgery left Byun unable to continue to serve. 
Byun broke down in tears as she described the decision to undergo surgery after suffering from gender dysphoria, which medical experts define as distress from the internal conflict between physical gender and gender identity.
""It was an extremely difficult decision to let my base know of my identity, but once I did, I felt much better,"" she told reporters at a news conference in Seoul after the military announced its decision.
""I thought I would finish serving in the army and then go through the transition surgery and then reenter the army as a female soldier. But my depression got too severe.""
One army official with knowledge of the deliberations told Reuters that there should be no reason for the military to deny Byun if she reapplied to serve in the female corps after completing the legal process to formally become a woman. 
A human rights organization had filed a petition with a national human rights watchdog urging the army to postpone its decision until after Byun had completed the court process, but the army said that legal proceeding is irrelevant to its personnel decisions.
The case has triggered debate over the treatment of transgender troops and soldiers from the wider LBGT community in the country, which requires all able-bodied men to serve for around two years.
Byun said she still hopes to serve in the military in the future.
""Apart from my gender identity, I want to show everyone that I can also be one of the great soldiers who protect this country.""

Israel Electric Corp (IEC) began sporadic, three-hour power cuts on Dec. 18 to press for payment of some $519 million owed by the Jerusalem District Electricity Company (JDECO).
Palestinians in the West Bank rely on IEC for over 95 percent of their electricity supply. The cuts led to power outages in the cities of Ramallah and Bethlehem, affecting an estimated 130,000 people, according to JDECO.
IEC Chairman Yiftah Ron-Tal said the company was stopping the cuts after ""JDECO transferred 740 million shekels ($214.21 million) of debt accumulated by the Palestinian Authority (PA) since 2016"".
JDECO buys electricity from IEC and then sells it to customers in the West Bank, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war and where the PA has limited self-rule under interim peace accords.
JDECO signed a loan agreement with several Palestinian banks in order to pay off the debt it owed, said Mansour Nassar, the company's assistant general manager for technical affairs.
The Palestinians have tried to reduce what they call their dependence on Israel for energy, in part through state- and private sector-funded solar energy projects and plans to build their own power plants."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court declined calls to suspend the implementation of a new citizenship law on Wednesday, deciding that a constitutional bench of five judges was needed to hear all the challenges to legislation that critics say discriminates against Muslims.
The court gave Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government four weeks to respond to 144 petitions challenging the constitutional validity of the law which has ignited protests across the country.
The law, which came into effect on Jan.10 after being passed by parliament in December, lays out a path for citizenship for six religious minorities in neighboring mostly-Muslim countries - Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.
Critics say that the omission of Muslims is discriminatory, and that basing the right to citizenship on religion violates the secular principles of India's constitution.
Opposition leaders, Muslim organizations and student groups had petitioned the court to hold off implementation of the law until the challenges to the legislation were settled.
But Chief Justice Sharad Arvind Bobde heading a three-bench panel told a packed courtroom that only a constitutional bench of five judges could rule on the matter and in the meantime gave the government more time to explain its stance.
""We will give you four weeks to file reply to all petitions,"" Bobde told the government's top lawyer, indicating that the next hearing will be held in late February.
The government says the law is for the benefit of religious minorities such as Hindus, Sikhs and Christians who face persecution in India's Muslim majority neighbors.
The biggest student organization in the northeastern state of Assam, where some of the worst violence was seen last month during widespread protests against the law, said it would keep up its opposition.
""Non-violent and democratic protests will continue alongside the legal battle,"" All Assam Students Union general secretary Lorinjyoti Gogoi told Reuters."

YANGON (Reuters) - Ethnic minority rebels in Myanmar have released a lawmaker held hostage for two months in a bid to reduce tension in the war-torn western state of Rakhine, a human rights group and the rebels said.
Rights groups had urged the Arakan Army (AA), which is fighting for greater autonomy, to release the member of parliament for the ruling National League for Democracy party, who was seized in an attack on a boat in November.
The insurgency in Rakhine State poses a serious threat to the government of Aung San Suu Kyi in an increasingly lawless region already destabilized by a military crackdown on Rohingya Muslims.
More than 730,000 Rohingyas fled the crackdown in 2017, a campaign that UN investigators said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"".
The ethnic Rakhine rebels accused the lawmaker, Hawi Tin, who is a member of the mostly Christian Chin ethnic group, of passing on information about their activities to the authorities. 
He was abducted on Nov. 3 while traveling by boat with several Indian nationals, one of whom died. The others were quickly set free.
“Hawi Tin is home now,” said Salai Lian, a spokesman for the Chin Human Rights Organisation. 
Salai Lian called on the insurgents to account for other Chin civilians caught up in the conflict.
""They are caught between and treated badly by both parties, the army and the AA,” he said.
A spokesman for the AA told Reuters they had released Hawi Tin to improve relations between ethnic groups in the region.
The AA was formed in 2009 but had kept a relatively low-profile before a surge in fighting erupted a year ago when rebels attacked four police stations.
The government has vowed to crush the rebels, sending thousands of troops into Rakhine and cutting off the internet across the region.
The rebels have increasingly turned to kidnapping, seizing dozens of people in recent months from buses and boats, while suspected informers have been detained in villages, according to officials, the rebels and media reports.

The report by Malaysian rights group Lawyers for Liberty last week said that Singapore prison officers were instructed to snap prisoners' necks by kicking them in the event the rope breaks during hangings. It said the report was based on information from an unnamed prison officer in Singapore.
The wealthy city-state carried out 13 hangings in 2018, the latest official data shows, 11 of which were for drug offences for which it has some of the strictest laws in the world. Amnesty International said it was the first year since 2003 that the number of hangings reached double-digits.
""The statement...contains untrue, baseless and preposterous allegations about the use of unlawful methods in judicial executions,"" Singapore's ministry of home affairs said, adding that no such methods were taught or approved, and that the rope used for executions has never broken.
The ministry instructed the rights group to carry a correction notice on the article under its new fake news law. It sent similar instructions to an activist and media commentator, a blog and the local news site of U.S. web services firm Yahoo.
Lawyers for Liberty founder N.Surendran said he stood by the statement and would not comply with the correction order.
""Singapore has no jurisdiction to interfere with the rights of Malaysian citizens to freedom of expression... Their attempt to extend their jurisdiction upon Malaysians across the causeway is provocative and absurd,"" N. Surendran said.
Yahoo, owned by  Verizon Communications  (NYSE:VZ), said in response to an emailed request for comment that it ""was looking into the matter and will respond in due course"".
The fake news law, seen as one of the most far-reaching of its kind, came into effect in October amid concern among rights groups and opposition politicians it could be used to silence criticism of the government.
The government has denied such suggestions saying the law, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), only tackles falsehoods and that legitimate criticism and free speech would not be affected.
Since the law was first invoked in late November, most of the cases have involved political opposition figures and an opposition party.
Singapore's communications minister has said it was a coincidence that the first few cases brought under the law were against political figures and parties."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The politics of protest was a running theme at Lunar New Year fairs in Hong Kong this week, as stall holders sold t-shirts, tattoo transfers, tote bags, and coasters bearing slogans popularized during months of pro-democracy demonstrations.
Often-violent protests, sparked by a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, have persisted in Hong Kong for more than seven months and the long queues at the fairs showed they retain broad popular support.
At one market in the prime Causeway Bay shopping district there was a shooting gallery, where visitors could fire foam pellets at cut-out images of Hong Kong's unpopular pro-Beijing leader, Carrie Lam, and China's President Xi Jinping.
""I need to vent,"" said Lu Koo, a 28-year-old hotel employee, said. ""Government officials have their heads in the clouds.""
At another stall, Amelie Li, a 32-year-old human resources specialist, and her mother tossed rings over beer bottles arranged in the shape of a protest slogan.
Li’s favorite purchase of the day was a keychain made of concrete that read “Liberate Hong Kong.”
""I will carry this every day because we hope this will come true,"" Li said as she left the market laden with shopping bags.
This year, the government banned the selling of dry goods at officially-sanctioned seasonal markets and slashed the number of stalls by one third, citing safety concerns.
The measures prompted activists to find new venues across the city to set up protest-themed stalls, with many vendors donating proceeds to organizations supporting the movement.
Cheung Chun-kit, who owns the Lung Mun Café popular with protesters, set up a market on the 10th floor of an industrial building on the Kowloon peninsula.
""Fai chun"" red banners, usually hung in doorways for good luck in the new year, drew the longest queues. These carried protest slogans instead of traditional blessings of health and prosperity.
Other items on sale included protest-themed T-shirts, key chains, and small, 3D-printed figurines of ""Lady Liberty"" -- a white statue that has become a symbol of the protests -- all made in a nearby building by dozens of students.
Cheung said he organized the workshops and fair to help students develop new skills and earn some money, as some of them have lost the financial support of their parents, who oppose their protest actions.
At the Causeway Bay market, visitors could buy macarons, tote bags, stress balls and coasters stamped with popular slogans such as ""Ideas are bulletproof"" and ""Five demands, not one less.""
Stock trader Jake Li, 26, sold a card game featuring government and police figures and prominent activists. He worked for three months with two other friends to design the game, which he hopes will help players better understand the movement.
Housewife Joey Cheung made mini-notebook keychains holding the lyrics of “Glory to Hong Kong,” one of the unofficial anthems of the movement.
Yvonne Cheung, a saleswoman turning 48 this week, bought a cake topper emblazoned with “Hong Kongers, add oil!”, a popular encouragement chant in the city.
“It’s my (birthday) wish. We want the Hong Kong government to reply to our demands,” Cheung said."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Emmanuel Macron begins a visit to Jerusalem on Wednesday with a symbolic stop at one of France's territories in the Holy Land aiming to avoid controversies of past presidents, while underscoring Paris' historical influence in the region.
The two-day visit, which includes political meetings to discuss Iran tensions and the peace process with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, head of opposition Benny Gantz and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, culminates in commemorations marking the 75 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz extermination camp.
But for the 42-year-old Macron, it is also an opportunity to follow in the steps of previous French leaders in visiting one of the four sites owned by France since the Ottoman era of the 19th century and which to this day remain in its hands through international treaties.
Arriving through the Old City's Lion gate in East Jerusalem, Macron will pay a visit to the Church of St. Anne, where the French tricolor has fluttered since the Ottomans gave it to Emperor Napoleon III in 1856 as thanks for his support during the Crimean War.
""Be it schools, hospitals, orphanages, or religious sites like this, we continue to defend French identity,"" said a French diplomatic source ahead of the visit. ""We are a step away here from Temple Mount and the Wailing Wail, the very heart of the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians, so symbolically we are.""
French diplomats caution that they want to leave little room for mishaps such as those seen in the past. Israeli officials have privately expressed disappointment that the French leader had not visited the country earlier in his presidency.
When former President Jacques Chirac visited Jerusalem's old town in 1996, he lost patience with the Israeli security agents who were pressing him to move on, telling one of them that his treatment was a ""provocation"" and threatening to get back on his plane. He refused to enter St. Anne until Israeli security left the site.
French officials did not rule out Macron ambling beyond St. Anne and into the historic Via Dolorosa, the route Christians believe Jesus walked to his crucifixion.
Macron last week played down any real prospect of renewing French efforts to push the peace process, stalled since 2014, saying it was not for him to dictate to either side.
""I am not going to come saying 'this is a peace plan' because it would only fail,"" he told reporters on Jan. 15. ""I'm going to speak to the actors, see what the conditions are. France always has a role to play and I don't think we're absent from the debates in the region."""

Marchers held mass protests in November and December last year to demand concessions from President Ivan Duque's right-wing government. Tuesday's protests were the first this year, and organizers say larger ones will come in March.
The ""immense majority"" of the demonstrations on Tuesday were peaceful, Bogota mayor Claudia Lopez told journalists in an evening press conference, with 16 of 20 gatherings ending without violence. Some demonstrators attacked the ESMAD riot police force, she added.
""It was not the ESMAD attacking civilians, but some violent, hooded protesters attacking members of our police,"" Lopez said.
Protesters were dispersed from some areas in the capital with tear gas, while others threw rocks and set tires on fire, blocking roads.
In separate remarks to journalists, Interior Minister Nancy Patricia Gutierrez and national police director Oscar Atehortua said some 20,000 people marched in 103 cities and towns across the country. Ten police officers were injured.
""We have found with great sadness that these marches are taken advantage of by vandals who affect the wellbeing of citizens, especially when there are blockages and effects on mass transit systems, when there are road blockades, when private and public installations are attacked,"" Gutierrez said.
Protesters have a wide variety of demands, including stepped-up efforts to stop killings of rights activists and implement a peace deal with leftist rebels. Others opposed a tax reform that was passed by Congress late last year.
Protester Diego Henao, 47, said he was demonstrating on behalf of his 15 nieces and nephews.
""I want there to be education, for there to be work,"" he said. ""I want the government to make to make good on the peace deal, for there to be rights, health and social justice."""

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors charged U.S. journalist Glenn Greenwald on Tuesday with assisting a group of hackers who intercepted the cellular phone calls of Justice Minister Sergio Moro when he was the judge handling Brazil's biggest-ever corruption case.
The Intercept Brasil website edited by Greenwald published damaging conversations between Moro and prosecutors in the Car Wash investigation that showed the judge advising them in the case against now jailed former leftist president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
""We will not be intimidated by these tyrannical attempts to silence journalists,"" Greenwald said in a statement in which he said the government of Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro does not respect basic press freedoms.
Greenwald was charged with criminal association with a group of six people who face charges of hacking the telephones of Brazilian officials as well as bank fraud and money laundering.
Greenwald has said the Car Wash investigators' conversations were leaked to The Intercept after they had been hacked. 
But the federal prosecutors said in a statement that an audio found on the seized laptop of one of the alleged hackers showed Greenwald advising him to erase all messages linked to The Intercept while the interceptions where still taking place.
""The dialogues demonstrated that Glenn Greenwald went beyond (his journalistic duty) by indicating actions that would hinder the investigation and reduce the possibility of criminal liability,"" the statement said.
Greenwald, a resident of Brazil, became known internationally for his role in the publication of classified U.S. national security documents leaked by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden in 2013.
It was not clear whether Greenwald could be indicted since he was not under investigation and prosecutors were barred from doing so by a court injunction last year. 
Greenwald said Moro had from the start called The Intercept ""allies of the hackers"" for revealing his collusion with prosecutors in the corruption investigation.
The Federal Police stated less than two months ago, after examining the same evidence cited by the prosecutors, that he had not committed any crime, Greenwald said.
""I did nothing more than do my job as a journalist - ethically and within the law,"" he said in the emailed statement.
Rosental Alves, journalism professor at Texas University, tweeted that prosecutors exposed by Greenwald seemed to be seeking revenge when in fact he was trying to protect his sources.

Snowden on Twitter called it ""naked retaliation"" and a threat to investigative journalism in Brazil.

VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou returned to a Vancouver court on Tuesday, where her lawyers argued for a second straight day that Meng violated no Canadian laws and should not be extradited to the United States on charges she violated its sanctions.
Meng, 47, arrived in a Vancouver courtroom on Monday for the first phase of a hearing that will last at least four days, during which her legal team argued that ""double criminality"" was at the heart of the case, as China repeated its call for Canada to release her.
The United States has charged Meng with bank fraud, and accused her of misleading  HSBC Holdings  Plc (LON:HSBA) about Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's [HWT.UL] business in Iran.
Meng sat beside her translator at a desk, behind her legal team.
Tuesday's hearing began with a nearly half-hour long back-and-forth between defense lawyer Eric Gottardi and the British Columbia Supreme Court Judge Heather Holmes. Gottardi attempted to answer a question that Holmes had asked Monday, about whether Meng's alleged bank fraud against HSBC could be construed as a fraud if it had happened Canada.
In Gottardi's written argument submitted to the judge on Tuesday, and which he explained verbally to the court room, he said 'no.'
""The bank would face no risk of legal liability in Canada under Canadian law as there are no legal consequences in Canada for engaging in dollar transactions related to Iran and the bank is an innocent victim,"" he wrote. 
During the morning recess, Meng, wearing a long black wool coat and stiletto heeled shoes, laughed and chatted in the hallway with members of her more than 20-person team of associates. The hearing will continue on Wednesday morning with prosecutors expected to make statements.
Court proceedings show the United States issued the arrest warrant, which Canada acted on in December 2018, because it believes Meng covered up attempts by Huawei-linked companies to sell equipment to Iran, breaking U.S. sanctions against the country.
""DOUBLE CRIMINALITY""
Meng, the daughter of Huawei's billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, remains free on bail in Canada, and has been living in a mansion in Vancouver's exclusive Shaughnessy neighborhood.
She has said she is innocent and is fighting extradition in part because her alleged conduct was not illegal in Canada, an argument commonly called ""double criminality.""
Unlike the United States, Canada did not have sanctions against Iran at the time Canadian officials authorized the start of the extradition process, her lawyers have said.
Defense lawyer Scott Fenton argued that for the court to say Meng committed fraud it would ""have to import U.S. sanctions laws (against Iran) to Canada to supply the risk.""
Fenton also argued against the alleged fraud by saying that if evidence were to show that the banks knew about Huawei’s dealings with Iran, and were willfully engaging in risk, then ""they're not innocent victims.""
""Then there's no materiality, there's no causation element between the misrepresentation and the willful conduct, it disappears,"" he said.
Meng's legal team is currently only scheduled to call evidence in the last week of April, and a second phase of the extradition hearing, focusing on abuse of process and whether Canadian officials followed the law while arresting Meng, is set to begin in June. Closing arguments are expected in the last week of September and first week of October.
Legal experts have said it could be years before a final decision is reached in the case, since Canada's justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.
The case has had a chilling effect on relations between Ottawa and Beijing. China has called Meng's arrest politically motivated.
Lawyer Richard Kurland, who is not directly involved with the case, said this hearing has tremendous implications for Canadian extradition law.

""The public interest here is to examine whether Canada can possibly become a sanctuary for people who violated foreign law outside of Canada,"" Kurland added.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's new president, Alejandro Giammattei, on Tuesday launched an anti-graft commission, after former leader Jimmy Morales chased out a U.N.-backed anti-corruption body investigating him and his family.
Giammattei, 63, who took office earlier this month, promised to take a hard line on rampant crime and corruption. He created the anti-graft commission tied to the president's office instead of reversing his predecessor's decision to expunge the U.N. body, known as CICIG. Giammattei had indicated he viewed CICIG as an unacceptable violation on Guatemala's sovereignty.
The CICIG, which left Guatemala after 12 years in September, helped to strengthen courts and send some of the nation's most powerful politicians and businessmen to prison.
In another tough-on-graft move, Giammattei rehired some of the police chiefs whom Morales' government had fired in order to hinder the work of the CICIG."

The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) demobilized under a 2016 peace deal after more than five decades of conflict with the government, becoming a legal political party.
But several top commanders have rejected the accord and chosen either not to demobilize or to return to arms. The government considers the dissidents to be criminals without an ideological motivation unlike the traditional FARC.
""The foreign ministry announces the beginning of diplomatic efforts through embassies for the inclusion of organized residual armed groups as terrorist organizations on the lists of the E.U., the U.S. and other countries,"" the ministry said on Twitter.
The effort is in line with a resolution adopted by a regional anti-terrorism conference held in Bogota on Tuesday, the ministry said in a statement.
Conference attendees, including U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, among others, rejected acts of terrorism and crimes committed by the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels and residual groups.
Armed conflict in the Andean country could heat up this year, including through urban bombings, if dissidents follow through with plans to pressure the government into a new peace deal, an expert mediator told Reuters this month."

TORONTO (Reuters) - The proportion of indigenous people in Canada's total inmate population has risen by five percentage points over the past four years to 30%, despite an overall drop in inmate population, a government report released on Tuesday showed.
The number of federally sentenced indigenous people has steadily increased for decades despite only accounting for 5% of the general population in Canada, the report https:// by Canada's correctional investigator found.
The head of Canada's human rights commission denounced the findings of the report, referring to it as a ""national disgrace.""
""We strongly agree with the Correctional Investigator that bold and urgent action is required to address this persistent and pressing human rights issue,"" said Canadian human rights chief commissioner Marie-Claude Landry.
The report also notes a rise of female indigenous inmates, who now accounts for almost half of the female inmate population in Canada.
Compared to non-indigenous inmates, indigenous offenders stay longer behind bars during their sentences before being granted parole, the office of correctional investigator said.
""(Four years ago), my office indicated that efforts to curb over-representation were not working,"" Canada correctional investigator Ivan Zinger said.
Zinger called for the Correctional Service of Canada to ""accept its share of responsibility, recognizing that tweaks around the edges of the system simply won’t cut it.”
He also called for reducing re-admissions and returns to custody of indigenous offenders."

The military said troops had cordoned off an area near the southern end of the Palestinian coastal enclave after spotting ""three suspects"" crossing the frontier. 
""(They) searched the area towards the suspects who hurled a grenade or explosive device at the troops,"" who then opened fire on the three Palestinians, the military said in a statement. A military spokeswoman confirmed they were killed. 
Two of the Palestinians killed were aged 18 and the third aged 17, a police source in Gaza said. The source said they were civilians without militant affiliations in Gaza. He questioned Israel's account that they threw explosives towards troops. 
There was no immediate comment from Gaza's Islamist rulers Hamas or other militant groups in the enclave.
Israel and Hamas have fought three wars in the last decade, in addition to dozens of other smaller skirmishes. 
Tuesday's fatalities were the first in cross-border fighting since a two-day surge in violence in November between Israel and the armed Gaza-based faction Islamic Jihad that left 34 Palestinians dead and dozens of Israelis injured. 
Israel keeps Gaza under a blockade, tightly restricting movement out of the territory that is home to 2 million Palestinians. 
Israel says the blockade helps stop weapons from reaching Hamas, which has fired thousands of rockets at it over the past decade.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials on Monday deported an Iranian student headed to a Boston university despite efforts by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates to block the removal.
The deportation of Mohammad Shahab Dehghani Hossein Abadi, a 24-year-old Iranian citizen enrolled at Northeastern University, comes after U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) announced an ""enhanced security posture"" amid heightened tensions with Iran.
The case had raised new questions about fair treatment of Iranians by immigration authorities under the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump. Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leading Democratic presidential candidate, called on CBP to halt Abadi's deportation on Monday night and vowed to fight Trump's ""xenophobic policies.""
Boston-based attorney Kerry Doyle, who took on the case along with attorneys from two other private firms and the ACLU, said Abadi shared immigration paperwork electronically that showed he had been denied entry due to a concern that he would remain in the United States beyond the scope of his student visa.
An official with the Department of Homeland Security said that charge was a ""catch all"" reason used to deny entrants. The official, who requested anonymity to discuss the case, said border authorities were concerned that Abadi had immediate family members with business ties to Hezbollah, a heavily armed group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States.
Doyle rejected that allegation and said a summary of Abadi's interview with border authorities suggested confusion over his father's identity.
""It appeared that there was someone with a similar name or there was some mix-up,"" she said.
Boston-based U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs halted Abadi's removal on Monday for 48 hours after an emergency petition filed by the ACLU. The DHS official said Abadi already had boarded a flight to leave the United States at that point.
Carol Rose, executive director at the ACLU of Massachusetts, argued in a statement on Tuesday that border authorities could have stopped the removal, but ""defied a federal court order and deported Shahab without due process.""
Whether CBP officials could have retrieved Abadi from the flight on Monday evening remained unclear.
A second Boston-based federal judge, U.S. District Judge Richard Stearns, said during a hearing on Tuesday that the challenge to Abadi's detention was moot since he had been removed from the country, according to the ACLU and the DHS official.
VISA CANCELED
Abadi was granted a U.S. student visa approximately one week ago, but had that visa canceled following his arrival at Boston Logan International Airport on Sunday, according to court documents.
Following the Jan. 3 U.S. military strike in Iraq that killed the top Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani, dozens of Iranian Americans with U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent residency were detained by U.S. immigration officials at a border crossing in Washington state.
Local advocacy organizations criticized the detentions - which they said stretched to 12 hours - as unusual and troubling.
CBP said in a Jan. 10 statement that it was operating with an ""enhanced security posture"" amid tensions with Iran. That came after retaliatory Iranian strikes on bases housing U.S. forces.
The ACLU of Massachusetts said that at least 10 Iranian students had been denied entry at U.S. airports since August 2019, with seven of those denials occurring at Logan International Airport."

Some countries will face bans only on some visa categories, the Wall Street Journal reported. The list of countries was not final and could yet change, website Politico said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with the Journal that he was considering adding countries to the travel ban, but declined to state which ones. Politico said an announcement was expected as early as Monday.
The move is likely to sour ties between the United States and the countries affected under the expanded ban. 
Nigeria, for example, Africa's largest economy and most populous country, is a U.S. anti-terrorism partner and has a large diaspora residing in the United States.
A senior Trump administration official said that countries that failed to comply with security requirements, including biometrics, information-sharing and counter-terrorism measures, faced the risk of limitations on U.S. immigration.
The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The State Department declined to comment.
Under the current version of the ban, citizens of Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as well as some Venezuelan officials and their relatives are blocked from obtaining a large range of U.S. immigrant and non-immigrant visas.
Chad was previously covered under the ban but was removed in April 2018.

Citizens of the countries can apply for waivers to the ban, but they are exceedingly rare.

Bolivia's legislature, controlled by his party, had not yet accepted his resignation. Morales stepped down on Nov. 10, as support from his allies and the military evaporated following a disputed election and widespread protests.
""The letter of resignation has been considered and approved by a majority,"" said Sergio Choque, head of the lower Chamber of Deputies. Choque added that the move showed Congress was fulfilling its parliamentary role.
Morales has maintained that he was ousted in a right-wing coup. Since he stepped down, he has noted in some interviews that he was legally still president until lawmakers approved his resignation. He does not plan to run in new elections in May.
In the resignation letter, read out to a packed Congress, the long-standing leader criticized the current government and said it was his responsibility to continue to protect his Bolivian ""brothers and sisters"".
Morales left Bolivia days after his resignation and is now in Argentina. From there, he has been active in his Movement for Socialism party's election campaign ahead of the May. 3 vote."

Armed militants forced their way into the market of the village of Alamou and attacked people there before burning the structure to the ground, the government said in a statement on Tuesday.
The bloodshed is part of a surge in violence in the West African country that has killed hundreds, forced nearly a million from their homes and made much of the north ungovernable over the past two years.
""These repeated attacks on innocent civilians call for real cooperation between defense and security forces,"" the government said.
President Roch Marc Kabore called for two days of national mourning in response to the attack. It was not immediately clear who was responsible.
Islamist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have carried out increasingly brazen attacks against civilian and military targets in Burkina Faso in recent months, including an attack on a mining convoy in November that killed nearly 40 people.

SAN JOSE (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday stressed the need for Venezuela and Nicaragua to hold free and fair elections, singling out the countries' left-wing governments for criticism.
Pompeo said Nicaragua was an authoritarian regime, calling on its government to cease repression and support free and fair elections, sentiments he echoed in comments about Venezuela.
The two countries' allied governments have been hit by U.S. sanctions following humanitarian crises. Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega crushed protests in 2018 in a clampdown that led to more than 300 deaths. 
Oil exporter Venezuela is suffering an economic collapse and hyperinflation under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro.
Maduro blames U.S. sanctions for the suffering. He has resisted international calls for early presidential elections. 
""We've seen no evidence that Maduro is remotely interested in having free and fair elections. He knows that he would lose,"" Pompeo told reporters in the Costa Rican capital.
Asked whether the United States would consider direct talks with Maduro, Pompeo said there had been many conversations with the Venezuelan leader in recent months. 
A State Department official said the reference to conversations with Maduro related to efforts by countries other than the United States, such as Norway and other European nations.

Maduro's envoys talked with the Venezuelan opposition in negotiations brokered by Norway last year, and during several previous attempts to find a way out of the country's political crisis. So far, none of the talks have led to a breakthrough.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin approved a new government on Tuesday which he described as a break with the past, bringing in some fresh faces but retaining many senior ministers. 
The new government included a new economy minister and a new first deputy prime minister, but the finance, foreign, defense, energy and agriculture ministers all kept their jobs.
The new team was formed less than a week after Putin unveiled a sweeping shake-up of the political system, which led to the resignation of his ally Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister along with the entire government.
Putin went on to pick 53-year-old former tax chief Mikhail Mishustin, who has almost no political profile, as his new prime minister. 
Putin's wider shake-up, which envisages changing the constitution, is widely seen as preparing the ground for 2024, when Putin, now 67, is obliged to leave the presidency after occupying the Kremlin or the prime minister's job continuously since 1999.
Critics have long said Putin, a former KGB officer, wants to stay on in some capacity after his term ends so that he can wield power over the world's largest nation and one of its two biggest nuclear powers.
Tuesday's new appointments could be intended to reboot the government's flagging image and shift attention to Putin's drive to lift falling real incomes and drive ahead with big national infrastructure projects which he hopes will catapult his country into a new economic league.
“The most important task is to increase the welfare of our citizens and strengthen our statehood and the position of our country in the world. All these are absolutely attainable goals,” Putin told the new government.
“We have achieved a very balanced government. We have enough people who worked in the previous government, as well as a major renewal.” 
Finance Minister Anton Siluanov, Energy Minister Alexander Novak, Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov all kept their jobs.
""THE LOGIC HAS CHANGED""
Putin named Andrei Belousov, his economy advisor since 2013, as first deputy prime minister, replacing Anton Siluanov who had held the role since May 2018.
Belousov, 60, in 2018 proposed making big metals and mining companies pay a windfall tax, sending their share prices lower, although that proposal was subsequently watered down. 
Belousov also made headlines last year when he confirmed his friendship with businessman Artem Avetisyan, whose legal battle with private equity fund Baring Vostok has rattled the business community. 
Putin approved 40-year-old Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Reshetnikov, a former regional governor, as the new economy minister, replacing Maxim Oreshkin who spent just over three years in the role. Reshetnikov has previously worked in the Moscow mayor's office.
Putin also replaced the minister of telecommunications. He named Maksut Shadaev, until now a vice president of state telecoms operator Rostelecom, to the role. 
Abbas Gallyamov, a former government speech writer, said Putin had removed three people strongly disliked in certain parts of society - the ministers for culture and education, and a deputy prime minister who oversaw sport at the height of a doping scandal.
""Previously the Kremlin said it would appoint who it wanted and didn't care if people didn't like their choice,"" Gallyamov wrote on social media. ""Now the logic has changed and the authorities do not want to irritate society.""

But he said keeping on some political heavyweights, signalled there was little change in direction, adding: ""Putin is clearly showing that substantive changes to the regime's ideology are not planned.""

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state prosecutors have charged Fabio Schvartsman, the former chief executive of miner Vale, and 15 other people with homicide for a dam disaster last year that killed more than 250 people, according to the charging document seen by Reuters.
In addition to homicide charges, Vale SA and TUV SUD, the company responsible for inspecting the dam, were charged with environmental crimes.
The 16 individuals charged had worked for Vale or TUV SUD, prosecutors said.
Reuters reported earlier this month that prosecutors were set to file criminal charges in coming days.
The collapse of the Vale tailings dam on Jan. 25, 2019 in the town of Brumadinho was one of the world's deadliest mining accidents and knocked $19 billion off Vale's market value in a single day.
Vale shares were down almost 2% in afternoon trade in Sao Paulo.

A rise in tensions in recent weeks between Ouattara and his opponents has raised fears of election-related violence in Ivory Coast, francophone West Africa's largest economy, where a disputed 2010 vote set off a civil war that killed 3,000 people.
Ouattara said earlier this month that he intends to revise the constitution ahead of the election to make it ""more coherent"" but has not provided details.
""There will be no change in the constitution to prevent anyone from being a candidate,"" Ouattara told Reuters on the sidelines of a briefing at think-tank Chatham House in London.
""The new constitution (says) anyone can be a candidate, no age limit and I don’t intend to change that.""
Some opposition leaders have speculated that Ouattara, who is 78, will reimpose the 75-year age limit for presidential candidates that was removed from a new constitution he championed in 2016.
That would exclude himself but also his main rivals, former presidents Laurent Gbagbo, who turns 75 in May, and Henri Konan Bedie, who is 85, from running.
Ouattara said late last year he would seek a third term if his predecessors decided to compete.
He told Reuters he would make an announcement by July on whether he would seek re-election, fearing instability and a 'lame duck' presidency if he decides not to run and makes it known months in advance of an election.
Gbagbo and Bedie have also not yet said whether they will run.
Gbagbo was acquitted earlier this year of crimes against humanity at the International Criminal Court for his role in the war but remains in Europe pending an appeal by the prosecution.
Political tensions in Ivory Coast have risen since last month, when the public prosecutor issued an arrest warrant for presidential candidate Guillaume Soro, a former rebel leader whose forces swept Ouattara to power in 2011.
Soro, currently in Europe, denies charges that he plotted a coup against Ouattara and says they are politically motivated.

Speaking ahead of talks with Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Trump said trade and borders were both critical points for discussion, while Khan said that for him Afghanistan was the top priority.
""Trade is going to be of very, very paramount importance ... and we're working together on some borders, and we're talking about Kashmir in relation to what is going on with Pakistan and India. And if we can help we certainly will be helping,"" he said.
""We've been watching that and following it very, very closely,"" he added.
Kashmir, which sits high in the Himalayas between India and Pakistan, has been in dispute between the nuclear-armed neighbors since they gained independence in 1947.
Tensions between the two have flared since August last year, when India sent troops to its side of Kashmir to quell unrest after it revoked the area's special autonomous status. Because India and Pakistan have fought two of three wars over Kashmir, any stand-off in the region is fraught with risk.
Khan, an international cricketer before turning to politics, said that while relations with India were important, the most pressing concern was Afghanistan.

533,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 01:01PM ET</span>",Main Irish opposition party would double vacant-site levy,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's main opposition party Fianna Fail, leading opinion polls before an election on Feb. 8, would double the state levy on sites suitable for housing but not yet developed in an effort to increase much needed supply.
A scarcity of housing has led to rapid rises in rents and homeless levels in Ireland's booming economy and is one of the key cost-of-living issues that could decide whether or not Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael Party wins another term.
The fellow center-right Fianna Fail said on Tuesday that it would increase the vacant-site levy introduced by Fine Gael to 14% from 7%.
It also detailed a new scheme where the state would top up the savings of first-time home buyers up to the value of 10,000 euros by one-third, targeting prospective home buyers paying high rents and struggling to save deposits.
The scheme would be limited to 25,000 applicants a year and run for five years in conjunction with the current ""help to buy"" tax rebate for first-time buyers, which Fianna Fail would also increase to 25,000 euros from the current 20,000 euro-level.
Varadkar said on Monday that Fine Gael, which introduced the scheme in 2016, would boost the rebate to 30,000 euros if re-elected. [nL8N29P4BR]
Fianna Fail housing spokesman Darragh O'Brien said the party would also cut development levies paid by builders on condition that a project is completed within three years. He said the party would not introduce a temporary freeze on rents that it had previously considered but now believed was unconstitutional.
Sinn Fein, Ireland's third largest party which an opinion poll on Monday put just two points behind Fine Gael and four shy of Fianna Fail, wants to freeze rents for three years and refund an average month's rent each year during that period.
Other Sinn Fein policies such as lowering the statutory retirement age back to 65 from 66 appear to have struck a chord with voters. But both Fine Gael and Fianna Fail refuse to govern with Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
Opinion polls suggest that one of the two largest parties will lead another minority government after the election."

Two senior political sources told Reuters the cabinet would be made up of 20 ministers with economist Ghazi Wazni as finance minister. In a Twitter post earlier on Tuesday, caretaker Finance Minister Ali Hassan Khalil of the Hezbollah-allied Amal Movement said a new government was ""hours away"".
Heavily indebted Lebanon has been without effective government since Saad al-Hariri resigned as premier in October due to protests against state corruption and waste - the root causes of the country's worst financial and economic crisis since its 1975-90 civil war.
The issue has become more pressing since hundreds of people were injured in clashes between protesters and security forces at the weekend. Ordinary Lebanese have been hit hard by banks' restrictions on access to cash, a slump in the Lebanese pound, job losses and inflation.
Two senior political sources earlier told Reuters all issues that had delayed a government deal had been resolved. 
The heavily armed Hezbollah and its political allies had been unable to agree the make-up of the cabinet since designating former education minister Hassan Diab as premier more than a month ago. 
Diab was headed to the presidential palace on Tuesday and Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri was set to follow, political sources and local media said. 

The government is expected to be comprised of specialists rather than politicians - a demand of protesters - but political parties have sought to put forward the names of the specialists themselves in order to maintain cabinet influence.

GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States urged China on Tuesday to join trilateral nuclear arms talks with Moscow, calling Beijing's secrecy around growing stockpiles a ""serious threat to strategic stability"".
U.S. President Donald Trump said last year he had discussed a new accord on limiting nuclear arms with Russian President Vladimir Putin and hoped to extend that to China in what would be a major deal between the globe's top three atomic powers. But China has so far refused to take part.
""We think, given the fact that China's nuclear stockpile is estimated to double over the next ten years, now is the time to have that trilateral discussion,"" Robert Wood, U.S. disarmament ambassador, told reporters on the opening day of the U.N.-backed Conference on Disarmament in Geneva.
He said that Washington had discussed the potential trilateral talks in a security meeting with Russia last week and had reached an ""understanding"" about pursuing them. ""We cannot afford to wait,"" he added.
Asked how to go about pressuring Beijing to join, Wood said that he hoped Russia, and others, would help. ""Hopefully over time and through the influence of others besides the United States, they (China) will come to the table. We think it's imperative for global security that the Chinese do that.""
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said last week that Russia would take part in potential trilateral talks but that he ""won't force China to change"" its current position.
China has previously said its weapons were the ""lowest level"" of its national security needs and not comparable to those of Russia and the United States.
The United Nations is seeking the total elimination of nuclear arms but talks have been deadlocked for more than 20 years.
Other talks between the five declared nuclear powers that have ratified the 1970 Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) - China, United States, Russia, France and the United Kingdom - are ongoing and a meeting is planned in London next month.
However, Wood said this was not the right framework for nuclear arms talks with Beijing.
In his speech, China's disarmament Ambassador Li Song did not refer to its own nuclear stockpiles but called for cooperation among nuclear powers and made a thinly-veiled swipe at the Trump administration.
Li called for a commitment to multilateralism, ""with no exceptions, least of all the big power which shoulders a special responsibility for international peace and security and who is not expected to play the role of a 'spoiler' to our collective efforts and to withdraw from treaties""."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday let residents of Flint, Michigan pursue a civil rights lawsuit against the city and government officials that accused them of knowingly allowing the city's water supply to become contaminated with lead.
The justices turned away two appeals by the city and the state and local officials of a lower court ruling that allowed the lawsuit to move forward. The lower court rejected a demand for immunity by the officials, finding that they violated the residents' right to ""bodily integrity"" under the U.S. Constitution by providing the tainted water after switching water sources in a cost-cutting move in 2014.
The justices' action comes as similar class-action cases are currently on appeal at the Cincinnati, Ohio-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Flint switched its public water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River to reduce costs during a financial crisis. The corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes.
Lead poisoning can stunt children's cognitive development. No level of exposure is considered safe.
The city switched back to Lake Huron water the next year. The contaminated river water also triggered an outbreak of bacteria-caused Legionnaires' disease, which killed 12 people and sickened dozens of others
Lawsuits over Flint's water have proliferated in recent years. The number of people who have reported being harmed through exposure to contaminants in Flint, including lead and bacteria, or who experienced ailments such as rashes and hair loss, has reached more than 25,000, including more than 5,000 children under 12, according to court records.
The cases center on the Constitution's 14th Amendment guarantee of due process under the law, which can protect people from government-induced harm to their personal security or health, a legal principle known as ""bodily integrity.""
Courts have previously enforced the right to confront abuses of power in cases of direct physical intrusion, such as non-consensual medical procedures or forced drug administration.
The defendants argued that the lower courts have dangerously expanded that right by applying it to policy decisions that result in public exposure to environmental toxins. They also argued they are protected from the claims through a legal doctrine known as ""qualified immunity"" because they could not have known they could be held liable for ""doing the best they could in difficult circumstances with limited information.""
The case before the justices was filed in 2016 by two Flint residents including Shari Guertin, who said that she and her child were exposed to high levels of lead.
Calling the water crisis a ""government-created environmental disaster"" in a 2019 ruling, the 6th Circuit green-lighted the constitutional claims and rejected immunity for the officials."
538,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 21, 2020 11:49AM ET</span>",Spain's new government spars with right on region's sex education veto,"By Clara-Laeila Laudette
MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's new leftist government accused the far right on Tuesday of eroding children's right to education and promoting ignorance in response to attempts by the region of Murcia to uphold a divisive ""parental veto"" on sex education.
The ultra-conservative Vox party, which emerged as Spain's third largest political force in a parliamentary election in November, catapulted the issue of whether parents can prevent children from attending classes on sex and relationships to the forefront of public debate.
It has long argued that such classes encourage pupils' interest in homosexuality and transgender identity.
Murcia is one of three Spanish autonomous regions which saw Vox enter power via alliances with conservative and center-right parties last year, a strategy which has enabled it to influence policy both within local coalitions and on the national stage.
""There are parties that do not want free men and women to educate us freely,"" government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said on Tuesday during a press briefing. ""The right-wing sees ignorance and inability as freedom.""
On Monday, Education Minister Isabel Celaa threatened to take legal action against the region if it fails to ""restore legality"" and remove the parental veto within a month.
However, Murcia regional government leader Fernando Lopez Miras said on radio channel Cadena Ser on Tuesday ""the freedom and rights of parents within the region ... are non-negotiable"".
""The ideological neutrality of teachers in Murcia region is unquestionable,"" said Lopez Miras, of the conservative People's Party (PP). ""The parental veto gives parents freedom.""
The PP, one of Spain's largest parties, has also veered to the right on the subject, with its Secretary General Teodoro Garcia Egea accusing Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez of seeking to ""indoctrinate children with compulsory, extracurricular workshops"".
Rights groups have been particularly critical of Vox's attacks on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights that have undermined years of political consensus on the issue in Spain, which in 2005 became only the third country in the world to allow same-sex marriage.
Spaniards rank among Europe's most supportive when it comes to LGBT rights, with the Pew Research Center recording 77% of citizens either supported or strongly supported same-sex marriage in 2018."

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition legislator Gilber Caro, whose whereabouts had been unknown since December, is being held in state custody and is in good condition, his lawyer said on Tuesday.
A special police unit took Caro into custody on Dec. 20 in an operation that opposition leaders described as illegal because he is protected by parliamentary immunity. He was indicted on charges including terrorism without the presence of legal counsel, according to his lawyer Theresly Malave.
Caro's arrest came as President Nicolas Maduro's government carried out a new wave of legal actions against opposition lawmakers just as opposition leader Juan Guaido's campaign to oust Maduro was stalling.
""He is well, but he shouldn't be there,"" said Malave, who on Monday was able to spend 45 minutes with him, together with one of his sisters. In a telephone interview, Malave said she could not disclose Caro's specific location.
Venezuela's Information Ministry and state prosecutor's office did not respond to requests for comment on Caro, a leading member of Guaido's hardline opposition party, Popular Will.
Before his December arrest, Caro had already spent a year and half in prison after being jailed without trial in January 2017 during anti-government protests on charges of treason and stealing military material. His lawyer at the time said Caro was innocent and authorities had planted weapons on him.
In an interview with Reuters after his release in June 2018, Caro said prison authorities had deprived him of food and water, causing him to lose a fifth of his body weight, and left him in solitary confinement for up to four months at a time.
Caro was detained again last year in April and released in June, though the government did not comment on the charges.
Some 30 lawmakers remain detained, in exile, or in refuge at embassies in Caracas, according to Guaido.
In December, Maduro's government approved a trial of four opposition lawmakers accused of committing crimes including treason and conspiracy.
Guaido last January invoked Venezuela's constitution to assume a rival presidency, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate, and was swiftly backed by dozens of countries including the United States."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Often seen as the preserve of old, rich men, this year's World Economic Forum has thrust around a dozen teenage ""change-makers"" to the top of its agenda, adding fresh voices, energy and fashion to proceedings.
The first panel of the four-day Alpine gathering made clear the shift from 81-year-old founder Klaus Schwab, with four young activists, including Sweden's Greta Thunberg, discussing how to forge ""A Sustainable Path towards a Common Future"".
The combined age of the panel, which included water, electricity and health activists from Zambia, Puerto Rico and Canada, was 64 -- younger than many of those in the audience.
""Davos elite being rebuked by their future customers,"" Isabel Hilton, chief executive of China Dialogue, said on Twitter.
For Thunberg, now a familiar face globally, the transition from campaigner to participant has been rapid. A year ago she was leading protests at Davos as well as speaking, warning the world that ""the house is on fire"".
This year she is taking part in several high-profile panels, including delivering a speech shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump spoke. Trump has ridiculed her in the past and glancingly referred to her as a ""prophet of doom"" on Tuesday.
Joining Thunberg among the 'change-makers' is Naomi Wadler, a 13-year-old anti-gun campaigner from the United States.
Wearing Doc Martens boots and chequered trousers, Wadler appeared entirely unfazed by her role as a Davos participant, saying she hoped to inspire as well as being inspired.
""I think it's so great that we're all invited... because this is something that hasn't been done before,"" Wadler, the youngest of the youth activists, told Reuters.
""The forum used to be made up of a lot of old, rich white men and so I think it's really cool that we have so many people of color.""
Among ten 'change-makers' profiled by the World Economic Forum on its website were Mohamad Al Jounde, 18, a Syrian education campaigner; Autumn Peltier, a 15-year-old Canadian who focuses on water resources; and Ayakha Melithafa, a 17-year-old environmentalist from South Africa.
The buzz around the group was infectious. On one climate panel, Fahd al-Rasheed, a 42-year-old Saudi official, joked that he wanted to be grouped with all the young people this year. The audience laughed, and Melithafa launched into an impassioned plea for more action on climate change.
""The WEF has finally realized that we have a role to play,"" she said later. ""We can't leave youth out of the conversation any longer.""
In South Africa, said Melithafa, people watch parliament ""which is full of old white men and old black men talking about what's best for young people. They need to stop and listen because we also have voices."""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Several hundred Hong Kong protesters gathered on Tuesday at the site of an attack six months ago by an armed mob on anti-government demonstrators, denouncing the lack of progress by police in bringing those responsible to justice.
Chinese-ruled Hong Kong has been embroiled by more than seven months of turmoil sparked by a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent to China for trial.
The youth-led protests, including mass marches, petrol bomb attacks and battles on university campuses, have since morphed into a broader revolt against authorities and strong-arm Chinese rule.
Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 with sweeping promises of a high degree of autonomy and freedoms. But the perceived failure of Beijing to honor these commitments has fueled the protests, posing a grave challenge to Chinese leader Xi Jinping.
China denies meddling in Hong Kong and blames the West for stirring up trouble.
Some protesters in a concourse below the Yuen Long train station in a district close to the border with China said they remained traumatized by scenes of an armed mob of white-shirted men beating up black-shirted protesters and ordinary people on July 21 last year.
A pro-democracy district councilor, Zachary Wong, criticized the police for not preventing the attack, and for not apprehending any of the attackers afterwards when they retreated into a nearby village and were surrounded by officers.
Yuen Long district councilor Tommy Cheung, who has helped set up a task force to probe the attack, said none of the 37 men arrested so far, some with organized criminal gang backgrounds, had yet seen their cases go to trial.
Jason Liu, a 29-year-old masked protester in the crowd, said he'd lost confidence in police enforcement: harsh on pro-democracy protesters but lenient toward pro-government allies, even those suspected of serious crimes.
""They always have excuses, and justify everything they do as right,"" said Liu, who was dressed in a gray hoodie while listening as riot police surrounded the area. ""It's really unfair how twisted and biased law enforcement has become.""
More than 7,000 protesters have been arrested in connection with the protests so far, including nearly 1,000 who have been charged. Police dispersed the protesters on Tuesday with pepper spray and made several arrests during a face-off in a nearby park.
Moody's downgraded Hong Kong's credit rating one notch this week as the city's leader, Carrie Lam, flew to the World Economic Forum in Davos for a charm offensive amid the turmoil. She said in an interview with CNBC she was ""very disappointed"".
Despite the backlash against Beijing, there are few signs of Beijing heeding demands for democracy and respect for the freedoms guaranteed at the handover.
China's most senior official in the city, Luo Huining, wrote on Monday in the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece, the People's Daily, of the need to ""establish and perfect the national security protection legal system and executive mechanism, as well as strengthening law enforcement"".
Lam said in Davos conditions have to be right for a national security law.
“Enacting local legislation to protect national security has always been Hong Kong’s constitutional obligation. That is written into the Basic Law (mini-constitution),"" she said.
""(But) I have to ask myself whether we have the right conditions conducive to doing this very controversial issue now.”"

GENEVA (Reuters) - North Korea said on Tuesday it was no longer bound by commitments to halt nuclear and missile testing, blaming the United States' failure to meet a year-end deadline for nuclear talks and ""brutal and inhumane"" U.S. sanctions.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un set an end-December deadline for denuclearization talks with the United States and White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said at the time the United States had opened channels of communication.
O'Brien said then he hoped Kim would follow through on denuclearization commitments he made at summits with U.S. President Donald Trump.
Ju Yong Chol, a counselor at North Korea's mission to the U.N. in Geneva, said that over the past two years, his country had halted nuclear tests and test firing of inter-continental ballistic missiles ""in order to build confidence with the United States"".
But the United States had responded by conducting dozens of joint military exercises with South Korea on the divided peninsula and by imposing sanctions, he said.
""As it became clear now that the U.S. remains unchanged in its ambition to block the development of the DPRK and stifle its political system, we found no reason to be unilaterally bound any longer by the commitment that the other party fails to honor,"" Ju told the U.N.-backed Conference on Disarmament.
Speaking as the envoy from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), North Korea's official name, Ju accused the United States of applying ""the most brutal and inhumane sanctions"".
""If the U.S. persists in such hostile policy toward the DPRK there will never be the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula,"" he said.
""If the United States tries to enforce unilateral demands and persists in imposing sanctions, North Korea may be compelled to seek a new path.""
U.S. military commanders said any new path could include the testing of a long-range missile, which North Korea has suspended since 2017, along with nuclear warhead tests.
""DO THE RIGHT THING""
U.S. disarmament ambassador Robert Wood voiced concern at Pyongyang's remarks and said Washington hoped the North would return to the negotiating table.
""What we hope is that they will do the right thing and come back to the table and try to work out an arrangement where by we can fulfill that pledge that was made by President Trump and Chairman Kim to denuclearize,"" he said.
South Korean Ambassador Jang-keun Lee said there must be substantial progress in denuclearization to ""maintain and build upon the hard-won momentum for dialogue"".
""Therefore, early resumption of negotiations between the United States and the DPRK is critical,"" he said.
Vesna Batistic Kos, permanent representative of Croatia to the U.N. Office at Geneva speaking on behalf of the European Union, also called on North Korea to stick to the talks.
Pyongyang, slapped with multiple Security Council resolutions and sanctions, has rejected unilateral disarmament and given no indication that it is willing to go beyond statements of broad support for the concept of universal denuclearization.
North Korea has said in previous, failed talks that it could consider giving up its arsenal if the United States provided security guarantees by removing its troops from South Korea and withdrew its so-called nuclear umbrella of deterrence from South Korea and Japan.
Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. 

The North regularly used to threaten to destroy the South's main ally, the United States, before rapprochement began after the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea.

The plexiglass installations bear laser-etched epitaphs in Hebrew to those believed to have been buried at the site.
Poland was home to more than three million Jews before World War Two, one of the world's largest Jewish communities, but the vast majority were killed by Nazi German occupiers who set up death camps such as Auschwitz on Polish soil.
Next Monday world leaders including German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier and Israeli President Reuven Rivlin will join some of the dwindling number of survivors at Auschwitz to commemorate the 75th anniversary of the camp's liberation.
Ethnologist Katarzyna Kopecka and photographer Piotr Pawlak travel around Poland searching for the sites of former Jewish cemeteries in their 'Currently Absent' project.
""This is a bit like bringing back roots that have been destroyed, but life is stronger than the entire attempt at destruction,"" said Pawlak. ""We can bring some memory back.""
The POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews in Warsaw says on its website there are 1,164 Jewish cemeteries in Poland, but more than half of them have no tombstones left.
Kopecka said they got the idea for the project after they discovered they were unwittingly sitting in an area that was actually a cemetery.
""Whether it's a field, or something else, these places are usually neglected,"" said Kopecka, who plans to visit some 200 such sites with Pawlak for their project.
DESCENDANTS' INTEREST
Kopecka said they often work with local authorities to determine the site of a former cemetery, but even they sometimes cannot locate it, forcing her and Pawlak to rely on guesswork.
The plexiglass installations are removed after they have been photographed.
The pictures have been displayed in Poland's parliament and in cultural centers around the country.
""We have people contacting us whose ancestors were buried in these cemeteries and they ask when we'll be going to a particular location,"" Kopecka said.
""They tell us the name of the place, they would like to obtain a photo because they've never been to Poland, and here rest their grandfathers, great-grandfathers, aunts and uncles.""
The duo plan to publish a book of their photos and to make a documentary on the cemeteries which would also feature descendants of those buried there."

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's government is willing to discuss the country's problems with leaders of demonstrations against the social and economic policies of President Ivan Duque, but some protest demands are ""unconstitutional"", a presidency official said.
Marchers in the Andean country held mass demonstrations in November and December last year to demand a varied laundry list of concessions from Duque's right-wing government. New protests are expected on Tuesday.
The unions and student groups who make up the National Strike Committee initially made 13 demands in talks with the government. These included stepped-up efforts to stop the murder of human rights activists and implement a peace deal with leftist rebels and the dissolution of the riot police force, who have drawn ire after a marcher was killed by a projectile.
The list eventually expanded to include 104 points covering fiscal, economic, trade and environmental demands, said presidency official Diego Molano, who leads negotiations for the government.
""We've found that some of the demands, an important number of them, are unconstitutional and don't correspond to executive branch functions,"" Molano told Reuters late on Monday.
""Others aren't on the government's agenda because they correspond to a new political or economic model and correspond more to structural changes at the depths of government, of the Colombian state, or they are financially inviable,"" he added.
One demand is that state-run oil company Ecopetrol become exclusively public property and exclude private investors, Molano said, an effort that would cost more than $4.5 billion.
The committee has asked for one-on-one talks with the government but Duque has insisted on participation by a wider swath of interest groups, including business organizations.
""The government of President Duque has all the willingness to keep talking, to advance in a conversation that allows us to move to proposals, to collaborate and solve problems,"" Molano said. ""On the points where we can find agreement we will seek concrete agreements.""
A top union leader told Reuters last week that protests will restart with more intensity this year.
Protests in 2019 were largely peaceful, but were marked by looting and attacks against public transport during their first few days, leading Cali and Bogota to institute curfews.
Five people died in connection with the demonstrations, which followed upheaval in other Latin American countries such as Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia.
The death of teenage protester Dilan Cruz, injured by a projectile fired by riot police, became a rallying cry for many marchers. The squad is now banned from using the weapon that killed Cruz."

The auction, sanctioned by a court order, is part of efforts by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government to sell assets confiscated in criminal cases with the proceeds used to shore up banks struggling with piles of bad debt.
Modi, a billionaire jeweler in his late forties whose diamonds have adorned Hollywood stars such as Kate Winslet and Dakota Johnson, was arrested over allegations of his involvement in a $2 billion fraud at India's state-run Punjab National Bank. He has denied the charges and is opposing efforts to extradite him from Britain to India.
Highlighting Saffronart's auction of Modi's assets - seized by India's financial crime-fighting agency, will be ""Boy with Lemon"" by pioneering Hungarian-Indian modernist artist Amrita Sher-Gil valued at 120-180 million rupees ($1.69-$2.53 million).
Other paintings to be sold will include an oil on canvas by India's best known painter M.F. Husain of similar value, and a work worth 70-90 million rupees by modernist V.S. Gaitonde.
Also on the block will be luxury wristwatches from Jaeger Lecoultre and Gerrard Perregaux, several Birkin and Kelly luxury handbags from Hermès and two cars - a Porsche Panamera and a Rolls Royce (LON:RR) Ghost, a Saffronart statement said.
It said it was assessing the value of some assets and would say next week how much it expected to raise from the auction.
Indian tax authorities raised about $8 million in an auction conducted last year by Saffronart of rare oil paintings that were seized from Modi.
The pending auction, however, will be the first time India's financial crimes agency has appointed a professional auction house to sell off seized assets, according to Saffronart.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Rescuers began digging through several feet snow at two mountainside locations in Nepal on Tuesday where four South Korean trekkers and three Nepali guides are thought to be trapped, officials said.
The hikers have been missing since Friday, after being swept away by an avalanche during a trek in the region of Mount Annapurna, the world's tenth highest mountain.
Nepal Tourism Board official Nandini Thapa said army rescuers, who were ferried in by helicopter, had already started digging.
""It is very deep ice and the work would take time,"" Thapa said.
Army official Gokul Bhandari said the nine rescuers would spend the night there and continue the search early on Wednesday.
The operation could take several weeks as the avalanche had dumped up to 12 feet (3.6 meters) at the site of the disaster, about 150 km (90 miles) northwest of the capital Kathmandu, rescuer Bijay K.C. said.
The incident comes as the winter trekking season in Nepal, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest, is drawing to a close this month.
In 2018, five South Koreans and four Nepali guides on a Himalayan climbing expedition were flung to their deaths after a huge block of ice crashed over a cliff into a narrow mountain gorge."

Security Council after declaring it in violation of a 2015 pact would send a ""very, very negative message"".
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, in remarks carried by IRNA and other Iranian news agencies on Monday, said: ""If the Europeans continue their improper behavior or send Iran's file to the Security Council, we will withdraw from the NPT.""
Robert Wood, U.S. disarmament ambassador, noting talks set for April on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), told reporters in Geneva: ""Here we are on the eve of a review conference that Iran is threatening to walk away from.
""We think that Iran needs to end its malign behavior and sit down with the United States and negotiate an agreement that deals not only with the nuclear issue but also with the other issues that concern us like the ballistic missile proliferation and development and the malign activities around the world,” he said."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A senior Thai official met an envoy of the main insurgent group fighting in the country's largely Muslim south in what both sides described as a positive step toward a peace process, the Thai government said on Tuesday.
The meeting in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur marked the first time the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) had returned to talks since it pulled out of an earlier peace dialogue in 2014.
The long-running insurgency in the Malay-speaking region of predominantly Buddhist Thailand has killed some 7,000 people over the past 15 years. 
The conflict has flared on and off for decades as insurgent groups like the BRN continued a guerrilla war to demand independence for Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat provinces, which were part of an independent Malay sultanate before they were annexed by the Thais in 1909. Successive Thai governments have refused to allow any degree of autonomy in the restive region.
General Wanlop Rugsanaoh, the head of Thailand's Peace Dialogue Panel, met with Anas Abdulrahman, a representative of the BRN on Monday for a discussion brokered by the Malaysian government, a Thai government statement said.
A senior BRN official, Abdul Aziz Jabal, described the meeting as ""the first round of official peace dialogue"".
He told a news conference in Kuala Lumpur that the two sides agreed on several mutual commitments, including a framework and terms of reference laying ground rules for future talks.
The BRN official added that the talks were attended by ""observers from overseas"", without elaborating.
The BRN was among several insurgent groups to have participated in formal peace talks with the Thai government until a military coup in 2014. The military junta resumed talks with other insurgent groups two years later but the BRN did not join that process, which stalled in 2018.
Since then, the BRN and the Thai government have had several contacts, including a secret meeting last August outside of Thailand. 
Mara Patani, an umbrella group representing other insurgent factions, welcomed Monday's meeting as a positive step for the stalled peace process.

""It is good that the BRN has agreed to come to the table finally, We have been expecting that for so long and they were elusive,"" Abu Hafez Al-Hakim, a Mara Patani, spokesman, told Reuters. ""I hope the Thai government will be serious and more committed from now on.""

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - The U.S. Census Bureau was due to launch its latest once-in-a decade head count of Americans on Tuesday in one of the most remote corners of the country: a tiny, rural Alaska Native settlement on the Bering Sea coast.
The population tally was scheduled to officially get under way with a ceremonial visit of Census Bureau chief Steven Dillingham to the home of a tribal elder in Toksook Bay, a Yup'ik village about 500 miles west of Anchorage.
From there, a team will fan out to collect 2020 census data from all the other Toksook Bay residents in a day of fanfare that will include ceremonial Yup'ik dance performances and a feast of traditional foods.
The census, a decennial endeavor mandated in the U.S. Constitution, is the basis for redrawing state legislative districts and reapportionment of Congress. It is also guides government funding for a vast array of programs and services, and produces some of the world's most widely used statistical information.
In the Lower 48 states, information about this year's census is expected to be mailed to households in mid-March, with April 1 designated the date of record for residential information submitted on census forms. Most people are expected to respond online, by mail or by telephone.
But in sprawling rural Alaska, where roads are few and much travel depends on hard-frozen ground, the census must get started earlier.
The Census Bureau has a tradition of selecting one or more remote Native villages to begin the official enumeration. Toksook Bay, with a population of 683, according to Alaska state information, has this year's honor.
But Tuesday's census kickoff, as in years past, is about more than counting the residents of a particular village. It is also meant to draw attention.
""It's the first time the word is really getting across the nation that the 2020 census is here,"" Dillingham said on Saturday.
Dillingham and his colleagues have spent several days in the state meeting with Alaska Native groups and others among groups that tend to be undercounted – immigrants and college students.
At the University of Alaska Anchorage on Saturday night, Dillingham participated in a ceremonial puck drop for a hockey game, donning a special jersey given to him by the school to commemorate the 2020 census.
To help boost responses in harder-to-reach communities, the Census Bureau has translated its materials into several indigenous languages, including Yup'ik.
The bureau expects to hire 300,000 to 500,000 census takers for the 2020 count, and about 1.8 million people have already applied for the temporary jobs, Dillingham said.
Dillingham acknowledged that immigrants who feel vulnerable about their status in the United States may be reluctant to respond to questionnaires, but he stressed that all data collected is confidential.
The Trump administration tried to insert a question about citizenship status in this year's census form, a move that critics said would have made immigrants more fearful of the process. But the U.S. Supreme Court blocked that plan."

The report in the Tages-Anzeiger newspaper said the two Russians were checked by Swiss police in August last year in the ski resort, which is hosting the WEF gathering of the global business and political elite this week. The pair presented diplomatic passports and left the country, the paper said.
Police in the eastern Swiss canton of Grisons said two men with Russian diplomatic passports had been the subjects of a routine identity check in Davos in August 2019, but no connection had been established between their visit and the WEF.
""It is true that we checked two Russian citizens in Davos and they identified themselves with diplomatic passports, but we could not ascertain any reason to detain them. They were allowed to go,"" a cantonal police spokeswoman said, adding police had never identified the men as plumbers.
A spokesman for the Russian embassy in Bern dismissed the report, saying two Russian diplomats accredited outside Switzerland had been checked and allowed to go on their way.
""Diplomatic passports are given to high-ranking officials, not to manual laborers,"" he said. ""I think this was probably a dumb joke.""
Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry in Moscow, said she was not aware of the incident.
Investment fund manager Bill Browder, who has led a campaign to expose corruption and punish Russian officials whom he blames for the death of his lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Moscow prison in 2009 after complaining of mistreatment, said the alleged incident showed the reach of the Russian state.
""The Russians are actively targeting all of their enemies in all different countries - they have huge resources and Davos is an important place, and this is the one place I can come and personally challenge Russian officials over the murder of Sergei Magnitsky,"" Browder told Reuters Today in Davos on Tuesday.
Russian prosecutors have said they suspect Browder of ordering a string of murders, including of Magnitsky, in a twist the financier has dismissed as ludicrous."

One protester was killed in Baghdad while another succumbed to a bullet wound sustained on Monday in Baquba city, medical sources said, adding at least 50 demonstrators were wounded.
Violent clashes erupted for a third straight day in Baghdad's Tayaran Square (NYSE:SQ) and in other southern cities including Basra and the holy Shi'ite cities of Kerbala and Najaf, with protesters hurling stones and petrol bombs at police who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
""Our protests is peaceful. We call for the resignation of the government and an independent prime minister who does not belong to any party,"" said a hooded protester in Baghdad, who declined to give his name.
Anti-government unrest has crippled Iraq since Oct. 1, with protesters demanding an end to what they say is deeply-rooted corruption and a ruling elite that has controlled Iraq since the U.S.-led invasion in 2003. More than 450 people have been killed.
Iraqi President Barham Salih is expected to appoint a new premier this week, state media reported, to replace outgoing Adel Abdul Mahdi who was forced out by the demonstrations.
Salih is choosing between three Iraqi politicians to lead a transitional government that would ease popular anger, State TV reported, adding the decision could come as soon as Tuesday.
Tuesday's unrest followed violent gatherings on Monday that killed six Iraqis, including two police officers, and wounded scores across the country.
Protests resumed over the weekend after a lull of several weeks as demonstrators sought to keep up momentum after attention turned to the threat of a U.S.-Iran conflict following Washington's killing of Tehran's top general in an air strike inside Iraq.
The killing of Qassem Soleimani, to which Tehran responded with a ballistic missile attack on two Iraqi military bases, has highlighted the influence of some foreign powers in Iraq, especially Iran and the United States.
Three Katyusha rockets fell inside the capital's heavily fortified Green Zone which houses government buildings and foreign missions, police sources said. The rockets were launched from Zafaraniyah district outside Baghdad, the sources said, adding that two landed near the U.S. embassy."

DUBAI (Reuters) - An Iranian lawmaker offered a $3 million reward to anyone who killed U.S. President Donald Trump and said Iran could avoid threats if it had nuclear arms, ISNA news agency reported on Tuesday amid Tehran's latest standoff with Washington.
Tensions have steadily escalated since Trump pulled Washington out of Tehran's nuclear agreement with world powers in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions. The standoff erupted into tit-for-tat military strikes this month.
""On behalf of the people of Kerman province, we will pay a $3 million reward in cash to whoever kills Trump,"" lawmaker Ahmad Hamzeh told the 290-seat parliament, ISNA reported.
He did not say if the idea of a reward had any official backing from Iran's clerical rulers.
The city of Kerman, in the province south of the capital, is the hometown of Qassem Soleimani, a prominent Iranian commander whose killing in a drone strike ordered by Trump on Jan. 3 in Baghdad prompted Iran to fire missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq.
""If we had nuclear weapons today, we would be protected from threats ... We should put the production of long-range missiles capable of carrying unconventional warheads on our agenda. This is our natural right,"" he was quoted as saying by ISNA.
The United States and it Western allies have long accused Iran of seeking nuclear weapons. Tehran insists it has never sought nuclear arms and never will, saying its nuclear work is for research and to master the process to generate electricity.
The 2015 nuclear agreement as a whole was designed to increase the time Iran would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb if it wanted one – the main obstacle to producing a nuclear weapon – from around two or three months.
Under the deal, Iran received sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear activities. In response to Washington's withdrawal from the pact and pressure from U.S. sanctions, Iran has gradually rolled back its commitments to the nuclear deal.
This month, Iran announced it was scrapping all limits on its uranium enrichment work, potentially shortening the so-called ""breakout time"" needed to build a nuclear weapon. Reports issued by the U.N. nuclear watchdog have suggested Tehran is still far from sprinting ahead with its work.
After its latest move to step away from compliance with the deal, European states Britain, France and Germany triggered a dispute mechanism in the pact, starting a diplomatic process that could lead to reimposing U.N. sanctions. 
Iran said on Monday that Tehran would pull out from the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if international sanctions were reimposed on the country. The 1968 NPT has been the foundation of global nuclear arms control since the Cold War.

The soldiers were arrested after the video surfaced on social media in July 2018. The shaky footage showed two women, one with an infant strapped to her back, being led across a patch of dusty scrubland by uniformed men who accused them of belonging to the Nigerian militant group Boko Haram.
Moments later, two of the men stepped back, leveled their rifles and fired a series of rounds into the victims.
Government and army officials initially dismissed the video as “fake news” meant to tarnish the government’s image, but later announced arrests in the case.
The sources said the trial began on Monday in a court in Yaounde, capital of the West African country.
Six of the soldiers admitted to having participated in the killings but said their commander had given the order to open fire, said the two sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly about the case.
The commander has denied giving the order, the sources said.
It was not clear how long the trial would last.
Cameroon has been battling Boko Haram for years in the country's far north, as the jihadist group fights to carve out an Islamic caliphate based across the border in Nigeria.
Rights activists, including Amnesty International, have accused government soldiers of repeatedly engaging in torture and extra-judicial killings in the far north. The government denies that there are systematic abuses.
The conflict with Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin has cost more than 30,000 lives and displaced millions more over the past decade, frequently spilling over into Cameroon, Niger and Chad."

Haftar abandoned talks for a ceasefire in Moscow last week and the blockade of Libyan oilfields by his forces overshadowed a summit in Berlin on Sunday aimed at shoring up a shaky truce.
His Libyan National Army (LNA) aims to capture the capital, Tripoli, through the backing of Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Russian mercenaries and African troops.
Turkey supports Haftar's opponents, the Tripoli-based internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) led by Fayez al-Serraj, and has dispatched military advisers and trainers to help the GNA.
Cavusoglu said Haftar's refusal to sign a joint communique in Berlin had raised questions about his intent.
""Does Haftar want a political or military solution? Until now, his stance has shown he wants a military one,"" he told Turkish broadcaster NTV at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
""Haftar must immediately fall back to the political solution line and take concrete and positive steps in line with calls of the international community for calm on the ground"".
Libya has had no stable central authority since Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown by NATO-backed rebels in 2011. For more than five years, it has had two rival governments, in the east and the west, with streets controlled by armed groups.
At the Berlin summit, foreign powers active in Libya committed to uphold an existing U.N. arms embargo and stop shipping weapons there, but Cavusoglu suggested that the commitment was dependent on a ceasefire holding.
""There were calls for no one to send additional forces or weapons there. All participants pledged to abide by this as long as the ceasefire continues,"" Cavusoglu said. ""Our president was clear on this... and we voiced it at the end of the summit too."""

KFAR HAROEH, Israel (Reuters) - An old photograph and modern face recognition technology could help two Israeli brothers find out how their father survived the Nazi Holocaust.
Seeking clues to the past, Eli and Saul Lieberman turned to an Israeli research center, which hopes to match family pictures from around the time of World War Two with its database of tens of thousands of photos, many taken by German Wehrmacht soldiers.
Those German photos show the troops themselves as well as people in villages and towns with Jewish populations.
Shem Olam Holocaust Memorial Centre launched its ""Face to Face"" project in July, calling via social media for people to send in pictures for facial recognition scans.
The Lieberman brothers know few details of the horrors their late father, Joseph, endured during the Holocaust, in which six million Jews were killed. A survivor of the Auschwitz death camp, he did not speak with them about his experiences.
But a photograph taken somewhere in Europe after the war shows their father together with two cousins, and Eli, 50, and Saul, 61, sent it to the Shem Olam center in July. They are awaiting a match and clues about their family's history.
""We live in a world that if you can't provide the document or the picture, it doesn't feel like it happened,"" Saul Lieberman said. ""People want to know where they came from, who they came from.""
So far, Shem Olam has received thousands of photos from the public but only several matches were made after further research and none was conclusive.
Avraham Krieger, the center's executive director, said he hoped that advances in technology and an expanding database would help connect a younger generation to the Holocaust.
""Face to Face is aimed first and foremost at giving some response to the chaotic reality created following the Holocaust ... that cut off any connection for those who survived, almost any connection to their past,"" Krieger said.
In Eastern Europe, the center's field researchers have also received photographs from local residents. Shem Olam has also received cooperation from various archives around the world.
The service is provided free of charge, said Assaf Fassy, Digital services manager for Shem Olam. He also hopes the project will help fight Holocaust denial."

BUNDANOON, Australia (Reuters) - Buddhist monk Phra Mana helped build his bush monastery with his bare hands three decades ago, but when Australia's worst wildfires in generations threatened to destroy it he stood up to fate with a smile.
An inferno ripped through the forest surrounding the Sunnataram Monastery in New South Wales two weeks ago and, after being evacuated, he and his fellow monks could do nothing but pray.
""I have never seen branches behave like this in the past 30 years,"" the Bangkok-born abbot said, describing how dry the land was. ""So when the heat came, it just burned so quick.""
This season's bushfires have razed an area equivalent to half of the UK, killed millions of animals, devastated rural communities and cost farmers and vintners their livelihoods.
At the monastery, which around 50 to 60 volunteer firefighters were dispatched to defend, only a few buildings and water tanks were lost.
True to his religion, Phra Mana has been able to accept the damage with equanimity.
""Wildfires are normal in Australia's bushland,"" the 56-year-old said as he strolled around the scorched compound in orange robes. ""As long as our faith and morale remain strong, we are prepared to face it.""
The Buddha statues gracing the compound still stand, and now the monks have added a message spelling out ""Thank you Firey"", addressed to the firefighters.
But the monastery remains under threat as a nearby forest continues to smolder. ""We are prepared. At the same time, we accept,"" Phra Mana said."

Harry was shown arriving on Vancouver Island by Sky News, just days after reaching an arrangement with Queen Elizabeth and senior royals that will see him and his wife Meghan leave behind their royal roles to seek an independent future. 
Buckingham Palace and the queen said on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer be working members of the royal family. They would not use their ""Royal Highness"" titles and would pay their own way in life, freeing them to forge a new future in Canada and the United States.
Harry has admitted he had not wanted to step away entirely from his royal life and his military appointments, but said there was no other option.
""It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,” he said on Sunday.
American actress Meghan returned to Canada on Jan. 10 to be reunited with baby son Archie, and Harry flew out late on Monday to join her.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex, the couple's formal title which they will continue to use, spent six weeks in Canada at the end of last year before returning to Britain.
Earlier this month, they shocked the royal family by publicly announcing they wanted more independence, leaving the other senior members hurt and disappointed, according to royal sources.
The new arrangement, agreed following a summit held by the queen at her Sandringham estate and attended by Harry's father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and elder brother Prince William, will come into effect this Spring. 
Harry is expected to carry out some official engagements before then although it is not clear whether Meghan will be involved. She was pictured in the Sun newspaper on Tuesday, walking her dogs in a park on Vancouver Island close to where the couple have been staying in a secluded house.
In their new life, the couple will no longer receive public money and will repay the cost of refurbishing their British home in Windsor, which official figures show amounted to 2.4 million pounds ($3 million).
But certain details, such as whether the couple could continue to use the “Sussex Royal” title for their website and branding and their future security arrangements, have either not been finalised or publicly revealed.
Asked about who would pay for their protection, justice minister Robert Buckland said there was an issue about how public money was spent.
""Quite clearly there have already been arrangements made about how that family are going to live and how they are going to be able to get private income but there clearly has to be a line of delineation,"" he told Sky News.

""I think we all want a family like that to be safe, but at the same time I think what really needs to happen is they need to understand how their lifestyle is to adapt and what their needs might be.""

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said it had asked the U.S. and French authorities for equipment to download information from black boxes on a downed Ukrainian airliner, potentially angering countries which want the recorders analyzed abroad.
Canada, 57 of whose citizens were among the 176 people killed in the crash, has said France should handle the flight data and voice recorders as one of the few nations with the capability. Kiev wants the recorders sent to Ukraine.
The U.S.-built Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 flown by Ukraine International Airlines was shot down in error on Jan. 8.
Tehran, already embroiled in a long-running standoff with the United States over its nuclear program that briefly erupted into tit-for-tat military strikes this month, has given mixed signals about whether it would hand over the recorders.
An Iranian aviation official had said on Saturday the black boxes would be sent to Ukraine, only to backtrack in comments reported a day later, saying they would be analyzed at home.
A further delay in sending them abroad is likely to increase international pressure on Iran, whose military has said it shot the plane down by mistake while on high alert in the tense hours after Iran fired missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq. 
Iran, which took several days to acknowledge its role in bringing down the plane and faced street protests at home as a result, launched its missiles at U.S. targets in response to a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian commander on Jan. 3.
""If the appropriate supplies and equipment are provided, the information can be taken out and reconstructed in a short period of time,"" Iran's Civil Aviation Organization said in its second preliminary report on the disaster released late on Monday.
Its initial report was released just 24 hours after the incident, before Iran's military acknowledged its role.
A list of equipment Iran needs has been sent to French accident agency BEA and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, the Iranian aviation body said.
""Until now, these countries have not given a positive response to sending the equipment to (Iran),"" it said. It said two surface-to-air TOR-M1 missiles had been launched minutes after the Ukrainian plane took off from Tehran.
'MAXIMUM PRESSURE'
Iran's aviation body said in its report it did not have equipment needed to download information from the model of recorders on the three-year-old Boeing 737.
Iran has for years faced U.S. sanctions that limited its ability to purchase modern planes and buy products with U.S. technology. Many passenger planes used in Iran are decades old.
Under Tehran's 2015 nuclear agreement with world powers, Iran received sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear work. But Washington reimposed U.S. sanctions after withdrawing from the pact in 2018, a move that led to the steady escalation of tension in recent months between the United States and Iran.
Responding to U.S. President Donald Trump's ""maximum pressure"" campaign designed to shut off Iran's oil exports, Tehran has scaled back its commitments to the nuclear accord.
After Iran's latest move this month to scrap limits on uranium enrichment, a process that can make material for nuclear warheads although Tehran denies any such aim, Britain, France and Germany triggered the nuclear pact's dispute mechanism.
Launching the mechanism starts a diplomatic process that could lead to reimposing U.N. sanctions on Iran.
European capitals say they want to save the deal but have also suggested it may be time for a broader pact, in line with Trump's call for a deal that would go beyond Iran's nuclear work and include its missile program and activities in the region.
Iran says it will not negotiate with sanctions in place.
The Iranian general killed in the U.S. drone strike, Qassem Soleimani, was responsible for building up a network of militias that created an arc of Iranian influence across the Middle East.
Since the plane disaster, Iran's judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi has said compensation should be paid to families of the victims, many of whom were Iranians or dual nationals.

Canada, Ukraine, Britain, Afghanistan and Sweden, which all lost citizens, have demanded Iran make the payouts. Canada's Transportation Safety Board said two of its investigators had spent six days in Iran and visited the wreckage. Iranian investigators had been ""cooperative and helpful"", it said.

The Vatican is one of just 15 countries that has diplomatic ties with Taiwan and the only one in Europe. But Taiwan has been concerned by the Vatican's moves to normalize ties with China, especially after a landmark 2018 pact on appointing bishops.
China, which believes Tsai wants formal independence for Taiwan, has heaped pressure on the president, who won re-election by a landslide this month on a platform of standing up to Beijing.
Tsai says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Taiwan hopes for a peaceful resolution of its differences with China, Tsai wrote in her letter, released by the presidential office on Tuesday, in response to a message from Pope Francis for the World Day of Peace on Jan. 1.
""However, at present dialogue across the Taiwan Strait is filled with difficulties,"" she wrote.
""The main sticking point is that China has so far been unwilling to let go of its desire to control Taiwan.""
She added, ""It continues to threaten Taiwan's democratic freedoms and human rights by threatening to use force against Taiwan, fake news, cyber attacks, and diplomatic means.""
But despite China's ""severe suppression"", Taiwan is moving forward, cooperating with friendly and similar-minded countries, so that other democracies recognize it as the best partner for maintaining peace and stability, she added.
China's recent military operations and exercises in the Taiwan Strait and surrounding areas have caused regional unrest and increased international distrust of it, Tsai said.
China has stepped up military activities near Taiwan since Tsai first won office in 2016, flying bomber patrols around the island and sending its latest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, through the sensitive Taiwan Strait in the election run-up.
Beijing cut diplomatic ties with the Vatican in 1951 and remains concerned an independent church in China could threaten its authority.

President Kais Saied named the former finance and tourism minister as his choice for premier on Monday, giving him a month to form a government that can win majority support in the deeply fragmented parliament.
Speaking late on Monday, Fakhfakh said his cabinet would try to meet the aspirations of the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy, citing the October election of Saied as evidence Tunisians wanted big change.
""We will work... to establish the conditions for a fair and strong state, a state that will reward weaker regions and weaker neighborhoods and end decades of poverty and marginalization,"" he said.
The economy has languished since the revolution, with low growth, high state deficits and debt, mounting unemployment and declining public services that have caused many Tunisians to lose faith in politics.
""We will focus all our forces on raising the priority challenges, social and economic, and strengthening democracy,"" he added.
Tunisia needs to borrow about $3 billion internationally in 2020 to meet spending commitments, and faces strong pressure from international lenders to cut spending.
Addressing Fakhfakh in published comments, Saied said: ""Remember the martyrs. Heed the cry of the unemployed and the cry of the poor"".
Saied named the former Total employee after the parliament this month rejected a government proposed by Habib Jemli, who was designated prime minister in November.
Jemli was nominated by the moderate Islamist Ennahda party, a member of successive governments since the revolution, after it came first in the October elections with 53 of the 217 seats.
However, he was not able to win enough support from other parties for his proposed cabinet, giving President Saied the opportunity to designate his own choice for premier.
His selection of Fakhfakh came despite the wishes of most parties in parliament, which showed more support for two other candidates. He now has a month to form a government and put it to a confidence vote. If he loses, there will be another election."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's new foreign minister is a former defense commander with little diplomatic experience, spotlighting leader Kim Jong Un's reliance on party and military loyalists at a sensitive time amid stalled U.S. talks, analysts in Seoul said on Monday.
Last week, North Korea told countries with embassies in Pyongyang that Ri Son Gwon, a senior military officer and official of the ruling Workers' Party, had been appointed foreign minister, a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters.
He replaces Ri Yong Ho, a career diplomat with years of experience negotiating with Washington, but who often took a backseat to other officials during the last two years of diplomacy.
Seoul-based NK News first reported the change on Saturday, citing unnamed sources in Pyongyang.
Analysts said it was too soon to tell exactly what impact the appointment may have for the stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States, but said Ri Son Gwon had often played a confrontational role in negotiations with South Korea.
Unlike his predecessor, Ri Son Gwon does not have any experience in dealing with nuclear issues or U.S. officials, though he has led high-level talks between the neighbors.
Previously chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country (CPRC), which handles relations with South Korea, Ri is the latest military official to be promoted to the party leadership.
""There has been a demonstrative crossover dynamic in which senior military officials migrate into the party leadership,"" said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre, a U.S. think tank.
As the young North Korean leader oversaw a number of short-range ballistic missile launches in the past year, the number of military and arms industry officials appearing in public with Kim Jong Un has increased sharply.
Ri had largely stayed out of the public eye since talks with South Korea stalled last year. But in April he was named to the foreign affairs panel of the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's parliament, and was most recently seen at a meeting of the party's policy-making central committee in December.
A tough, hawkish negotiator, Ri ""stormed out of the room"" during military talks with South Korea in 2014 when Seoul demanded an apology for what it saw as the North's past military provocations, a former South Korean official who met him said.
Ri was also known as a right-hand man of Kim Yong Chol, another former military leader who took up a top party post before steering nuclear talks with the United States.
POWER SHIFTS
After the failed Hanoi summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, Kim Yong Chol faded from public view as Kim Jong Un elevated diplomats versed in U.S. relations, including Ri Yong Ho's deputy Choe Son Hui.
But Kim Yong Chol seemed to retain influence behind the scenes, while the role of Ri Yong Ho gradually withered, as working-level talks with the United States also collapsed in October and Washington ignored a year-end deadline to resume negotiations.
Ri Yong Ho's absence from a group photograph of top party executives at the December meeting prompted speculation about his future.
""Ri Yong Ho is the official who was effectively sidelined after the Hanoi meetings and was removed from office because the interlocutors selected by the foreign ministry appeared not to accomplish anything,"" Madden said.
As Ri Son Gwon becomes foreign minister, deputy Choe is expected to retain an influential position, thanks in part to her family background and personal rapport with an inner circle of women close to Kim Jong Un, including his sister and wife, diplomatic sources say.
""What's most important is what Kim Jong Un thinks, and he needs someone he can trust to speak for him, whether it be Ri Son Gwon or Choe Son Hui,"" said Kim Hong-kyun, a former South Korean nuclear negotiator."

DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Greta Thunberg, who has inspired a new generation of activists to attend the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, urged world leaders to listen to young people on Tuesday.
""I'm not a person that can complain about not being heard,"" she said, prompting laughter from the audience at a panel session titled ""Forging a Sustainable Path Towards a Common Future"" on the first day of the annual WEF meeting.
""The science and voice of young people is not the center of the conversation, but it needs to be.""
Several young activists have traveled to the Swiss ski resort of Davos this year, following in Thunberg's footsteps.
Among the ""climate heroes"" being celebrated by the WEF are Irish teen scientist Fionn Ferreira, who created a solution for preventing micro plastics from reaching oceans.
They also include South African climate activist Ayakha Melithafa, 17, and Canadian Autum Peltier, who has been advocating for water conservation since she was 8 years old.
""It is about us and future generations and those who have been affected today,"" Thunberg said. ""We need to bring the science into the conversation."""

Interpol, the global police coordination agency based in France, said late in 2018 that Meng had resigned as its president, days after his wife reported him missing following a trip to his home country of China.
Meng, who admitted his guilt in July last year, told the court in the northern city of Tianjin he would not appeal against the judgment, it said in a statement online.
Last March, the ruling Communist Party said its investigation had found Meng spent ""lavish"" amounts of state funds, abused his power and refused to follow party decisions.

The court said Meng took more than 14.46 million yuan worth of assets in bribes and abused his former positions in the public security ministry and the coast guard between 2005 and 2017.

Mehmet Yilmaz told a news conference that Ankara would continue aid work in the country despite recent attacks by Islamist group al Shabaab that have targeted Turkish workers.
""This will not stop us from helping Somalia,"" Yilmaz said. ""We shall continue work. Somalia and Turkey have good relations.""
Saturday's suicide car bombing by al Shabaab occurred in Afgoye, about 30 km (18 miles) northwest of the capital, and targeted Turkish construction workers who were having lunch with local police. A total of 21 people were injured in the attack, among them six Turks.
""We are flying three injured Turks and six Somalis,"" Yilmaz said at Mogadishu Airport, where their plane was about to take off. All nine were in a serious condition, he said.
Turkey has been a major donor to Somalia following a famine in 2011. Ankara is seeking to increase its influence in the Horn of Africa to counter Gulf rivals like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

Jehovah's Witnesses have been under pressure for years in Russia, where the dominant Orthodox Church is championed by President Vladimir Putin. Orthodox scholars have cast them as a dangerous foreign sect that erodes state institutions and traditional values, allegations they reject.
Russia's Supreme Court ruled in 2017 that the group was an ""extremist"" organization and ordered it to disband, a decision that was followed by a crackdown which has seen dozens of adherents detained and hundreds hit with criminal charges.
Prosecutors had asked the court to sentence Bubnov, 54, to seven years in prison, accusing him of organizing the activities of the local Jehovah's Witnesses, something he denied.
Jarrod Lopes, a spokesman for the group, said on Tuesday the court had opted for a suspended six-year jail sentence instead. He said Bubnov would look into appealing. The court could not immediately be reached for comment.
Although Bubnov escaped a custodial sentence, Lopes said being convicted as an 'extremist' could restrict a person's finances and adversely affect his or her employment options."

Japan fights back with an internet FAQ,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan on Tuesday published a list defending how it treats people accused of crimes, the latest move in its struggle to counter accusations of ""hostage justice"" after ex-Nissan chief Carlos Ghosn's dramatic escape to Lebanon.
The 3,000-word list of 14 questions and answers on the Justice Ministry's home page, in English and Japanese, addresses Japan's conviction rate of more than 99 percent and why lawyers aren't present during questioning.
Ghosn, who was free on bail, fled over the New Year holidays as he was awaiting trial on charges such as under-reporting income - which he denies. He said he had no choice but to run and that he felt ""like the hostage of a country I served for 17 years.""
His complaints were echoed by Australian sports journalist Scott McIntyre, who was detained in the same centre as Ghosn for 44 days on trespassing charges after he tried to get information on his missing children.
McIntyre said the lights were on 24 hours a day, making it impossible to sleep more than an hour each night, and that several of his fellow detainees told him they would confess to crimes they had not committed to shorten their time there.
Both cases have drawn foreign attention to Japan's criminal justice system and put its government on the defensive, with Justice Minister Masako Mori at one point saying Ghosn's accusations were ""intolerable.""
""Japanese detention centers maintain detention rooms appropriately ... The rooms are structured so as to allow sufficient natural light and ensure good airflow,"" the Ministry said on its website. ""Access to bathing is granted to detainees at least twice a week in order to keep them in good health.""
In its global report this month, Human Rights Watch criticised what it called Japan's ""'hostage' justice system.""
""Criminal suspects are held for long periods in harsh conditions to coerce a confession,"" it said, adding that the situation received renewed attention after Ghosn's arrest.
One of the longest answers on the ministry's website, at 325 words, was a response to ""Isn't it fair to describe Japan's justice system as one of 'hostage justice?'""
""To the contrary, the Japanese criminal justice system does not force confessions by unduly holding suspects and defendants in custody. It is therefore not accurate at all to criticize the system as being a 'hostage justice' system,"" it said.
""In Japan, there are strict requirements and procedures stipulated in law with regard to holding suspects and defendants in custody, with due consideration given to the guarantee of human rights."""

Nora Anne Quoirin, 15, who suffered from learning difficulties, went missing in early August from a rainforest resort in Seremban, about 70 km (44 miles) south of the Malaysian capital, a day after her family arrived on holiday.
Her naked body was found 10 days later near a jungle stream in a deep ravine near the Dusun resort, where the family was staying.
Lawyer Sankara N. Nair, who is representing the family, said he has written to Malaysia's attorney general asking for an inquest on the parents' behalf and is yet to hear back from the country's top prosecutor.
""They feel that the investigation carried out by the police is not thorough,"" Nair told reporters at a court complex in Seremban after appearing for case management for a separate civil lawsuit filed by Quoirin's parents.
Nair said the family has filed a civil negligence lawsuit against the resort operator claiming 152,000 ringgit ($37,375), saying the resort was unsafe.
""My client is saying that the place was unsafe and the window latch was broken. So they are alleging that somebody can take the little girl out (from their room),"" he said.
Dusun and the attorney general's chambers did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Malaysian police last year ruled out abduction as a motive, saying they had found no signs pointing to foul play.
Officials have said an autopsy established that Quoirin had died from internal bleeding, probably caused by prolonged hunger and stress. She had suffered intestinal damage, and died two or three days before her body was found, they said.
But the family feared a criminal connection to the disappearance, saying she had special needs and had never before left them voluntarily, a British victims' group, the Lucie Blackman Trust, said last year."

YANGON/21 (Reuters) - A government-appointed panel established in Myanmar to probe allegations of abuses in Rakhine state in 2017 that drew global outrage said on Monday they had found no evidence of genocide against the Rohingya Muslim minority.
More than 730,000 Rohingya fled Rakhine state during weeks of brutal violence, during which the United Nations says gang rapes and mass killings were carried out with ""genocidal intent"". Hundreds of villages were burned to the ground and later razed and scraped.
Although the panel acknowledged ""war crimes"" had taken place, rights groups and Rohingya leaders dismissed the report as a ""whitewash"" days ahead of an expected ruling by the U.N's highest court on a genocide case against the country.
The commission of inquiry said there were ""reasonable grounds"" to conclude members of the security forces among ""multiple actors"" were responsible for possible war crimes and serious human rights violations during a military-led crackdown against the group in 2017.
These included the ""killing of innocent villagers and destruction of their homes"", it said.
But in its statement, issued to mark the finalization of a full report based on interviews with villagers and members of the security forces, the panel blamed Rohingya militants for attacking 30 police posts and ""provoking"" the crackdown and described the situation as an ""internal armed conflict"".
""The ICOE has not found any evidence suggesting that these killings or acts of displacement were committed pursuant to an intent or plan to destroy the Muslim or any other community in northern Rakhine State,"" the panel’s statement read.
""There is insufficient evidence to argue, much less conclude, that the crimes committed were undertaken with the intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, or with any other requisite mental state for the international crime of genocide."" 
Myanmar President Win Myint said in a statement on Tuesday the government ""concurred"" with the findings of the commission and vowed to pursue further investigations, specifically into alleged crimes by civilians and Rohingya militants. 
He said he had given the report to the army chief, so that the military might extend ongoing investigations, he said, adding that the executive summary would be made public.
The army began a rare trial in November of soldiers and officers from a regiment deployed to Gu Dar Pyin village, the site of an alleged massacre of Rohingya.
Two spokesmen for the military could not be reached for comment by Reuters.
In Bangladesh, where hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who fled Myanmar have taken refuge, a Rohingya leader, Dil Mohammed, described the report as a whitewash.
""We have been persecuted for decades. So many of our people were killed, our women were raped, our children were thrown into fire and our homes were torched. If it is not genocide, what is it?"" he said.
The International Court of Justice, the highest U.N. court, will this week issue a decision on a request for emergency measures in a genocide case against the country.
Gambia filed the suit in November alleging Myanmar was committing ""an ongoing genocide"" against the Rohingya. 
The commission of enquiry was formed in 2018 as the country faced growing calls for accountability. The government appointed two local and two international members – Filipino diplomat Rosario Manalo and Kenzo Oshima, a former Japanese ambassador to the United Nations.
Myanmar says the international efforts violate its sovereignty and has vowed to carry out its own investigations into the allegations.
But few have been punished so far. Seven soldiers jailed for 10 years for killing 10 Rohingya men and boys in the village of Inn Din were granted early release last November, after serving less than a year in prison.
""The problem is, according to Myanmar's constitution, the military is the only institution that can investigate its own members for breaches of military discipline,"" Maung Maung Soe, a political analyst based in the commercial capital of Yangon, told Reuters.

""We will be able to solve this problem only if a court martial seriously engages and takes specific actions on those who committed war crimes.""

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Governments need to take into account the climate crisis when considering the deportation of asylum seekers, the United Nations said in a landmark ruling that could pave the way for future climate refugees.
The ruling by the U.N. Human Rights Committee was given in the case of Ioane Teitiota, from the Pacific nation of Kiribati, who brought a case against New Zealand in 2016 after authorities denied his claim of asylum as a climate refugee.
Teitiota migrated to New Zealand in 2007 and applied for refugee status after his visa expired in 2010. He claimed the effects of climate change and a rising sea level had forced him to migrate. He was deported to Kiribati in September 2015.
The committee upheld New Zealand's decision to deport Teitiota, saying he did not face an immediate risk if returned, but it agreed that environmental degradation and climate change are some of the most pressing threats to the right to life.
""Without robust national and international efforts, the effects of climate change in receiving states may expose individuals to a violation of their rights,"" the committee said in a statement released earlier this month.
This would trigger non-refoulement obligations which forbid a country form returning asylum seekers to a country in which they would likely be in danger.
The committee added that the risk of an entire country becoming submerged under water was so extreme that a life with dignity may not be possible even before this happened.
Teitiota's lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The low-lying South Pacific island nation of Kiribati has a population of more than 110,000, but its average height of 2 metres (6-1/2 ft) above sea level makes it one of the countries most vulnerable to rising seawater and other climate change effects.
New Zealand and Australia, the two most developed countries in the South Pacific, have resisted calls to change immigration rules in favour of Pacific people displaced by climate change.
The U.N. ruling is not binding but could open the door for future climate change asylum seekers, asylum advocates said.
""The decision sets a global precedent,"" said Kate Schuetze, Pacific Researcher at Amnesty International.
""It says a state will be in breach of its human rights obligations if it returns someone to a country where – due to the climate crisis – their life is at risk, or in danger of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment,"" she said in a statement."

OKUMA, Japan (Reuters) - At the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant north of Tokyo, workers in protective suits are still removing radioactive material from reactors that melted down after an earthquake and tsunami knocked out its power and cooling nearly nine years ago.
On an exclusive tour of the plant, spread over 3.5 million square meters (865 acres), Reuters witnessed giant remote-controlled cranes dismantling an exhaust tower and other structures in a highly radioactive zone while spent fuel was removed from a reactor.
Officials from Tokyo Electric, which owns the plant, also showed new tanks to hold increasing amounts of contaminated water.
About 4,000 workers are tackling the cleanup, many wearing protective gear, although more than 90% of the plant is deemed to have so little radioactivity that no extra precautions are needed. Photography was highly restricted and no conversations were allowed with the workers.
Work to dismantle the plant has taken nearly a decade so far, but with Tokyo due to host the Olympics this summer - including some events less than 60 km (38 miles) from the power station - there has been renewed focus on safeguarding the venues.
""Tepco tries to disclose all information to the public as soon as possible. If something happens at the site, we let people know by email, for example,"" said Kan Nihonyanagi, risk communicator at Fukushima, told Reuters in an interview at the site.
The buildup of contaminated water has been a sticking point in the cleanup, which is likely to last decades, and has alarmed neighboring countries. In 2018, Tepco said it had not been able to remove all dangerous material from the water - and the site is running out of room for storage tanks.
Officials overseeing a panel of experts looking into the contaminated water issue said in December choices on disposal should be narrowed to two: either dilute the water and dump it in the Pacific Ocean, or allow it to evaporate.
The Japanese government may decide within months, and either process would take years to complete, experts say.
(Graphic: Fukushima's ""ice wall"" - https://tmsnrt.rs/2RvPz8c)
""The Olympics are coming, so we have to prepare for that, and Tepco has to disclose all the information not only to local communities but also to foreign countries and especially to those people coming from abroad,"" said Joji Hara, a Tokyo-based spokesman for the power company who accompanied Reuters during the visit.
Tepco has opened English-language Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) accounts, he said. It is also preparing to put out basic emergency information in Korean and Chinese, he added.
Athletes from at least one country, South Korea, are planning to bring their own radiation detectors and food this summer.
Baseball and softball will be played in Fukushima City, about 60 km (38 miles) from the destroyed nuclear plant. The torch relay will begin at a sports facility called J-Village, an operations base for Fukushima Daiichi in the first few years of the disaster, then pass through areas near the damaged station on its way to Tokyo. 
In December, Greenpeace said it found radiation ""hotspots"" at J-Village, about 18km south of the plant.
When Tokyo won the bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympics Prime Minister Shinzo Abe declared that Fukushima was ""under control"" in his final pitch to the International Olympic Committee.

In 2016, the Japanese government estimated that the total cost of plant dismantlement, decontamination of affected areas, and compensation would be 21.5 trillion yen ($195 billion) - roughly a fifth of the country's annual budget at the time.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's Constitutional Court on Tuesday found key figures of the opposition Future Forward Party not guilty of opposing the country's monarchy, an allegation that could have seen the high-profile party banned in one of several ongoing cases against it. 
The ruling was a relief for the opposition, which has said the anti-monarchy charges were politically motivated to suppress dissent against Thailand's government headed by a former military junta leader.
The court rejected the claims the party sought to overthrow Thailand's monarchy. The complaint also alleged the party is linked to the Illuminati, a secret society that conspiracy theorists believe seeks world domination. 
""The accused have not acted in their rights and liberties to overthrow the constitutional monarchy,"" said Taweekiat Meenakanit, one of the judges. 
King Maha Vajiralongkorn, 67, is a constitutional monarch, but in traditional culture, the monarch is revered as the country's protector and insulting the king is a criminal offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Seeking to abolish the monarchy is considered a grave offense.
Founded almost two years ago, Future Forward Party came third in last year's general election, which the opposition says was manipulated in favor of the pro-military Palang Pracharat Party. 
Its leader Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, 41, has emerged as the most prominent opponent to the government that last year reinstalled former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, 65, as a civilian prime minister five years after he staged a military coup.
The Constitutional Court last year disqualified Thanathorn from his parliamentary seat and he also faces other legal cases.

Future Forward faces several other ongoing legal cases, including one alleging it violated laws governing political parties by accepting loans from party leader, auto-parts billionaire Thanathorn.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico suffered its worst year for homicides in 2019, with a record 34,582 victims, official data showed on Monday, underscoring the challenge President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador faces while waging war on drug cartels.
Lopez Obrador assumed the presidency in December 2018 pledging to pacify the country with a less confrontational approach to security, but violence has continued rising, with the number of homicide victims 2.5% higher in 2019 than a year earlier, according to the security ministry data.
Separate security ministry figures using an older methodology that refers to the number of homicide investigations showed an increase to 29,401 last year from 29,100 in 2018.
Mexico has used its military in a war on drug cartels since late 2006. But, despite the arrest or killing of leading capos, the campaign has not succeeded in reducing drug violence and has led to more killings as criminal groups fight among themselves.
To tackle the problem, Mexican officials last week presented lawmakers a proposal to overhaul the criminal justice system, paving the way for the Senate to take up the plan next month that could ease security cooperation with the United States.
Concern has grown over the president's strategy, which he says still needs time, after two major crises in recent months.
Critics blasted the government as weak in October when it ordered security forces to release the captured son of convicted kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman under pressure from marauding cartel henchmen in the northern city of Culiacan.
Then, in early November, three mothers and six children were massacred by suspected cartel gunmen in northern Mexico, sparking outrage and revulsion at home and abroad.
According to a draft of the criminal justice reform reviewed by Reuters, the plan would allow private communications to be used as evidence and limit legal challenges to avoid extradition delays for criminal suspects, many of whom are U.S.-bound.

Mexican Attorney General Alejandro Gertz told senators the plan would attack entrenched corruption and impunity as well as the roots of criminal activity.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military said on Tuesday it plans to expand the deployment of an anti-piracy unit now operating off the coast of Africa to the area around the Strait of Hormuz, after the United States pressed for help to guard oil tankers.
Attacks on oil tankers in the Strait of Hormuz off the coast of Iran last year prompted U.S. officials to call for allies to join a planned maritime security mission.
As a key U.S. ally, South Korea has debated the prospect, and the decision to divert a navy unit already in operation southwest of Arabia comes as a compromise that will not require fresh parliamentary authorization. 
While South Korea will deploy its forces to the area, including the Gulf, it will not officially be joining an international coalition of forces, the defense ministry said.
""The South Korean government decided to temporarily expand the deployment of the Cheonghae military unit,"" a ministry official told reporters.
The step would ensure the safety of citizens and free navigation of South Korean vessels, he added.
The Cheonghae unit will continue with its mission while it cooperates with the coalition, the ministry said, adding that the United States had been briefed on the decision, which was also explained to the Iranians separately.
The Strait of Hormuz is a busy passageway into the Gulf, with vessels sailing through it approximately 900 times a year for South Korea, which gets more than 70% of its oil from the Middle East, the defense ministry says.
The Cheonghae unit has been stationed in the Gulf of Aden since 2009, working to tackle piracy in partnership with African countries as well as the United States and the European Union.
The 302-strong unit operates a 4,500-ton destroyer, a Lynx anti-submarine helicopter and three speed boats, South Korea's 2018 defense white paper showed.
Among its operations were the rescue of a South Korean ship and its crew in 2011, shooting eight suspected pirates and capturing five others in the incident.
The South Korean troops have also evacuated South Korean citizens from Libya and Yemen, and as of November 2018 had escorted around 18,750 South Korean and international vessels.

580,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 09:29PM ET</span>",Get the party started: Chiefs and 49ers headed to Miami for 54th Super Bowl,"By Steve Keating
(Reuters) - The NFL will cap its centennial season with a compelling Super Bowl featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers that will highlight a clash of styles and two dynamic young quarterbacks poised to lead the league into its next hundred years.
Back in Miami for a record 11th time, the National Football League is planning a week-long party of the century with something for everyone including a championship game on Feb. 2 between the throwback 49ers and high-octane Chiefs.
The 49ers, coached by Kyle Shanahan who turned just 40 in December, play a run-first, hard-hitting style that was more in vogue when Jim Brown and Gayle Sayers were blasting through defenses back in the 60s.
The Chiefs, coached by 61-year-old Andy Reid, are explosive and creative with a play book that looks like it was lifted from a video game.
""Fired up, fired up to go Miami, I need to go on a diet so I can fit into my clothes,"" Reid told reporters. ""They don't care about the score,"" he said of his team, ""they just bring it and that's paid off for us the last couple of weeks.""
How the 49ers and Chiefs reached the 54th Super Bowl is a contrast of style and philosophy.
In two playoff contests, San Francisco quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, 28, completed just 17 of 27 passes for 191 yards.
During one stretch of Sunday's NFC championship game against the Green Bay Packers, Garoppolo went 90 minutes without throwing a single pass.
Instead the Niners leaned on a top-ranked defense and the running of Raheem Mostert, who rumbled for 220 yards - second most in NFL playoff history - and four touchdowns, to brush aside the Packers 37-20.
Earlier on Sunday, the Chiefs were tackling another run-first outfit in the Tennessee Titans, led by Derrick Henry, the NFL's leading rusher. Henry had steamrolled over Tom Brady and the defending champion New England Patriots and the top seed Baltimore Ravens on the way to the AFC title game.
The Titans ground game, however, was no match for the Chiefs explosive, quick-strike offence led by 24-year-old phenom quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who threw for nearly 300 yards and three touchdowns and ran for another score in a 35-24 win to send Kansas City back to the Super Bowl for the first time in 50 years.
A week earlier in the division playoffs against Houston, Mahomes tossed five touchdowns, including four in the second quarter, as the Chiefs erased a 24-0 deficit and wiped out the Texans 51-31.
With the help of a speedy receiving corps of Tyreek Hill, Sammy Watkins, Mecole Hardman and running back Damien Williams (NYSE:WMB) that looks like it could contend for a 4x100 meter relay Olympic gold medal, Mahomes has thrown for 608 yards and eight touchdowns in two postseason contests.
So there lies the storyline that will dominate the two-week buildup to the big game, and it is an intriguing one that will be dissected, discussed and debated ad nauseam by experts and bar stool pundits alike.
Can the 49ers do what the Titans could not do against Kansas City and run the ball with enough effectiveness to keep pace with a Chiefs attack that has become known as the ""Legion of Zoom""?

And can the Chiefs protect Mahomes from the NFL's top pass rush long enough to give their young quarterback time to find cracks in a ferocious San Francisco defense that has been rock solid?

Homero Gomez, who manages a butterfly sanctuary in the western Mexican state of Michoacan, disappeared on Jan. 13, according to the Human Rights State Commission of Michoacan.
The organization has asked the attorney general's office to determine if Gomez's disappearance is linked to his role in defending Mexico's forests, commission official Mayte Cardona told Reuters.
""He was probably hurting the (business) interests of people illegally logging in the area,"" Cardona said.
Illegal logging and trafficking is rife in Michoacan, a state plagued by organized crime.
""The investigation is ongoing,"" a source with the state prosecutor said.
Environmentalists say illegal logging hurts the habitat of the monarch butterfly, which migrates thousands of kilometers from Canada across the United States to reproduce in Mexico."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to make changes after an attack near London Bridge in November in which Usman Khan, a convicted terrorist who had been released early from prison, killed two people.
Khan had been sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison in 2012 with a requirement that the parole board assess his danger to the public before release. He was set free in December 2018 without such an assessment.
""The senseless terror attack at Fishmongers' Hall in November confronted us with some hard truths about how we deal with terrorist offenders,"" interior minister Priti Patel said in a statement.
The government, elected in December, said it would introduce new counter-terrorism legislation within its first 100 days which would force dangerous offenders who receive extended determinate sentences to serve the whole time in jail.
Those convicted of offences such as preparing acts of terrorism or directing a terrorist organization would face a minimum of 14 years in prison, the government said, adding that it would also review how terror offenders are managed when they are released.
The father of one of Khan's victims, Jack Merritt, a 25-year-old who had worked on a prisoner rehabilitation scheme, said at the time his son would have been upset to see his death used to justify tougher penalties."

The government had originally planned to set by this month a basic framework to determine guidelines for selecting cities, but is now looking to postpone that process, the Asahi reported, citing government and ruling party sources.
Last month, prosecutors arrested Tsukasa Arimoto, a Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) lawmaker previously in charge of casino policy, on suspicion he accepted bribes from a company seeking to build a casino in Japan.
The arrest has hardened public opposition to the already unpopular plan to allow casinos in Japan.
Hamstrung by a shrinking economy, population and tax base, Japan is pushing to boost tourism through ""integrated resorts"" - Las Vegas-style complexes that include casinos, shopping arcades and conference centers. Some analysts say the casino market could be worth $20 billion or more annually.
The government has authorized licenses to build three integrated resorts and is expected to officially receive bids from interested localities in 2021.
Potential bidders include Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka, Japan's three largest cities, and smaller ones including Nagasaki and Wakayama."

TRINIDAD, Cuba (Reuters) - In the colonial Cuban city of Trinidad, handicrafts shop owner Lourdes Milan says she has already slashed prices due to the drop in U.S. visitors following Washington's tightening of sanctions and she's worried the situation will worsen this year.
Trinidad, a five-hour drive east of Havana, was one of the top destinations for the Americans that poured into Cuba after the Obama administration eased decades-old restrictions on travel to the island during a short-lived 2014-2016 detente.
But the number of U.S. visitors dropped by 21.9% last year after the Trump administration tightened those restrictions again and banned the recently re-instated cruises, according to data published this month in Cuban state magazine Excelencias.
The U.S. visitors number will likely drop again this year due to new U.S. curbs on U.S. flights to Cuba that have come into effect since December.
""We are reducing prices to the minimum because there is very little tourism,"" said Milan, who had not sold a single product by midday despite January being high season for tourism in Cuba.
The total number of visitors to the island dropped by 9.6% last year to 4.275 million, according to Excelencias.
Slight rises in arrivals of Cubans living abroad and Canadians were unable to compensate for the double-digit decline in U.S. visitors - mostly via cruise ships - and a smaller drop in European tourists.
Paolo Spadoni, associate professor in the department of social sciences at Augusta University in the state of Georgia, said the full impact of the U.S. ban on cruises would be felt even more this year, as it was implemented last June.
Moreover, the Trump administration barred U.S. airlines from flying to all destinations in Cuba besides Havana in December and announced this month it would curb public charter flights too.
""Now, all itineraries have to start in Havana, which means they cost more,"" Liliana Guerra, commercial vice director at Cienfuegos' Hotel Jagua, run by the Spanish hotel chain Melia, said in front of a swimming pool devoid of guests.
""We are seeing a decrease in the arrival of Cubans from abroad who used these airports nearby to visit their families and then would stay in our hotel as a kind of family tourism.""
The tourism ministry's delegate in Cienfuegos, Jose Gonzalez, said U.S. sanctions on oil shipments to Cuba were also having a knock-on effect. Some boat operators, for example, have had to shut sporadically due to lack of fuel."

ASSEN (Reuters) - A Dutch court will hold the first procedural hearing on Tuesday in the case of a man accused of keeping his family in seclusion for nine years in an isolated farmhouse in the northern Netherlands.
The man, 67-year-old Gerrit-Jan van Dorsten, is facing charges of unlawful detention and child abuse. Now ailing after a stroke, he is not expected to attend the pre-trial hearing.
In October, police found him and five adult siblings at the farm in Ruinerwold after a sixth sibling escaped and reached a nearby village bar. After listening to his story, local people alerted police.
It emerged that the six siblings and their father had lived on the farm since 2010, and had never had their births registered or been to school, as required by Dutch law.
Their mother died in 2004, and three more older siblings had left the family before they went into seclusion.
Van Dorsten, who described himself in writings as ""Cosmic Eagle"" according to an account in daily De Telegraaf, was initially arrested on suspicion of abuse, unlawful detention and money laundering. Charges were later expanded to include the sexual abuse of two of the oldest of his nine children.
He was left partly paralyzed and unable to speak by the stroke in 2017, his lawyer Robert Sorn told the national ANP news agency. Police have not been able to question him due to his health problems, Sorn said in December.
He is being held in custody in a prison hospital.
The case also involves a second suspect, a 58-year-old man described as a follower or accomplice of Van Dorsten who paid the rent on the farmhouse.
Identified as Josef Brunner, an Austrian, he was initially charged with endangering the health of others and unlawful detention and is expected to attend the hearing.
The children, all over the age of 18, have not spoken publicly but have given statements through a Dutch filmmaker working on a documentary on the family.
The four eldest, including the one whose flight from the farm led to its discovery, said in November that they support the criminal case against their father. In a separate declaration the five youngest children - those who were found at the farm - say they do not support the charges.
The five younger ones have been put in accommodation and are receiving help with trying to reintegrate into society.
They have said they continue to hold the values their father instilled on them to ""find happiness in our relationship with God and to educate ourselves"".
""We don't define happiness as 'living in seclusion', that was never the intention but it just happened,"" they said.
The five on the farm were four women and one man, plus the 25 year-old man who went for help, according to De Telegraaf.
A breakdown of the gender of the elder children was not available. It was not known what they were doing besides their participation in the documentary."

Fianna Fail surged into a surprising 12-point lead over Fine Gael in the Sunday Times/Behaviour & Attitudes poll that was published on Sunday but almost entirely conducted before Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called the Feb. 8 election.
Polls conducted late last year suggested the two parties, which have broadly similar policies on the economy and Brexit, were closely matched and Monday's Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI opinion poll put Fianna Fail on 25% and Fine Gael on 23%.
While Fianna Fail was unchanged from the series' last poll in October, Fine Gael dropped six points. Satisfaction with the government also fell sharply to 27% from 42% while Varadkar's personal approval plummeted to 35% from 51% in October.
He was still, however, marginally the most popular leader.
Sinn Fein, the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA), with whom both of the main parties refuse to govern, jumped seven points to 21%. Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin reiterated again on Monday that it would not form a coalition.
The left wing Sinn Fein, which has tended to underperform its opinion poll numbers in previous elections, immediately repeated its call for the inclusion of leader Mary Lou McDonald in two planned televised debates between Varadkar and Martin.
The survey of 1,200 prospective voters in every constituency was conducted between Thursday and Saturday, the opening days of the campaign.
If Monday's survey translated into votes on polling day, Ireland would likely be heading for a second successive minority government, this time led by Fianna Fail but needing another ""confidence and supply"" deal with one of its two main rivals.
Under such a cooperation deal, Fine Gael has led a minority government since 2016 with a handful of independent lawmakers and the backing of fellow center-right Fianna Fail from the opposition benches.
Prospective direct partners in a minority government, the Green Party and Labour, stood on 8% and 5% respectively in the Irish Times/Ipsos MRBI opinion. The Greens were also polling at 15% in Dublin, where the party is targeting a number of seats."

LISBON (Reuters) - Portuguese authorities said on Monday they had started investigating media reports concerning Angolan billionaire Isabel dos Santos, while a small bank said it had decided to put an end to commercial relationships with entities she controls.
This was the latest fallout from increased scrutiny of Angola's former first daughter, a highly divisive figure in her home country, where she is nicknamed ""the Princess"" after amassing a fortune estimated at more than $2 billion during her father Jose Eduardo's decades-long presidency. 
A spokesman for Portugal's prosecutor's office said it would investigate reports about dos Santos while the central bank said in a statement it had asked Eurobic bank about transfers between Angola and Dubai, following the same reports.
Both institutions said they would take appropriate action if needed, without giving any details.
The central bank statement, the prosecutor's office and Eurobic all referred to hundreds of thousands of files about dos Santos dubbed the ""Luanda Leaks"" - obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) and released by several news organizations on Sunday.
The media reports focused on alleged financial schemes used by dos Santos to build her business empire, including transfers between Angola and Dubai. 
Dos Santos, who holds a 42.5% stake in Eurobic indirectly via two entities and does not sit on the board, said on Sunday that allegations made against her were ""completely unfounded.""
Eurobic, which was already under investigation from the central bank over its links to dos Santos, said it decided to end its business relationship with all entities controlled by the billionaire.
The bank's board of directors decided in a meeting on Monday to ""terminate the commercial relationship with entities controlled by the universe of the shareholder Isabel dos Santos and people closely related to it.""
However, Eurobic did not say what that would mean for its own relationship with dos Santos, its main shareholder. It could not immediately be reached for any additional comment. 
Angolan authorities froze dos Santos' assets in the African country in late December following allegations by prosecutors that she and her husband had steered payments of more than $1 billion from state companies Sonangol and Sodiam to firms in which they held stakes. 
Dos Santos and her husband have denied any wrongdoing.
In Portugal, dos Santos holds significant stakes in several important firms, including telecoms company NOS.
Portugal's Sonae, which partners with dos Santos in NOS, said in statement late on Monday that it was following the situation with ""attention and concern, especially given allusions made to several non-executive members of the board of directors of its subsidiary NOS.""

A Sonae spokesman told Reuters Sonae has total confidence in NOS. Dos Santos and Sonae each own 50% of holding company ZOPT-SGPS, which controls 52.15% of NOS.

With more than 30 provinces on bad weather alert, Valencia on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic Islands were bearing the brunt of the storm on Monday. 
Port authorities estimated waves of 8.44 meters in Valencia on Monday, which they said was a record, while a Reuters witness said waves had been growing throughout the day, crashing on to Barcelona's famous Barceloneta beach. 
A 63-year-old man died at home in the central province of Avila after being hit by roof tiles lifted by a gust of wind, said David Segovia, mayor of the town of Pedro Bernardo.
Unusually cold weather was blamed for the death of a 54-year-old homeless woman in Gandia, near Valencia, a municipal official told Reuters. 
One man in northwest Asturias region was killed by a vehicle on a snowbound road, reportedly struck while fitting chains to his car, an emergency services spokesman said. 
And Spanish media quoted the mayor of the Valencian town of Moixent as saying a fourth man had died after being found outside his home showing signs of hypothermia on Monday morning. 
Catalonia's regional government ordered a ban on all outdoor activities in the Girona, Barcelona and central Catalonia regions, a spokesman for its interior department said, adding those who did not comply with the ban could face a fine.
The storm also forced the closure of Alicante airport, leading to the cancellation of nearly 200 flights.

National weather agency Aemet reported winds of up to 115 km per hour (71 mph) and eight-meter (26-feet) waves in the province of Valencia. At least 120 councils there decided to suspend school and hundreds of kilometers of roads were cut off.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - There will be more action by the United States to support Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday, after meeting with Guaido on the sidelines of a regional conference in Bogota.
The South American country, which is suffering an economic collapse and hyperinflation under the leadership of President Nicolas Maduro, is a failed state, Pompeo said. 
Guaido, recognized as his crisis-ridden nation's legitimate president by more than 50 countries including the United States, defied a court order to travel to Colombia. 
""I would fully expect there will be further action that the United States would take to continue to support President Guaido and the Venezuelan people,"" Pompeo told journalists. 
""We do not talk about particular sanctions but everyone can fully expect that the United States is not done,"" Pompeo added, without specifying what action Washington will take.
Pompeo declined to address whether the United States is prepared to sanction Russia over its backing of Maduro.
Guaido will next travel to Davos, Switzerland, to attend the World Economic Forum.
""We will have important meetings in Europe, in the European Union and specifically in Davos,"" Guaido told journalists. ""There are forces that are uncontainable, like those that seek democracy.""
Guaido would not confirm whether he will meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Davos.
The trip will help gain global attention for Guaido as Venezuela's political stalemate drags on and the country's parliament is increasingly beset by violence. 
There is little chance Guaido's tour will break Venezuela's deadlock, however, as the military continues to stand by the ruling Socialist Party and Maduro has shown himself to be resilient to U.S. sanctions.
""It's utterly irrelevant for us that a lackey has gone to meet his masters in Colombia,"" said ruling Socialist Party Vice President Diosdado Cabello in a Caracas press conference, referring to Guaido. ""He hasn't achieved anything he promised.""
Colombia and the United States accuse Maduro of harboring armed groups like Colombia's own Marxist-led National Liberation Army rebels and of having connections to everyone from drug traffickers to Hezbollah.
Maduro has branded Guaido as a U.S. puppet and said the United States wants to invade Venezuela.
""(Maduro is) now running an operation that looks more like a cartel than anything else that one could describe. This isn't good for Venezuela, it's not good for the countries that are around Venezuela,"" Pompeo said.

In his comments, Pompeo also applauded Colombia and other Latin American countries' for their recent designations of Hezbollah as a terrorist group.

The former finance minister now has a month to form a coalition capable of winning a confidence vote in parliament by a simple majority, or there will be another election with urgent economic decisions hanging over the country.
The choice of Fakhfakh, 48, underscores the economic priorities following a decade of low growth, high public debt and declining services since the 2011 revolution that introduced democracy.
Fakhfakh, a former employee of the French energy company Total, served as finance minister in 2012 in the volatile period after the revolution and also worked as tourism minister.
The incumbent government of Youssef Chahed has since 2016 tried to rein in spending while addressing the aftermath of two major militant attacks in 2015 that devastated Tunisia's crucial tourism industry.
However, it has been acting as a caretaker government since the Oct. 6 parliamentary election in which the largest party, the moderate Islamist Ennahda, took only a quarter of the seats.
It nominated Habib Jemli as prime minister in November, but his proposed government failed to win parliamentary backing and lost a confidence vote on Jan. 10.
That meant President Saied, who was also elected in October, had the right to designate his own choice of prime minister to try to form a government.
Tunisia's constitution splits power between the head of state and the government, leading to several periods in recent years of political struggles between them."

COLOMBO (Reuters) - Thousands of twins packed two-by-two into a stadium in Sri Lanka's capital on Monday - so many that officials struggled to count them in time to prove they had organized a record-breaking gathering.
Huge queues built up at the open-air venue in Colombo as sets of siblings waited to get their birth certificates checked. Many appeared to leave before they could be added to the tally.
The last record was set in Taiwan in 1999, when 3,961 sets of twins, 37 sets of triplets and four sets of quadruplets gathered outside Taipei City Hall.
""The counting is still going on. We will submit the final count and the documentation back to the Guinness World Record committee and I am confident we will be informed in writing that we hold the record,"" Upuli Gamage, co-organizer of the event with her twin Chamali, told the crowd.
There was no immediate comment from the Guinness organization on whether the event had met the requirements to claim the record.
Many of the twins - including children, pensioners and police officers - had traveled for hours to attend the event, which had Sri Lanka's prime minister, Mahinda Rajapaksa, as guest of honor.
""It's fascinating,"" said Raheen Usman, a 19-year-old from Colombo, there with her twin Farheen.
""I have made a lot of new friends - all of my friends are twins now.""
The record-breaking attempt was followed by a concert performed exclusively by twins, including an 80-member orchestra.
The campaign group Sri Lanka Twins said it had organized the event to raise the profile of underprivileged twins, triplets and quadruplets. Poorer families often struggled to cope with multiple births, it added."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin accelerated a shake-up of Russia's political system on Monday, submitting a constitutional reform blueprint to parliament that will create a new center of power outside the presidency.
Putin also replaced Prosecutor General Yuri Chaika, who had held the role since 2006, a move suggesting his planned changes could reach beyond the political system and the government.
In a surprise move, Putin announced plans for reforms last week. Long-time ally Dmitry Medvedev then resigned as prime minister along with the government, saying he wanted to allow room for the president to make the changes.
Putin's proposed changes are widely seen as giving him scope to retain influence once his term expires in 2024 though he said at the weekend he did not favor the Soviet-era practice of having leaders for life who die in office.
In draft amendments submitted to the State Duma lower house, Putin offered a glimpse of how his reforms look on paper. Under his plan, some of the president's broad powers would be clipped and parliament's powers expanded.
In one of the biggest changes, the status of the State Council, now a low-profile body that advises the president, would for the first time be enshrined in the constitution.
Putin, 67, has not disclosed what he plans to do once he leaves the Kremlin. One option could be to head the beefed-up State Council once he leaves the presidency.
Under his proposals, the president would pick the make-up of the State Council which would be handed broader powers to ""determine the main directions of domestic and foreign policy.""
His changes also envisage preventing any future president serving more than two terms. Putin first became president in 2000 and is now in his fourth term as head of state.
OPPOSITION PROTEST MARCH
Chaika, 68, has long been one of the most powerful figures in the Russian justice system and has faced allegations of corruption from the political opposition which he denies.
The Kremlin said Chaika was moving to another, unspecified, job and proposed Igor Krasnov, deputy head of the Investigative Committee, which handles major crimes, to replace him.
Krasnov, 44, has led high-profile criminal investigations including the inquiry into the murder of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov, who was shot dead near the Kremlin in 2015.
Russia's opposition said on Monday it planned to stage a protest march next month against the reforms.
""Society needs a big and genuinely mass protest,"" wrote opposition politician Ilya Yashin, who said Putin's changes amounted to a move to ""rule forever"".
The Duma is due to discuss Putin's amendments on Thursday.
Putin has said the public will be invited to vote on the proposed changes.
Andrei Klishas, a senior lawmaker involved in drafting the legislation, said the vote might be held once parliament approved the legislation, the RIA news agency reported."

Johnson's Conservatives won a large majority in the lower chamber, the House of commons, at the Dec. 12 vote and lawmakers there quickly approved the legislation needed to ratify his exit deal with Brussels earlier this month.
The legislation is now passing through the House of Lords, where the government does not have a majority. While the upper chamber is not expected to block passage of the bill, it is seeking to make changes.
Members of the Lords voted by 270 to 229 in favor of a change put forward by the pro-EU Liberal Democrats which would give eligible EU citizens in Britain an automatic right to stay after Brexit, rather than having to apply to the government to do so.
It would also ensure they are given physical proof of their right to remain. The government has said only that people will be given a ""secure digital status"" which links to their passport.
Last week, European Parliament Brexit coordinator Guy Verhofstadt said Britain had told him it was looking into the possibility of providing a physical document to EU citizens but Johnson's spokesman said he was not aware of any plans.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine on Monday urged Iran to return the black boxes from a Ukrainian passenger plane shot down by the Iranian military with the loss of all 176 people on board.
Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said returning the boxes would show that Iran was committed to an unbiased investigation of the Jan. 8 tragedy.
Prystaiko was speaking as an Iranian delegation led by Minister of Roads and Urban Development Mohammad Eslami was visiting Kiev to discuss the incident. 
""His main task is to apologize and acknowledge what happened. We hope that we can go a little further than just political discussions and discuss practical problems. Among them in particular is the return of the black boxes,"" Prystaiko told reporters. 
Iran said on Sunday it was trying to analyze the black boxes, denying an earlier report it would hand them to Ukraine.
""At first they stated that they were handing them over, then the same person stated that they were not handing them over. This created some misunderstanding in Ukraine and we were starting to be asked: are they being handed over or not?""
The office of President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said Iranian experts were expected to assess Ukraine's technical ability to decode the black boxes. A statement said the wreckage of the aircraft was to be returned to Ukraine.
""I promised the families and relatives of the victims, I promised the people of Ukraine that the truth will be established. We must know what happened,"" the statement quoted Zelenskiy as telling the Iranian minister.
Many of those killed had were Iranians with dual citizenship, but Iran does not recognize dual nationality and said it would treat the victims as Iranian nationals. 
Canada, which had 57 citizens on the flight, said there were still no firm plans for downloading the recorders. Ottawa and other capitals have called for the black boxes to be sent abroad.
The disaster has heightened international pressure on Iran as it grapples with a long-running dispute with the United States over its nuclear program and its influence in the region that briefly erupted into open conflict this month.
The Iranian military said it downed Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 in error in the aftermath of tit-for-tat strikes by the United States and Iran. But authorities delayed admitting this, prompting days of protests in Iran.

Ukraine held a ceremony at Kiev's Boryspil airport on Sunday as the bodies of 11 citizens, including nine crew, were returned.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Much remains to be done in Colombia's fight against cultivation of coca, the base ingredient in cocaine, United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said during a visit to Bogota on Monday.
The Andean country has come under repeated pressure from the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump to curb coca-growing by crime gangs and rebel groups, especially as crop figures shot up in recent years. 
This month Colombian President Ivan Duque announced the country eradicated more than 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) of coca last year - a record.
""As a result of aggressive, counter narcotics efforts by President Trump and President Duque, President Duque's administration has rolled back record high cultivation and cocaine production levels,"" Pompeo said.
""Much work remains, we'll keep the progress going,"" added Pompeo, who is visiting to attend a regional counter-terrorism conference in Bogota. 
Coca eradication is the best way to protect peace efforts and fight drug trafficking which fuels violence, Duque told Reuters in an interview last week.
""Our work in the fight against drugs is maintained,"" Duque said in joint remarks with Pompeo, adding that his administration is deploying a ""multiplicity of tools"".
Duque supports restarting aerial fumigation of coca - which is more efficient and safer for troops than manual eradication.
Aerial spraying of the herbicide glyphosate was banned by the Constitutional Court in 2015 over cancer concerns but Duque has said a restart under safety conditions set by magistrates could be possible this year.
In opening remarks at the conference, Pompeo praised Colombia's designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.
The heavily armed group, established in 1982 by Iran's Revolutionary Guards, is an important part of a regional Tehran-led alliance known as ""the axis of resistance"".
""We all know too that the Iranian regime's top terrorist proxy Hezbollah has found a home in Venezuela under Maduro. This is unacceptable,"" Pompeo added, referring to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, recognized as his crisis-ridden nation's legitimate president by more than 50 countries including the United States, is attending the conference and is expected to meet with Pompeo. 
Duque recognized Guaido in his opening remarks, saying ensuring free and fair elections in Venezuela is the responsibility of all countries.
Guaido is expected to continue onward to the World Economic Forum in Davos, a source said.
The trip will help gain global attention for Guaido, but there is no evidence the tour will break Venezuela's deadlock, as the military continues to stand by the ruling Socialist Party.

Brazilian authorities on Monday said it was not yet clear if members of the PCC were among those who fled the Acre prison, or if the two jailbreaks were related.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Monday it could quit the global nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) if European countries refer it to the U.N. Security Council over a nuclear agreement, a move that would overturn diplomacy in its confrontation with the West.
The 1968 NPT has been the foundation of global nuclear arms control since the Cold War, including a 2015 deal Iran signed with world powers that offered it access to global trade in return for accepting curbs to its atomic program.
The fate of the 2015 pact has been in doubt since U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of it and reimposed sanctions. Iran has responded by scaling back its commitments, although it says it wants the pact to survive.
Britain, France and Germany declared Iran in violation of the 2015 pact last week and have launched a dispute mechanism that could eventually see the matter referred back to the Security Council and the reimposition of U.N. sanctions.
""If the Europeans continue their improper behavior or send Iran's file to the Security Council, we will withdraw from the NPT,"" Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said, according to comments carried by IRNA and other Iranian news agencies.
He also said Iran could take other steps before withdrawing from the NPT, although he did not specify them.
The nuclear dispute has been at the heart of an escalation between Washington and Tehran which blew up into military confrontation in recent weeks.
The 190-member NPT bans signatories other than the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France from acquiring nuclear weapons, in return for allowing them to pursue peaceful nuclear programs for power generation, overseen by the United Nations.
The only country ever to declare its withdrawal from the NPT was North Korea, which expelled nuclear inspectors and openly tested atomic weapons. Nuclear-armed India and Pakistan never signed up, nor did Israel, which does not say whether it has nuclear weapons but is widely presumed to have them.
The West has long accused Iran of seeking to develop nuclear arms. Tehran denies this and says its goal is to master the whole process of generating electricity from nuclear energy.
A steady escalation over Iran's nuclear plans flared into tit-for-tat military action this month, with Trump ordering a drone strike that killed a top Iranian general, prompting Iran to fire missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq. During a state of alert, Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner in error.
Amid that escalation - one of the biggest since Iran's 1979 revolution - Tehran has faced mounting pressure from European states which say they want to save the 2015 nuclear deal. They have also indicated a readiness to back Trump's call for a broader deal with Iran that goes beyond its nuclear plans.
'MAXIMUM PRESSURE'
""Despite the ill will that we see from some European countries the door of negotiations with them has not been closed and the ball is in the court of these countries,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.
But he also told a news conference: ""I don't think Iran is ready to negotiate under the conditions they have in mind.""
Since Washington withdrew from the deal, Trump began a policy of ""maximum pressure"", saying a broader deal should be negotiated on nuclear issues, Iran's missile program and Iranian activities in the Middle East.
U.S. sanctions have crippled Iran's economy, slashing its oil exports. Iran has long said it would not negotiate with Washington while sanctions are in place.
Tehran has repeatedly held talks with European officials to find ways to keep the nuclear agreement alive, but has blamed the Europeans for failing to guarantee economic benefits that Iran was meant to receive in return for curbing nuclear work.
""The European powers' claims about Iran violating the deal are unfounded,"" Mousavi said. ""Whether Iran will further decrease its nuclear commitments will depend on other parties and whether Iran's interests are secured under the deal.""
In a report on a parliamentary website, Iran's foreign minister said steps to scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal were now over.
Britain has said a ""Trump deal"" could replace the 2015 deal, and France has called for broad talks to end the crisis.
Iran says it cannot negotiate with Trump, who broke promises by repudiating the deal reached under his predecessor Barack Obama. Mousavi repeated Iran's rejection of a ""Trump deal"".

""The fact that a person's name is put on an agreement shows they're not familiar with the conditions. An agreement with a person doesn't mean anything,"" he said.

603,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 10:28AM ET</span>",Prince Harry seeks 'more peaceful life' as reluctantly ends royal role,"By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry has spoken of his sadness at being forced to give up his royal duties in a deal with Queen Elizabeth and senior Windsors, saying there was no other option if he and his wife Meghan were to seek an independent future.
Buckingham Palace and the queen announced on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer be working members of Britain’s monarchy, no longer use their ""Royal Highness"" titles and would now pay their own way in life, freeing them to forge what they call a ""progressive new role"".
The new arrangement was struck to end a crisis the couple sparked by announcing earlier this month they wanted to cut down on official engagements and spend more time in Canada and the United States, while remaining active royals.
In a speech to the Sentebale charity on Sunday, a clearly upset Harry said the final outcome was not what he and his American wife, a former actress, had wanted.
""Our hope was to continue serving the queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations without public funding. Sadly that wasn't possible,"" the prince, the sixth-in-line to the throne, said.
""I've accepted this knowing it doesn't change who I am, or how committed I am. But I hope that helps you understand what it had come to, that I would step back from all I have ever known to take a step forward into what I hope can be a more peaceful life.""
Under the arrangement, Harry will remain a prince and the couple will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they begin a new life split between Britain and North America, where they will spend the majority of their time. But they will not take part in any future ceremonial events or royal tours.
Royal commentators said it amounted to an ""abdication"" from the ""firm"" - as the royals are known - and showed that, beneath the warm words in which she said Harry and Meghan were much loved, the queen had taken a decisive line by insisting on a clean break.
""NO OPTION""
""It brings me great sadness that it has come to this,"" said Harry. He said the decision to step back had followed months of talks and had not been a decision he had come to lightly. They were not walking away, he explained. 
""As far as this goes, there really was no other option.""
He told the audience at the charity he co-founded to help children with HIV in Africa that he wanted them to hear the truth from him ""not as a prince, or a duke, but as Harry, the same person that many of you have watched grow up over the last 35 years but with a clearer perspective"".
""The UK is my home and a place that I love. That will never change,"" he said. 
The couple's plans for independence, announced after a long break over the Christmas period in Canada, caught the rest of the royal family by surprise and left the queen and other senior members hurt and disappointed, according to royal sources.
However, in a TV interview aired in October, both had made it clear how they were struggling with the immense media attention. The couple had also started legal action against a newspaper for printing a letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. 
Harry said he felt his wife had faced ""bullying"" from some tabloids similar to that faced by his mother Princess Diana who died in a car crash while trying to escape paparazzi photographers.
""When I lost my mum 23 years ago, you took me under your wing. You've looked out for me for so long but the media is a powerful force and my hope is one day our collective support for each other can be more powerful because this is so much bigger than just us,"" he said.
Buckingham Palace have said the couple would no longer receive public money and that they would repay the cost of refurbishing their cottage in Windsor, which official figures show amounted to 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million).
But certain details, such as their future security arrangements or whether the couple could continue to use the ""Sussex Royal"" title for their website and branding, have either not been finalised or publicly revealed. 
Meghan is currently in Canada with their baby son Archie and Harry is expected to join her soon. 
The royal crisis, which has dominated the British news agenda for almost two weeks, overshadowing Brexit and tensions over Iran, exposed a deep rift among the Windsors and poses questions about its role in the modern world.
The Sun newspaper said Harry and his elder brother William, with whom he acknowledged he had fallen out, had ended their feud but he remained at loggerheads with his father Prince Charles, the heir-to-the-throne. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he believed the whole of Britain would want to wish the couple the very best.
However, Meghan's father was less generous, accusing them of damaging the monarchy.

""They are destroying it, they are cheapening it, they're making it shabby,"" Markle told Britain's Channel 5.

Three protesters succumbed to their wounds in a Baghdad hospital after police fired live rounds in Tayaran Square (NYSE:SQ), security and medical sources said. Two protesters were shot by live bullets while a third was hit by a tear gas canister, they said.
A fourth demonstrator was shot dead by police in the Shi'ite holy city of Kerbala, the sources added.
Protesters threw petrol bombs and stones at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades, Reuters witnesses said. 
""They (security forces) should stop shooting and aiming, who are they and who are we? Both sides are Iraqis. So why are you killing your brothers?"" said one woman protester in Baghdad who declined to give her name. 
In the Iraqi oil city of Basra, two policemen were struck and killed by a civilian car during the protest, security sources said. The driver was trying to avoid the scene of clashes between protesters and security forces when he drove into the two officers, they said.
Elsewhere in southern Iraq, hundreds of protesters burned tires and blocked main roads in several cities, including Nassiriya, Kerbala and Amara. They say Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has not fulfilled promises including naming a new government acceptable to Iraqis.
Baghdad police said its forces had reopened all roads that were closed by ""violent gatherings"". It said 14 officers were wounded near Tahrir square, including some with head wounds and broken bones.
Traffic was disrupted on a highway linking Baghdad to southern cities, a Reuters witness said. Production in southern oilfields was unaffected by the unrest, oil officials said.
Mass protests have gripped Iraq since Oct. 1, with mostly young protesters demanding an overhaul of a political system they see as profoundly corrupt and as keeping most Iraqis in poverty. More than 450 people have been killed.
Numbers had dwindled but protests resumed last week as demonstrators sought to keep up momentum after attention turned to the threat of a U.S.-Iran conflict following Washington's killing of Tehran's top general in an air strike inside Iraq.

The killing of Qassem Soleimani, to which Tehran responded with a ballistic missile attack on two Iraqi military bases housing U.S. troops, has highlighted the influence of some foreign powers in Iraq, especially Iran and the United States.

Two Ukrainian soldiers were killed and 10 were wounded at the weekend in the eastern Donbass region, where fighting between Russia-backed separatist fighters and Ukraine's armed forces began in 2014.
The separatists did not immediately comment on the latest incident but each side blames the other for recent violence.
France and Germany have been trying to broker an end to the conflict at talks with Russia and Ukraine in what is known as the Normandy format. They hope to build on a ceasefire agreement that was reached in the Belarussian capital, Minsk, but has failed to end the conflict.
Although the intensity of fighting has dropped, shelling and shooting continues on the contact line between the separatists and Ukrainian soldiers, some of whom wait in trenches now tipped in places by ice and snow.
""As for the Minsk process and intensification of shooting attacks - we are concerned about it, no doubts,"" Prystaiko told a joint news conference with Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama.
He said Kiev had discussed the latest violence with the head of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which monitors the situation in eastern Ukraine.
""I think there will be a reaction from the Ukrainian side to such shooting attacks. We will try to contact our Normandy partners urgently because, like you, we see that agreements do not work,"" Prystaiko said.
More than 13,000 people have been killed in the fighting since 2014.
At a four-way summit with the leaders of France and Germany last month the Russian and Ukrainian presidents, Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelenskiy, agreed to commit to the full and comprehensive implementation of a ceasefire."
606,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 10:06AM ET</span>",Thousands of armed activists gather at Virginia's pro-gun rally,"By Brad Brooks
RICHMOND, Va. (Reuters) - Thousands of armed pro-gun activists from across the United States rallied outside Virginia's capitol building on Monday to protest new restrictions proposed by state lawmakers, with authorities bracing for violence.
The rally began on a cold morning with a festival-like atmosphere in the streets of Richmond. Many in the crowds were dressed in camouflage or tactical gear and carrying weapons as they exchanged pleasantries with others arriving at the event. Some browsed vendors' pro-gun T-shirts and other merchandise, much of it carrying slogans supporting President Donald Trump. 
Those backing tougher gun restrictions see Democrats taking control of the Virginia legislature for the first time in a generation on campaign promises of tougher access to arms as offering a model for other traditionally gun-friendly states. 
Activists at the rally argued that Virginia is stomping on their constitutional right to bear arms and vowed that Monday's event will help citizens understand how quickly they can lose the ability to carry guns, based on who wins at the ballot box. 
""What's going on here, if not stopped, will spread to other states,"" said Teri Horne, who had traveled to Virginia from her home in Texas with her Smith & Wesson rifle and .40-caliber handgun. ""They will come for our guns in other states if we don't stop them in Virginia.""
Activists said they were planning only a peaceful protest. Security was tight with a large police presence. Those wanting to enter Capitol Square (NYSE:SQ) to hear the morning's speakers had to pass through a single entrance for security screening, leaving their guns outside.
Tension rose ahead of the rally after the FBI last week arrested three members of a small neo-Nazi group, who authorities said hoped to ignite a race war through violence at the gathering, reminiscent of a 2017 white supremacist rally in nearby Charlottesville.
People across the United States were focused on the Virginia gun issue, said Philip Van Cleave, leader of the Virginia Citizens Defense League, which is organizing Monday's rally.
""They don't want us to fail in stopping this,"" Van Cleave said on Sunday. ""We've gotten huge donations from other states.""
Van Cleave has rejected calls for violence, but he has urged tens of thousands of armed supporters from across the United States to be in Richmond to provide security for his group.
A spokesman for the Capitol police said Van Cleave had worked closely with law enforcement on plans for the rally. 
High-profile national militia figures gathered for a meeting on Sunday near Richmond said they wanted Monday's event to be peaceful, but feared the worst, including the risk of a ""lone wolf"" unleashing bitter fighting with a single shot. 
""The buildup is probably one of the most intense I've seen,"" said Tammy Lee, a right-wing internet personality from Oklahoma who was involved in the Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" rally. 
Christian Yingling, head of the Pennsylvania Light Foot Militia and a leader in Charlottesville, said none of his men would carry long guns and they wanted to avoid skirmishes.
'FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT' 
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, a Democrat, has vowed to push through new gun control laws and is backing a package of eight bills, including universal background checks, a ""red flag"" law, a ban on assault rifles and a limit of one handgun-a-month purchase.
""The Virginia election last November was an indictment of guns, and it was not an outlier,"" said Christian Heyne, who leads legislative efforts at the gun violence prevention group Brady. ""Virginia candidates flipped things on their head when they won because of the gun issue, not despite it. That is a fundamental shift.""
The state's gun owners responded with a movement to create ""sanctuary cities"" for gun rights, with local government bodies passing declarations not to enforce new gun laws.
Since the November election, nearly all of Virginia's 95 counties have some form of ""sanctuary"", a term first used by localities opposed to harsh treatment of illegal immigrants.
The idea has quickly spread across the United States, with over 200 local governments in 16 states passing such measures.
President Donald Trump fanned the flames on Friday when he said the U.S. Constitution was being attacked in Virginia, where he was soundly defeated in 2016 by Hilary Clinton.
The NRA, which is not involved in organizing Monday's rally, also blasted Virginia's Democrats, who received campaign contributions last year of more than $2.5 million from Everytown for Gun Safety, started by former New York mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg. 

""Anti-gun billionaires who invested millions in the 2019 Virginia elections expect a return on that investment,"" said NRA official D. J. Spiker. ""The NRA is fully prepared to work to defeat Governor Northam's gun grab - but also work to find compromise.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Monday condemned the ""barbaric resurgence"" of anti-Semitism around the world, linking it to the rise of populism.
Next week's 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp should serve as a reminder not to become indifferent, Francis said to a delegation from the human rights and research group, the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
""It is troubling to see, in many parts of the world, an increase in selfishness and indifference, lack of concern for others and the attitude that says life is good as long as it is good for me, and when things go wrong, anger and malice are unleashed,"" Francis said.
""This creates a fertile ground for the forms of factionalism and populism we see around us, where hatred quickly springs up ... where hatred is seminated,"" he said. ""Even recently, we have witnessed a barbaric resurgence of cases of anti-Semitism.""
He did not specifically mention any countries or populist movements.
Last month in eastern France, scores of Jewish graves were found desecrated in a cemetery, hours before lawmakers adopted a resolution equating anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism.
France has Europe’s biggest Jewish community - around 550,000 - and anti-Semitic attacks are common, with more than 500 alone in 2018.
""Once more, I firmly condemn every form of anti-Semitism,"" Francis told the delegation.
A global survey https://global100.adl.org/about/2019 by the U.S.-based Anti-Defamation League in November found that anti-Semitic attitudes had increased in many places around the world and significantly in Eastern and Central Europe.
It also found that large percentages of people in Eastern and Western European countries think Jews talk too much about the Holocaust.
In the survey, about 78% of respondents in Poland, where the Nazi extermination camp of Auschwitz was located during the German occupation in World War II, answered in the affirmative to the statement: ""Jews still talk too much about what happened to them in the Holocaust.""
The Nazis and their collaborators killed about six million Jews in their attempt to exterminate European Jewry. Millions of others were also killed, including homosexuals, gypsies and political dissenters.
Francis, who visited Auschwitz in 2016, said remembering the Holocaust was vital to ensure that similar atrocities do not happen again. 

""If we lose our memory, we destroy our future. May the anniversary of the unspeakable cruelty that humanity learned of seventy-five years ago serve as a summons to pause, to be still and to remember. We need to do this, lest we become indifferent,"" he said.

Orwell met Brenda Salkeld a few years before his first publishing success, ""Down and Out in Paris and London"" in 1933 and she became an influence on his writing, according to the letters which were reported in The Times newspaper on Monday.
Orwell told Salkeld that his first wife, Eileen O'Shaughnessy, understood his desires and ""she wished I could sleep with you about twice a year, just to keep me happy"".
In an earlier letter, he wrote: ""I don't know if you have ever realized quite how much you mean to me. Besides you said you thought you would finally take a lover, and if so I don't see why it shouldn't be me.""
He continued to write to her until 1949 - just before his second wedding and only weeks before his death. The letters showed he used Salkeld as a sounding board for his ideas.
Orwell's son, Richard Blair, said he bought the letters to give to the George Orwell Archive at University College London.
Another set of letters bought by Blair also showed Orwell's continued admiration for a former lover, Eleanor Jacques.
Blair told The Times that the letters showed Jacques and Salkeld ""had far more influence on him than first supposed.""
""They were very personal letters,"" he said. ""I think there was a bit of physical contact in both cases from time to time. He liked very strong women. Women who had an opinion. That is what attracted him. The fact he got anything after that was a bonus.""
Orwell, who also wrote the novels ""Animal Farm"" and ""Nineteen Eighty-Four"", remains widely known for his criticism of governments and totalitarianism. The 70th anniversary of Orwell's death will be on Jan. 21."

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Finance Minister Siv Jensen and her right-wing Progress Party will resign from the government over a cabinet decision to help bring a woman suspected of Islamic State affiliation back home to Norway, Jensen said on Monday.
The resignation robs Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg of her parliamentary majority and could make the country more difficult to govern, but Solberg still plans to remain in office as head of a minority coalition.
""I brought us into government, and I'm now bringing the party out,"" Jensen told a news conference.
There had been ""too many compromises"", Jensen said, while adding she wants to have a close dialogue with the prime minister in the future.
The Norwegian crown currency was largely unchanged after the announcement.
Prime Minister Erna Solberg said she would remain in office as head of a minority three-party coalition.
Most Norwegian governments since the 1970s have ruled with a minority in parliament, including Solberg between 2013 and January 2019.
Jensen's departure was triggered by the decision, announced last week, that the Norwegian woman and her two children would receive help to return to Norway from Syria so that one of the children could receive medical treatment.
The woman, who left Norway in 2013, was arrested on her return on suspicion of being a member of the Islamist militant group that briefly controlled a territory the size of Britain across Iraq and Syria.
While Progress had offered to help the children, the populist party sought to deny any government assistance for adults seeking to return home after joining Islamist groups abroad or marrying foreign fighters.
Decisions on whether to help women with IS ties return from Syria has caused controversy in Europe, including in Finland where the recently appointed government settled on a compromise to decide each case individually.
The Norwegian woman, who has not been named, has denied the charges against her and will fully cooperate with police during interrogation, her lawyer has said.
Jensen's exit, along with six other Progress cabinet ministers, leaves Solberg with a string of posts to fill, including that of oil and energy minister to oversee Western Europe's biggest oil and gas industry.
At the finance ministry, the new appointee will chart the course for the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, with assets of $1.1 trillion.

Norway's constitution does not allow early elections, and the next vote for parliament will take place in September 2021.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A strip of skin tattooed with the Auschwitz death camp number 99288 sits in a silver frame on a shelf in Avraham Harshalom's living room. It is his prisoner number, etched on to his forearm in 1943.
As the 75th anniversary of the camp's liberation on Jan 27, 1945, nears, Harshalom, 95, is very clear about why he kept it.
""For history. To tell it to the next generations,"" he said.
""In Auschwitz nobody knew names. The German SS (officer), when he was talking to you, he was talking to a number.""
Harshalom is one of some 200,000 Holocaust survivors living in Israel today. But with every passing year, fewer remain to provide first-hand testimony to the atrocities committed by the Nazis in World War Two.
Six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
""The Second World War is no longer a family story that you hear at home. For many it has become a history textbook story,"" said Pawel Sawicki, press officer at the Auschwitz Memorial, at the site of the camp built in Nazi-occupied Poland.
""The biggest challenge is how to tell this story in a way relevant to them today and in the future.""
More than a million people, nearly all of them Jews, died at Auschwitz, whose name has become synonymous with the industrial-scale killings carried out at the Nazi death camps.
Harshalom, who was born in a small Polish village, was 17 when he arrived at Auschwitz.
Harshalom, born Avraham Frydberg, was selected by the SS for work at the camp. It saved his life: those deemed unfit for labor were sent to immediate death in the camp's gas chambers.
Among those killed were his parents and his brother.
Harshalom had his tattoo removed soon after moving to the newly-founded state of Israel in 1949, where he started a family and built a career as a businessman.
In the years immediately following the war the tattoo kept inviting questions; people simply didn't know what it meant, even in Israel, he said.
""At first, say 20 years after the war, all Holocaust survivors and especially prisoners of Auschwitz were not talking at all (of their experiences),"" he said.
""We were not talking because people didn't believe ... that what we are telling is true.""
SAVED BY A FUR COAT
Artemis Meron, from a small Jewish community in Greece, was 15 when in 1944 she was transported to Auschwitz with her mother and nine-year-old brother.
She and other Jews rounded up in Greece were packed by the hundreds into freight carts with hardly any room to move. One bucket held water to drink, another served as the only toilet. Many died on the journey, their bodies slung into one of the train-cars.
Upon arrival at Auschwitz they were lined up into rows - young men on one side and young women on the other. In the middle the elderly, mothers and children were shoved into military vehicles.
""We wanted to stay together. We held each other tight. It was snowing heavily and my mother gave me her black fur coat, so I must have looked older than I was,"" Meron said.
She was singled out for labor. As they headed to the vehicles, an SS guard struck her down, separating her from her family.
""He put my brother and mother into the vehicle, shut it and off it drove. I didn't have time to say goodbye,"" she recalled, her eyes filling with tears.
""I hoped we'd see each other later in the evening. What was I to think? That all those put in the vehicles were taken that evening to the gas chambers, to the crematorium? We knew nothing,"" she said.
""The worst was when we heard the rumors ... and then we knew the truth. We were told 'don't you see the smoke rising up?'""
""ANGEL OF DEATH""
Another Auschwitz survivor, Vera Grossman Kriegel, 81, said she was pained by the rise of anti-Semitism in recent years and feared that history might repeat itself.
""It can happen anywhere,"" she said. ""Hate is born of ignorance. No one is learning from the past, no one wants to learn.""
Aged six, Vera and her twin sister were subjected to the pseudo-medical experiments of doctor Josef Mengele, who used prisoners at Auschwitz as research subjects, earning him the name ""Angel of Death"".
Vera and her sister were two of the few children to survive his cruelty. She tells of how she was kept naked in a cage, given painful injections directly into her spine, and beaten if she cried as she saw many other children suffer and die.
""Why did I stay alive? It was for a reason. Did I stay alive to keep silent? No - to tell."""

Politicians have failed to agree on a government or an economic rescue plan since protests pushed Hariri to quit as prime minister in October.
Beirut has been rocked in recent days by some of the worst violence since the unrest began, with 370 injured in clashes between protesters and security forces on Saturday. 
President Michel Aoun met security chiefs on Monday to work out a plan for deterring violent groups that ""security services have detailed information on"" while protecting property and peaceful protesters, sources at the meeting said.
Lebanon's unrest is fueled in part by deep financial strains that have sunk the currency, pushed up prices and driven banks to impose capital controls.
""Our government resigned in order to transition to a new government dealing with popular changes but obstruction has continued for 90 days and the country is moving toward the unknown,"" Hariri said in a tweet.
Last month little-known former minister Hassan Diab was designated prime minister with the backing of Islamist movement Hezbollah and its allies, but a deal on a cabinet has yet to be announced.

""The continuation of the caretaker government is not the solution so let's stop wasting time and have the government bear the responsibility,"" Hariri said.

613,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>",Supreme Court religious rights case has big implications for U.S. schools,"By Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite wondering every autumn whether she can afford it, Kendra Espinoza has worked hard to keep her two daughters in a small private Christian school in Kalispell, Montana, costing about $15,000 annually for them to attend.
Even with some financial support from the school Espinoza, a single mother, still has a sizable tuition bill to pay. She decided against sending the girls, ages 14 and 11, to local public schools that would be free to attend. On top of her full-time office manager job, Espinoza has worked nights as a janitor in an office building to help pay for tuition, taking her daughters along to instill in them a strong work ethic.
If you want something enough in life, Espinoza said, you have to fight for it.
""The way I try to raise my girls, of course I want them to be able to read the Bible and be taught how to pray, taught from that faith-based perspective,"" Espinoza said in an interview. ""At the public school, there's a lot of disrespect and not enough of those values that I wanted them to learn.""
Espinoza, 47, is a plaintiff in a major religious rights case that will be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday. She and two other mothers of students at Stillwater Christian School are appealing a lower court ruling that struck down a Montana state tax credit that could help students pay to attend private schools including religious ones.
A 2015 Montana law provided people a tax credit of up to $150 for donations to groups that fund scholarships for private school tuition. State tax officials limited the program to non-religious schools in order to comport with the state constitution, which forbids public aid to any ""church, sect or denomination."" Thirty-eight states have such constitutional provisions.
But the Montana Supreme Court struck down the scholarship program entirely because it could be used to pay for religious schools.
""This is grossly unfair to any parents of kids who go to religious school,"" said Espinoza, who is represented by the Institute for Justice, a libertarian legal group. ""It's not fair to us to be excluded (from) funds available to the general public.""
The Supreme Court's ruling in the case, due by the end of June, could narrow the separation of church and state.
In their appeal to the nine justices, lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that Montana's decision to exclude religious school students from the scholarship program violated their rights under the U.S. Constitution to free exercise of religion and equal protection under the law.
It is an argument that could find favor with the court, which has a 5-4 conservative majority.
Under the Montana program, individuals could donate to a scholarship fund organization and receive up to a $150 tax credit. The one scholarship organization that currently exists provides $500 scholarships, primarily to needy students.
Proponents of religious school funding contend that the no-aid to religious institutions provisions in place in 38 states are so-called Blaine amendments, written into the majority of state constitutions in the 19th century as a form of anti-Catholic discrimination.
Montana disagrees, noting that the state adopted a new constitution in 1972 and kept the no-aid provision, believing it would protect religious freedom by preventing the government from gaining influence over religious schools and weakening public schools.
President Donald Trump's administration is backing the plaintiffs in the case. The Republican president, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, enjoys strong support among evangelical Christian voters. At a rally in Florida this month he pledged to bring prayer to public schools.
Though the plaintiffs are asking the justices to rule in their favor on the tax credit program, Trump's administration has a broader goal in mind: knocking out state constitution no-aid provisions.
""Because the no-aid provision contravenes the U.S. Constitution, the state court had no authority to enforce it,"" Solicitor General Noel Francisco said in a court filing.
Opponents of government support for religion as well as public educators have expressed alarm at the possible ramifications of a ruling in favor of the plaintiffs.
Such a decision could lead to the unprecedented outcome of requiring state funding for religious education or other activities, said Rachel Laser, president of the advocacy group Americans United for Separation of Church and State.
""The question before the court is whether states can continue to protect their citizens' religious freedom by ensuring that public money not be used to fund religious education and discrimination. The answer must be yes,"" Laser said.
Expanding tax credits and vouchers for private education takes scarce resources away from public education, added Lily Eskelsen Garcia, president of the National Education Association, a union that represents public school teachers nationwide.
The case is ""an obvious attempt to use the Supreme Court to move this political agenda,"" she said.
Eighteen other states have tax-credit programs like the one ended in Montana, supporting around 250,000 students, according to a court filing. Most private schools in those states are religious.
Espinoza's case could give the justices an opportunity to build on a major 2017 religious rights ruling in favor of a Missouri church that challenged its exclusion from state playground improvement grants generally available to other nonprofit groups. The Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that churches and other religious entities cannot be flatly denied public money even in states where constitutions explicitly ban such funding.
""People will say that they're afraid of religion being pushed down their throat but I don't believe that's an issue in this case,"" Espinoza said. ""If funds are donated by private citizens to a private organization, just because they have a tax credit attached doesn't make them public funds."""

VALLETTA (Reuters) - Another Maltese minister has quit after a paper reported links between her policeman husband and the man suspected of masterminding a journalist's murder, the government said on Monday.
Corruption investigator Daphne Caruana Galizia was blown up by a car bomb in October 2017, prompting a lengthy inquiry that has caused political turmoil on the Mediterranean island, including the resignation of the prime minister.
The latest official to quit was Justyne Caruana, a lawyer who was minister responsible for the small island of Gozo.
The Sunday Times of Malta said her husband, former assistant police commissioner Silvio Valletta, went to London to see a soccer match with businessman Yorgen Fenech in September 2018 when Fenech was already of interest in the investigation.
""I am submitting my resignation as minister with immediate effect in view of the press story issued, even though I am completely extraneous to it and have no connection to the facts,"" the outgoing minister wrote in a letter, extracts of which the government published on Monday.
On Sunday, Valletta, who had been the lead investigator into the murder but was taken off the case in mid-2018 due to conflict of interest and resigned from the force last year, said he did not know Fenech was a suspect when they traveled.
""I never did anything wrong and would certainly never have gone abroad with anyone who I would have thought, or known to be under investigation,"" he said.
Fenech, one of Malta's wealthiest men with extensive ties to government, was charged with complicity to murder last year. Sources say police regard him as the mastermind of the journalist’s killing. He has denied the accusation.
The departing minister Caruana, who is not related to the journalist, was appointed by former Prime Minister Joseph Muscat in 2017 and confirmed by new premier Robert Abela last week.
""I always acted with the utmost correctness. I only ask to be allowed to defend my name in the interests of my children,"" she added in her letter.
Various other officials from Muscat's government have also resigned during the political storm over the murder, while Malta's police chief quit a few days ago."
615,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>",Former policeman among three militants killed in gunfight with Indian troops,"By Fayaz Bukhari
SRINAGAR, India (Reuters) - A former police officer was among three Islamist militants killed in a gunbattle with Indian troops in the disputed region of Kashmir on Monday, security officials said.
They said Adil Bashir Sheikh, a former special police officer, stole a cache of automatic weapons from the house of a local legislator in September 2018 and joined the militant group Hizbul Mujahideen.
He was killed along with two other men in the Shopian district of Kashmir after being surrounded by security forces.
The three men were responsible for the deaths of a dozen people, including four police officers, according to Dilbagh Singh, director general of Jammu and Kashmir Police.
""It is a major success for security forces,"" he said. ""It was a successful operation,"" Singh told a news conference.
Kashmir, a Muslim-majority Himalayan territory, is claimed by both India and Pakistan and they have fought two wars over the region. Both claim it in full but rule it in part.
Tensions in Kashmir have been especially acute over the last year. India and Pakistan both said they carried out air strikes in enemy territory after a February 2019 suicide bombing by a Pakistan-based militant group killed dozens of Indian troops.
In August, India revoked the special autonomous status of its portion of Kashmir - to the fury of Islamabad. India, which said the move was needed to spur economic development in Kashmir, in turn accuses arch-rival Pakistan funding a decades-long insurgency in the region, an assertion Islamabad denies.
Many Kashmiris strongly oppose Indian rule, including some in the region's police forces, which unlike the army is predominantly staffed by local people.
Earlier this month, security forces arrested Davinder Singh, a senior police officer responsible for security at the airport of the regional capital Srinagar after he was found traveling in a car with a commander of Hizbul Mujahideen.
""We have got a lot of information from him,"" Singh said, without elaborating."

The Oresund Bridge, made famous by the Nordic noir TV crime series 'The Bridge', needs the fresh coat of paint to maintain its steel structure. The project will involve painting some 300,000 square meters of bridge.
""The top layer of the five-layer painting system will wear out within the next 10 years, so we have to apply a new top layer to be able to maintain the lower levels, which protect the steel from corrosion,"" project manager Johan Nord told Reuters.
The bridge was last painted in sections on land before being assembled over the waterway. This time, a special platform has had to be mounted beside the bridge, with the workmen hanging from gantry cranes over the Oresund strait.
""It's a very special job because you are working 20 to 30 meters above sea level hanging in gantry cranes to get access to the bridge,"" Chief Executive of Muehlhan Denmark, Jens Mork, said.
German industrial service provider Muehlhan has been chosen for the first two years of the project, which will see an area equivalent to 42 soccer fields painted black.
Mork said he expected to use between 300,000 and 400,000 liters of paint for the entire project."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Hindu nationalist ruling party on Monday elevated a veteran lawmaker and long-time associate of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to become its president ahead of a string of state elections.
Jagat Prakash Nadda, who rose through the ranks after cutting his teeth as a student leader in the 1970s, will become the new president of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), replacing Amit Shah, currently India's Home Minister.
Nadda was elected unopposed, the party said.
Led by Modi and Shah, the BJP returned to power, winning in a general election in 2019 by a landslide majority, but the party has failed to keep its hold on a number of key Indian states amid growing criticism over some of its recent moves.
Since late 2018, the BJP has lost control of the western states of Rajasthan and Maharashtra, Jharkhand in the east and Chhattisgarh in central India - shrinking its national footprint, even though Modi's popularity seems largely undiminished.
A wave of countrywide protests over a new citizenship law that has continued for more than four weeks has also caught the party on the wrong foot, adding to concerns about a flagging economy and rising inflation.
With some of India's largest states going to the polls in the next two years, Nadda will have to balance the outsized influence of Modi and Shah alongside crafting an electoral strategy to improve the BJP's performance.
""Electorally, the BJP is going to have a tough cycle,"" said Rahul Verma, a fellow at New Delhi think-tank Centre for Policy Research. Next month, Delhi elects a new state assembly and the BJP is widely seen to be trailing behind an incumbent local group headed by a feisty leader.
Nadda first joined the student wing of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) - the nationalist group that spawned the BJP - before moving into electoral politics in the 1980s, and subsequently working alongside Modi in the early 1990s.
During Modi's first term, Nadda served as the federal health minister. He was then left out of Modi's cabinet, after the prime minister returned to power, and moved back to the party full-time as its working president last June.
Since then, Modi's government has moved quickly to fulfil a number of electoral promises, including removing special provisions on the disputed Kashmir region, gaining legal approval for building a temple at a contested site in the northern city of Ayodhya, and introducing a new citizenship law.
But the moves have hardened opposition against the party, with many Indians, including a section of Muslims, accusing Modi of pushing a Hindu-first agenda."

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will stop using their royal titles, give up state funding and repay taxpayer money used to refurbish their home at Windsor Castle as they seek to pursue new careers outside of Britain's royal family.
The deal is intended to end a crisis that erupted two weeks ago when the couple abruptly announced plans to step back from their royal duties and spend part of each year in North America.
It will come into this spring and the new arrangement will be reviewed after a year by the senior royals.
WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR THEIR TITLES?
Harry will remain a prince and sixth in line of succession. But the couple will no longer be working members of Britain's monarchy, no longer use their ""Royal Highness"" titles and will now be free to seek a private income
Harry will also relinquish his honorary military appointments and his status as a Commonwealth youth ambassador. But the couple will preserve their links to a network of private charities.
WHO WILL PAY?
Harry and Meghan will no longer receive income from the monarchy's funding, known as the ""Sovereign Grant"". This is a government handout that covers the running costs of the royal household and travel expenses.
The couple previously said the grant was equivalent to 5% of their income toward running their official office. The remaining income came from Prince Charles's centuries-old private estate.
Charles, heir to the throne and father of Prince Harry and Prince William, will continue to offer private financial support although the details of this was not spelled out.
They will also repay the 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million) in public money used to refurbish Frogmore Cottage, the house in grounds of the queen's Windsor Castle they moved into last year.
A royal source said the couple would pay a commercial rent on the property.
HOW WILL THEY EARN MONEY?
The couple have not said how they intend to fund themselves in future. Some of Queen Elizabeth's other grandchildren work, including Prince Andrew's daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, who work in business and the arts.
Last year, Harry said he would be teaming up with U.S. television mogul Oprah Winfrey to produce a documentary on mental health for Apple's video streaming service.
New video footage was published at the weekend showing the couple at the premiere of Disney’s Lion King in London last year. It shows Harry telling the film’s director that Meghan, a former actress, is available for voiceover work, with Meghan saying: ""That’s really why we’re here – it’s the pitch.""
Six months ago Harry and Meghan applied to the UK Intellectual Property Office to trademark the phrases Sussex Royal and Sussex Royal Foundation for use on books, stationery, clothing such as pyjamas and socks, charity campaigns and the provision of training, sport and social care.
It is unclear if they will retain the Sussex Royal brand name and monogram of a crown above an entwined H&M.
WHERE WILL THEY LIVE?
They said they now plan to divide their time between Britain and North America.
They will continue to base themselves at Frogmore Cottage in the grounds of the queen's Windsor Castle when in Britain.
Meghan was born in Los Angeles and she grew up in Hollywood. Harry and Meghan, who lived in Canada while filming the TV show ""Suits"", spent the last six weeks of 2019 in Canada and their first official appearance of 2020 was a trip to Canada House in London, home of Canada's diplomatic mission to Britain.
WHO WILL PAY FOR THEIR SECURITY?
It is also not clear who will pay for the couple’s security, which could run into millions of pounds per year. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on those arrangements.
Until now, the couple have received armed personal protection from London's police paid for by taxpayers. But they are no longer working royals, which may influence what publicly funded security they are entitled to.
A former head of royal protection said that Britain’s Home Office will probably continue to provide the couple with some police protection, given their status as prominent public figures."

Putin, in a surprise move, last week unveiled a sweeping shake-up of the political system which led to the resignation of Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister along with his government.
Putin's changes, which would amend the constitution to create new centers of power outside the presidency, were seen by many as giving the 67-year-old scope to extend his grip on power once his term expires in 2024.
Opposition politician Ilya Yashin on Monday announced what he said were coordinated opposition plans for a protest march against Putin's initiative on Feb. 29 in Moscow.
""Society needs a big and genuinely mass protest,"" wrote Yashin, who said Putin's changes amounted to a move to ""rule for ever"".
""It will be a political march, the main aim of which will be to call for the rotation of power and to protest against the usurpation of power,"" said Yashin.
Yashin said the protest, permission for which he said would now be requested from the Moscow authorities, had the support of a wide range of anti-Kremlin groups including opposition politician Alexei Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation.
Navalny publicized Yashin's message on social media.
Putin has dominated Russian politics, as president or as prime minister, for two decades. His proposed changes, which are set to be put to a nationwide vote on an as yet unspecified date, have not so far triggered major protests.
Over 1,000 people marched through Moscow on Sunday in an event one Kremlin critic tried to turn into a protest against the reforms, but many demonstrators chose to voice dissent about other issues instead."

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Rescuers in Nepal called off efforts on Monday to find seven people, including four South Korean trekkers, after fresh avalanches hit the Annapurna region where the group went missing last week, an official said.
Three Nepali guides were among the group struck by an avalanche on Friday along the popular trekking route at the base of Mount Annapurna, the world’s 10th highest mountain, at 8,091 meters (26,545 feet).
A military helicopter flew an army search and rescue team and sherpa climbers to the area, but ""bad weather, heavy snow and continuous avalanches"" prevented them from landing, said Mira Acharya, a tourism department official.
""It is a big disaster and the government is concerned about the safety of tourists,"" Acharya told Reuters. ""Rescuers are on standby for a fresh search.""
The search will continue when the weather improves, she added.
About 200 people, including 140 foreign hikers, were evacuated from the area at the weekend, police official Binod Sharma said.
Avalanches and bad weather had also prevented a search on Sunday by seven rescuers from the Trekking Agents’ Association of Nepal, who reached the site at Deurali, about 150 km (90 miles) northwest of the capital, Kathmandu.
A helicopter equipped with a device to track signs of the trekkers in the snow also failed to pinpoint where the group of seven went missing, said Suraj Paudyal, an official of a private rescue company.
In 2018, five South Koreans and four Nepali guides on a Himalayan climbing expedition were flung to their deaths after a huge block of ice crashed over a cliff into a narrow mountain gorge.
The winter trekking season in Nepal, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest, is drawing to a close this month. Nepal gets four percent of its GDP from tourism including trekking."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's Constitutional Court is to decide on Tuesday whether to dissolve the opposition Future Forward Party, in a ruling that could strengthen the military-backed government's majority in parliament. 
The case is based on a complaint that claims the party is seeking to overthrow the revered constitutional monarchy and is linked to the Illuminati, a secret society that conspiracy theorists believe seeks world domination. 
Founded almost two years ago by auto-parts billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, Future Forward Party came third in last year's general election, which the opposition says was manipulated in favor of the pro-military Palang Pracharat Party. 
Thanathorn, 41, has emerged as the most prominent opponent to the government led by Palang Pracharat, which reinstalled former junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha, 65, as a civilian prime minister five years after he staged a military coup. 
Future Forward spokeswoman Pannika Wanich said the case is an attempt to eliminate the party, using a claim of protecting the monarchy that few would dare argue against. 
""It's clear that the anti-monarchy claim is the only one that can go so far as to destroy Future Forward Party,"" Pannika said. 
""We emphasize that this is a deliberate political harassment."" 
The case, accepted by the Constitutional Court in July, is best known for its allegation that the party's triangular logo signifies association with the Illuminati, making the party a threat to Thailand's constitutional monarchy. 
It also alleges that language in the party's manifesto, as well as past business investments, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) pictures and academic briefings by key party figures, suggest personal hostility toward the constitutional monarchy since before the party was founded. 
""I looked into their behavior from the past to now,"" Nattaporn Toprayoon, who filed the complaint last May, told Reuters. ""I did it because I'm Thai. The monarchy is of utmost reverence."" 
But Pannika said these allegations were problematic. 
""This would set a new legal precedent that executive members of a political party must have their thoughts and minds inspected,"" she said. 
""It's also an unexpected new low that a political party has to defend itself to show it's not involved with the Illuminati."" 
A verdict to dissolve Future Forward on Tuesday is likely, which could spark political events like flashmobs in the short term, said Yuttaporn Issarachai, a political scientist at Sukhothai Thammathirat Open University. 
""But even if the party survives, it will still face other outstanding legal challenges ahead,"" Yuttaporn said. 
Future Forward faces another case alleging that it had violated laws governing political parties by accepting loans from its party leader, among others.

623,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 05:19AM ET</span>","75 years on, Holocaust survivors struggle to recover property in Poland","By Joanna Plucinska and Dan Fastenberg
WARSAW/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lea Evron, 85, has only fragments of memories of the fur factory and the three-story apartment building her family owned before World War Two in Zywiec, a small town in southern Poland.
What she does remember clearly is returning after the war, when most of her family had been killed in the Holocaust.
A local woman said to her and her mother ""Hitler promised to get rid of all of the Jews, and here they come home,"" Evron told Reuters in her apartment in New York.
Evron and her mother were told they could live in the apartment building, but only in the maids' quarters. They moved to Israel soon afterwards.
Evron is just one of thousands of Jews whose families' property was seized by Poland's Nazi occupiers and then kept by its postwar communist rulers.
Home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities before the war, Poland is the only EU country that has not legislated on property restitution.
To make matters more difficult, Jews say documents proving property ownership were often destroyed in the Holocaust.
As the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz, the Nazi German death camp, approaches on Jan. 27, they say it's time for Poland to make the process easier.
""Holocaust survivors ... shouldn't have to suffer now. They are dying without justice in Poland,"" said Lea's husband, Jehuda Evron, 88.
Poland's ruling Law and Justice party, supported by far-right groups, has rejected demands for clearer rules on restitution, despite pressure from the United States.
""Something that should be fundamentally a moral question - I had a house, the Nazis stole it, the Soviets stole it, I should get it back - is now being made into a political question,"" Poland's Chief Rabbi, Michael Schudrich, told Reuters, referring to comments by far-right groups.
LOST PROPERTY
Poland has grappled with the issue since communism fell in 1989, with many arguing that it simply cannot afford to repay everyone who lost property.
No new legislation has emerged and Jews complain that courts and administrators are making decisions often derived from communist laws.
The Evrons launched their first legal case in 1992, spurred by promises from politicians like former president Lech Walesa that restitution would be handled quickly.
The couple want to recover property from the government, which took ownership under communism.
In the 1990s, the government sold the residential building they once owned to an individual who turned it into a shopping mall, despite the Evrons' offers to purchase the property, thus complicating matters further.
Appeals by the new owner lengthened the process even further. While many courts have ruled in favor of the Evrons over almost three decades, the couple have received nothing.
They have probably spent more money on the legal case than the value of the assets themselves.
""I can show you the full cabinet of correspondence and documents related to this issue and unfortunately it's going nowhere,"" Evron said.
SOCIAL ATTITUDES
Lawyers told Reuters that it is getting more difficult for Holocaust survivors to get restitution as the government refuses to simplify the rules and courts grow more skeptical.
Social attitudes have also shifted.
Soon after the fall of communism, many Poles accepted that property taken by the Nazis, and then the communists, should be returned to its rightful owners. But many now feel it is unfair to expect the government to reimburse everybody.
History also plays a role.
Communist authorities praised the Poles' behavior during the war, but research since 1989 showed that while thousands risked their lives to help the Jews, thousands more participated in the Holocaust.
Many Poles refuse to accept that, and the government is pushing back against claims of wartime misconduct, saying the West does not appreciate Poland's bravery under the Nazis.
In June, Poland's President Andrzej Duda told Reuters anti-Semitic and anti-Polish sentiments were comparable. ""[The Nazis] destroyed the Jews as a nation, but they also destroyed us as a nation,"" Duda said.
An opinion poll last year showed more Poles were against restitution than for. That has made some courts and administrators more stringent about restitution, lawyers said.  
Robert Winnicki, leader of Poland's right-wing Confederation grouping, said U.S. legislation intended to exert pressure for restitution is the work of Jewish groups aiming ""to cash in on large amounts of money that they don't deserve"".
Lawyers meanwhile call for legislation to speed up restitution for ageing Holocaust survivors.
Lea Evron has her doubts. ""I don’t want to hope because I don't believe that they will return anything."" "

YANGON (Reuters) - In a muddy field in western Myanmar, hundreds of Chinese shipping containers fitted with single narrow windows stand in neat lines, empty of the refugees they were designed to host.
The gray boxes were sent by China two years ago as quick and cheap housing for some of the hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims who fled Myanmar for Bangladesh during a military-led crackdown in 2017 that the United Nations said was conducted with genocidal intent.
The empty containers, situated near the town of Maungdaw in Rakhine state, reflect months of failed efforts to entice the Rohingya to return to Myanmar despite a diplomatic drive by the country's close ally and neighbor, China.
In a sharp departure from its official policy of non-interference in the affairs of other countries, China has positioned itself as the key mediator in resolving the protracted crisis. But like the Indonesian and United Nations envoys who previously attempted to mediate between the parties, China is finding the business of diplomacy tough going, with little signs that the crisis will soon be resolved.
The main sticking point is a disagreement over whether the refugees will be safe in Myanmar.
Myanmar says it has created safe conditions for the Rohingya's return, but Bangladesh and the United Nations say that fighting in Rakhine and a lack of human rights guarantees make a return for the refugees dangerous. The Rohingya, meanwhile, say they will not go back without guarantees of rights they are currently denied, including citizenship and freedom of movement.
Over the past two years, Chinese officials have brokered three meetings between leaders of the two countries, made multiple visits to the sprawling refugee camps housing the Rohingya in Bangladesh, hired cattle trucks to bring returnees home and even offered cash inducements, all to no avail.
Still, China says it has made progress, even if only a few hundred Rohingya have returned home so far.
The issue received fresh attention when President Xi Jinping traveled to Myanmar on Friday for a two-day state visit. In a joint statement from both countries published after the visit, China reaffirmed its willingness to continue to mediate, while Myanmar thanked China for ""its understanding of the Rakhine problem, its difficulty and complications"".
The main focus of Xi's visit was the massive Chinese infrastructure projects, including a controversial hydropower dam and a deep-sea port in Rakhine, that make Myanmar a vital link in his flagship Belt and Road Initiative aimed at expanding trade links across the world.
The two countries signed dozens of deals covering trade and infrastructure, with Myanmar agreeing to speed up implementation.
Western Myanmar, sitting between booming India and Southeast Asia, is strategically important to Beijing, offering China's landlocked western provinces potential port access to the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal.
""We have facilitated and hosted three foreign minister meetings between China, Myanmar, and Bangladesh to work for an early repatriation,"" Luo Zhaohui, China's vice foreign minister told reporters on Jan. 10 in a press conference ahead of Xi's trip. ""Our efforts have paid off,"" he said.
But Bangladeshi officials, Western diplomats in Yangon, and security analysts say that China is mainly concerned with shoring up its key interests in Rakhine.
In discussions with the Bangladesh government, Chinese officials emphasize the importance of developing the state rather than resolving human rights issues, according to a Bangladeshi official familiar with the discussions.
""China wants to resolve the crisis,"" said another Bangladeshi official. ""At least, they want to start repatriation as early as possible. But they are not doing enough to oblige Myanmar to create a conducive environment for them to return.""
U.N. officials and diplomats in Yangon also say that China's efforts to broker a quick solution ignores the human rights concerns.
""Their approach is wildly simplistic,"" said one Yangon-based diplomat. ""What we hear is China has been pushing Myanmar and Bangladesh to just get it done. What does that mean when the conditions aren't there?""
China's Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
The Myanmar government, responding to questions from Reuters, defended the Chinese efforts.
Ko Ko Naing, a Myanmar official at the Ministry of Social Welfare, said China had been ""helping continuously"", citing its development efforts in Rakhine.
""The lack of development is more important than social cohesion,"" he said. ""We are doing many investments there. The roads are better.""
UNCERTAIN RETURN
While more than 730,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh in 2017, hundreds of thousands are still in Myanmar, confined to camps and villages where they are denied access to healthcare and education.
Fresh fighting between government troops and an ethnic armed group comprised mostly of majority Rakhine Buddhists has also displaced tens of thousands of people.
Despite the concerns over the security situation in Rakhine, China's position is that Myanmar is ready to take back the refugees.
It is also advocating resolving the issue through bilateral talks between Myanmar and Bangladesh, and minimizing the role of parties like the United Nations, which runs the refugee camps, officials from both Myanmar and Bangladeshi told Reuters.
China has presented its diplomatic work in Myanmar and Bangladesh as humanitarian, but analysts and diplomats in Yangon say those efforts have broader geopolitical aims.
""I'd say that China is not involved in the Rohingya crisis for humanitarian reasons, but for political and economic considerations,"" said Yun Sun, co-director of the East Asia program at the Stimson Center in Washington.
""China would like to be the new peacemaker in the region,"" she said, adding that China wanted to show how its approach to resolving the crisis could succeed where Western powers had failed. ""It's a competition for leadership.""
Nowkhim, a refugee leader in Kutapalong, one of the camps in Bangladesh, said the general perception among the Rohingya was that China was merely pressing Myanmar's official line and was unwilling to push it to accept their demands.
A video from a meeting between refugee leaders and Chinese diplomats, which was seen by Reuters, shows a Chinese official saying that the Rohingya should drop demands such as the right to be recognized as an ethnic group in Myanmar.
Myanmar's position is that the Rohingya are Muslim migrants from the Indian sub-continent and not one of the country's ethnic groups – which would technically grant them citizenship.
""They are not willing to solve our problem easily,"" said Nowkhim. ""They are just showing the world that 'we meet with Rohingya'.""
FAILED EFFORTS
Beijing's last major effort to kickstart repatriation was in August after Myanmar compiled a list of 3,000 Rohingya approved for return. But that effort failed after hundreds of the refugees on the list went into hiding to avoid being sent back.
Standing in one of the refugee camps in Bangladesh at the time, a Chinese diplomat said that someone needed to make the first move to send the Rohingya back.
Myanmar officials waited on the other side of the border, but not a single refugee volunteered to return. Only about 400 refugees have since returned separately, according to Myanmar authorities. Rohingya leaders say that most of returnees are those with close ties to the Myanmar government.
Myanmar has also rebuffed some of China's efforts, last year rejecting a proposal that refugees be allowed to visit Rakhine to assess conditions.
A local businessman tasked with assembling the donated containers, who asked not to be named, said he saw little point in continuing with his work.
""People haven't stayed in the houses for two years,"" he said. ""I will stop building this year,"" he added.
""The situation has not changed, right?"""
625,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 04:52AM ET</span>",Taiwan's China-friendly opposition seeks makeover after election drubbing,"By Felice Wu and Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Driven out of China after losing a civil war, Taiwan's main opposition party faces another crisis following an election drubbing this month, seeking to re-invent itself and rethink its unpopular policy of trying to accommodate Beijing.
The Kuomintang, which ruled all of China until forced to flee to Taiwan in 1949, soundly lost both the presidential and parliamentary elections to the Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), whose promises to stand up to China's threats contrasted with its own platform to be more conciliatory toward Beijing.
China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be taken by force if needed, with President Xi Jinping last year once again proposing a ""one country, two systems"" model for the island, only to be denounced by both the DPP and Kuomintang.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen won re-election by a landslide by positioning Taiwan as an independent country staunchly defending its democratic system against autocratic China.
Kuomintang chairman Wu Den-yih resigned in the aftermath of the defeat, and the party will vote for a new leader in early March.
But it is riven by disagreement over what its policy toward China should be, especially as many people, particularly the young, increasingly identify themselves as Taiwanese, with little connection to China, or even reason to be nice to it.
During campaigning the Kuomintang proposed returning to the ""92 consensus"", a vague deal it struck with the Chinese Communist Party in 1992, by which both agreed there is but one China, though each can have its own interpretation of the term.
The DPP used that proposal to drive home a message that the Kuomintang wanted to sell out the island to the Communist Party. The Kuomintang emphatically denied that.
""Everybody is clueless now, because the '92 consensus' is the bedrock for all of us. If we don't use it, then what?"" Allen Tien, head of Kuomintang's Youth League, told Reuters.
""In comparison, 'Resisting China and protecting Taiwan' is a fancier slogan. We need to get a new name for the '92 consensus'.""
Beijing insists the '92 consensus' must be the basis for any talks with Taiwan.
OTHER PROBLEMS AHEAD
There is no obvious new leader, though possible candidates include Eric Chu, who stood unsuccessfully for the presidency in 2016, and Sean Lien, the U.S.-educated son of a former vice president.
The party needs a ""collective leadership"", Lien said last week. Chu has not commented.
Some are taking a more direct approach to the party's problems.
A group of Kuomintang members, including some lawmakers, launched a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page over the weekend to canvass ideas from the public toward a China policy, saying the party had never denied China was a threat to Taiwan.
""The crux lies in what is the best choice for the attitude Taiwan takes to face mainland China,"" the group said in a statement, adding that close trade ties between the two, as well as a shared language and culture, offered Taiwan an opportunity.
Adding to the gloom, the Kuomintang's presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu could face removal from his position as mayor of the southern city of Kaohsiung.
He is the target of a petition seeking a recall vote, which could happen this summer, if approved by Taiwan's election commission. Han says he will respect the will of the public.
There have even been suggestions that the party drop the China reference in its name, which translates literally as Chinese Nationalist Party, though for now that looks unlikely.
""Everybody knows we need to change,"" Hsu Chiao-hsin, a Kuomintang city councilor in Taipei, told Reuters, referring to the party's China policy. ""But we should not make ourselves unrecognizable."""
626,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 04:52AM ET</span>","Masks on, Chinese start holiday travels as alarm mounts over mystery virus","By Huizhong Wu and Sophie Yu
BEIJING (Reuters) - Bundled up in winter clothes as they head home for the Lunar New Year holiday amid a health scare over a mystery new virus, Chinese travelers on the teeming concourse of Beijing West station were evenly split between the masked and the barefaced.
Covering up was clearly the best decision for many of the passengers waiting to board the packed train carriages for the 5-1/2 hour journey to Wuhan, the epicenter of an outbreak that has sent shivers through the world's most populous country.
Going back to her hometown, 28-year-old Tan Jie has been ribbed at work about the danger of contracting the new coronavirus, but the blue surgical mask on her face shows she is taking the risk seriously.
""My Beijing colleagues joked and said 'when you come back to work, we'll have to quarantine you for two weeks,'"" Tan said, trying to make light of the dampener the scare has put on the most important holiday for Chinese families.
So far three people have died, and authorities globally have counted more than 200 reported cases. On Monday, China confirmed the first cases in the country outside Wuhan, in Beijing and the southern city of Shenzhen, across the border from Hong Kong.
Liao Guang and her husband are looking forward to being reunited with their two-year-old child in Yichang, a city in the same province as Wuhan, and rushed to buy masks before traveling, as alarm spread on social media after the number of confirmed cases tripled over the weekend.
""All the trending items were about this pneumonia outbreak, so I thought we should buy a mask and take some kind of a preventative measure,"" said Liao, a petite 26-year-old, trailing a wheelie bag.
""I think during this (holiday), we're not going to go out too much, and probably won't go to places with a lot of people, like the movie theater.""
BAREFACED SHAME
Little remains known about the virus, including its source, how easily it can spread, or its severity, though some experts say it is less deadly than the earlier Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) virus, which killed nearly 800 people in 37 countries after an outbreak in southern China in 2002-2003.
Symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, like many other respiratory diseases. While it is unclear whether masks provide effective protection, for people with no other information they are the most obvious precaution.
Drug stores in Wuhan reported mask sales have surged.
""Today we've sold out all the single-use masks, and I need to prepare for tomorrow's supply,"" said a worker at a branch of Beike Drug Store. ""Demand has surged ten times compared with before the disease broke out.""
Beijing has said the outbreak is controllable and vowed to step up efforts to prevent its spread ahead of the holidays, which begin late this week, when hundreds of millions of Chinese will be travel domestically and abroad.
At Beijing West railway station the number of people wearing masks was pretty well matched by those without anything covering their faces, and there were no visible infrared temperature cameras for detecting elevated body temperatures.
The outbreak, as well as disclosures from local governments about patients under quarantine pending a confirmed diagnosis, were among the top trending topics on social media platforms Monday. Some users expressed anger at a lack of clear guidance from authorities on precautions that could be taken.
""I have to search on Weibo by myself for all the new developments - no notice from schools, companies or the compound where I live,"" one user of Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, complained.
Another took aim as people going without masks for not taking the outbreak seriously.
""So ignorant, so fearless, so arrogant,"" another user said."
627,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 20, 2020 03:43AM ET</span>",North Korea's Kim taps tough-talking military veteran as foreign minister,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's new foreign minister is a former defense commander with little diplomatic experience, spotlighting leader Kim Jong Un's reliance on party and military loyalists at a sensitive time amid stalled U.S. talks, analysts in Seoul said on Monday.
Last week, North Korea told countries with embassies in Pyongyang that Ri Son Gwon, a senior military officer and official of the ruling Workers' Party, had been appointed foreign minister, a diplomatic source in Seoul told Reuters.
He replaces Ri Yong Ho, a career diplomat with years of experience negotiating with Washington, but who often took a backseat to other officials during the last two years of diplomacy.
Seoul-based NK News first reported the change on Saturday, citing unnamed sources in Pyongyang.
Analysts said it was too soon to tell exactly what impact the appointment may have for the stalled denuclearisation talks with the United States, but said Ri Son Gwon had often played a confrontational role in negotiations with South Korea.
Unlike his predecessor, Ri Son Gwon does not have any experience in dealing with nuclear issues or U.S. officials, though he has led high-level talks between the neighbors.
Previously chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country (CPRC), which handles relations with South Korea, Ri is the latest military official to be promoted to the party leadership.
""There has been a demonstrative crossover dynamic in which senior military officials migrate into the party leadership,"" said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre, a U.S. think tank.
As the young North Korean leader oversaw a number of short-range ballistic missile launches in the past year, the number of military and arms industry officials appearing in public with Kim Jong Un has increased sharply.
Ri had largely stayed out of the public eye since talks with South Korea stalled last year. But in April he was named to the foreign affairs panel of the Supreme People's Assembly, the country's parliament, and was most recently seen at a meeting of the party's policy-making central committee in December.
A tough, hawkish negotiator, Ri ""stormed out of the room"" during military talks with South Korea in 2014 when Seoul demanded an apology for what it saw as the North's past military provocations, a former South Korean official who met him said.
Ri was also known as a right-hand man of Kim Yong Chol, another former military leader who took up a top party post before steering nuclear talks with the United States.
POWER SHIFTS
After the failed Hanoi summit with U.S. President Donald Trump, Kim Yong Chol faded from public view as Kim Jong Un elevated diplomats versed in U.S. relations, including Ri Yong Ho's deputy Choe Son Hui.
But Kim Yong Chol seemed to retain influence behind the scenes, while the role of Ri Yong Ho gradually withered, as working-level talks with the United States also collapsed in October and Washington ignored a year-end deadline to resume negotiations.
Ri Yong Ho's absence from a group photograph of top party executives at the December meeting prompted speculation about his future.
""Ri Yong Ho is the official who was effectively sidelined after the Hanoi meetings and was removed from office because the interlocutors selected by the foreign ministry appeared not to accomplish anything,"" Madden said.
As Ri Son Gwon becomes foreign minister, deputy Choe is expected to retain an influential position, thanks in part to her family background and personal rapport with an inner circle of women close to Kim Jong Un, including his sister and wife, diplomatic sources say.
""What's most important is what Kim Jong Un thinks, and he needs someone he can trust to speak for him, whether it be Ri Son Gwon or Choe Son Hui,"" said Kim Hong-kyun, a former South Korean nuclear negotiator."

In Baghdad's Tayaran Square (NYSE:SQ) overnight, protesters threw petrol bombs and stones at police who responded with tear gas and stun grenades, Reuters witnesses said.
Elsewhere in southern Iraq, hundreds of protesters burned tyres and blocked main roads in several cities, including Nassiriya, Kerbala and Amara. They say Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi has not fulfilled promises including naming a new government acceptable to Iraqis.
""They (security forces) should stop shooting and aiming, who are they and who we are? Both sides are Iraqis. So why are you killing your brothers?"" said one woman protester in Baghdad who declined to give her name.
Baghdad police said its forces had successfully reopened all the roads that were closed by ""violent gatherings"".
Mass protests have gripped Iraq since Oct. 1, with mostly young protesters demanding an overhaul of a political system they see as profoundly corrupt and as keeping most Iraqis in poverty. More than 450 people have been killed.
Numbers had dwindled but protests resumed last week as demonstrators sought to keep up momentum after attention turned to the threat of a U.S.-Iran conflict following Washington's killing of Tehran's top general in an air strike inside Iraq.
The killing of Qassem Soleimani, to which Tehran responded with a ballistic missile attack on two Iraqi military bases, has highlighted the influence of some foreign powers in Iraq, especially Iran and the United States."

The comment comes after South Korean President Moon Jae-in last week proposed the two countries work together to resolve the issue of wartime forced laborers, and called Japan ""our closest neighbor."" 
It also follows some fence-mending steps in recent months, including Seoul's reversal of its decision to scrap an intelligence-sharing pact with Japan, and Tokyo's partial easing of curbs on the export of high-tech materials to South Korea.
""Under an increasingly severe security environment in Northeast Asia, diplomacy with neighboring countries is extremely important,"" Abe told parliament in his policy speech.
""Essentially, South Korea is the most important neighbor with which Japan shares basic values and strategic interests.""
In a parliamentary speech in October, Abe simply referred to South Korea as an ""important neighbor.""
But Abe and Moon met in China in December and stressed the need to improve ties, officials from both sides said.
Also, Moon told a news conference last week South Korea would actively cooperate for the success of this year's Olympic Games in Japan, and that he hoped the sporting event would provide a good opportunity to fundamentally improve ties. 
Relations between Japan and South Korea, two of the United States' major Asian allies, plunged to their lowest in decades after South Korea's top court ordered Japanese firms in 2018 to compensate some wartime forced laborers.
Japan says the matter was settled by a 1965 treaty that normalized bilateral relations following Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean peninsula.
""I sincerely hope South Korea honors the commitments between the two counties and works toward building future-oriented relations,"" Abe said in his Monday speech, reiterating that the onus is on Seoul to put ties back on an even keel.
By adopting a warmer tone toward its neighbor while making it clear that the ball is in Seoul's court, Abe's message was meant to encourage South Korea to take fresh steps to resolve the issue, said Narushige Michishita, vice president of Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies.

""If South Korea realizes that Japan is resolved to maintain the firm stance, that will give them an incentive to buckle down and decide what they should do now,"" Michishita said.

Earthquakes were still happening at the Taal volcano, which shot giant clouds of ash miles into the air on Jan. 12, and levels of the gas were rising, a sign of magma ""recharging"" and ""resupplying"" beneath it, a Philippine vulcanologist said.
""If it reaches the crater, it could cause a strong explosion,"" Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), told DZMM radio.
Authorities have thrown a 14-km (9-mile) exclusion zone around the volcano, with experts saying an eruption could bring a devastating rain of rocks and magma and unleash a tsunami in the lake around it.
Several establishments reopened last week in the tourist resort of Tagaytay after the volcano, 70 km (45 miles) from the capital, Manila, had shown signs of calming, but authorities urged them to heed orders to close.
""We asked them to cease operations so no tourists or locals would be lured to that area,"" Epimaco Densing, an undersecretary of the interior ministry, told reporters.

Just 311 meters (1,020 feet) high, Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes, but it can be deadly, having killed more than 1,300 people in an eruption in 1911.
More than 100,000 people have abandoned homes around the volcano and flocked to evacuation centers after it blanketed homes, schools, and farms with ash.
The education ministry said it was ready to send teachers to run classes for more than 1 million students in nearby towns after displaced people had to be accommodated in some schools.
No deaths have been reported and the volcano's impact has proved just a blip for the $330-billion national economy, despite canceled flights and a day of work lost on Jan. 12 because of a heavy fall of ash in Manila.
Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, most recently in 1977. The Philippines lies on the ""Ring of Fire"", a belt of volcanoes girdling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes."

The Daxing health commission in the capital Beijing said it had confirmed two cases of coronavirus, while the southern Guangdong province's health commission confirmed one case in Shenzhen. They mark the first cases in China beyond the central city of Wuhan where the virus first emerged.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said 136 new cases of pneumonia caused by the coronavirus strain had been found in the city over the weekend, adding to 62 already known cases. A third death occurred on Saturday, the authority said in a statement.
This brings the total number of known cases worldwide to more than 200, underscoring the challenge for health authorities seeking to contain the outbreak. South Korea on Monday reported its first confirmed case of the coronavirus, a 35-year-old female Chinese national who had traveled from Wuhan, the fourth patient to be reported outside China.
Hundreds of millions of Chinese tourists will be traveling domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year holiday period that starts later this week.
A report by London Imperial College's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms. Chinese health authorities have not commented directly on the report.
CONTAINMENT EFFORTS
Authorities around the globe, including in the United States and many Asian countries, have stepped up screening of travelers from Wuhan. Last week, two cases were reported in Thailand and one in Japan. All three involved people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city.
The virus belongs to the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China.
Its symptoms include fever and difficulty in breathing, which are similar to many other respiratory diseases and pose complications for screening efforts.
China's National Health Commission said on Sunday it will step up prevention efforts, but acknowledged it still doesn't know the source of the virus.
Shares in pharmaceutical firms and mask makers in China surged Monday because of the outbreak.
The outbreak was one of the top trending topics on Chinese social media platform Weibo, where many users expressed concerns about their safety.
""Who knows how many people who have been to Wuhan may be unaware that they have already been infected?,"" one user said.
China's Global Times, published by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily newspaper, said in an editorial the government needs to disclose all information and not repeat the mistakes made with SARS. Chinese officials covered up the SARS outbreak for weeks before a growing death toll and rumors forced it to reveal the epidemic.
""Concealment would be a serious blow to the government's credibility and might trigger greater social panic,"" the editorial said."

LANGKAWI, Malaysia (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Monday his ruling coalition could be a one-term government if it does not make changes and stop infighting.
Mahathir led the Pakatan Harapan coalition, or Alliance of Hope, to a spectacular victory in a general election in May 2018, joining hands with former foes to end the 61-year rule of the Barisan Nasional coalition.
But Mahathir's coalition has lost five by-elections since then, including one over the weekend, and polls have shown waning popularity among the public. 
""We have lost five by-elections but they still don't understand,"" Mahathir told reporters at a meeting in Langkawi, a resort island off the western coast of Malaysia. 
""I told them in a democracy you need strong support from the people. But instead they fight amongst themselves and divide the people... They are not going to win unless they change their ways,"" he said.
Mahathir's four-party coalition came to power on promises of reforms and widespread disgust over corruption. Former premier Najib Razak, who was defeated by Mahathir, was caught in the middle of a multi-billion dollar corruption scandal at state fund 1MDB. Najib is currently on trial for corruption. 
Nearly two years since the unexpected win, the government has been increasingly criticized for failing to deliver promised reforms on governance and human rights quickly and to protect the rights of the majority ethnic Malays.
There has also been uncertainty over Mahathir's promised handover of power to his coalition partner Anwar Ibrahim. 
Mahathir had said he would hand over the premiership to his former foe Anwar two years after winning the 2018 elections. But doubts have grown after Mahathir said he needed more time to steer the heavily-indebted country out of its troubles first. 
The 94-year-old premier reiterated on Monday he would give way to Anwar after November, when Kuala Lumpur will host world leaders for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit, and before the coalition's five-year term is completed in 2023.
But he again declined to commit to a specific timeline.
""When the time comes, I feel that I have done all I can, I will step down,"" he said.
He added Anwar will need the support of the majority of the parliament to become the prime minister. 
Mahathir was Malaysia's longest serving prime minister from 1981 to 2003, when he retired from politics. In 2018 when he again won office he became the world's oldest leader aged 92.

On Monday, the premier also said Malaysia will not take retaliatory trade action against India over its boycott of palm oil purchases amid a political row between the two countries, adding Kuala Lumpur will find ""ways and means"" to resolve the issue.

U.s. President Donald Trump has threatened to punish Mexico and Central American countries economically if they fail to curb migrant flows, resulting in a series of agreements aimed at taking pressure off the United States in absorbing the numbers.
Migrants crossed into Mexico in small groups during the weekend after Mexican security officials blocked an effort by some Central Americans to force their way through the border.
The bulk of at least 2,000 migrants remained in the Guatemalan border town of Tecun Uman planning to set off for Mexico en masse early on Monday, believing that they stood a better chance of making progress in a large caravan.
Mexico has offered migrants work in the south, but those who do not accept it or seek asylum will not be issued safe conduct passes to the United States, the interior ministry said.
The ministry said in a statement on Sunday afternoon that Mexican authorities had received nearly 1,100 migrants in the states of Chiapas and Tabasco and set out various options to them in accordance with their migration status.
""However, in the majority of cases, once the particular migration situation has been reviewed, assisted returns will be carried out to their countries of origin, assuming that their situation warrants it,"" the ministry said.
According to Guatemala, at least 4,000 people have entered from Honduras since Wednesday, making for one of the biggest surges since three Central American governments signed agreements with the Trump administration obliging them to assume more of the responsibility for dealing with migrants.
Mexico has so far controlled the border at Tecun Uman more successfully than in late 2018, when a large caravan of migrants sought to break through there. Many later crossed into Mexico via the Suchiate River dividing the two countries."

Seventeen people were rescued at the site of Sunday's collapse in the province of Bengkulu, where Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency has launched a rescue effort, its spokesman, Agus Wibowo, said.
A crowd of about 30 people, mostly students, gathered on the bridge could have caused a strain leading to the collapse, Wibowo told Reuters.
""They were watching the floods in the river below and then the bridge snapped, so they fell into the overflowing river,"" he added.
A strong current in the river had swept away the victims, drowning them, regional disaster official Ujang Syafiri said in comments to state news agency Antara, adding that the bridge was mostly used by farmers living nearby.
""Since last night, the regional disaster mitigation agency, the military, the police, related organizations, and volunteers had been searching for the missing,"" Wibowo said in a statement on Monday."

Ventus Lau was arrested on Sunday evening on charges of ""obstruction of police administration"" and violating terms set when permission was granted for the protest, the Hong Kong Civil Assembly Team said in a statement. 
The organizers initially applied for a permit - known as a letter of no objection - for a march, but the police only agreed to a static rally in a park in the city's Central district.
But as the crowds swelled and spilled onto surrounding streets, some protesters briefly barricaded roads with umbrellas, traffic cones and other street furniture and dug up bricks from the pavement. 
Police then ordered a halt to the protest and began dispersing the crowd.
""It was primarily rioters' violent acts which led to the suspension of the gathering,"" Senior Superintendent Ng Lok-chun told reporters.
""The organizer has violated the agreements set in the no objection letter, failed to assist in maintaining the order in the public gathering event, that is why we have arrested Mr. Lau.""
Police said two community liaison officers were attacked with wooden sticks and sustained head injuries. They also said some protesters threw water bottles at officers conducting a 'stop and search' operation.
In a statement late on Sunday, the government said it ""strongly condemns"" the attack on the police officers.
The ""Universal Siege Against Communism"" demonstration was the latest in a relentless series of anti-government protests since June, when Hong Kongers took to the streets to voice their anger over a now-withdrawn extradition bill.

Organizers said 150,000 attended the demonstration, while police estimated a crowd of 11,680 at its peak.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - The world's richest 2,153 people controlled more money than the poorest 4.6 billion combined in 2019, while unpaid or underpaid work by women and girls adds three times more to the global economy each year than the technology industry, Oxfam said on Monday.
The Nairobi-headquartered charity said in a report released ahead of the annual World Economic Forum of political and business leaders in Davos, Switzerland, that women around the world work 12.5 billion hours combined each day without pay or recognition.
In its ""Time to Care"" report, Oxfam said it estimated that unpaid care work by women added at least $10.8 trillion a year in value to the world economy - three times more than the tech industry.
""It is important for us to underscore that the hidden engine of the economy that we see is really the unpaid care work of women. And that needs to change,"" Amitabh Behar, CEO of Oxfam India, told Reuters in an interview.
To highlight the level of inequality in the global economy, Behar cited the case of a woman called Buchu Devi in India who spends 16 to 17 hours a day doing work like fetching water after trekking 3km, cooking, preparing her children for school and working in a poorly paid job.
""And on the one hand you see the billionaires who are all assembling at Davos with their personal planes, personal jets, super rich lifestyles,"" he said.
""This Buchu Devi is not one person. I in India encounter these women on a daily basis, and this is the story across the world. We need to change this, and certainly end this billionaire boom.""
Behar said that to remedy this, governments should make sure above all that the rich pay their taxes, which should then be used to pay for amenities such as clean water, healthcare and better quality schools.
""If you just look around the world, more than 30 countries are seeing protests. People are on the street and what are they saying? - That they are not to accept this inequality, they are not going to live with these kind of conditions,"" he said."

Speaking at a news conference in Buenos Aires, Morales named his former economy minister Luis Arce Catacora as the Movement to Socialism's (MAS) presidential candidate, with former foreign minister David Choquehuanca as his running mate.
Morales unveiled the ticket after meeting at the weekend with senior MAS party officials who traveled to the Argentine capital, where Morales is living after accepting an offer of asylum. He is barred from running for president again.
The names differed from a ticket announced on Friday by MAS officials in La Paz, which had Choquehuanca, an Aymara Indian, as the party's presidential candidate.
At the time, a party official said the ticket - including Morales disciple and coca farmer Andronico Rodriguez as vice presidential candidate - was the result of party consensus.
But later on Friday Morales wrote on Twitter that the pair were just ""pre-candidates"" along with two of his close allies: Catacora and another former foreign minister, Diego Pary Rodriguez.
""Soon we will return to Bolivia to join this campaign fight,"" Morales said at the press conference.
""I want to tell everyone I have a political project of liberation, not only to Bolivians but the whole world... that another world without capitalism is possible.""
Morales, Bolivia's first indigenous president, resigned on Nov. 10 after a disputed election victory in October sparked protests and an Organization of American States audit found serious irregularities in the vote count.

RICHMOND, Virginia (Reuters) - The top Republican in Virginia's lower house said that any group planning to incite violence at a large gun rights rally on Monday in Richmond should stay home, while far-right leaders of militias planning to attend swore they were coming in peace.
Richmond was braced on Sunday for the rally, aimed at showing gun enthusiasts' disdain for swift moves the newly Democrat-controlled legislature is making to pass stiffer gun laws - and many residents feared a repeat of violence seen at a white supremacist rally in nearby Charlottesville in 2017.
But several militia leaders with large followings on social media who attended that Charlottesville rally said they were coming purely to show their support for those opposed to new, more restrictive gun laws in the state. 
""If you think that we're a threat coming into your city, then you don't know who we are, you don't understand what we're about,"" said Joshua Shoaff, who has over 542,000 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) followers and goes by the pseudonym Ace Baker. ""We're not anarchists - we believe in government."" 
Other leaders of well-known militias also vowed they were not seeking confrontations in Richmond. But police warned that among those they know to be attending are known neo-Nazis and other groups who may seek to hijack the gun-rights gathering. 
Authorities say they are expecting several thousand people and are trying to keep the event from becoming violent.
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam this week temporarily banned all weapons from the area around the Capitol ahead of the demonstration.
Todd Gilbert, the Republican leader in Virginia's House of Delegates, said in a statement on Saturday that violence was not welcome during Monday's rally.
""Any group that comes to Richmond to spread white supremacist garbage, or any other form of hate, violence, or civil unrest isn't welcome here,"" he said. ""While we and our Democratic colleagues may have differences, we are all Virginians and we will stand united in opposition to any threats of violence or civil unrest from any quarter.""
Monday's rally is being organized by the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a pro-gun rights group that annually comes out in force to lobby Virginia's legislature to not pass any new gun laws. 
The group is working closely with police, according to law enforcement officials, in an effort to pull off a smooth event - but they have called for tens of thousands of armed citizens to come to the event, hiking tensions.
President Donald Trump backed the rally organizers in a Twitter post on Friday in which he said the U.S. Constitution was under attack by recent gun control measures in Virginia, a state that Hilary Clinton won in 2016 and where Democrats took full control of the state legislature for the first time in a generation in November.
""Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia,"" Trump wrote in the post, referring to the amendment in the Bill of Rights that gives Americans the right to keep and bear firearms. ""That's what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away.""
The Virginia Senate late on Thursday passed bills to require background checks on all firearms sales, limit handgun purchases to one a month, and restore local governments' right to ban weapons from public buildings and other venues. 

Both Virginia legislative houses are also expected to pass ""red flag"" laws that would allow courts and local law enforcement to remove guns from people deemed a risk to communities, among other measures.

642,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2020 04:31PM ET</span>",Migrant caravan gathers on Guatemala border to enter Mexico en masse,"By Roberto Ramirez
TECUN UMAN (Reuters) - Hundreds of Central Americans gathered on the Guatemala-Mexico border on Sunday, aiming to cross en masse early on Monday in what could prove a stiff test of the Mexican government's pledge to satisfy U.S. demands to curb migrant flows.
President Donald Trump has threatened to hurt Mexico and Central American countries economically if they allow large numbers to reach the U.S. border. U.S. border agents have tracked the latest exodus from Honduras this week.
Small groups of migrants crossed the bridge from Tecun Uman, Guatemala, to Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico, on Saturday after Mexican National Guardsmen repelled an attempt by some of the Central Americans to force their way through the border gates.
Afterwards, most of the migrants withdrew to Tecun Uman to await the arrival of more travelers behind them in the hope they stand a better chance of progressing in one caravan.
""We've been getting organized,"" said Jose Luis Cruz, a 33-year-old autoworker from Comayagua, Honduras, who left behind a wife and two children in a bid to reach the United States.
Cruz said migrants waiting in Tecun Uman wanted to try and enter Mexico en masse at around 5 a.m. on Monday, hoping that authorities would let them pass to avoid clashes.
""If we cross alone, they'll get us, and all the sacrifices we've made to get here will have been in vain,"" he added.
Guatemala's government says at least 4,000 people have entered from Honduras since Wednesday, making for one of the biggest surges since three Central American governments signed agreements with the Trump administration obliging them to assume more of the responsibility of dealing with migrants.
Tecun Uman's main migrant shelter quickly filled to capacity with 600 people, and another 1,300 broke their journey in a second, makeshift refuge, said local priest Alfredo Camarena.
Mexican authorities have so far controlled the border more successfully than in late 2018, when a large caravan of people sought to break through at the same crossing. Many later crossed into Mexico via the Suchiate River dividing the two countries.

Mexico has offered migrants work in the south, but those who do not accept it or seek asylum will not be issued safe conduct passes to the United States, the interior ministry said.

Sunday's confrontation broke out near parliament a day after more than 370 people were wounded, the biggest casualty toll since the protests against the ruling elite began.
Unrest in the capital this week has deepened the multi-faceted crisis sweeping Lebanon as it grapples with financial strains that have sunk the currency, pushed up prices and driven banks to impose capital controls.
Politicians have failed to agree on a government or an economic rescue plan since the protests pushed Saad al-Hariri to quit as prime minister in October.
""We have gone from being a country we used to call the Switzerland of the east to a country ranked at the bottom in everything,"" said housewife Rezzan Barraj, 47, at Sunday night's protest.
""It's clear that the more they (security forces) step up their violence, the more people's strength and determination grow."" 
A Reuters witness saw police fire rubber bullets. The Lebanese Red Cross said it treated 52 people and took 38 to hospital. 
Hundreds of people yelled ""revolution"" in the commercial district of the capital. Protesters pelted riot police with stones and fireworks. 
Some tried to climb over barbed wire and fencing to storm a heavily barricaded part of central Beirut that includes parliament. One man jabbed police with a pole across the barriers as the violence escalated.
Zeina Ibrahim, 37, an office manager, said protesters had faced violence from police and attacks from supporters of the sectarian, dominant parties. 
""Violence only breeds violence,"" she said. ""After all this time, all these months...I don't blame protesters at all if they move bit by bit towards violence.""
The Internal Security Forces (ISF) urged people to remain calm and said otherwise it would be forced to repel them. 
The interior and defense ministers and army and other security chiefs were set to meet at the presidential palace on Monday.
Human Rights Watch on Saturday called for an end to a ""culture of impunity for abuse"" by police, which it said fired tear gas canisters at some people's heads. 
Interior Minister Raya al-Hassan said people had the right to protest but it was unacceptable to ""blatantly assault"" security forces. 
Protesters have also turned their anger on the banks - which have curbed access to savings - with some smashing the facade of the banking association on Saturday night.
Hassan Diab, who was designated prime minister with the backing of Islamist movement Hezbollah and its allies last month, met with President Aoun on Sunday.

A senior political source told Reuters the government line-up would be finalised on Sunday, but Diab left without commenting as a cabinet deal remained elusive.

Yulia Galyamina, a Moscow city councillor, had urged people to take to the streets to speak out against Putin's proposed political changes by joining an authorized rally already due to be held to mark the murder of a journalist, Anastasia Baburova, and a lawyer, Stanislav Markelov, 11 years ago.
But many protesters did not heed her call and Sunday's event saw a smaller turnout than many previous opposition protests last summer, which at their peak drew around 60,000 people.
Sunday's protest was also made up of diverse groups with different political demands, including anti-fascists, women's rights campaigners, leftists and students, meaning the anti-Putin protest component was diluted.
Putin's proposed reforms, which triggered the resignation of the prime minister and government last week, are widely seen as giving Putin, 67, scope to extend his grip on power once he leaves the presidency in 2024. [nL8N29L2M9]
The changes would create new centers of power outside the presidency, and critics say that means Putin could be pulling the strings from behind the scenes for years to come.
Putin's plan has divided the anti-Kremlin opposition however, with some calling it ""an anti-constitutional coup"" and others, like prominent opposition politician Alexei Navalny, dismissing it as unimportant in the scheme of things and therefore not worth protesting over.
Galyamina, the Moscow city councillor, marched on Sunday holding copies of Russia's constitution which she said was imperiled by Putin's reforms.
""Putin leave office!,"" Galyamina and others shouted, saying his plan amounted to repressing the Russian people.
On Saturday, some Russians took turns to hold one-person pickets outside the presidential administration to express their disagreement with Putin's constitutional reforms.
The TASS news agency has also reported that authorities in Moscow have authorized a protest of up to 10,000 people against Putin's reforms on Feb. 1. It is unclear who the organizers are."

Canada's parliament is expected to approve soon.
Writing on Twitter shortly before midnight, Seade said Mexico should take steps to capitalize on the investment potential China offered, noting that his country's appeal to the Asian economy ""grew enormously"" with the USMCA deal.
Some Asian businesses wasted little time in committing investment to Mexico once the USMCA had passed U.S. Congress.

BOLOGNA, Italy (Reuters) - The ""Sardines"" grassroots movement protesting against the populism of far-right Italian leader Matteo Salvini staged a mass rally in the northern city of Bologna on Sunday ahead of a regional vote that could shake up national politics.
Salvini's resurgent League party and his rightist allies are looking to end almost 75 years of unbroken leftist rule in the well-to-do Emilia Romagna region in next Sunday's election, with latest polls putting the two camps neck and neck.
Alarmed at the rise of the anti-immigrant, anti-Europe League, a group of four friends created the Sardines movement in November to challenge Salvini's often abrasive message. It has earned its name by packing squares throughout the region and beyond with supporters.
They returned to the birthplace of their group on Sunday, staging a concert that organizers said had drawn between 35,000 and 40,000 people, many waving cut-out sardines. The police did not immediately provide their own crowd estimate.
""Salvini plays on people's fears, he is trying to turn us against newcomers, against foreigners. We mustn't let him win,"" said Cristina Camurani, 60, who was wearing a toy fish on her head. ""It would be a huge shock if the left lost here.""
Salvini has been crisscrossing Emilia Romagna for weeks, visiting more than 100 municipalities in a tireless drive to secure a shock victory that he hopes could cause Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's national government to fall.
'EVICTION ORDER'
In a rare political mistake, Salvini walked out of a ruling coalition with the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement last August, expecting his move to trigger early elections. Instead, the center-left Democratic Party (PD) took the League's place in government, leaving him to languish in opposition ranks.
He says victory on Jan. 26 in this once impregnable PD stronghold would show that the new coalition had no electoral legitimacy and should therefore stand aside.
""On January 27th ... with victory in my pocket, I will issue Conte with an eviction order,"" Salvini told thousands of supporters on Saturday in the nearby town of Maranello, home to Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) - a symbol of Italian engineering and sporting prowess.
Emilia Romagna is one of Italy's wealthiest regions with an unemployment rate of around 5%, half the national average. But despite its economic success, Salvini has tapped into concerns about security, immigration and high taxes.
""After 70 years of leftist-led administrations here, I say the time has come to release the energies (on the right) that have been compressed for too long,"" said local League politician Modesto Amicucci, who attended the Maranello rally.
Salvini has dragged his party from the edge of extinction six years ago to make it the biggest force in Italy. The Sardine leaders say they have no intention of becoming a political party and instead want to promote civility and counter populism.
""We have already chalked up our first victory,"" one of the Sardine founders, Mattia Santori, said on Sunday, arguing that his movement had helped lower political tensions by providing a good-natured outlet for Salvini's foes.
""Don't forget that just a few months ago, the political and social climate in Italy was very different to what it is now."""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - There are still no firm plans for downloading the cockpit and flight data from a Ukrainian airliner which was shot down by Iran 10 days ago, Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB) said on Sunday.
A total of 176 people died in the disaster, 57 of them Canadian citizens. Canada's government reiterated demands on Sunday that the boxes be sent to either France or Ukraine.
Iran is trying to analyze the black boxes, the state IRNA news agency reported on Sunday, denying a report that a decision had been taken to send the recorders to Ukraine.
The TSB said in a statement that two of its crash investigators had left Tehran earlier on Sunday after a six-day visit during which they examined the wreckage.
The TSB said it understood the boxes were still in Iran and added: ""There are still no firm plans as to when and where the aircraft recorders will be downloaded and analyzed"".
Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said he wrote to his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif on Sunday to urge the boxes be quickly sent to Ukraine or France.
""The wish of the international community is that the black boxes be sent where they should be sent ... to ensure we have proper technical expertise when (they) are opened,"" he said on the sidelines of a cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

The president, who critics accuse of undermining the rule of law in Honduras, added that his country would continue seeking support from international partners including the OAS, the United Nations, the European Union and others.
Lawmakers allied with Hernandez voted last year against retaining the MACCIH, which was formed in 2016.
On Friday, the foreign ministry said Honduras had failed to agree on a renewal of the MACCIH's mandate, noting there was concern in sectors of society that it had overreached its remit.
In response, the OAS said the Honduran government had not matched the MACCIH's commitment to tackling corruption.
The record of Hernandez, an ally of the United States, has come under increasing scrutiny in recent months.
Last year, a U.S. jury found his brother, Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, guilty of conspiring to import cocaine, illicit weapons possession and lying to U.S. authorities.
During the trial, witnesses alleged that Juan Orlando Hernandez pledged to protect his brother from extradition and called for bribes to secure power for himself and the ruling National Party. Hernandez denied the allegations.
Hernandez won a second term as president two years ago after an election the OAS said was marred by irregularities."

Mauricio Claver-Carone, a senior adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, said in an interview with Bolivian newspaper Pagina Siete that Morales was a ""headache"" for Argentina, which granted him asylum, at a time it should be focusing on other issues including its economic crisis and its relationship with the International Monetary Fund.
""(Morales) had sold himself like a caricature that was peaceful, but what we have seen is an Evo Morales who sponsors and fosters violence and wants to foster militias. We warned the Argentine government that this was going to happen. I warned then President-elect Alberto Fernandez before these events occurred,"" Claver-Carone said in the interview.
""I wish I had been wrong, but now Argentina is seeing the problem that Evo Morales means,"" he said.
A spokesperson for Fernandez, who was inaugurated on Dec. 10, did not immediately respond to request for comment.
Morales said on Jan. 13 that Bolivians had the right to organize and defend themselves, without firearms, from what he said were attacks by Bolivia's interim government, which he says took power in a coup late last year.
Days later, Morales retracted his call for the organization of militias after it prompted Bolivia's interim government to send a letter to Argentina asking that the government disavow his comments.
A spokesman for Argentina's Foreign Ministry declined to comment at the time on whether the government spoke to Morales about his comments.
Morales, a socialist leader who was at the helm of Bolivia for nearly 14 years, stepped down on Nov. 10 after a disputed election victory sparked protests and led to allies, the police and the military pulling their support. A caretaker government led by interim President Jeanine Anez then took control of the country.
After initially fleeing to Mexico, Morales arrived in Argentina after Fernandez's inauguration and has been living there under asylum.
Claver-Carone, who visited Bolivia earlier this week for meetings with Anez, also took aim at Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, saying he tried to destroy the country's armed forces to pave the way for armed militias in an act of ""gangsterism.""
""The same thing that Nicolas Maduro did with that gangsterism, is what Evo Morales tried here in Bolivia,"" Claver-Carone said.
Maduro claims the Trump administration has tried to precipitate a coup in Venezuela and has praised the armed forces for their loyalty.
Argentina's Fernandez faces a diplomatic juggling act between the United States, which has called for Maduro to step down as president, and leftist allies including Venezuela and Morales.
In December, Claver-Carone left Fernandez's inauguration events early, unhappy with the presence of Venezuelan officials from Maduro's government."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Police fired tear gas on Sunday to disperse thousands of anti-government protesters who gathered in a central Hong Kong park but later spilled onto the streets, briefly barricading roads and spray-painting buildings. 
Out in numbers before the demonstration began, police intervened promptly when the rally turned into an impromptu march. Several units of police in riot gear were seen chasing protesters and several arrests were made. 
A water cannon truck drove on central streets, flanked by an armored jeep, but was not used.
Organizers initially applied for a permit for a march, but police only agreed to a static rally in the park, saying previous marches have turned violent. 
Once protesters spilled onto the streets, some of them, wearing all-black clothing, barricaded the roads with umbrellas and street furniture, dug up bricks from the pavement and smashed traffic lights. 
Police said in a statement two police community liaison officers were attacked with wooden sticks and sustained head injuries. They also said some protesters threw water bottles at some other officers who were conducting a 'stop and search' operation.
""In view of the violent incidents, police officers have asked the organizer to halt the public meeting ... and urge participants to ... leave the area by public transport,"" the statement said.
The ""Universal Siege Against Communism"" demonstration was the latest in a relentless series of protests against the government since June, when Hong Kongers took to the streets to voice their anger over a now-withdrawn extradition bill.
The protests, which have since broadened to include demands for universal suffrage and an independent investigation into police handling of the demonstrations, had lost some of their intensity in recent weeks.
In an apparent new tactic, police have been showing up ahead of time in riot gear, with officers conducting ""stop and search"" operations near expected demonstrations. 
""Everyone understands that there’s a risk of stop-and-search or mass arrests. I appreciate Hong Kong people still come out courageously, despite the risk,” said organizer Ventus Lau.
On Jan 1, a march of tens of thousands of people ended with police firing tear gas to disperse crowds.
The gathering in the park was initially relaxed, with many families with children listening to speeches by activists. 
In one corner, a group of volunteers set up a stand where people could leave messages on red cards for the lunar new year to be sent to those who have been arrested. One read: “Hong Kongers won’t give up. The future belongs to the youth”.
Authorities in Hong Kong have arrested more than 7,000 people, many on charges of rioting that can carry jail terms of up to 10 years. It is unclear how many are still in custody.
Anger has grown over the months due to perceptions that Beijing was tightening its grip over the city, which was handed over to China by Britain in 1997 in an deal that ensured it enjoyed liberties unavailable in the mainland.

Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest.

656,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2020 10:54AM ET</span>","Iran aims to examine downed plane's black boxes, no plan yet to send them abroad","By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Sunday it was trying to analyze the black boxes of a Ukrainian airliner that its military shot down this month, denying a report that a decision had been taken to send the voice and flight data recorders to Ukraine.
Canada, which had 57 citizens on the Jan. 8 flight in which all 176 aboard were killed, said on Sunday there were still no firm plans for downloading the recorders. Ottawa and other capitals have called for the black boxes to be sent abroad.
The plane disaster has heightened international pressure on Iran as it grapples with a long-running dispute with the United States over its nuclear program and its influence in the region that briefly erupted into open conflict this month.
The military has said it downed Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 in error in the aftermath of tit-for-tat strikes by the United States and Iran. But authorities delayed admitting this, prompting days of protests on Iran's streets.
""We are trying to read the black boxes here in Iran. Otherwise, our options are Ukraine and France, but no decision has been taken so far to send them to another country,"" Hassan Rezaifar, a director in charge of accident investigations at Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told state news agency IRNA.
Rezaifar had been quoted by Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency on Saturday as saying the black boxes could not be decoded in Iran and would be sent to Ukraine after Kiev's repeated requests. IRNA also reported on Sunday that the official had made similar comments a day earlier.
It was not immediately clear what prompted Rezaifar to backtrack.
The Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 was en route from Tehran to the Ukrainian capital. Most of those on board were Iranians or dual nationals.
Canada's Transportation Safety Board said in a statement two of its investigators left Tehran on Sunday after a six-day visit during which they examined the wreckage.
It said Iranian investigators were ""cooperative and helpful"" but said there were still no firm plans on how and when the black boxes would be downloaded.
PAYING RESPECT
Ukraine has previously said it expected the recorders to be handed over, while Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said France was one of the few countries with the ability to read information on the recorders.
France's air accident agency BEA said on Saturday it was awaiting an official request for assistance. 
The bodies of 11 Ukrainian victims were brought home on Sunday in a ceremony at Kiev airport. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said that ""bereaved families and the whole nation have an opportunity to pay their respects"".
The plane was brought down when the military was on high alert in the tense hours after Iran launched missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq in response to the killing of a top Iranian commander in a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 3 in Baghdad.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has called the downing an ""unforgivable error"" and promised to hold those responsible to account. The Revolutionary Guards also issued profuse apologies, as protesters raged against the Guards and the clerical system that the elite force was set up to protect.
The Islamic Republic's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Friday that ""some tried to use it as an excuse to overshadow the martyrdom of our great commander"" Qassem Soleimani, the powerful general killed in the U.S. strike.
The death of Soleimani, portrayed as a national hero at home but seen as a dangerous enemy in the West, led to huge mourning ceremonies in Iran, followed just a few days later by angry protests and chants of ""Death to Khamenei"" over the plane disaster.
Tension between Tehran and Washington has escalated since 2018, when the United States withdrew from Iran's nuclear pact with world powers and reimposed sanctions.
Tehran reduced its commitments to the 2015 pact, under which Iran agreed to scale back nuclear work in return for sanctions relief. European states triggered a dispute mechanism last week over the violations, a step that could lead to U.N. sanctions.

Parliament speaker Ali Larijani said Iran would review its cooperation with the U.N. nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency, should it face ""unjust"" measures.

Guaido confirmed on Sunday he had arrived in Colombia and would speak with Colombian President Ivan Duque, though he did not mention Pompeo. Spokespeople for the U.S. State Department and Guaido declined to comment on a meeting with Pompeo.
Guaido has not left Venezuela since February, when he defied a court-imposed travel ban and traveled to neighboring Colombia to organize a U.S.-backed effort to transport aid cargos back across the border, which was blocked by troops loyal to President Nicolas Maduro.
In a message on Twitter, Guaido said he was grateful for Duque's support and said the trip would ""generate the conditions that will lead us to freedom.""
""I can assure you that my return to our country will be full of good news,"" he added.
Duque, on Twitter, welcomed Guaido to Colombia, saying they would have a private meeting at his presidential residence on Sunday and Guaido would attend Monday's conference. The meeting will address the use of drug-trafficking and illegal gold mining to fund ""terrorist activities"" in the Americas.
The United States, along with some 50 other nations, has recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate head-of-state since last January when he invoked the constitution as head of congress and declared Maduro an usurper.
But a year on Maduro remains in power, despite a U.S. campaign to cut off his government's sources of financing by imposing sanctions on Venezuela's vital oil sector, and Guaido's attempts to encourage the military to rebel.
Earlier this month, Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party seized control of the National Assembly and swore in an allied politician who defected from Guaido's camp. Opposition lawmakers than voted in Guaido for a second term as congress chief in a separate session.
Pompeo at the time congratulated Guaido for his re-election and condemned ""the failed efforts of the former Maduro regime to negate the will of the democratically elected National Assembly.""

Maduro accuses Guaido of being a coup-mongering puppet controlled by the White House. In an interview published by the Washington Post on Saturday, Maduro said the Trump administration had underestimated his staying power and he ""didn't care"" about sanctions.

658,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2020 10:00AM ET</span>",SpaceX to attempt rocket failure test again after bad weather delay,"By Joey Roulette
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - Elon Musk's SpaceX will try again on Sunday to destroy one of its own rockets in a test of a crucial emergency abort system, a day after bad weather forced the company to delay its final milestone test before flying NASA astronauts from U.S. soil.
High winds and choppy seas in the area where the spacecraft was expected to splash down on Saturday delayed the dramatic inflight test of the unmanned astronaut capsule to Sunday, with a longer six-hour launch window starting at 8 a.m. ET (1300 GMT).
SpaceX said on Twitter on Sunday morning that the target launch time was 10:30 a.m. (1530 GMT) from Cape Canaveral in Florida, and that teams were continuing to track weather in the recovery area.
If the test goes ahead, SpaceX's Crew Dragon capsule, an acorn-shaped pod that can seat seven astronauts, will fire thrusters to detach itself from a Falcon 9 rocket less than two minutes after liftoff, simulating an emergency abort scenario to prove it can return astronauts to safety.
The test is crucial to qualify the capsule to fly humans to the International Space Station, something the National Aeronautics and Space Administration expects to come as soon as mid-2020. It follows years of development and delays as the United States has sought to revive its human spaceflight program through private partnerships.
NASA awarded $4.2 billion to Boeing (NYSE:BA) and $2.5 billion to SpaceX in 2014 to develop separate capsule systems capable of ferrying astronauts to the space station from U.S. soil for the first time since NASA's space shuttle program ended in 2011. The space agency has since relied on Russian spacecraft for rides to the space station.
During the test the Falcon 9 rocket's boosters will shut down roughly 12 miles (19 km) above the ocean, a mock failure that will trigger Crew Dragon's so-called SuperDraco thrusters to jet itself away at supersonic speeds of up to 1,500 miles per hour (2,400 kph).
The capsule will deploy three parachutes to slow its descent to the water, and will carry aboard two human-shaped test dummies fitted with motion sensors to collect data on the immense g-force — the effect of acceleration on the body — astronauts would be subjected to during abort.
The test was originally scheduled for mid-2019 but was delayed after a Crew Dragon capsule exploded in April on a test stand just before firing its launch abort thrusters, triggering a lengthy investigation.

SpaceX-led investigators in July zeroed in on a previously unknown explosive reaction between a titanium valve and a propellant used to ignite the thrusters. A SpaceX official said the company completed the investigation within the last week.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan's parliament on Sunday approved a draft law to ban imports of Israeli gas to the country just days after they started under a multibillion-dollar deal struck in 2016 which is opposed by much of the population.
The motion was passed unanimously by Jordan's 130 lawmakers and will be referred to the cabinet to be made law, although legal hurdles may prevent it coming into force.
The government has previously said it was a deal between companies rather than a political matter.
The $10 billion supply deal was originally struck between Jordan's state-owned utility and a U.S. Israeli consortium led by Texas-based  Noble Energy  (NYSE:NBL), to provide gas to the country's power plants for electricity generation.
It was not referred to parliament for approval.
Although U.S. ally Jordan has a peace treaty with Israel the deal, which supplies Jordan for 15 years, has faced much popular opposition, with lawmakers arguing it makes the kingdom dependent on its neighbor for energy.
Many Jordanians are also the descendants of Palestinians who moved to the country after the creation of Israel in 1948, and view Israel as an erstwhile enemy that expelled their ancestors from their homes.
The Jordanian government said after the agreement was signed in 2016 that securing stable energy prices for the next decade could achieve annual savings of at least $500 million and help reduce a chronic budget deficit.
The import of Israeli gas has become a major focus in Jordan and sparked protests and calls for both the deal and the peace treaty to be scrapped.
""The gas of the enemy is an occupation. Down with the gas deal,"" placards carried by protesters said.
Jordan's ties with Israel have come under increasing strain since the gas deal was struck as Israel has moved to the right and since Donald Trump replaced Barack Obama as U.S. president.
Jordan's King Abdullah fears Israel's rejection of a Palestinian state in the occupied West Bank could spark renewed violence and see a new generation of Palestinians relocating to Jordan."

Some were disguised as flowers or koala bears - a reference to the bushfires currently ravaging their habitat in Australia - and holding banners including: ""Let's ignore the Donalds and listen to the Gretas"", referring to U.S. President Donald Trump, and ""Make the world cool again"".
Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, who had joined 10,000 protesters in Lausanne on Friday, would not be able to take part in the hike, the organizers said.
Authorities had approved the first stretch from Landquart to Klosters, but rejected the activists' request to proceed to Davos by road for security reasons.
The organizers said they were determined to go on to Davos, but would take smaller hiking paths they didn't need permission to use."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China will step up efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays as a rise in confirmed cases fanned fears the virus could spread to other countries.
The National Health Commission said on Sunday departments should work together to carry out preventative measures.
""Our commission will step up our guard during the Spring Festival, pay close attention to the development and change of the epidemic, and direct the implementation of prevention and control measures,"" the commission said, adding that it believes the outbreak can be controlled.
Wuhan's health authority confirmed earlier on Sunday 17 more cases of the virus in the city, bringing the total number of known patients there to 62. 
Two people have died from the virus in Wuhan, the largest city in central China with a population of about 11 million people. Three cases have been confirmed abroad - two in Thailand and one in Japan - involving people from Wuhan or who recently visited the city. 
China, the World Health Organizations and authorities across the globe are stepping up efforts to contain the virus, which initially emerged in Wuhan in late December as a wave of pneumonia patients. 
Many of China's 1.4 billion people will travel domestically and abroad during the Lunar New Year break that begins next week, raising concerns about the virus spreading to other countries. 
The virus belongs in the same family of coronaviruses as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China. 
Though some experts say the new virus may not be as deadly as SARS, there is still little known about it including its origin and how easily it can be transmitted between humans. 
The World Health Organization said on Sunday that some of the new cases appear not to be linked to the Huanan seafood market, believed to be the centre of the outbreak. Due to China's efforts to implement broader screening, new cases may be identified in the coming days and weeks, it added.
""The fact that three cases have been exported to Thailand and Japan without connection to the Huanan Seafood Market suggests that the virus has spread beyond the Huanan Seafood Market into the community,"" said David Hui, a professor of respiratory medicine at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
Wuhan will strengthen oversight of big events and reduce the number of public gatherings, state media quoted Chen Yanxin, the city's deputy mayor as saying on Sunday.
Wuhan officials said since Jan. 14 they are using infrared thermometers at airports, railway stations and other passenger terminals in the city to strengthen screening.
Airport authorities in the United States as well as most Asian nations are screening passengers from Wuhan.

A report by the London Imperial College's MRC Centre for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said there are likely to be ""substantially more cases"". It estimated that by Jan. 12 there were 1,723 cases in Wuhan City with onset of related symptoms.

Turkey began drilling for oil and gas near Cyprus last year despite warnings from the EU, stoking tensions with neighboring members Greece and Cyprus.
In the latest move, Energy Minister Fatih Donmez on Friday told the state-owned Anadolu news agency that Turkey's Yavuz drilling ship was setting off for Cyprus, prompting cautionary EU comments.
""The EU has remained silent since 2003 to the usurping of our country's and the Turkish Cypriots' rights in the eastern Mediterranean,"" Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said in a written statement.
""The European Union must firstly end these policies under the guise of union solidarity, which are far from reality, prejudiced and show double standards.""
Cyprus was divided in a Turkish invasion in 1974 after a brief Greek-inspired coup. Turkey supports a breakaway Turkish Cypriot state in the north of the island.
Responding to the announcement of fresh drilling, EU foreign affairs spokesman Peter Stano said on Saturday that concrete steps were needed to create an environment conducive to dialogue.
""The intention by Turkey to launch further exploration and drilling activities in the wider region goes, regrettably, in the opposite direction,"" Stano said in a statement.
Aksoy said the ship Yavuz was heading for the south of Cyprus to an area for which Turkish Cypriot authorities awarded an exploration license to a Turkish company in 2011.
Cyprus's internationally recognized government discovered offshore gas in 2011 but has been at loggerheads with Turkey over maritime zones around the island, where it has granted licenses to multinational companies for oil and gas research.
Turkey, which does not have diplomatic relations with Cyprus's government, says that some areas in which Nicosia has operations are either on the Turkish continental shelf or in areas where the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state has rights over any finds."

KUALA LUMPUR/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's trade minister will not meet with his Malaysian counterpart in Davos next week because of his tight schedule, an Indian trade ministry official said on Sunday, as a spat simmers between the top buyer of palm oil and its biggest supplier.
Hindu-majority India has repeatedly objected to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad speaking out against a new citizenship law which critics say discriminate against Muslims.
Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, is the second biggest producer and exporter of palm oil and India's restrictions on the refined variety of the commodity imposed last week have been seen as a retaliation for Mahathir's criticism of New Delhi.
A Malaysian government spokesman said on Friday that trade ministers from India and Malaysia could meet on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos.
But the Indian trade ministry official, who said he was speaking on behalf of the ministry, said no meeting was planned between India's Piyush Goyal and Malaysia's Darell Leiking.
""I can tell you fair and square there's no meeting between the Malaysian minister and the Indian trade minister at Davos,"" he said, asking not to be named as he was not a government spokesman.
""As part of a larger meeting of trade ministers they may be both together, but there's no meeting. The schedule is already finalised, and it's full.""
India last week imposed curbs on refined palm oil, which a source in New Delhi with direct knowledge of the matter said could be used to deny or delay imports from Malaysia. India has been Malaysia's top palm market for five years.
The row dragged benchmark Malaysian palm futures to their biggest weekly decline in more than 11 years on Friday.
Malaysia's Leiking has sent a message to Goyal wishing him well for the Davos meeting, according to the message reviewed by Reuters.
Spokespeople for the trade ministries of India and Malaysia did not immediately respond to queries from Reuters.
Mahathir, the world's oldest premier at 94 and one of the Muslim world's biggest voices, has said he would continue to speak out against ""wrong things"" even if his words cost his country financially.
""Why is he harming his own country by his erratic actions?"" the Indian official said, referring to Mahathir. ""The comments he's making are very unprecedented.""
Responding to a question on India's new religion-based citizenship law, Mahathir said last month the country was trying to ""deprive some Muslims of their citizenship"". At the U.N. General Assembly in September, he said India had ""invaded and occupied"" Kashmir, a disputed Muslim-majority region also claimed by Pakistan."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will review its cooperation with the United Nations' nuclear watchdog should it face ""unjust"" measures, Iranian parliament speaker Ali Larijani said, after EU powers last week triggered a dispute mechanism under Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal.
The move by France, Britain and Germany amounts to formally accusing Iran of violating the terms of the deal and could lead eventually to reimposing U.N. sanctions that were lifted under the pact. 
""We state openly that if the European powers, for any reason, adopt an unfair approach in using the dispute mechanism, we will seriously reconsider our cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency,"" state TV quoted Larijani as saying.
Tehran has continued to gradually roll back its nuclear commitments under the pact in reaction to sanctions reimposed by Washington since the U.S. quit the nuclear deal in 2018.
Tehran said last week it would abandon limits on enriching uranium, though it would continue to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog (IAEA), which is policing the nuclear pact.
President Hassan Rouhani, architect of the nuclear deal, has repeatedly said that Tehran's nuclear steps were reversible if Tehran's economy was shielded by other parties to the deal from U.S. penalties. 
Under the deal between Iran and major powers, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for lifting international sanctions against the Islamic Republic.
The three European nations said they still wanted the 2015 nuclear deal to succeed and were not joining a ""maximum pressure"" campaign by the United States.
The mechanism involves a Joint Commission, whose members are Iran, Russia, China, Germany, France, Britain and the European Union, seeking to resolve the dispute.
A group of Iranian lawmakers signed a statement on Sunday warning the European powers to ""stop their hostile approach"" toward Tehran, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency reported. 
""Otherwise we, as representatives of the Iranian nation, will decide whether Iran should remain in the nuclear deal or whether it should continue its cooperation with the IAEA,"" the lawmakers said. 
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, not parliament, has the last say on state matters such as Tehran's nuclear standoff with the West. 

The Tasnim report did not say how many lawmakers signed the statement, which also called on the government to consider downgrading its diplomatic ties with Britain after Iranian officials accused the U.K envoy to Tehran of attending an illegal protest, which he denies.

""This year it is looking less crowded, this year when we came on the road, traffic was less,"" said tour guide Bassam Dalle. ""It’s obvious, we all know why.""
A Finnish guide who organizes snowmobile tours in the area said a third of the Nordic tourists who had booked with him this year had canceled.
""It’s a fantastic place, amazing mountain ranges ... plenty of snow, sunshine, warm and people are very friendly, so it’s a dream destination,"" said the guide.
Skier Gaby Tabbal was enjoying the day, though several slopes were shut. Though numbers were down, he noted there were still people skiing: ""This is the first day this year, the weather is beautiful, the snow is beautiful."""

Eight Indonesians were abducted in Sabah on Thursday. Three were released, while the remaining five were probably brought by their captors to the southern Philippine province of Sulu, said Lieutenant General Cirilito Sobejana, chief of the military's Western Mindanao Command.
Sulu is Abu Sayyaf's stronghold.
Sobejana disclosed the abduction a day after soldiers clashed with Abu Sayyaf members in Sulare island in Parang town, in Sulu, killing one militant and destroying a speed boat believed to have been used in the kidnapping.
Sobejana said Malaysian authorities had immediately coordinated with the Philippine military after the abduction.
Indonesia's foreign ministry said it also has coordinated with the Philippine government and was still waiting for official information about the incident.
The speed boat was positively identified by the three Indonesian fishermen who have been freed as the one used in the abduction staged by six militants, Sobejana said.
""The likelihood they are in Sulare island or Parang, Sulu is very high,"" he said.
Abu Sayyaf, which has its roots in separatism, is notorious for banditry and piracy, including beheading some captives if no ransom is paid."

Some residents danced and brought wooden replicas of the Infant Jesus, locally known as ""Santo Nino"", to celebrate the feast of the Holy Child. Many worshippers in Asia's biggest Catholic nation believe the statues can grant miracles.
""We prayed that we can rise up, put a stop to this calamity to allow us to return back to our homes,"" said 44-year-old evacuee Annie Villanueva. ""A lot of families like us want to be together in our own homes and stand up.""
More than 70,000 people have been evacuated since the Taal, one of the Philippines' most active volcanoes, began spewing clouds of ash, steam and gas on Jan. 12.
The volcano alert level remains at 4, just a notch below the highest, which means that ""hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days"".
""We feel afraid, especially for our families because we don't know our fate, if we will be safe,"" Villanueva said.
Nearly 800 volcanic earthquakes were recorded overnight within the danger zone, indicating ""intense seismic activity (that) likely signifies continuous magmatic intrusion beneath"", the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said in an advisory.
High-risk areas within a 14-km (9-mile) radius of the volcano's main crater should remain strictly off-limits to people, Maria Antonia Bornas, chief science research specialist at Phivolcs, told reporters.
""We continue to record earthquakes, and that is why we can't relax,"" she said."

LAS VEGAS, Nevada (Reuters) - Former two-division champion Conor McGregor returned to the Octagon with a stunning knockout of Donald Cerrone in under a minute at UFC 246 on Saturday in his first fight since losing a lightweight title bout to Khabib Nurmagomedov 15 months ago.
The 31-year-old Irishman left 'Cowboy' Cerrone bloodied just seconds into the fight by ramming shoulders into his face from the clinch, and when they broke McGregor landed a head kick that wobbled the American and sent him scrambling back to the cage.
McGregor closed in and rained down strikes as Cerrone covered up, prompting referee Herb Dean to stop the fight after just 40 seconds.
McGregor served a six-month suspension and was fined $50,000 for his role in a brawl at the end of his loss to Nurmagomedov.
He was convicted of assault late last year for punching a man who had refused a shot of whiskey from him in a Dublin pub while in a separate case in 2018 he was charged with three counts of assault and one count of criminal mischief after police said he attacked a vehicle carrying UFC fighters.
He pleaded guilty to a reduced disorderly conduct charge in that case.
After his long absence, McGregor was glad to be back.
""I feel really good, but I came out of here unscathed. I'm in shape. We've got work to do to get back to where I was,"" McGregor said in his post-fight interview.
The victory was McGregor's first since November 2016 at Madison Square (NYSE:SQ) Garden where he beat Eddie Alvarez to win the lightweight title and become the organization's first simultaneous two-weight champion.
A crowd of over 19,000 packed out the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Saturday and an uninspiring undercard was quickly forgotten as McGregor made his way to the Octagon.
Fans waving Irish Tricolours roared support for their man as the introductions took place and McGregor leaped into action as the fight began.
Cerrone had made his name by going toe-to-toe with some of the heaviest hitters in the UFC, giving fans the fights they want to see, but he was caught cold by McGregor's unorthodox shoulder strikes.
""I had never seen anything like that,"" Cerrone said. ""It threw me way off guard. He busted my nose and it started bleeding and then he stepped back and head kicked me.”
Despite a third straight defeat, Cerrone said he had no plans to retire.
“I’m going to keep fighting man. I love this sport.”
McGregor has said he planned to have three UFC fights this year and also revealed he has a lucrative boxing match against Manny Pacquiao in the pipeline."

The fire occurred in Vejprty on the country's northwest border with Germany in a home where mostly men with mental and other disabilities lived. 
It was the second deadliest blaze in the country's three-decade post-communist history. In 2010, a fire in an abandoned building often used by homeless people in Prague killed nine people. A hotel fire in the capital in 1995 killed eight.
Prime Minister Andrej Babis called the fire ""a terrible tragedy"", saying on Twitter that police and firefighters were doing their utmost.
The cause of the fire was not yet known.
The blaze was reported just before 5 a.m. (0400 GMT) on Sunday. Firefighters were able to contain the fire and put it out within hours. 
Dennik N newspaper reported that the fire started in one room and that most of those killed died from smoke inhalation.

MELBOURNE/KANAGAROO ISLAND, Australia (Reuters) - The Australian government said on Sunday it will provide financial aid to the country's tourism sector that's been badly hit by long-lasting bushfires, as business owners fretted about cancellations that stretch into the months ahead.
Although recent rains have brought some relief, damage to the industry from the fires has approached A$1 billion ($690 million) so far and may top A$4.5 billion by the end of the year, according to estimates from Australian tourism bodies.
""People have stopped coming,"" said Tony Coppins, owner of Kangaroo Island Safari and Kangaroo Island Ocean Safari, adding that he had received cancellations for February and March.
""They think the whole island is on fire and it's not, so we really need to send that message out that the island is still accessible.""
A fire earlier this month scorched more than 200,000 hectares (494,000 acres) on the island, located off the coast of South Australia, in blazes described as ""hell on earth"".
The government said on Sunday it would channel $76 million ($52 million) in what it described as an initial push to help the country's A$152 billion tourism industry, which accounts for more than 3% of annual economic output.
""International visitors are critical and especially critical in places like Kangaroo Island or tropical North Queensland and these are destinations that have relied upon a large part of their visitor market being international tourists and that's why we got to recover those markets as quickly as we can,"" said Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham.
Birmingham said bookings from key international markets to Australia were down by between 30% and 40%. Domestic bookings across the country were down nearly 70%, Australian media reported.
Rains have brought the number of fires burning across Australia's east and south coast to under 100 for the first time in weeks, easing a disaster that has scorched an area roughly one-third the size of Germany.
Twenty nine people have been killed in the fires while millions of animals are also estimated to have perished.
In Melbourne, fears receded that smoke from the fires would disrupt the Australian Open which starts on Monday as the city and parts of the bushfire-ravaged state of Victoria braced for heavy rains.
""Victoria is about to see its wettest two-day period in many, many months,"" said Dean Narramore from the state's Bureau of Meteorology.
More than 780,000 fans attended the two-week Australian Open last year, according to figures from the office of the state's premier, providing a major influx of cash for Victoria's economy.

Following are some highlights of what is happening in the bushfire crisis:
** About 80% of the Greater Blue Mountains that are on the World Heritage List of protected designations have been lost to the bushfires, Australian media reported.
** There were 69 bushfires in New South Wales, nearly a third of them still to be contained, and 14 fires were burning in Victoria, with some big blazes in state's mountain region known for hiking.
** Intense storms and heavy rains were expected across Australia's east and south coast on Sunday and Monday, with meteorologists warning of heavy flash flooding in Victoria.
** The Southern (NYSE:SO) Highlands in New South Wales re-opened to visitors after bushfires burnt through the region last year.

674,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2020 04:19AM ET</span>",Main Irish opposition surged into 12-point lead as election called,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's main opposition party, Fianna Fail, surged into a 12-point lead over the governing Fine Gael party according to an opinion poll that was published on Sunday but conducted mainly before Prime Minister Leo Varadkar called a snap election.
Varadkar called the Feb. 8 poll on Tuesday, kicking off a campaign that will pit his party's record on Brexit and Ireland's fast growing economy against a struggling public services and a high cost of living, particularly in housing.
The Sunday Times/Behaviour & Attitudes poll had put the two dominant parties of Irish politics level on 27% heading into the contest but the poll on Sunday showed Fine Gael plummeting to 20% while its centrist rival jumped to 32%, up five points on a month ago.
The survey of almost 1,000 eligible Irish voters was conducted between Jan. 2 and 14, the day Varadkar called the election. It marked Fine Gael's lowest rating in Behavior & Attitudes nine years of polling, and Fianna Fail's largest ever lead in the series.
The survey was carried out as the government came under strong criticism from opposition parties for planning a commemoration of the British police force that fought against Irish independence a century ago. It canceled the event last week. 
Other regular opinion polls conducted late last year suggested the two big parties, which have broadly similar policies on the economy and Brexit, were closely matched but that Fine Gael held a marginal lead.
If Sunday's survey translated into votes on polling day, Fianna Fail would be approaching the percentage share of the vote where it could attempt to form a multi-party coalition with smaller parties rather than another ""confidence and supply"" deal.
Under such a cooperation deal, Fine Gael has led a minority government since 2016 with a handful of independent lawmakers and the backing of Fianna Fail from the opposition benches.
However the poll also suggested coalition options remained narrow with prospective partners the Greens up one point to 7%and Labour down two to 4%.

Sinn Fein, whom both of the main parties refuse to govern with, fell one percentage point to 19%. This left the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) just one point behind Varadkar's Fine Gael.

The project is getting under way a year after the Israeli military said it had destroyed a series of infiltration tunnels dug by the Lebanese Hezbollah group.
""All the drilling is being done on the Israeli side of the blue line,"" military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, referring to the border demarcation with Lebanon, said in a conference call with journalists.
He said the planned Israeli network ""was not a wall"" but seismic and acoustic sensors buried in the ground.
Israel had informed U.N. peacekeepers in south Lebanon about the work ""to make sure everybody knows what we are doing and that we are operating on the Israeli side"" of the border, Conricus said.
He said deployment of the network was beginning on Sunday at Misgav Am, an Israeli border community, and drilling there could go on for up to two months.
""The overall plan is to expand the location of the sensors and place them at additional locations along the blue line,"" Conricus said, without giving an end-date for construction.
""This is a precautionary measure,"" he said. ""Our current assessment is that there are no cross-border attack tunnels.""

677,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 19, 2020 03:43AM ET</span>","Trump marks U.S.-Japan security pact with call for stronger, deeper alliance","TOKYO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump marked the 60th anniversary of the signing of the security treaty between the United States and Japan with a call for a stronger and deeper alliance between the two countries, despite criticizing the pact six months ago.
""As the security environment continues to evolve and new challenges arise, it is essential that our alliance further strengthen and deepen,"" Trump said in a statement dated Jan. 18.
""I am confident that in the months and years ahead, Japan's contributions to our mutual security will continue to grow, and the alliance will continue to thrive.""
Last June, Trump told a news conference in Japan that the treaty - signed six decades ago on Sunday and the linchpin of Japan's defense policy - was ""unfair"" and should be changed, echoing his long-held view that Japan is a free-rider on defense. 
Trump at the time added he was not thinking of withdrawing from the pact.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Sunday called for making the treaty more robust.
""We have elevated the relationship to one in which each of us, the U.S. and Japan, protects the other, thereby giving further force to the alliance,"" Abe said at a Tokyo reception to mark the anniversary of the signing.
""Going forward, it is incumbent upon us to make it even more robust, to make it a pillar for safeguarding peace and security in both outer space and cyberspace.""
The treaty obligates the United States to defend Japan, which under its U.S.-drafted constitution renounced the right to wage war after World War Two. Japan in return provides military bases used by the United States to project power in Asia.
The treaty was first signed in 1951 and revised in 1960 under Abe's grandfather, then-premier Nobusuke Kishi. Kishi was forced to step down afterwards following a massive public outcry from Japanese critics who feared the pact would pull their country into conflict.
Abe since taking office in 2012 has raised Japan's defense spending by 10% after years of decline and his government in 2014 reinterpreted the constitution to allow Japanese troops to fight overseas for the first time since World War Two.
Although generally supportive of the alliance, Japanese voters remain concerned about their country getting dragged into U.S.-led conflicts. A recent survey by Kyodo news agency showed 58.4% opposed Tokyo's decision to dispatch a warship and patrol planes to the Middle East to help protect ships bringing goods to Japan.
Trump's administration has also pushed for Japan to pay more for U.S. forces stationed in the country. Under an agreement reached in 2015, Japan pledged to increase its spending for U.S. forces stationed there by 1.4% over the following five years to 189.3 billion yen ($1.72 billion) per year on average.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will no longer be working members of Britain's monarchy and they will pay their own way in life as they embark on an independent future, Buckingham Palace said on Saturday.
They will also no longer use their ""Royal Highness"" titles, the palace said in an announcement that sought to end turmoil in the monarchy sparked earlier this month when the couple announced they wanted to reduce their official duties and spend more time in North America.
The queen and senior family members met last week to discuss the situation and have been in ""constructive and friendly"" discussions with officials on how this stepping back would work in practice for Harry, 35, and his American wife, former actress Meghan, 38.
""Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family,"" Queen Elizabeth said in a statement issued by the palace, referring to the couple's baby son.
(Read the statement by Queen Elizabeth, https://www.royal.uk/statement-her-majesty-queen-0)
""I recognize the challenges they have experienced as a result of intense scrutiny over the last two years and support their wish for a more independent life.""
The queen said she was ""particularly proud"" of how quickly Meghan had become one of the family. The couple married in May 2018 in a lavish ceremony at her home in Windsor Castle, west of London in front of a global TV audience of millions.
Harry will remain a prince and the couple will keep their titles of Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they begin a new life split between North America and Britain, but they will not take part in any future ceremonial events or royal tours. 
Royal commentators said it amounted to an ""abdication"" from the royal family and showed that under the warm words, the queen had taken a firm and decisive line.
""It is harder to think of a much cleaner break than this. Harry and Meghan are still members of the Royal Family, but they are effectively no longer royal"", the BBC's royal correspondent, Jonny Dymond, said. 
Meghan is currently in Canada with Archie and Harry is expected to join her soon.
A palace spokeswoman said the couple would no longer receive public money and that they would repay the cost of refurbishing their cottage in Windsor, which official figures show amounted to 2.4 million pounds ($3.1 million).
It remained unclear what public funds would be spent on their security. Buckingham Palace declined to comment but said there was an independent process to determine public funding for security.
The office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau declined to comment on Saturday's news.
ROYAL PAIN
The couple's plans for independence, announced after a long break over the Christmas period in Canada, caught the rest of the royal family by surprise earlier this month and left the queen and other senior Windsors hurt and disappointed, according to royal sources.
However, in a TV interview aired in October, both had made it clear how they were struggling with the immense media attention. Harry said he felt his wife had faced ""bullying"" from some tabloids. 
A friend of Harry and Meghan also said last week the couple felt they had been driven out by some members of the royal family.
The changes will come into effect in the spring of this year, the palace said, and there will be further royal engagements before the new arrangement is implemented, although it was not clear whether Meghan would be involved. 
The situation will be reviewed in a year's time by senior royals - the queen, Harry's father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles and Harry's elder brother Prince William.
There has been intense media speculation in recent days over what exact roles the couple would have.
""As agreed in this new arrangement they understand they are required to step back from royal duties,"" the Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said on Saturday.
""The Sussexes will not use their HRH title as they are no longer working members of the royal family.""
'NO HALFWAY HOUSE'
The change means Harry, who served a decade in the British Army, will give up his military patronages and his role as Commonwealth Youth Ambassador. 
It was not immediately clear whether the couple could continue to use the ""Sussex Royal"" title for their website and branding.
While they will no longer receive public funding, Prince Charles will continue to offer private financial support, a royal source said.
The source said the couple will spend the majority of their time in North America, and had not signed any commercial agreements as yet.
""Although they can no longer formally represent the queen, the Sussexes have made clear that everything they do will continue to uphold the values of her majesty,"" the palace spokeswoman said.
Before their wedding, Harry's spokesman said that Meghan was seeking to become a British citizen, but rules specify that prospective Britons spend the vast majority of their time in the United Kingdom. Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the issue. 
""I think the queen has dealt with this crisis because she has absolutely drawn the line: you can be private people, but you cannot be royal at the same time,"" Alastair Bruce, a commentator on the royals, told Sky News.
""There's no halfway house.""

The protest came only days after the European Commission unveiled ideas on how to finance its flagship Green Deal project that aims to make the European Union a CO2 emissions-neutral area by 2050, in part through the transformation of the car industry.
A member and former spokesman for the group, Christophe Meierhans, said Extinction Rebellion targeted the car industry because it told ""a lot of lies in order to sell more cars"".

BERLIN (Reuters) - Libyan rival camps and their foreign backers will attend a summit in Berlin on Sunday to discuss ways to end a proxy war over the capital Tripoli and the oil producer, which has displaced 140,000 and now more than halved the country's crude output.
Germany and the United Nations hope to persuade Russia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt to push their opposing camps to agree on a lasting truce in Tripoli, home to the internationally recognized government.
As with previous failed attempts, center stage of the one-day meeting will be occupied by eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, who in April started a campaign to take Tripoli. Western powers hope this time to put pressure on him to continue a ceasefire that has largely held for one week.
Haftar on Monday walked out on a Russo-Turkish summit, in contrast with his rival Fayez al-Serraj, the internationally recognized prime minister, who signed a lasting truce proposal put forward to both leaders.
Haftar, a former general from the regime of Muammar Gaddafi toppled in 2011, appeared confident this week when German foreign minister Heiko Maas visited him at his base outside Benghazi to ask him to come to Berlin.
He leaned back in his chair while Maas was leaning towards him to make his peace pitch, a picture from the meeting showed.
Haftar escalated the conflict on Friday when allied tribesmen shut down eastern oil ports, cutting oil production by 800,000 barrels a day. That will hit hard Tripoli, which benefits most from oil revenues.
The one-day summit, which will also bring together U.S. Secretary of States Mike Pompeo and European and Arab leaders, will not attempt to broker a power-sharing agreement between Haftar and Serraj.
Instead the focus is on a lasting ceasefire to restart talks.
Haftar is backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Jordan, Sudanese and Chadian fighters, and most recently Russian mercenaries, which helped him gain a bit on the Tripoli front. France has also given some support.
That has prompted Turkey to rush to Serraj's rescue by sending troops to Tripoli. Up to 2,000 fighters from Syria's civil war have also joined the battle to defend the capital, a U.N. official said on Saturday.
""I mean this is a regionwide conflict broadening, and looking increasingly like Syria which is why the whole international community is getting together in Germany,"" a senior U.S. state department official told reporters traveling with Pompeo.
Still, expectations were ""moderate,"" the official added.
Tarek Megerisi, a policy fellow with the North Africa and Middle East program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said there was no sign Haftar's backers were pushing him to stop the war.
""That means that obtaining a commitment to maintain this forum where all interfering actors meet in the form of follow-up committees would likely be the most valuable output Germany could achieve,"" he said."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's federal government will help Newfoundland on the Atlantic coast dig out in the wake of a massive winter blizzard that buried cars and left thousands without power, a Cabinet minister said on Saturday.
The storm dumped as much as 76.2 cm (30 inches) of snow on St. John's, the capital of Newfoundland, and packed wind gusts as high as 130 km per hour (81 mph). The snowfall was an all-time record for the day for St. John's International Airport.
St. John's Mayor Danny Breen said earlier that a state of emergency declared on Friday remained in effect. Businesses were closed, as was the international airport.
Natural Resources Minister Seamus O'Regan said military reservists might be called in, but details of the assistance had yet to be worked out. The immediate priority will be snow removal and clearing roads to the snowbound hospital, he said.
""We have a real issue right now with access to the hospital,"" O'Regan told reporters in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's government is meeting for two days in a what it has called a retreat.
Commenting on the scale of the blizzard, O'Regan said: ""It's snow and a hurricane, and snow and a hurricane shuts down a city.""
The public safety and defense ministers, who were en route to Winnipeg, would be able to provide more details later, O'Regan said. Earlier, the provincial premier asked the government for support, including ""mobilizing the Canadian Armed Forces.""
Thousands remained without power, and social media showed people had begun to literally dig out of their homes after snowdrifts blocked their doorways.
The Canadian Broadcasting Corp (CBC) confirmed a report of an avalanche slamming into a home in St. John's Battery neighborhood, which sits at the entrance to the city's harbor on the slopes of a steep hill.
A picture of the home on Twitter showed the living room filled with snow. The CBC also said a 26-year-old man has been reported missing after having set out to walk to a friend's house on Friday during the blizzard. 

""Help is on the way,"" Trudeau tweeted.

XINGU INDIGENOUS PARK, Brazil (Reuters) - Leaders of native tribes in Brazil issued a rallying call to protect the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest and its indigenous people from what they called the ""genocide, ethnocide and ecocide"" planned by the country's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro.
A manifesto signed on Friday at the end of a four-day meeting in the Xingu reservation said Bolsonaro was threatening the survival of indigenous people with plans to allow commercial mining and ranching on their protected lands.
""The government is attacking us and wants to grab our lands,"" the document said, calling for a year of demonstrations and the support of foreign organizations and environmental activists.
Bolsonaro has vowed to encourage economic development in the Amazon to lift the tribes from poverty and improve the lives of 30 million Brazilians who live there. Environmentalists fear his plans will speed up destruction of the rainforest, which is a bulwark against global climate change.
""We do not accept mining, agribusiness and the renting of our lands, nor logging, illegal fishing, hydroelectric dams or other projects that will impact us directly and irreversibly,"" the four-page document said.
The meeting in the village of Piaraçu on the Xingu river was called by Raoni Metuktire, the 90-year-old Kayapó chief who became an environmental campaigner in the 1980s with British rock singer Sting at his side.
The tribes said the Brazilian state under Bolsonaro had failed to fulfill its constitutional duty to protect indigenous lands and the surrounding environment by stopping illegal activity and punishing invaders. 
They also held the government responsible for the poisoning of the ""air, soil and rivers"" by the uncontrolled use of chemicals in agriculture adjacent to their reservations.
""We were convened by Chief Raoni with the goal of coming together and denouncing that a political project by the Brazilian government of genocide, ethnocide and ecocide is underway,"" the manifesto said.
Bolsonaro's office declined to comment.
Brazil’s indigenous affairs agency, Funai, run by a police officer appointed by Bolsonaro, said earlier this week that the meeting in the Xingu was a “totally private event” that it could not support because it was not “in line” with government policy.
The farm frontier in Brazil, one of the world's top meat and grains exporters, has advanced into the Amazon region in recent years, causing land conflicts with indigenous people.

Invasions of reservations by illegal loggers and miners have increased since Bolsonaro took office last year, leading to violent clashes. At least eight indigenous leaders were killed last year in circumstances that have not yet been clarified.

Riot police fired tear gas and water cannon, chasing protesters armed with tree branches and sign posts in a commercial district near Lebanon's parliament.
Crowds spilled on to the streets this week after a lull in largely peaceful protests which broke out in October. They are furious at a ruling elite that has steered the country towards its worst economic crisis in decades. 
Police beatings and arrests in recent days have alarmed human rights groups and sparked fears among activists of a move to crush the dissent.
Smoke billowed out of tear gas canisters encircling protesters as ambulances sped through the streets of the capital. Witnesses said security forces also fired rubber bullets. 
The Lebanese Red Cross said more than 100 people had been treated for injuries, with at least 65 others taken to hospital on both sides.
A security source said at least 15 protesters had been detained. 
President Michel Aoun ordered the army and security commanders to restore calm. 
Saad al-Hariri, who resigned as premier in October, said the violence threatened civil peace. ""It is an insane, suspicious and rejected scene,"" he tweeted. 
After the unrest pushed Hariri to quit, feuding politicians have failed to agree on a new cabinet or rescue plan. The Lebanese pound has lost nearly half its value, dollar shortages have driven up prices and confidence in the banks has collapsed.
The Internal Security Forces (ISF) said they were being ""violently and directly"" confronted on Saturday night. ""Those who are rioting will be pursued, arrested and referred to the judiciary,"" it said on Twitter.
Young men chanting ""revolution"" hurled stones, steel barriers and flower pots at riot police. Protesters had tried to push into the heavily barricaded part of central Beirut which includes the parliament. 
Interior Minister Raya el-Hassan said it was unacceptable for protesters to ""blatantly assault"" the security forces. 
Firefighters put out a blaze that engulfed a protest camp in the centre of the city, where burning tents sent plumes of smoke into the air. It was not immediately clear what caused the fire. The ISF denied media reports that some of its forces had set fire to the camp, where activists had held debates and sit-ins in recent months. 
Hundreds of people had marched and chanted against the political class in other parts of the capital in the afternoon. A large banner at one of the rallies read: ""If the people go hungry, they will eat their rulers.""

Anger at the banks - which have curbed people's access to their savings - has also boiled over, with protesters smashing bank facades and ATMs on Tuesday night.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. National Archives, home to foundational documents such as the Bill of Rights, apologized on Saturday for altering images critical of President Donald Trump at an exhibit on women's fight for voting rights and said it had removed the display.
The entrance to the Washington exhibit had featured interlaced photographs of a 1913 women's suffrage march and the Women's March that took place on Jan. 21, 2017, each visible from a different angle. In the 2017 photograph, the word ""Trump"" had been blurred in at least two signs carried by demonstrators, including one that originally read ""God Hates Trump.""
The word ""vagina"" and other anatomical references were also obscured.
""We apologize, and will immediately start a thorough review of our exhibit policies and procedures so that this does not happen again,"" the Archives said in statement.
The photo-editing was first reported by The Washington Post on Friday and witnessed by a Reuters reporter on Saturday at the same time as demonstrators attending this year's Women's March strolled through downtown Washington in the cold and drizzle.
The Post reported on Friday that the Archives had said in a statement last week that as a non-partisan agency it had altered the image ""so as not to engage in current political controversy.""
Roughly an hour after Reuters witnessed the altered image, however, the Archives issued a public apology in which it said it had removed the display and would replace it as soon as possible with one that uses the unaltered image.
""We made a mistake. As the National Archives of the United States, we are and have always been completely committed to preserving our archival holdings, without alteration,"" it said.
Along with its popular Washington museum which includes exhibits of founding documents, the agency preserves government records and oversees research centers and presidential libraries in dozens of locations across the United States.
""Public access to government records strengthens democracy by allowing Americans to claim their rights of citizenship, hold their government accountable, and understand their history,"" its mission statement reads.
The altered 2017 image was easy to miss, visible only from the side of the display at an angle of around 45 degrees. From the front, only the 1913 suffrage march - part of the movement that led to women winning the vote in 1920 - was visible.
Trump has been criticized for his behavior toward women, including for taped comments that surfaced in 2016 in which he can be heard bragging about groping and having sex with women.
At the time, Trump dismissed the tape as locker room banter."

The usually well-informed outlet, citing multiple unnamed sources in Pyongyang, said Ri would be replaced by Ri Son Gwon, the former chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Country (CPRC), who played a prominent role in inter-Korean talks in early 2018.
North Korea news said the move, of which there has been no mention in official North Korean media, was part of a major political reshuffle that could have a significant impact on the country’s diplomatic stance. The outlet said it would likely be confirmed on or before Thursday, when an event for resident diplomats is scheduled in Pyongyang.
South Korea's unification ministry, which is in charge of North Korea affairs, has said that any change in Ri's status should be assessed cautiously.
The U.S. State Department, which has been seeking unsuccessfully to revive talks aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Ri Yong Ho, who was born in 1956, did not attend the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations in September. He had attended the high-level meeting in New York for three years from 2016 to 2018.
North Korea News said his absence from a group photo of top ruling party officials at a meeting in January raised speculation that he may have been replaced amid a broader political reshuffle that saw notable promotions and possible demotions of prominent figures in North Korea’s military, Cabinet, and more.
South Korea's Yonhap news agency cited a source in Beijing as saying that North Korea's top envoys to China and the United Nations returned to Pyongyang on Saturday. It said this was spurring speculation that North Korea could review its nuclear negotiating strategy with the United States.
The agency quoted its source as saying that the ambassador to China, Ji Jae-ryong, and the envoy to the United Nations, Kim Song, left for Pyongyang from Beijing airport in the morning.
It said North Korean ambassadors to Angola and Singapore were also seen at the airport, indicating a possible meeting of North Korea's overseas diplomatic mission chiefs in Pyongyang. Some 10 other North Korean diplomats accompanied the top envoys on the flight, Yonhap said.
A fluent English speaker who studied at Pyongyang’s prestigious University of Foreign Languages, Ri Yong Ho has for years held a number of high-level posts dealing with the West.

From 2003 to 2007, he was North Korea’s ambassador in London and served as vice foreign minister, representing North Korea at now-defunct six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program.

690,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2020 03:46PM ET</span>","Despite shake-up, Putin rejects idea of Soviet-style leaders for life","By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - President Vladimir Putin said on Saturday he did not want Russia to return to the late Soviet-era practice of having lifelong rulers who died in office without a proper succession strategy.
His comments, made to World War Two veterans in St Petersburg, came days after he unveiled a sweeping shake-up of the political system which led to the resignation of Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister along with his government.
Putin, in a surprise move, picked Mikhail Mishustin, the low-profile head of the country's tax service, as the country's next prime minister. Russians are now waiting to hear which ministers will keep their jobs in a new government.
Putin's changes, which would amend the constitution to create new centers of power outside the presidency, were widely seen as giving the 67-year-old scope to extend his grip on power once he leaves the presidency in 2024. He has dominated Russian politics, as president or as prime minister, for two decades.
Critics accuse Putin, a former KGB officer, of plotting to stay on in some capacity after his term ends. They suspect he wants to continue to wield power over the world's largest nation, which is also one of its two leading nuclear powers.
In his comments on Saturday, Putin, who has already said he wants to limit future presidents to two terms in power despite currently serving out his fourth term himself, rejected the idea of Russian presidents for life.
Asked by a war veteran on the occasion of the 77th anniversary of the lifting of the siege of Leningrad if it was time to abolish term limits for presidents altogether, Putin said: ""As regards (presidential) terms for staying in power I understand ... that (concern over this) is linked for many people with worries about societal, state and domestic and external stability.
""But it would be very worrying to return to the situation we had in the mid-1980s when state leaders stayed in power, one by one, until the end of their days and left office without ensuring the necessary conditions for a transition of power. So thanks, but I think it would be better not to return to that situation.""
The late Soviet period was characterized by a series of elderly leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev, Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko who all died in office, sparking a scramble by others to grab power.
Putin's comments are likely to be seen as reinforcing the idea that he plans to exit the presidency in 2024 as per the current constitution, but are unlikely to appease critics who think he'll find a way to continue wielding influence behind the scenes in a different enhanced role."
691,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2020 03:07PM ET</span>",U.S. sanctions Iranian commander over Mahshahr killings,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Saturday it had imposed sanctions on a general of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps who commanded units blamed for a massacre of protesters in November.
The U.S. State Department has said previously it had received videos of the Revolutionary Guards opening fire without warning on protesters in Mahshahr county in southwest Iran.
On Saturday, it cited ""multiple"" media reports and information submitted by the Iranians through its Rewards for Justice tipline that units under Brigadier General Hassan Shahvarpour’s command killed as many as 148 people when they used armored vehicles to encircle fleeing protesters, firing machine guns into the crowd and setting fire to the marsh in which protesters took cover.
The State Department said it was designating Shahvarpour, a commander in Khuzestan province where Mahshahr is located, under a U.S. law banning officials of foreign governments and their immediate family members for whom there was ""credible information on their involvement in gross violations of human rights."" 
The announcement comes amid high tensions between Tehran and Washington after the United States killed Iran's most powerful military commander in a drone strike in Iraq and Iran retaliated by launching missile strikes at U.S. targets in Iraq.
U.S. President Donald Trump in 2018 pulled the United States out of a nuclear deal between Iran and major powers, arguing the agreement was too weak and that new sanctions would force Iran to accept more stringent terms.
The State Department, which has stepped up criticism of Iran over human rights, said the latest move demonstrated Washington's ""continued commitment to the Iranian people to support their demands for accountability from Iranian officials who committed serious human rights abuses against protesters in November.""
A Reuters special report last month found that about 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started in Iran on Nov. 15. The figures, provided by three Iranian interior ministry officials, included at least 17 teenagers and about 400 women as well as some members of the security forces and police.
Iran’s authorities have disputed the U.S. account of what happened at Mahshahr. Iranian officials have said security forces confronted “rioters” who they described as a security threat to petrochemical complexes and to a key energy route that, if blocked, would have created a crisis in the country."
692,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 18, 2020 02:09PM ET</span>","Angered by weapons ban, organizers urge thousands to attend Virginia gun rally","By Brad Brooks and Gabriella Borter
(Reuters) - Organizers of a Virginia gun rally urged thousands of people to attend Monday's event protesting Democrats' push to stiffen the state's gun laws after its top court upheld the governor's emergency ban on weapons at the rally grounds.
In a statement late Friday, the Virginia Citizens Defense League, a pro-gun rights group organizing the rally in Richmond, urged 10,000 people to attend the rally at the Capitol grounds unarmed in accordance with the governor's ban.
The emailed statement also called on tens of thousands more to stand with their weapons immediately outside the designated rally grounds to show support for Americans' right to bear arms under the U.S. Constitution.
""For every one gun owner on the Capitol grounds, we need another two to five people outside,"" the organizers wrote. ""Those doing so can be legally armed."" 
Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on Wednesday said he was temporarily banning all weapons from the area around the Capitol ahead of the demonstration, and the Virginia Supreme Court upheld that ban on Friday.
President Donald Trump backed the rally organizers in a Twitter post on Friday in which he said the U.S. Constitution was under attack by recent gun control measures in Virginia, a state that Hilary Clinton won in 2016 and where Democrats took full control of the state legislature for the first time in a generation in November.
""Your 2nd Amendment is under very serious attack in the Great Commonwealth of Virginia,"" Trump wrote in the post, referring to the amendment in the Bill of Rights that gives Americans the right to keep and bear firearms. ""That's what happens when you vote for Democrats, they will take your guns away.""
Gun-control activists have reported a growing number of online death threats as the lawmakers press on and ahead of Monday's rally, which authorities are trying to keep from becoming violent.
Militias, neo-Nazis and other groups have vowed to attend and police say they are expecting several thousand people. 
The Virginia Senate late on Thursday passed bills to require background checks on all firearms sales, limit handgun purchases to one a month, and restore local governments' right to ban weapons from public buildings and other venues. 
Both Virginia legislative houses are also expected to pass ""red flag"" laws that would allow courts and local law enforcement to remove guns from people deemed a risk to communities, among other measures. 
Supporters of more restrictive gun laws say they would help decrease the number of people killed by firearms in the United States each year. Gun-rights activists assert that the constitution guarantees their right to possess any firearm. 
On Thursday, the FBI arrested three members of a small neo-Nazi group who authorities said hoped to ignite a race war through violence at the Richmond rally, reminiscent of a 2017 white supremacist rally in nearby Charlottesville.

That rally proved a critical moment in the rise of the ""alt-right,"" a loose alignment of fringe groups centered on white nationalism and emboldened by Trump's 2016 election. Trump was criticized from the left and right for initially saying there were ""fine people on both sides"" of the dispute between neo-Nazis and their opponents at the rally.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Saturday it was sending to Ukraine the black boxes from a Ukrainian passenger plane that the Iranian military shot down this month, an accident that sparked unrest at home and added to pressure on Tehran from abroad.
Iran's Tasnim news agency also reported the authorities were prepared for experts from France, Canada and the United States to examine information from the data and voice recorders of the Ukraine International Airlines plane that came down on Jan. 8.
It did not say when the black boxes would be sent to Ukraine.
The plane disaster, in which all 176 aboard were killed, has added to international pressure on Iran as it grapples with a long running row with the United States over its nuclear programme that briefly erupted into open conflict this month.
The plane was shot down in error at a time when Iran was on high alert for a U.S. attack. But the military took days to admit they had brought it down, a delay that sparked protests.
Hassan Rezaifar, a director in charge of accident investigations at Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, said the aim was to read the information on the recorders ""with the use of the expertise of the countries of France, Canada and America"".
""If this effort is unsuccessful then the black box will be sent to France,"" he said, according to Tasnim, adding that black boxes were being sent to Kiev at the request of Ukrainian experts in Tehran and that they would not be inspected in Iran.
The U.S.-built Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 was en route from Tehran to the Ukrainian capital. Most of those on board were Iranians or dual nationals. Canada had 57 citizens on board.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who has been pressing for a full investigation into the plane downing, said on Friday Iran should send the black boxes to France.
CALL FOR COMPENSATION
France was one of the few countries with the ability to read the flight and cockpit data recorders from the jet, he told a news conference, adding they were badly damaged.
Canada's Foreign Ministry and the prime minister's office had no immediate comment on the move to send the black boxes to Ukraine. The French Foreign Ministry had no immediate comment and a spokesman for the France’s air accident agency, BEA, said it was awaiting an official request for assistance.
A spokesman for the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board also said it had no comment.
Ukraine has previously said it expected Iran to hand over the black boxes to Ukraine. The foreign minister also expects Iranian representatives to travel to Kiev next week.
Canada, alongside Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and Britain, which also had citizens on the flight, have called for a thorough investigation and compensation for the families.
The plane was brought down in the tense hours after Iran launched missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq in response to the U.S. killing of an Iranian commander in a drone strike on Jan. 3 in Baghdad.
Iran's foreign ministry urged those involved in the crash to avoid making it an ""excuse for political gestures"".
Addressing the crisis, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei told worshippers chanting ""Death to America"" at prayers on Friday that the disaster was a ""bitter tragedy that burned through our heart"".
But he said ""some tried to use it as an excuse to overshadow the martyrdom of our great commander"" Qassem Soleimani, Iran's most powerful general who was killed in the U.S. strike.
The death of Soleimani, portrayed as a national hero at home but viewed as a dangerous enemy in the West, prompted huge mourning ceremonies in Iran. Those were followed by street protests against the clerical system after the plane disaster.

Tension between Tehran and Washington has ratcheted higher since 2018, when the United States withdrew from Iran's nuclear pact with world powers and reimposed sanctions, and erupted into the tit-for-tat military strikes this month.

TECUN UMAN, Guatemala (Reuters) - Scuffles briefly broke out on the Guatemala-Mexico border on Saturday morning as a group of several hundred mostly Honduran migrants pressed forward to cross, only to be pushed back by Mexican security forces.
Scores of people who entered Guatemala from Honduras in recent days have been arriving at the Mexican border, with the bulk of them still advancing in a larger caravan, testing the resolve of Mexico to heed U.S. demands to contain migrant flows.
President Donald Trump has threatened to hurt Mexico and Central American countries economically if they allow large groups to reach the U.S. border, and the latest exodus from Honduras has been accompanied by U.S. border agents.
Guatemalan authorities say around 4,000 people have arrived in the country in the last few days, the biggest surge since Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador signed accords with the United States that increase pressure on them to deal with migrants.
After waiting on a bridge at the Guatemalan border town of Tecun Uman, some migrants began pushing and shoving before being driven back by Mexican security officials, who shut the border crossing and sought to calm the group.
A Reuters witness estimated there were 300-400 people on the Guatemalan side of the border. Along with local television reporters, he said order was quickly restored at the scene.
A few migrants made it through the gate, local media said, but Mexican officials appeared to be controlling the situation more successfully than when a large caravan sought to force its way through at the same crossing in October 2018.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said he is monitoring the approach of the migrants and has held out the prospect of jobs in southern Mexico for those who want to stay.
Interior Minister Olga Sanchez said earlier this week that the migrants would not be granted safe conduct passes.
About 400 of the migrants who entered Guatemala since Wednesday have been returned to their countries of origin, according to a statement issued by the Guatemalan government."

Orchestra members and singers performed well-known airs by Verdi and Bizet in a half-hour event outside the Opera Garnier building, ending with a rendition of the Marseillaise.
The musicians were cheered on by colleagues including ballerinas who last month performed scenes from Swan Lake at the same spot in a similar protest over the proposed pensions overhaul.
The event drew applause from passers-by on a sunny winter's afternoon in the French capital, where performances by the Paris Opera have been canceled for the past month due to the strike by artists who want to preserve centuries-old retirement provisions.
""We're so unhappy about not being able to give our shows that we're performing in a different way, in the street, to show the public that we're not on holiday,"" Fabien Wallerand, a tuba player in the Paris Opera's orchestra, told Reuters.
Under an arrangement dating back to 1698 and the reign of Louis XIV, Paris Opera dancers can retire on a full pension at the age of 42, singers at 57 and musicians at 60.
President Emmanuel Macron's plan to merge France's various pension schemes into a single system has triggered more than a month of strikes, particularly in public transport.
However, concessions by the government, notably a delay to a move to raise the age at which workers can claim a full pension from 62 to 64, have contributed to a waning in strikes."

BERLIN (Reuters) - The United Nations envoy to Libya said on Saturday he hoped but ""could not predict"" whether eastern oil ports shut ahead of a pending Berlin summit aimed at reaching a truce in Libya would be reopened soon.
Ghassan Salame said the Berlin summit scheduled for Sunday would likely discuss the closures to avoid them dragging on for weeks or months like previous seizures of facilities. 
""If the thing is not solved between today and tomorrow I expect the issue to be raised, yes,"" Salame told Reuters in Berlin, where Germany and the UN are expected to push for an extended truce.
Oil export terminals across eastern and central Libya were shut on Friday by tribesmen allied to commander Khalifa Haftar, whose Libya National Army (LNA) based in the east has been locked in a nine-month war with government forces over control of the capital, Tripoli.
Diplomats see the closures as a power play by the LNA aimed at choking off oil revenue to the internationally recognized Tripoli government.
The National Oil Corp (NOC) on Saturday declared force majeure on oil exports from the eastern ports of Brega, Ras Lanuf, Hariga, Zueitina and Es Sider, saying the closures would result in the loss of 800,000 barrels (bpd) day in oil output.
Production in Libya, which was plunged into chaos with the toppling of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, was estimated at 1.3 million bpd last week.
Salame said he hoped Haftar would be willing to consider extending a truce which has largely held for a week despite the two sides failing to sign a deal at talks in Moscow mediated by Russia and Turkey on Monday.
Haftar is expected to attend the summit opposite Tripoli-based Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj.
The war over Tripoli is backed by foreign powers with the LNA supported by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and most recently Russian mercenaries, and Turkey sending troops and fighters from Syria's civil war to help al-Serraj.
""I can confirm the arrival of fighters from Syria,"" Salame said, putting estimates at 1,000 to 2,000.
There have been a series of failed conferences and negotiations to stabilize Libya.
Salame said he had started the process of a new intra-Libyan dialogue between the rival parliaments in Tripoli and the east, an approach that has failed since 2017.

""What is different now is that we have war...in 2017 there was no pressure, but now you have thousands of people who have been killed,"" he said.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Somali insurgents linked to al Qaeda claimed responsibility for a car bombing on Saturday that wounded at least 15 people in Afgoye, northwest of the capital Mogadishu.
Police said the injured included Turkish contractors as well as Somali nationals. 
Turkey's state-owned Anadolu news agency said at least four Turkish employees of a construction firm were wounded and are being treated in hospital, citing information from the Turkish embassy in Mogadishu. 
""A speeding suicide car bomb rammed into a place where the Turkish engineers and Somali police were having lunch,"" police officer Nur Ali told Reuters from Afgoye.
""So far, we know three Turkish engineers and their translator were injured,"" he said. ""Two other policemen were injured in the blast.""
Al Shabaab, which frequently carries out bombings to try to undermine Somalia's central government, which is backed by the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping troops, said it carried out the attack. 
""We are behind the martyrdom of the suicide car bomb in Afgoye,"" Abdiasis Abu Musab, a spokesman for the group, said. ""We targeted the Turkish men and the Somali forces with them. There are casualties of death and injuries.""
The group and government often differ in casualty figures.
Residents and police said al Shabaab fighters tried to mount an attack on Afgoye, about 30 km (18 miles) from Mogadishu, late on Friday but were repulsed.
Turkey's Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said six Turkish nationals and nine Somali citizens were wounded in Saturday's bombing. 
""The wounded are being treated at our Mogadishu Recep Tayyip Erdogan hospital. Two of our citizens are in a serious condition,"" Koca said on Twitter.
""Four of the nine Somali wounded are in a serious condition. We are in contact with our embassy,"" he added.
Local residents described a ""huge blast"" followed by ""clouds of smoke"".
""Before the blast, several Turkish engineers and well armed convoy of Somali police were at the scene,"" Farah Abdullahi, a shopkeeper, told Reuters from Afgoye. ""We see casualties being carried but we cannot make if they are dead or injured."" 
Turkey has been a major source of aid to Somalia following a famine in 2011 as Ankara seeks to increase its influence in the Horn of Africa to counter Gulf rivals like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Turkish engineers are helping with road construction in Somalia. A group of engineers was among those hit in late December in a blast at a checkpoint in Mogadishu that killed at least 90 people.

""We curse and condemn in the strongest terms the bomb terror attack which targeted innocent civilians in Somalia,"" the Turkish Defense Ministry said on its Twitter account.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Parts of Australia's east coast were hit by severe storms on Saturday, dousing some of the bushfires that have devastated the region for months but causing road closures and flash flooding.
Fears of smoke from the fires disrupting the Australian Open tennis receded in Melbourne, where the main tournament was due to start on Monday.
Despite the heavy rain, authorities were still battling nearly 100 blazes - part of the bushfires that have killed 29 people since September, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and scorched an area nearly one-third the size of Germany.
Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, three of the states most hit by drought and bushfires, are now dealing with rain bucketing down in several areas. 
Major highways were closed in Queensland on Saturday, with the state getting some of the heaviest rain Australia has seen for months, while power was cut in parts of New South Wales after a stormy night.
""Heavy, intense rainfall has eased, but showers and thunderstorms still possible through the weekend,"" the Bureau of Meteorology in Queensland said on Twitter on Saturday.
""Take care on the roads - if it's flooded, forget it."" GRAPHIC - Swirling smoke interactive: https://graphics.reuters.com/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES-SMOK/0100B4W52R7/index.html 
Parts of Queensland's south saw triple the monthly rainfall overnight. No major damage has been reported, although some residential areas were flooded and many of the state's parks and tourist attractions were closed. 
New South Wales fire services welcomed the rain, which they said on Twitter would help to control the 75 fires burning in the state, of which 25 are yet to be contained. But, they also said that some firegrounds have not seen any rain yet.
More benign storms were forecast for Victoria over the weekend, which has been hit this week already by severe storms and unhealthy smoke from the bushfires.
Skies were clear in Melbourne, however, for the final round of qualifying for the Australian Open, the year's first Grand Slam, and Victoria's Environmental Protection rated the air quality as ""good"", after an earlier forecast of unhealthy air for the weekend.
There were still more than a dozen fires burning in Victoria on Saturday, with firefighters battling to contain a big blaze in the state's mountain region, fifteen times the size of Manhattan. 
Victoria's emergency service also issued an evacuation warning due to a bushfire on Saturday for French Island, the state's largest coastal island with a small population of just above 100 people.

A crowd gathered outside the Theater Des Bouffes du Nord on Friday evening after the couple had arrived to watch a performance of La Mouche (The Fly). Videos on social media showed protesters chanting ""Macron resign"" and at one stage trying to enter the venue near the Gare du Nord train terminus in northern Paris.
""There was an attempted invasion of the theater but the presidential couple was able to remain until the end of the play and left the venue by car around 10pm with a police escort,"" a source close to Macron said.
The president's presence at the theater was flagged on Twitter by journalist and political activist Taha Bouhafs, who was inside the venue. He was later detained by police, according to a judicial source.
Macron was previously targeted by ""yellow vest"" protesters in their year-long movement against the cost of living, accused of being arrogant and out of touch.
The president has mostly stayed on the sidelines during protests against his planned overhaul of France's retirement system, leaving Edouard Philippe, his prime minister, to face unions during a month and a half of transport stoppages.
But with participation in rail strikes waning, opponents of the pension reform have staged more direct action.
The headquarters of the moderate CFDT union, which the government has been trying to win over, was invaded on Friday by activists from other unions, while the Louvre Museum was blocked by striking staff.
Macron, who included changes to the pension system in his 2017 election campaign, wants to replace dozens of existing schemes with a universal, points-based system."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China reported four more cases of pneumonia believed to be caused by a new coronavirus strain, causing rising concern globally that a disease health officials do not yet fully understand could spread during a key holiday period.
The new virus, which was discovered in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, belongs in the same large family of coronaviruses that includes Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which killed nearly 800 people globally during a 2002/03 outbreak that also started in China. 
Though experts say the new virus does not appear to be as lethal as SARS, there is little known about its origins and how easily it can spread. Thailand and Japan have confirmed new cases of the virus earlier this week, stoking worries globally as many of the 1.4 billion Chinese people will travel abroad during the Lunar New Year holidays that begin next week. 
Authorities around the world including in the United States, Thailand and South Korea have stepped up monitoring of travelers from Wuhan as part of their efforts to prevent the disease from spreading. 
The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned that a wider outbreak is possible, though it has advised against any travel restrictions for China.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission (WMHC) said on Saturday the four new individuals diagnosed with the new virus are in stable condition, adding it has confirmed 45 cases in the city as of Thursday. A day earlier, the commission confirmed the death of a second patient.
Nearly 50 people are now known to have been infected globally, but all of them either live in Wuhan or have traveled to the city.
A report published by the London Imperial College's MRC Center for Global Infectious Disease Analysis said there are likely ""substantially more cases"" of the new coronavirus than currently announced by Wuhan authorities: its base scenario estimate is that there would be 1,723 cases showing onset of related symptoms by Jan. 12. 
The WMHC referred Reuters queries about the report to the National Health Commission (NHC) and the Hubei provincial government, but the NHC and the Hubei government did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Wuhan is the capital of Hubei province. 
SCREENING
U.S. authorities have said they would start screening at three airports to detect travelers arriving via direct or connecting flights from Wuhan who may have symptoms of the new virus.
In Asia, authorities in Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand have stepped up monitoring of passengers from Wuhan at airports. Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines say they have strengthened screening at all points of entry in response to the outbreak, as well.
But Alexandra Phelan, global health legal expert at Georgetown University's Center for Global Health Science and Security, said such screening may be insufficient in preventing the virus from spreading as its symptoms, which include fever, cough and difficulty in breathing, are ""quite general"".

""There are likely to be many individuals with matching symptoms due to an illness that is not 2019-nCoV,"" Phelan said, referring to the new virus.

Erdogan made his remarks in a column published on the Politico website on Saturday, ahead of a summit in Berlin on Sunday that will try to stabilize the country.
At the meeting, Germany and the United Nations will push rival Libyan camps fighting over the capital, Tripoli, to agree to a truce and monitoring mechanism as first steps toward peace, diplomats and a draft communique said.
Turkey supports the government of Fayez al-Serraj in Tripoli and describes Khalifa Haftar, who heads the eastern Libyan National Army (LNA), as a coup plotter.
""Keeping in mind that Europe is less interested in providing military support to Libya, the obvious choice is to work with Turkey, which has already promised military assistance,"" Erdogan wrote.
""We will train Libya's security forces and help them combat terrorism, human trafficking and other serious threats against international security,"" he added.
Sunday's summit will put pressure on Haftar and the LNA to halt a nine-month offensive against Tripoli after a week-long lull in fighting. But it will not try to broker power-sharing between the two sides, said diplomats briefed on preparations.
Haftar and Serraj are both due in Berlin - along with Erdogan and the leaders of Russia, Egypt and other Western and Arab powers. Libya has been in turmoil since the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Erdogan said that if Libya's legitimate government were to fall Islamist militant groups such as Islamic State and Al Qaeda ""will find a fertile ground to get back on their feet"".
Haftar is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Sudanese and Chadian fighters, and most recently Russian mercenaries. France has also given some support.

On the other side, Turkey has supported Serraj by sending troops to balance out recent gains by Russian snipers. Hundreds of pro-Turkey fighters from Syria's war have also been deployed, diplomats say.

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Seven trekkers, including four South Koreans, went missing in Nepal's northwest Himalayan region after an avalanche hit their trail, local police and hiking officials said on Saturday.
The area where the avalanche struck the group, which also included three local guides, is estimated to be about 150 km (93.21 miles) northwest of Nepali capital Kathmandu, according to the officials. The avalanche was triggered by heavy rain and snowfall, they said.
""Four of our Korean clients, who were trekking in the Annapurna region are not in contact and are missing since an avalanche struck them on Friday,"" Sandesh Pandey, who runs the tour company which organized the hike, told Reuters.
Mount Annapurna, in northwest Nepal, is the world's tenth highest mountain at 8,091 meters (26,545 feet) and its base camp is popular with thousands of trekkers who visit annually.
The three Nepali guides are also not reachable, said Mira Acharya, a tourism department official in Kathmandu.
Four helicopters have been deployed for the search and rescue mission with police and local volunteers also looking for the trekkers, Acharya said, adding, however, that rough weather conditions were making the operation difficult.
The incident comes as the annual trekking season in Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountain peaks including Mount Everest, is drawing to a close.
It could potentially dampen the mood for the Himalayan nation's tourism industry, yet to recover from a devastating earthquake which killed nearly 9,000 people in 2015 including 18 climbers and their guides at the base camp of Mount Everest.
Cash-strapped Nepal earns 4% of GDP through income from tourists.
About 8% of the nearly 1.1 million tourists who visited the country in 2019 went hiking or mountain climbing, according to official estimates.
Separately, four rescue helicopters on Saturday evacuated nearly 200 trekkers in the Annapurna region – about 140 of them foreigners - to safer locations, police said. Their nationalities are not yet known."

NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - China and Myanmar inked dozens of deals on Saturday to speed up infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian nation, as Beijing seeks to cement its hold over a neighbor increasingly isolated by the West.
But no major new projects were agreed during the two-day visit by President Xi Jinping, the first of any Chinese leader in 19 years. Analysts said Myanmar was generally cautious of investments by Beijing and was also being careful ahead of elections later this year.
Still, Xi and Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi signed 33 agreements shoring up key projects that are part of the flagship Belt and Road Initiative, China’s vision of new trade routes described as a “21st century silk road”.
They agreed to hasten implementation of the China Myanmar Economic Corridor, a giant infrastructure scheme worth billions of dollars, with agreements on railways linking southwestern China to the Indian Ocean, a deep sea-port in conflict-riven Rakhine state, a special economic zone on the border, and a new city project in the commercial capital of Yangon.
They did not address a controversial $3.6 billion Beijing-backed mega dam, where work has been stalled since 2011, reflecting the contentiousness of Chinese investment in Myanmar, where many are uncomfortable with the sway Beijing has over its smaller neighbor.
""While a large number of different agreements have been signed, there is no Big Bang here,"" said Richard Horsey, a Yangon-based analyst with the International Crisis Group.
""The overall impression is that Myanmar is being cautious about Chinese investment, especially ahead of elections planned later in the year, he said.
""China will be hoping that this is an incremental step toward realizing its mega-infrastructure goals, and that further progress can be locked in over the coming months,"" he said.
‘DERAILED’ BY WEST
At a welcoming ceremony on Friday, Xi hailed a “new era” of relations between the countries.
“We are drawing a future roadmap that will bring to life bilateral relations based on brotherly and sisterly closeness in order to overcome hardships together and provide assistance to each other,” Xi said. He was scheduled to leave later on Saturday.
Suu Kyi called China “a great country playing an important role in the international affairs and the world economy” but urged for economic projects that avoid environmental degradation and benefit locals.
Xi also met leaders from political parties in ethnic areas riven with civil conflict where Chinese infrastructure projects are underway.
Sai Kyaw Nyunt, joint-secretary of the Shan Nationalities League for Democracy, one of the ethnic politicians invited to meet Xi, said it was only a handshake.
“Our country is very small and powerless,” he said, “So they treat us that way.”
The two countries have historically had a fraught relationship, but have moved closer since 2017, when Myanmar was internationally condemned for its treatment of minority Rohingya Muslims in Rakhine state.
More than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee western Myanmar after a military crackdown that the United Nations has said was executed with “genocidal intent”. China has defended the country on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal.
An article in Chinese state media ahead of the state visit said Myanmar had been “derailed” by its engagement with the West and only China was willing to “pull Myanmar from the sludge”.
“But after some turbulence, Myanmar realized there were double standards in the approach Western countries had taken on human rights issues and began to turn to China for diplomatic and economic help,” the article in the Global Times said."

KUALA LUMPUR/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Trade ministers from India and Malaysia are likely to meet on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos next week amid a palm oil spat between the two countries, a Malaysian government spokesman told Reuters on Friday.
Hindu-majority India has repeatedly objected to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad speaking out against its recent policies which critics say discriminate against Muslims.
Malaysia, a Muslim-majority nation, is the second biggest producer and exporter of palm oil and India's restrictions on the refined variety of the commodity imposed last week have been seen as a retaliation for Mahathir's criticism of New Delhi's actions.
India's trade minister Piyush Goyal denied on Thursday that the government was trying to hit out at Malaysia in particular.
The row between the countries, nevertheless, pushed benchmark Malaysian palm futures to its biggest weekly decline in more than 11 years on Friday.
No agenda has been set for the proposed meeting between Goyal and his Malaysian counterpart Darell Leiking on Friday, the spokesman for Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry said, adding that the request for a meeting had come from India.
An Indian government source said a meeting was indeed likely with Leiking. A spokeswoman for India's trade ministry did not respond to a request for comment.
Reuters reported on Thursday that Malaysia did not want to escalate the palm spat with India by talking of any retaliation for now, after Mahathir's media adviser called for tighter regulations on Indian expatriates and products. Malaysia instead wants to rely on diplomacy.
A separate Indian government source said it was important for New Delhi also to talk things out with Malaysia.
""We too have a lot to lose in Malaysia, there are 2 million Indian-origin people there,"" the source said.
There were a total of 117,733 Indian nationals registered as foreign labor in Malaysia as at June 2019, accounting for nearly 6% of the total foreign workforce in the country. Ethnic Malaysian-Indians are the third-largest community in the Southeast Asian country.
Another reason for frosty ties between the countries is the continued presence of controversial Indian Islamic preacher Zakir Naik in Malaysia, said one of the sources.
Naik, who faces charges of money laundering and hate speech in India, has lived in Malaysia for more than three years and has permanent residency in the country. He denies the Indian accusations.
The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorized to talk to the media."

""Getting back to work does not mean getting back to business as usual. Going forward we will put several new policies and security procedures in place,"" Garry Reid, a senior Pentagon intelligence official, said in a statement.
Three U.S. sailors were killed and eight other people were wounded in the attack at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. A deputy sheriff shot dead the gunman, Saudi Air Force Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani.
After the attack, the U.S. military grounded Saudi pilots and restricted the some 850 visiting Saudi military personnel in the country to classroom training as part of a ""safety stand-down"" during which time it reviewed vetting procedures. 
Reid said in a statement that all military departments could fully resume training when the new procedures were in place.

Next week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper is due to visit the base in Pensacola, Florida, where the shooting took place and will brief base leadership on the planned changes in vetting and security, the Pentagon says.

TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduras on Friday effectively ended the mandate of an anti-graft body backed by the Organization of American States (OAS), dealing another setback to the fight against corruption in the region.
In a statement, the Honduran foreign ministry said the government and the OAS had failed to agree on a renewal of the mandate for the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH).
It said there had been discontent in some sectors of Honduras about its perceived overreach.
The OAS criticized the decision and defended its record in the troubled Central American country.
""During its operation, the mission actively and successfully collaborated with the Honduran institutions to face the endemic problem of corruption in the country,"" the statement said.
""Unfortunately, the Honduran government's position has been to not to join us."" The current mandate expires on Jan. 19, 2020.
Honduran lawmakers allied with President Juan Orlando Hernandez voted last year against renewing the mandate for the agency, which was formed in 2016 and has tackled public corruption and illicit campaign financing.
Pressure has been mounting on Hernandez. Last year, a U.S. jury found his brother, Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernandez, guilty of conspiring to import cocaine, illicit weapons possession and lying to U.S. authorities.
During the trial, witnesses also alleged that Hernandez pledged to protect his brother from extradition and called for bribes to secure power for himself and the ruling National Party. Hernandez denied the allegations.
Hernandez was sworn in as president two years ago after an election the OAS said was marred by irregularities, and called for a new vote."

BERLIN/CAIRO (Reuters) - Eastern Libya ports controlled by commander Khalifa Haftar, who is trying to seize the capital Tripoli, are shutting down oil exports, slashing national crude output by more than half and ramping up tensions ahead of a summit in Germany to discuss the country's conflict.
The dramatic move came as Germany and the United Nations try to persuade Haftar and his foreign backers at the Berlin summit on Sunday to halt his nine-month campaign to take Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognized government.
Tribesmen in areas controlled by Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) faction on Friday stormed the eastern Zueitina oil export port and announced the closure of all terminals under LNA control.
LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari later told reporters that the ""Libyan people"" had closed the oil ports. A source in state oil company NOC said the LNA and an eastern oil protection force had ordered the closure of the ports. The oil protection force confirmed exports had been stopped.
Libya's oil production was an estimated 1.3 million barrels a day before the closures.
Analysts said the closure of oil ports would not have been possible without the blessing of the LNA leadership. Eastern authorities tolerate little dissent, human rights groups say.
The tribesmen allied with Haftar earlier accused the Tripoli government of using oil revenues to pay foreign fighters - a reference to Turkey's decision to send soldiers and fighters from Syria's civil war to western Libya to help the Tripoli government fend off the LNA campaign.
The Turkish move has undermined recent LNA gains made on the Tripoli front thanks to Russian mercenaries and combat drone support from the United Arab Emirates, restoring a stalemate.
BERLIN SUMMIT
The ports closure mark a setback for the Berlin conference on Sunday where Haftar, who backs a parallel government in the east, and the Tripoli prime minister Fayez al-Serraj as well as their foreign backers and Western powers are expected.
The one-day summit is the latest in a series of failed conferences and negotiations to stabilize Libya, which has been in chaos since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
NOC had earlier warned against closing terminals in eastern Libya.
""The oil and gas sector is the lifeblood of the Libyan economy ... they should not be used as a card for political bargaining,"" NOC Chairman Mustafa Sanalla said in a statement.
The Tripoli-based NOC has sought to stay out of the conflict but faces pressure from the LNA, which controls most of the country's oil ports. NOC channels oil and gas revenue through the central bank, which mainly works with the Tripoli government though it also pays some public servants in the east.

Former prime minister and ex-army general Umaro Cissoko Embalo has been hailed as the winner of last month's runoff vote. But runner-up and ruling party candidate Domingos Simoes Pereira has contested the results saying the election was marred by fraud.
In a ruling backed by five out of eight judges, the Supreme Court called on the national electoral commission to clarify tabulation procedures used for the vote ""to ensure the freedom and fairness of the exercise in electoral will.""
The commission did not immediately respond to the court's decision. Earlier on Friday it released the final results, confirming Embalo's victory with 54% of votes cast versus Pereira's 46%.
Uncertainty over the outcome of the election would extend protracted political turmoil in the coup-prone West African country of 1.6 million people that has hobbled economic development and made voters weary of the ruling class.
A representative of Embalo's MADEM-15 party rejected the court's ruling saying the publication of the final results made his victory irreversible."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump turned to some legal heavyweights to help defend him in his Senate impeachment trial with the addition on Friday of former independent counsel Ken Starr, who paved the way for former President Bill Clinton's 1998 impeachment, and prominent lawyer Alan Dershowitz.
The team defending the Republican president will be led by White House counsel Pat Cipollone and Trump private attorney Jay Sekulow, Trump's legal team and a source said. Trump adviser and former Florida attorney general Pam Bondi and former independent counsel Robert Ray will also be on the team, according to the source familiar with the team's composition.
The trial formally got underway on Thursday, though it will start in earnest on Tuesday with opening statements. The trial in the Republican-led Senate will determine whether Trump is removed from office.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives voted to impeach Trump on two charges arising from his dealings with Ukraine - abuse of power and obstruction of Congress - on Dec. 18 after an investigation that centered on his request that Ukraine investigate political rival Joe Biden, the president's possible Democratic opponent in the Nov. 3 election.
The Senate is expected to acquit Trump, as none of its 53 Republicans has voiced support for removing him, a step that requires a two-thirds majority. Trump has denied wrongdoing and has called the impeachment process a sham.
Starr is a former federal judge who held a senior Justice Department post under Republican President George H.W. Bush. Starr's voluminous investigative report on Clinton's sexual affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky served as the basis for his impeachment in the House on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The Senate in 1999 acquitted Clinton, a Democrat. Starr had recommended impeachment on 11 grounds.
In 2016, Starr was ousted as president of Baylor University, a private Baptist institution in Texas, after an investigation by an outside law firm determined that university leaders had mishandled accusations of sexual assault by football players. Critics of Starr at the time accused him of turning a blind eye to sexual violence on his campus after pursuing Clinton for a sexual relationship.
Both Starr and Dershowitz also served as lawyers for financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who was found dead in his New York jail cell last year where he was being held on new sex trafficking charges.
In 1999, Trump made unflattering comments about Starr, saying in an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show after Clinton's acquittal: ""I think Ken Starr's a lunatic."" In a 1999 interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Trump said, ""Starr's a freak. I bet he's got something in his closet.""
'DREAM TEAM'
Dershowitz has been a well-known figure in U.S. legal circles for decades. He was a long-time Harvard Law School professor and was part of the so-called ""Dream Team"" of lawyers who won a 1995 acquittal of former National Football League star and actor O.J. Simpson on charges of murdering his wife and a friend of hers. Dershowitz's past clients also have included boxer Mike Tyson and televangelist Jim Bakker.
Both Starr and Dershowitz were defenders of Trump in media interviews during the impeachment process. Sources working with the Trump legal team said the president wanted Dershowitz because of his background as a constitutional scholar. 
A statement provided by Dershowitz from Trump's legal team said he will present oral arguments at the trial to address the constitutional arguments against impeachment and removal from office. 
""While Professor Dershowitz is non partisan when it comes to the constitution - he opposed the impeachment of President Bill Clinton and voted for Hillary Clinton - he believes the issues at stake go to the heart of our enduring Constitution,"" the statement said.
Ray succeeded Starr as independent counsel during the Clinton investigation. On the day before Clinton left office, Ray announced that he would not criminally prosecute him in connection with perjury and obstruction.
One person who was not added to the team that will defend Trump at the trial is his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who played a key role in the Ukraine matter.
Democrat Adam Schiff heads a team of seven House members who will serve as prosecutors. Schiff, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is a former federal prosecutor in Los Angeles.
Still to be determined is whether the Senate will allow witness testimony and new evidence or whether senators will decide the case as Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has suggested using only the material amassed by House investigators.
Trump involved the national collegiate champion Louisiana State University football team in the impeachment drama during its celebratory visit to the White House.
""A lot of presidents, some good, some not so good,"" Trump told the team. ""But you've got a good one now, even though they're trying to impeach the son of a bitch. Can you believe that?"" Citing themes he has raised in his bid to win re-election on Nov. 3, Trump then touted the economy and the U.S. military, adding, ""We took out those terrorists like your football team would have taken out those terrorists, right?""
A pivotal event in the Ukraine matter was Trump's firing of Marie Yovanovitch last year as U.S. ambassador in Kiev, a move encouraged by Giuliani, who was pressing Ukraine to investigate Biden.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo broke his silence on Friday on documents released this week suggested that Lev Parnas, a Giuliani associate, was involved in monitoring Yovanovitch's movements before Trump removed her, raising questions about her security.

""We will do everything we need to do to evaluate whether there was something that took place there,"" Pompeo, who refused to cooperate in the House impeachment inquiry, told conservative radio host Tony Katz. ""I suspect that much of what's been reported will ultimately prove wrong, but our obligation, my obligation as secretary of state, is to make sure that we evaluate, investigate.""

Johnson had proposed a crowdfunding campaign to allow the Big Ben bell in parliament's clock tower to sound even though it has been largely silent since 2017 while renovation work is carried out on the tower.
Members of the public have donated more than 200,000 pounds ($260,580) of the 500,000 pounds Johnson said it would cost for Big Ben to bong, but the government has now said parliamentary authorities do not believe they would be allowed to accept the money.
""January 31st is a significant moment in our history as the United Kingdom leaves the EU and regains its independence,"" Johnson's office said in a statement setting out its plans to mark Brexit - a moment which will be celebrated by some and mourned by others in a country still divided on the issue.
""The government intends to use this as a moment to heal divisions, re-unite communities and look forward to the country that we want to build over the next decade.""
On the evening of Jan. 31, Johnson will address the nation, his office said. Earlier in the day he will hold a special meeting of his top team of ministers in northern England.
The government said it plans to broadcast the light display in Downing Street on social media, including a clock counting down to 2300 GMT, the moment Brexit officially takes place. Other buildings around the government district of Whitehall will also be lit up.
The Union Jack be flown on all of the flag poles around Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ), where Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has been given permission to hold a party with speeches and music.
A commemorative Brexit coin, inscribed with the words ""Peace, prosperity and friendship with all nations"", will also be put into circulation on the day Britain leaves the EU, the government said."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Labour Party needs to do more to promote aspiration and look more like a government-in-waiting, the party's business spokeswoman, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said when she formally launched her leadership campaign on Friday.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is stepping down, after the party's worst election performance since 1935 gave Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives a large majority in parliament.
Long-Bailey is currently second in the race to succeed Corbyn, behind the party's Brexit spokesman Keir Starmer, according to a YouGov poll of party members for The Times newspaper.
Speaking to party members in Manchester, northern England, not far from where she grew up as the daughter of a trade union official, the 40-year-old lawyer said Labour had failed to convince the public they were competent to run the country.
""The truth is many didn't trust us, whether it was Brexit, whether it was tackling anti-Semitism - they didn't believe in us enough,"" she said. ""There is no point promising the world, if people don't trust you with the basics,"" she said.
Labour's policy of renegotiating Johnson's Brexit deal then holding a second referendum dissatisfied both Brexit supporters and opponents, and under Corbyn there was a surge of complaints about anti-Semitism within the party.
""To win, the Labour Party does need a new professionalism. We need to look like a government in waiting,"" Long-Bailey said.
Long-Bailey is close to trade unions and has been characterised as wanting to keep more of Corbyn's policies than Starmer, a 57-year-old former head of England's prosecution service who wanted Corbyn to take a tougher line against Brexit.
However, on Friday Long-Bailey said existing Labour policies needed to be supplemented with a greater focus on aspiration.
""We talked quite a lot about individual polices in relation to helping the most vulnerable – which we should do, because we're the Labour Party, we're the party that does that. But we didn't match that with a message of aspiration.""
In a further nod to the right wing of the Labour Party, Long-Bailey also briefly mentioned the optimism created by the 1997 victory of Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is now a hate figure for many on the left due to his support for the 2003 Iraq war.
Long-Bailey also said parliament in Westminster felt almost as remote as the EU in Brussels to many voters, and pledged to close the unelected upper house of parliament and replace it with an elected senate outside London."
714,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 04:23PM ET</span>",Can't sell your presidential plane? Mexico mulls raffle instead,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday floated the idea of raffling off his predecessor's $130 million jet after the government's efforts to sell the plane over the past year came to nothing.
Mexico has yet to find a buyer for the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 787 Dreamliner, which the leftist Lopez Obrador has cast as a symbol of excess and corruption in previous governments in a country where around half the population lives in poverty.
Seeking to paint his predecessors as part of an out-of-touch elite, Lopez Obrador has made a point of taking commercial flights, and has auctioned off many government planes and helicopters.
But selling the luxury jet, acquired by former President Enrique Pena Nieto in 2012, has proven tough. Earlier this week Lopez Obrador said the aircraft would return to Mexico from California after potential sales to private buyers fell through.
One option under consideration is to offload the plane in a raffle, with the national lottery selling six million tickets at about 500 pesos ($26.70) each, Lopez Obrador said.
""The people will decide what's best,"" he told reporters at a regular news conference on Friday.
Later in the day, Transport Minister Javier Jimenez Espriu appeared taken by surprise when consulted about the raffle by a reporter, who asked him whether the idea was feasible.
""No, I don't think so,"" Jimenez Espriu said in a video published on social media by newspaper Reforma. ""I think there are other more immediate (options).""
Mexico has already set out several options to dispose of the plane, include selling it to a group of businesses, renting it by the hour, or bartering it for medical equipment.
Lopez Obrador said one prospective buyer this week offered $125 million. But Mexico could not sell it below a United Nations-backed valuation of $130 million, he explained.
The spacious jet, which has been reconfigured to fly only 80 people, has a large ""presidential suite"" and a private bath.

Ortega told Reuters she learned the news when she visited Ferrer on Thursday but that he received the documents in his case on Jan. 13. He has yet to stand trial, and the documents did not include a date for the proceedings, she said.
The Cuban government, which calls the 49-year-old Ferrer a U.S.-backed counterrevolutionary, declined to comment.
Authorities arrested Ferrer on Oct. 1 on the assault charges, which his relatives and his opposition organization, the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU), say was done to silence him.
International rights organizations including Amnesty International have described him as a prisoner of conscience and have campaigned for his release.
Ferrer was one of 75 dissidents arrested in 2003 during a nationwide crackdown known as the Black Spring. He was released on parole in 2011 and soon after formed UNPACU, which has become one of Cuba's largest and most active opposition organizations.
The Cuban government regularly detains rights activists for a few hours or days, in what the activists describe as a long-running campaign of harassment and repression.
But in recent years, it has become unusual for the authorities to arrest a prominent figure for more than a week.
Cuba does not usually comment on the detention of dissidents, which would give them more publicity.
But given the high profile nature of Ferrer's case and the international campaign for his release, the government broadcast a special television report on him in November, in which he was denounced as aggressive and a liar.
Critics of the authorities in Havana say the government appears to be tightening control, fearing unrest over deepening economic woes following tighter U.S. sanctions, especially since internet service was expanded, increasing access to information and the ability to mobilize."

The bridge is close to the capital's central Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) where thousands have been camped out for months, with recent clashes causing the authorities to restrict access to the crossing. The protester died after a tear gas canister was launched directly at his neck, the medical sources said.
""Saboteurs attacked the barricades in the Sinak bridge area and security forces have been using non-lethal methods to stop them for hours,"" said a spokesman for the prime minister.
Mass protests have gripped Iraq since Oct. 1 and protesters, most of them young, are demanding an overhaul of a political system they see as profoundly corrupt and keeping most Iraqis in poverty. More than 450 people have been killed.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Friday urged Iran to send the black boxes from the passenger plane shot down by its forces to France for analysis and said the first remains of victims should soon arrive back in Canada.
Trudeau told a news conference in Ottawa that France was one of the few countries with the ability to read the flight and cockpit data recorders from the jet, which he said were badly damaged.
Iran says it shot down Ukrainian International Airlines flight 752 last week by accident, killing all 176 people aboard, 57 of whom were Canadian.
""Iran does not have the level of technical expertise and mostly the equipment necessary to be able to analyze these damaged black boxes quickly,"" Trudeau said.
""There is a beginning of a consensus that ... (France) would be the right place to send those black boxes to get proper information from them in a rapid way and that is what we are encouraging the Iranian authorities to agree to.""
In the week since Tehran said its military had shot down the aircraft, Iran's government has said international authorities looking into the tragedy would have access to the black-box data, but that has yet to happen, slowing the investigation.
More than two thirds of Canadians are not confident there will be a full and accurate account of the disaster, an Angus Reid Institute poll released on Friday said.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif held a rare face-to-face meeting with his Canadian counterpart, Francois-Philippe Champagne, on Friday in Muscat, Oman. The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 2012.
In a statement, Canada's foreign ministry said Zarif agreed on the need for ""a transparent analysis of the black box data,"" and that the ministers ""discussed the duty Iran has towards the families of the victims – including compensation"".
Zarif wrote on Twitter after the meeting that both countries' experts would continue to exchange information, adding ""politicization"" of the tragedy must be rejected and that the focus should be on the victims' families.
'BITTER TRAGEDY'
In Ottawa, Trudeau told reporters his government would provide C$25,000 ($19,100) in immediate aid to the families of the victims, but he added that Canada expects Iran to offer compensation.
Trudeau said about 20 families of Canadian victims had requested the return of the bodies and that he expected the first remains to be repatriated in the coming days. He gave no further details.
The bodies of all 11 Ukrainians who died in the crash have been identified and will be transported to Ukraine on Jan. 19, the interior ministry in Kiev said in a statement.
With Iran facing a deepening crisis as it grapples with unrest at home and rising pressure from abroad, the Islamic Republic's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei delivered his first Friday prayers sermon in eight years.
He described the shooting down of the plane as a ""bitter tragedy that burned through our heart"". But he stopped short of offering a direct apology for the disaster and instead urged Iranians to unite and show solidarity by turning out in numbers for the February parliamentary election.
Tension between Tehran and Washington has ratcheted higher since 2018 when the United States withdrew from Iran's nuclear pact with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have hammered the Iranian economy.
The standoff erupted into tit-for-tat military strikes this month, when Washington killed Iran's top general Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at Baghdad airport on Jan. 3, then Iran launched missile strikes at U.S. targets in Iraq on Jan. 8.
In the tense hours following those strikes, the Ukrainian airliner was shot down in error as it took off from Tehran.
Russia lent Iran some support over the disaster, saying on Friday that the airliner had been shot down when Iran's military was spooked by reports of advanced U.S. F-35 stealth fighters in the air in the Iranian border area.
""I'd like to underline the edginess that always accompanies such situations,"" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in Moscow, adding that the incident was human error and that he was not trying to excuse anyone for what happened.
The White House declined to comment, and the Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment."

Booze vending machines, party boats, free bars and adverts for alcoholic drinks were also forbidden in Mallorca's Playa de Palma and Magaluf, as well as the West End in Ibiza's Sant Antoni. 
Tourists will also not be allowed to buy alcohol in those areas between 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., authorities said.
The new regulations also outlawed ""balconing"", where revellers jump off balconies, often into hotel swimming pools - a practice that has killed dozens of drunken visitors over the years. 
""With this, the Balearic Islands become the first destination in Europe to fight back against tourism based on excess,"" Iago Negueruela, the regional official in charge of economy and tourism, told reporters.
Anyone ""balconing"" or allowing it to happen would be expelled from their hotel and could be fined up to 60,000 euros ($66,540), he said.
Some traders said the measures would hurt small businesses on the Mediterranean islands.

Gaultier, 67, did not detail what would happen to his namesake brand, owned by private Spanish fashion and fragrance group Puig, only saying in a brief statement that it would continue to exist. 
""I will be celebrating my 50th anniversary in fashion with a major Haute Couture fashion show,"" Gaultier said in short statement. 
""Be reassured that Gaultier Paris will go on, with a new project which I am the instigator, and that will be revealed to you very soon,"" he said.
His fashion firm could not be reached for further comment on whether Gaultier would be appointing a successor as creative chief, or what his plans were. 
The affable Frenchman, who will be celebrating his 50-year-career in the industry with his swansong runway show next week, brought an often elusive sense of fun to the world of fashion. 
Some of his tongue-in-cheek collections in recent years included one themed around cigarettes, which he presented as a dig at overly moralistic attitudes.
Gaultier, who has also designed costumes for films and co-presented cult television show Eurotrash, has long been known for pushing boundaries in fashion, blurring the lines between men's and women's clothing. 
One of the few household names in high fashion, Gaultier Gaultier emerged as one of the leading young talents in French fashion during the early 1980s, shaking up the establishment with wild designs drawn from street culture, punk and the gay club scene.
His reputation as a provocateur brought him both fame and contempt from other fashion designers. 
He is best known for some of his sexy designs and stage costumes, including a conical bra worn by singer Madonna, as well as the sailor-style, white and blue striped tops that Gaultier often wears himself. 
In recent years he had dropped more regular collections, focusing on producing one-of-a-kind ranges presented during Haute Couture fashion weeks in Paris. 
His brand still produces perfumes. 
Gaultier made his first steps in the industry as an apprentice of French designer Pierre Cardin in the 1970s, going on to present his first individual collection in 1976.

He later also worked as a designer for Hermes, which used to own a large stake in his label before selling it to Puig in 2011.

LISBON (Reuters) - Citing freedom of expression, a Lisbon court has ruled against Isabel dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angola's former president, who had demanded the removal of several tweets by a long-time Portuguese critic accusing her of money-laundering.
Thursday's ruling, which Reuters saw on Friday, said the decision did not mean the court agreed with the tweets' content and did not call into question dos Santos' presumption of innocence. However it denied dos Santos' request for the removal of the posts and payment of damages.
She had called the posts slanderous in her lawsuit.
""Freedom of expression and information shall take precedence"" over dos Santos' personality rights, or reputation and good name, the court said.
A spokeswoman for dos Santos told Reuters the businesswoman considered that the court decision ""valued the right to freedom of expression in detriment of the right to defend her good name"". She did not say if dos Santos would appeal.
Angolan authorities froze dos Santos' assets in the African country in late December following allegations by prosecutors that she and her husband had steered payments of more than $1 billion from state companies Sonangol and Sodiam to firms in which they held stakes. Dos Santos and her husband have denied any wrongdoing.
The tweets in question dated back to October when Ana Gomes, a Portuguese former European Parliament member and ex-senior member of a European Parliament group looking into corruption and organized crime, made six posts on Twitter about dos Santos.
They followed an interview by dos Santos to news agency Lusa in which she said she was heavily indebted due to her investments.
""Isabel dos Santos is very indebted because, when settling her debts, she launders big time!"" said one of Gomes' tweets, cited in the court's ruling. In another tweet cited by the court, Gomes said dos Santos laundered Angolan money through small local lender Eurobic, in which she is the main shareholder, and through other investments in Portugal.
The court ruled that Gomes was ""not required to completely prove the truth of the facts"", but her own professional knowledge, research and familiarity with various investigative articles were enough to give the tweets sufficient plausibility.
Reuters exclusively reported this week that Portugal's central bank is carrying out an inspection of Eurobic to assess its procedures against money laundering.
Eurobic said it was complying with all requirements to prevent illegal transactions and that it saw the inspection as ""part of the normal supervision process"" in the banking sector."
723,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 01:55PM ET</span>",Families of Iran crash victims face politically charged litigation,"By Tracy Rucinski and Tim Hepher
CHICAGO/PARIS (Reuters) - Families of the 176 people killed when Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner face a complicated legal battle where backing from the victims' governments may be crucial as they seek damages, legal experts said.
Lawyers say many relatives will automatically be entitled to compensation equivalent to $170,000 from Ukraine International Airlines under the 1999 Montreal Convention, which establishes airline liability in the case of death or injury to passengers, and are entitled then to try to sue for more.
But others may be entitled to a much smaller amount.
Iran is not a member of the Montreal treaty but only its less flexible predecessor, known as the Warsaw Convention.
In theory, that means that while families of foreign-based victims who were returning home from Iran when the plane was shot down on Jan. 8 may get the full payout, those on a single ticket or who started their journey in Iran or Afghanistan - some victims were Afghans - may be entitled to only $25,000 under the Warsaw Convention, several lawyers said.
The airline, which mentions both treaties in its published rules, said it could not comment on which would apply until legal procedures were completed. Ukraine's government has so far said only that it will apply the Montreal terms to its citizens.
International rules do not allow an airline to be pursued for the most severe category of ""punitive"" damages. For that, most lawyers say families must embark on the tortuous process of suing Iran, for which political backing is seen as crucial.
""Iran has a moral obligation to the families and it will take political support of Canada, Ukraine and the other interested nations to ensure that Iran meets its obligation,"" said Justin Green of law firm Kreindler & Kreindler.
Iran shot down the airliner when its forces were on alert after firing missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq in retaliation for a deadly U.S. strike against one of its generals. It acknowledged making a mistake only after days of denials.
Five countries whose citizens were killed have said Tehran should pay compensation to families of the victims, but have not said what support they plan to offer.
Iran has expressed ""profound regrets"" over the downing of the plane and promised to extend support to families, but has not yet formally addressed the issue of compensation.
Tehran has urged all countries involved in the crash to avoid turning it into a political issue.
SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY
Taking on any state as a private citizen faces huge barriers including the reluctance of many courts to challenge sovereign immunity. It is not yet known whether Iran will claim immunity.
For families inside Iran, already facing a potential disadvantage against their overseas counterparts on automatic compensation because of Iran's treaty memberships, suing the government is widely viewed as challenging, Iran analysts said.
Iran has described the crash victims as martyrs, making it difficult, if not impossible, to take action against the state because of sensitivities over the term, they said.
Some observers have drawn comparisons with the downing of an IranAir jet by a U.S. warship in 1988. Some 290 people were killed and Iran later sued the United States over the incident, which occurred at a time of tense relations.
The two sides reached a settlement in 1996 at the International Court of Justice in which the United States did not admit liability but agreed to pay up to $300,000 to families of each of the Iranian passengers.
Peter Neenan, partner at London law firm Stewarts, calculates a comparable payment today would be worth $400,000.
""I would like to see Iran make the first steps and say we want to compensate and here is a number – at least to get the conversation started,"" he said.
LOCKERBIE FALLOUT
The Iran Air case triggered a row over jurisdiction, with the United States unsuccessfully arguing that the world court should not intervene, while battles to find the best location are also common in civil disputes following air crashes around the world.
Others see in the volatile course of Middle East diplomacy a parallel with the legal fallout over the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which over 250 died.
Green, whose firm Kreindler & Kreindler represented Lockerbie victims, said U.S. government pressure including sanctions against Libya was vital to ultimately winning a $2.7 billion settlement against the Libyan government.
The final part of the settlement was absorbed into a broader deal between Libya and the United States to ease years of tensions between the North African country and the West.
Tension between Iran and the United States has increased since 2018, when Washington withdrew from Tehran's nuclear pact with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have hurt the Islamic Republic's economy."

GUATEMALA CITY/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - More than 3,500 Central Americans had poured into Guatemala by Friday in U.S.-bound gatherings known as caravans, officials said, posing a headache for the leaders of Guatemala and Mexico amid fierce U.S. pressure to curb migration.
President Donald Trump has repeatedly urged the region to prevent such groups of migrants reaching Mexico's border with the United States, and the latest exodus from Honduras that began on Wednesday has been accompanied by U.S. border agents.
The migrants, some travelling in groups as small as a dozen people while others formed caravans of more than 100, said they planned to unite at the Guatemalan border city of Tecun Uman before crossing together into Ciudad Hidalgo, Mexico.
Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his government was monitoring the situation as the migrants approached, saying there were 4,000 jobs available on the southern border, as well as shelters and medical help.
""We are keeping an eye on everything,"" Lopez Obrador said during a regular press conference.
Lopez Obrador did not say if Mexico would seek to keep the migrants in the southern part of the country. Most Central Americans who leave their countries escaping poverty and violence are eager to make their way towards the United States.
Under U.S. pressure, Mexican security forces have increasingly broken up large groups as they head north.
On Wednesday, Guatemala's new President Alejandro Giammattei suggested Mexico would prevent any caravans from reaching the United States.
About a thousand migrants entered Guatemala on Thursday, with local officials busing some of the migrants back to the Honduran border to fill out official paperwork, said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's migration institute.
""We haven't returned people from Guatemala and we have a total of about 3,543 people who have so far crossed the border,"" Mena said.
At least 600 Honduran migrants spent the night under tents in a shelter in Guatemala City on Thursday night, sleeping on mattresses.
""Now we have more experience, and we know how to treat them,"" said Father Mauro Verzeletti, director of the Migrant House shelter in Guatemala City.
Guatemala's former President Jimmy Morales agreed last July with the U.S. government to implement measures aimed at reducing the number of asylum claims made in the United States by migrants fleeing Honduras and El Salvador, averting Trump's threat of economic sanctions.

New leader Giammattei said a top priority would be reviewing the text of migration agreements made with the United States.

LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - Swedish activist Greta Thunberg and a crowd of some 10,000 protesters marched in the Swiss city of Lausanne on Friday before many of them head to Davos next week to challenge political and business leaders to combat the climate crisis.
The 17-year-old, who launched the #FridaysforFuture movement that has sparked global protests, denounced a lack of government action to cut heat-trapping emissions before it is too late.
""So, we are now in a new year and we have entered a new decade and so far, during this decade, we have seen no sign whatsoever that real climate action is coming and that has to change,” Thunberg said in a speech in Lausanne.
“To the world leaders and those in power, I would like to say that you have not seen anything yet. You have not seen the last of us, we can assure you that. And that is the message that we will bring to the World Economic Forum in Davos next week.”
Protestors held signs including ""Wake up and Smell the Bushfires"" and ""It is late but it is not too late"".
Hundreds of campaigners will take trains over the weekend and then march to Klosters near Davos, which Thunberg is attending for the second year in a row and will take part in two panel events.
Climate change and environmental destruction top the risks highlighted by world decision-makers in a survey ahead of the 2020 gathering of the global elite.
This year's gathering takes place against the backdrop of some of Australia's worst ever bushfires. While the government there has avoided making a link to climate change, the fires have added to public concern about the heating of the planet.
Last year was the Earth's second-hottest since records began, and the world should brace itself for more extreme weather events like the bushfires ravaging much of Australia, the United Nations' World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday.

727,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 12:31PM ET</span>",Explainer: How close is Iran to producing a nuclear bomb?,"By Francois Murphy and Arshad Mohammed
VIENNA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The central achievement of the Iran nuclear deal - keeping Tehran at arm's length from nuclear weapons - is eroding.
The 2015 accord's many restrictions on Iran's atomic activities were built around one objective: to extend the ""breakout time"" Tehran would need to produce enough fissile material for one atomic bomb - if it decided to do so - to at least a year from around 2-3 months.
Iran maintains that it has never sought nuclear weapons and never would. It has long said it has enriched for civilian purposes including future nuclear energy and research projects.
    Tehran began breaching the deal's curbs last year in a step-by-step response to President Donald Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the deal in May 2018 and the reimposition of U.S. sanctions that have throttled Iran's vital oil exports.
    Those breaches have shortened the breakout time slightly, though Iran is far from sprinting ahead as fast as it could, reports by the U.N. nuclear watchdog policing the deal show.
But the breaches have been enough to prompt the European signatories to the deal to trigger its dispute resolution mechanism, raising the prospect of the global, United Nations sanctions that were lifted under the deal being reinstated.
WHAT HAS IRAN DONE?
Iran has contravened many of the deal's core restrictions, but has said it will continue to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency and its inspectors. The deal has imposed on Iran the most intrusive nuclear verification regime of any country, and it has not backed out of that yet.
* Enriched uranium - The deal limits Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium to 202.8 kg - less than half the amount it was producing per quarter before its accord with world powers, and a small fraction of the tonnes it possessed. This was the first of Iran's breaches last year, verified by the IAEA on July 1. The last quarterly IAEA report in November said the stockpile stood at 372.3 kg. It will have continued to increase since then.
* Enrichment level - The deal caps the fissile purity to which Iran can refine uranium to at 3.67%, far below the 20% it was achieving before the deal and the 90% that is weapons-grade. Iran breached that cap on July 8. Since then, however, its enrichment level has remained steady at up to 4.5%.
* Centrifuges - The deal only allows Iran to produce enriched uranium with about 5,000 first-generation IR-1 centrifuges at its Natanz plant. It can operate small numbers of more advanced - faster-producing, more durable and efficient - models there without accumulating enriched uranium. Iran had roughly 19,000 installed centrifuges before the deal.
The IAEA verified on Sept. 25 that Iran had begun enriching with advanced centrifuges, but in much smaller numbers than the IR-1s. Iran has brought online two 164-machine cascades of centrifuges that were dismantled under the deal, and installed smaller clusters of other models. As those come online, its production of enriched uranium is likely to increase.
The Islamic Republic has yet to breach the cap on IR-1 centrifuges at Natanz.
* Fordow - The deal bans enrichment at Fordow, a site that Iran secretly built inside a mountain and was exposed by Western intelligence services in 2009. Centrifuges are allowed there for other purposes, like producing stable isotopes https://www.iaea.org/topics/nuclear-science/isotopes/stable-isotopes. Iran began enriching there on Nov. 9 but only with a small number of IR-1s.
HOW CLOSE IS IRAN TO HAVING A BOMB NOW?
The breaches have eaten into the breakout time slightly, but estimates of the current breakout time vary. Many diplomats and nuclear experts also believe the starting point of one year is a conservative estimate.
    A European diplomat who previously put the breakout time at 12 months declined to offer an estimate but said Iran's actions were now ""having a serious impact"".
    Another diplomat pointed to a statement by France's foreign minister last week that it would take Iran one to two years to get a bomb, though it was not clear if that meant the necessary fissile material or an actual weapon.
    David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector and a hawk on Iran, said Tehran could within five to 10 months amass 900 kg of uranium enriched to 4.5% at its current rate. That amount, if further refined, could yield the 25 kg of weapons-grade, highly enriched uranium needed for one nuclear bomb.
WHAT MORE WOULD IRAN NEED TO DO?
Even if Iran had accumulated sufficient fissile material, it would need to assemble a bomb, probably one small enough to be carried by its ballistic missiles. How long that would take exactly is unclear, but stockpiling enough fissile material is widely seen as the biggest hurdle in producing a weapon.
Both U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran once had a nuclear weapons program that it halted. There is evidence suggesting Iran obtained a design for a nuclear weapon and carried out various types of work relevant to making one.
U.S. intelligence experts, however, believe Iran has yet to demonstrate an intention to shatter the 2015 deal, three U.S. government sources said, noting Tehran continues to grant the IAEA access to its declared nuclear facilities."

In a Feb. 8 contest that pre-campaign polls suggest is too tight to call, Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's re-election hopes may hinge on whether enough voters are feeling the benefit of a booming economy that has stretched public services still recovering from an economic crash a decade ago.
Austerity measures introduced to turn the public finances around included a lower rate of pay for new entrants to second level teaching. The government has said it will need a number of budgets to close the gap but the Teachers' Union of Ireland (TUI) said on Friday that progress was too slow.
One of the two main secondary school unions, the TUI, said over 1,100 schools, institutes of technology and technological universities would be affected by the strike.
Varadkar this week specifically decided to hold a national election on a Saturday for the first time in a century so parents would not have to organize childcare if their local school was being used as a polling station.
Elections have typically been held on Fridays in Ireland.
""We have exhausted every avenue open to us to bring this matter to resolution and have been left with no choice but to take strike action over the ongoing scandal of pay discrimination,"" TUI President Seamus Lahart said in a statement.
""The date's proximity to the general election affords our members a focus point to make pay discrimination a key election issue. In the coming days and weeks, candidates of all political hues should be asked to outline their views on this matter."""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Protests against the social and economic policies of Colombian President Ivan Duque will restart with more intensity this year, a top union leader said.
Marchers in the Andean country held mass demonstrations in November and December last year to demand a varied laundry list of concessions from Duque's right-wing government.
New protests will open on Tuesday with cacerolazos, Central Union of Workers (CUT) chief Diogenes Orjuela told Reuters late on Thursday, referring to a traditional Latin American form of dissent.
""I think (the protests) will be stronger. When we say stronger, they are demonstrations and strikes far from any violent intent,"" Orjuela said. ""The first strong action - like the one on Nov. 21, it will be similar - will take place in March.""
Protests last year were largely peaceful, but were marked by looting and attacks against public transport during their first few days, leading Cali and Bogota to institute curfews.
Five people died in connection with the demonstrations, which followed upheaval in other Latin American countries such as Ecuador, Chile and Bolivia.
The death of teenage protester Dilan Cruz, injured by a projectile fired by riot police, became a rallying cry for many marchers, who have demanded the force be dissolved. The squad is now banned from using the weapon that killed Cruz.
The National Strike Committee, comprising unions like the CUT and student groups, initially presented the government with 13 demands in talks - including stepped-up efforts to stop the murder of human rights activists and implement a peace deal with leftist rebels.
Protesters had asked the government scrap a tax reform proposal, especially a provision to cut taxes for corporations, but the bill was passed by Congress just before Christmas.
Demonstrators also opposed rumored increases to the pension age and cuts to the minimum wage for young people - policies Duque denies supporting.
The committee later increased its demands to 104 points, including opposition to fracking.
Most demands are things already agreed with students, indigenous communities and other groups, but not implemented, Orjuela said.
The committee has demanded one-on-one talks with the government, but Duque has insisted on wider participation by civil society, including business groups.
""What the strikes and marches have expressed is there is another opinion in Colombia,"" Orjuela said. ""It is very important for us that the government understand it must listen to that opinion.""
The committee and the government may meet in the coming days, he added."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's supreme leader threw his support behind the elite Revolutionary Guards in a rare sermon on Friday after their belated admission that they had accidentally downed an airliner triggered days of protests on the streets.
In his first Friday prayers sermon in eight years, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei also told worshippers chanting ""Death to America"" that the elite Guards could take their fight beyond Iran's borders after the U.S. killing of a top Iranian commander.
Washington said any threats would only isolate Iran further.
Khamenei's address comes amid a deepening crisis for Iran as it grapples with unrest at home and rising pressure from abroad.
Tension has steadily ratcheted higher since 2018, when the United States withdrew from Tehran's nuclear pact with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have hammered the economy.
The standoff erupted into tit-for-tat military strikes this month, when Washington killed top commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike on Jan. 3 and Iran launched missile strikes at U.S. targets in Iraq on Jan. 8.
In the tense aftermath, a Ukrainian airliner was shot down by mistake. But it took days for the Guards to admit this and protesters directed their rage at the elite force and the clerical system it was set up to defend.
""Our enemies ... were happy that they found an excuse to undermine the Guards, the armed forces and our system,"" Khamenei said in his sermon, heaping praise on the Guards for protecting Iran and renewing a call for U.S. troops to leave the region.
Khamenei said Soleimani's work of projecting Iran's military influence abroad would continue and said the Quds Force he commanded ""protects oppressed nations across the region.""
He said Quds Force soldiers were ""fighters without borders"".
The U.S. Department of State's special representative to Iran, Brian Hook, said in Washington that Iranian threats risked further isolating the country.
But Russia lent Iran some support over the airliner disaster, saying it had been shot down when Tehran was spooked by reports of advanced U.S. stealth fighters in the area.
""I'd like to underline the edginess that always accompanies such situations,"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said.
'BITTER TRAGEDY'
Protests, led by students, erupted in Tehran and other cities for four days over the shooting down of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, in which all 176 aboard were killed, mostly Iranians or dual nationals.
As the unrest picked up, U.S. President Donald Trump sent tweets in Farsi and English supporting the protesters, who were chanting ""Death to Khamenei"" and slogans against the Guards.
Khamenei said in his sermon: ""These American clowns who lie and say they are with the Iranian people should see who the Iranian people are.""
""The plane crash was a bitter tragedy that burned through our heart,"" Khamenei said. ""But some tried to use it as an excuse to overshadow the martyrdom of our great commander Soleimani.""
Stopping short of a direct apology for the plane disaster, he urged Iranians to unite and show solidarity by turning out in numbers for the February parliamentary election.
The funeral of Soleimani, long portrayed as a national hero in Iran but seen by the West as a ruthless adversary, had brought huge numbers of Iranian mourners to the streets.
On social media, some Iranians reacted angrily to Khamenei's Friday sermon and his comments on the plane disaster. ""Not a word of apology. Only arrogance,"" tweeted Mike Pouraryan.
Online footage during demonstrations had shown protesters being beaten and recordings of gunshots. Riot police were deployed in force on the streets, particularly outside universities, a focus for the unrest.
Iran's police denied firing at protesters.
Two months earlier, police launched a bloody crackdown on protests that erupted over sharp fuel price hikes, which added to the suffering of Iranians already hurt by U.S. sanctions.
In reaction to Washington's ""maximum pressure"" policy, Tehran has gradually scaled back on commitments to the nuclear deal, including lifting limits on its uranium enrichment.
Britain, France and Germany, which have been trying to salvage the pact, have subsequently launched the deal's dispute mechanism over Iran's violations, starting a diplomatic process that could lead to reimposing U.N. sanctions.
""These European countries cannot be trusted. Even their negotiations with Iran are full of deceit,"" Khamenei said.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - A former foreign minister and a coca farmer will be the candidates for president and vice president for exiled Bolivian President Evo Morales' political party in the May elections in the South American country, officials said on Friday.
Former Bolivian Foreign Minister David Choquehuanca, an Aymara indian, will be the presidential candidate for the Movement to Socialism (MAS) party in the vote, which will serve as a re-run of a disputed October election.
Coca farmer Andronico Rodriguez will join the ticket as the vice presidential candidate, MAS official and union leader Theodore Mamani confirmed to Reuters.
The ticket must formalize its participation in the election to the electoral tribunal by Feb. 3.
Choquehuanca, 58, is a veteran indigenous politician who was born in the Bolivian highlands. Rodriguez, 30, is currently vice president of a prominent coca farmer union in the city of Cochabamba.
Top MAS party officials are scheduled to meet this weekend in Buenos Aires, where Morales, who is barred from running for president again, is currently living under asylum.
Morales, a socialist leader who was at the helm of Bolivia for nearly 14 years, stepped down on Nov. 10 after a disputed election victory sparked protests and led to allies, the police and the military pulling their support.
Bolivia's electoral tribunal set May 3 as the date for fresh elections after an Organization of American States audit found serious irregularities in the way votes were counted in the disputed October election.
After initially going to Mexico, Morales arrived in Argentina in December, where he has remained vocal on politics, frequently taking aim through his Twitter account at the caretaker government of interim President Jeanine Anez.
Mamani said MAS chose Choquehuanca and Rodriguez on Thursday through consensus."

The proposed reforms, which triggered the resignation of the prime minister and government, are widely seen as giving Putin, 67, scope to extend his grip on power once he leaves the presidency in 2024.
Describing the changes as akin to a ""state coup"", Yulia Galyamina, a Moscow city councillor, urged residents to speak out by joining a rally on Sunday that was already due to be held to mark the murder of a journalist and lawyer 11 years ago. 
""The proposed changes to our constitution discriminate against the whole country and are repression against all of us,"" Galyamina wrote on social media. 
It was not immediately clear how much traction Galyamina's call would get in a city where a spate of big protests calling for election freedoms flared last year before fading again. 
Alexei Navalny, one of Russia's most prominent opposition politicians, spoke out against her idea, blaming the constitution itself for having allowed the Kremlin to dominate the political landscape. 
Navalny didn't name any particular area of the constitution, which demarcates a strong presidential system, but said it had allowed the authorities to control elections and hike the pension age without repercussion. 

""There's no need to defend it,"" he said.

New Prime Minister Robert Abela announced Lawrence Cutajar's resignation as police commissioner at a news conference on Friday, four days after he took office with a pledge to strengthen the rule of law on the Mediterranean island.
""In his resignation letter, Mr Cutajar wrote that the appointment of a new prime minister demanded change so that necessary reforms to the (police) force could start taking place,"" Abela said, praising Cutajar for his work.
Cutajar was appointed by Abela's predecessor, Joseph Muscat, who stepped down after criticism over Caruana Galizia's 2017 murder and after the middleman in the murder plot linked people in Muscat's inner circle to attempts at an alleged cover-up.
Police have charged three men suspected of planting the car bomb that killed Caruana Galizia, and a fourth suspected of masterminding the killing.
But there had been calls for Cutajar's removal for not doing more to investigate an aide to Muscat over his contacts with a businessman accused of complicity in the killing, though both the official and the businessman deny wrongdoing.
Paul Caruana Galizia, one of the murdered journalist's sons, welcomed Cutajar's departure and activists representing pressure group Occupy Justice said it was ""long overdue"".
Abela told the news conference he would consult the opposition over the appointment of the next police commissioner.
Abela said late on Thursday he had instructed government workers not to remove flowers and candles from a makeshift memorial to Caruana Galizia, who had repeatedly denounced corruption at the highest levels of government.
Abela also announced the appointment of a cabinet committee to discuss governance issues and propose changes in line with proposals made by a Council of Europe committee which visited Malta last year. The committee had said the prime minister has too many powers, including the power to nominate judges.

""There were at least six (U.S.) F-35 fighters in the air in the Iranian border area (at the time). This information has yet to be verified, but I'd like to underline the edginess that always accompanies such situations,"" Lavrov said.
Iran's downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, which killed all 176 people aboard, has created a crisis for the Islamic Republic's clerical rulers who have faced days of protests after the Iranian military admitted it had shot down the plane accidentally.
Lavrov, speaking at his annual news conference in Moscow, called the incident a human error and said he was not trying to excuse anyone for what happened.
But he said it was important to understand the context and that the incident had occurred hours after an Iranian missile attack on U.S. bases in Iraq, when Iranian forces were braced for some kind of U.S. military retaliation.
""There is information that the Iranians were expecting another attack from the United States after the strike but did not know what form it might take,"" said Lavrov."

Neighbors told him soldiers had also discovered his mother in a house where she had been hiding. None were ever seen again.
This week, the government opened a mass grave in his neighborhood. Families mourning long-lost loved ones were allowed to sift through the crumbling remains.
Prosper - who asked that only his first name be used to protect him from reprisals - searched among the jumble of bones and scraps of cloth, haunted by his inability to remember his mother's clothes. Suddenly a woman next to him cried out.
""She recognized the watch and clothes of her husband,"" he said. ""I haven't been able to remember the clothes or shoes my mother was wearing. Twenty-six years is a long time.""
Burundi's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, known by its French acronym CVR, told parliament this week that it had identified more than 4,000 mass graves across the country.
The tiny East African nation has suffered colonial occupation, civil war and decades of intermittent massacres. The government-run commission was set up in 2014 to investigate violence from 1885, when foreigners arrived in Burundi, until 2008, when a stalled peace deal to end the civil war was fully implemented.
It does not cover most of the rule of the current president, Pierre Nkurunziza. The U.N. says hundreds of Burundians have been killed in clashes with security forces since 2015, when Nkurunziza ran for a third, disputed term in office. The U.N. also warned last year that rights abuses are likely to spike again ahead of May elections.
Burundi's population is divided between the Tutsi and Hutu ethnic groups, as is neighboring Rwanda, where Hutu extremists slaughtered 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a 1994 genocide. Much of Burundi's civil war - which killed 300,000 people before it ended in 2005 - also had ethnic overtones.
So far, the commission has identified more than 142,000 victims of violence, commission chairman Pierre Claver Ndayicariye told lawmakers on Tuesday. Some may never be found.
One of the graves that was opened lies in the neighborhood of Kamenge in the capital Bujumbura. Inside lay the remains of 270 people.
The commission is preserving the remains for burial, along with weapons like hoes, machetes, hammers, and knives recovered nearby, said Clement Ninziza, deputy chairman of the commission.
The commission has not apportioned blame for the killings, but noted in its preliminary report that the site lay close to a near a former military post.
Residents said many people were buried there after a 1994 massacre by soldiers and a Tutsi militia. Prosper managed to run away. Neighbors told him of his family's fate.
""My mother was with many other women who were found hiding,"" he said. ""When the army officers came, they killed all of them, saying they were sorcerers. They were then brought to that mass grave."""

YANGON (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping flew into Myanmar on Friday for two days of talks to shore up massive infrastructure projects in the Southeast Asian nation isolated by the West over its treatment of the Rohingya Muslim minority.
State counselor Aung San Suu Kyi greeted him with a handshake on the steps of the presidential palace after a ceremonial welcome by the president and a military marching band, on the first day of a two-day visit, Xi's first as leader and the first of any Chinese president in 19 years.
Win Myint, the president, told reporters at the palace it was a ""very historic and important trip"".
Analysts say Xi will seek to reinvigorate stalled infrastructure projects central to his flagship Belt and Road Initiative described as a ""21st century silk road"".
The two countries have had a historically fraught relationship, with many in Myanmar suspicious of the tremendous sway China holds over its smaller neighbor, but have moved closer since the expulsion of the Rohingya in 2017 was met with international condemnation. 
More than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee western Myanmar after a military crackdown the United Nations has said was executed with ""genocidal intent"". China has defended the country on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal.
China is the second biggest investor in Myanmar, behind only Singapore, data published by the World Bank shows. Myanmar's exports to China, its largest trading partner, were worth $5.5 billion in 2018, while imports were worth $6.2 billion.
Hundreds of school children and government staff lined the road from the airport on Friday, waving flags and chanting, “Chinese president!” “May his health be good!”
“China always helps our country when we are in crisis or when we face natural disasters,” said Aye Aye Mu, a local teacher. “They always support us and send donations to us.”
But many in Myanmar view China warily and infrastructure projects have been deeply unpopular, uprooting thousands of villagers and wreaking environmental damage.
Protesters plan to gather outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon on Saturday to oppose the ""exploitation of natural resources"" in Myanmar, including the $3.6 billion Myitsone hydropower dam project, which was suspended in 2011 but may be restarted.
In one of the capital's most popular teashops, 34-year-old Aung Ko Latt, a businessman, said Myanmar was not equipped to evaluate Chinese projects to make sure they meet international standards and benefit local communities.

""They will exploit Myanmar under the current circumstances,"" he said.

OCHOPEE, Fla. (Reuters) - Thomas Aycock's life flashed before his eyes one night in the Everglades as a 13-foot Burmese python squeezed his arm and a leg in its coils. Aycock, who was trying to bag the snake by himself, still recalls feeling its tail across his back.
""I knew what it was doing, it was going for my throat,"" said the 54-year-old Florida Army National Guard major who was able to wrestle free during that incident in the summer of 2018. ""I said to myself, 'It can't go down like this.'""
That scare has not stopped him from returning again and again to the sprawling wetland, devoting almost every spare moment to searching the thick brush and sawgrass for more snakes, as he was doing during this interview. 
The state encourages hunters to capture or kill the giant, invasive south Asian snakes that are decimating local wildlife. Dozens of hunters are prowling the Everglades during Florida's 10-day Python Bowl, which ends Monday. Armed with long metal hooks that resemble fireplace pokers and bags, many hunters catch the snakes and take them in live. 
Those who take the most longest and heaviest pythons each will win $2,000 in cash. Other prizes include off-road vehicles.
Aycock and his fellow hunters are spending days and nights slowly creeping across the webs of levees that span the Everglades by foot, bicycle and souped-up SUV looking for the glint of an eye or the shine of brown and black scales.
First found in the Everglades around the year 2000, the snakes were introduced by pet owners and possibly a snake research facility that was destroyed when Hurricane Andrew struck the region in 1992. 
The behemoths, some of which measure more than 18 feet (5.5 m) long and weigh more than 100 pounds (45 kg), have wreaked havoc on the fragile ecosystem. A 2012 study in Everglades National Park by the United States Geological Survey found 99% fewer raccoons, 98% fewer opossums and 87% fewer bobcats. Massive snakes have even been found trying to eat alligators. 
""I saw an opossum last night out on the levee and it was the first small animal I've seen in probably five or six months,"" Aycock said.
Agencies including the South Florida Water Management District and the Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission have all launched python removal programs in recent years, offering hunters hourly wages and bonuses depending on the size and weight. 
According to a 2019 report, contracted python hunters brought in about 1,900 snakes since the program launched in March 2017.
The success has been hard fought. Despite their size and numbers, which some estimate in the hundreds of thousands, Aycock said it can take eight hours on average to find a snake.
HUNDREDS CAUGHT
From the start of the program to mid-2018, the most current data available, hunters working for both agencies spent 14,000 hours in the field yielding 1,186 snakes. Some larger females have been found holding up to 100 eggs. 
""We're targeting removal in bird rookeries, in sensitive ecological areas, so regardless of the snakes' population we know every one removed makes a difference,"" said Kristen Sommers, the state's wildlife impact management section leader.
Yet on Wednesday night, finding even one proved impossible for Aycock. The cooler weather meant the cold-blooded serpents stayed hidden and out of sight.

""Every python removed out of this ecosystem serves a purpose in restoring this ecosystem,"" Aycock said. ""We have a good time out here, but it's also a mission we take seriously and are willing to work at.""

Paris has blamed Iran for carrying out the drone and missile attack, which crippled the world's biggest oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia, and had promised to provide assistance to prevent a repeat of the incident.
""In the Arabian Peninsula and Arab-Persian Gulf, where tensions are mounting, we have deployed in record time the Jaguar Task Force, which contributes to reassuring the Saudi kingdom,"" President Emmanuel Macron said in a speech to the French military late on Thursday.
The initiative had not been announced until now.

Verhofstadt, who met with British ministers including Brexit minister Stephen Barclay on Thursday, said he had been reassured there would be a grace period for those who have not applied for Britain's ""settled status"" scheme by the June 2021 deadline.
""What will happen for those people even after the grace period? Well there will be no automatic deportation,"" Verhofstadt told BBC Radio.
""After the grace period they will have a possibility to apply, giving the grounds why it was not possible to do it within the normal procedures.""
Asked about Verhofstadt's comments, Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman confirmed there would be no automatic deportation. 
Reuters reported in November that Britain was threatening to deport EU citizens if they failed to apply on time and would grant leniency only in exceptional circumstances.
As of the end of last year, more than 2.7 million of the estimated 3.5 million EU nationals living in Britain had applied. Earlier this week the EU expressed concerns over ""conflicting signals"" on what would happen to those who fail to do so in time.
Britain is set to leave the EU on Jan. 31 after agreeing a divorce deal late last year but will remain bound by all the bloc's rules until the end of 2020 under an agreed transition phase aimed at smoothing its exit.
Verhofstadt also said EU citizens who are granted settled status want to be given a physical document so they can prove they have the right to remain. He said Britain had told him it was looking into the possibility of this.
Johnson's spokesman said he was not aware of any planned change.

""The settlement scheme will grant people a secure digital status which future proofs their rights and links to their passport and ID card,"" he said.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungarian Jews on Friday marked the 75th anniversary of the liberation of the Budapest ghetto and the end of the Holocaust, which killed more than 500,000 Jews and destroyed a once-vibrant Jewish culture across Hungary.
""I lost 49 family members,"" survivor Eva Fahidi told a small crowd at the Holocaust Memorial Wall, part of the wall that once surrounded the ghetto in central Budapest. ""I was 19 years old and suddenly so hated anything could be done to me.""
""Hate is the most horrific sentiment,"" she warned. ""Hate yields more hate, a cycle that never ends.""
Budapest today boasts a large and vibrant Jewish community, but anti-Semitism remains a persistent problem. Nearly 20% of people dislike Jews, according to a 2018 CNN poll, the highest proportion among seven European countries polled.
In 1944, about 100,000 Jews remained in Budapest. When the fascist Arrow Cross party seized power that fall, about 70,000 were gathered in a small area comprising 162 apartment buildings, surrounded by wooden planks.
Starvation, freezing temperatures and ongoing violence killed thousands within weeks. Arrow Cross gunmen often herded groups of Jews to the banks of the Danube and shot them into the icy river.
The guards fled only when the Soviet Red Army laid siege to Budapest. The wooden perimeter planks were burned immediately in the harsh winter.
Hungary has grappled with that past. Leaders, including Prime Minister Viktor Orban, first deflected part of the blame to a German occupation, but eventually acknowledged Hungary's role in the genocide.
The reckoning continues. Zoltan Pokorni, a prominent member of the ruling Fidesz party, teared up as he recalled last week that his own grandfather took part in the killings.
""(Citing) the German occupation is no excuse but at most an attempt to whitewash the past,"" he said at a recent event marking the murder of Jews at another Budapest location. ""The victims were Hungarians, as were most of the killers.""
""We must see the victims as more than Jews, complete in their existence. Likewise we must see the killers as more than that: we must see how they became killers. I am here to tell you, this pain makes us one and the same."""

BERLIN/TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Germany and the United Nations will push rival Libyan camps and their foreign backers fighting over the capital to agree on Sunday to a truce and monitoring mechanism as first steps towards peace, diplomats and a draft communique said.
But the meeting in Berlin at Chancellor Angela Merkel's headquarters will not try to broker power-sharing between the eastern-based forces and the internationally-recognized government in Tripoli, said diplomats briefed on preparations.
The summit will put pressure on Khalifa Haftar and his eastern Libyan National Army (LNA) to halt a nine-month offensive against Fayez al-Serraj's government in the coastal capital after a week-long lull in fighting.
About 140,000 people have been forced out of their homes.
""I hope the war ends and we have our country back to live in peace,"" said Aisha Ali Saleh, a mother-of-eight in an apartment on an abandoned building site with no power or running water.
Haftar and Serraj are both due in Berlin - along with leaders of Russia, Turkey, Egypt and other Western and Arab powers - in the latest bid to stabilize the OPEC member nation in turmoil since the 2011 fall of strongman Muammar Gaddafi.
Members of the transatlantic alliance NATO and Arab countries were instrumental in removing Gaddafi then, and foreign powers have again been the drivers of the aftermath, supplying drones, guns and ammunition to the factions.
Haftar is backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Egypt, Jordan, Sudanese and Chadian fighters, and most recently Russian mercenaries. France has also given some support.
On the other side, Turkey has rushed to Serraj's rescue by sending troops to balance out recent gains by Russian snipers. Hundreds of pro-Turkey fighters from Syria's war have also been deployed, diplomats say.
""Berlin is an opportunity to restart the political process and build on the pause in fighting,"" said a Western diplomat.
A six-page draft communique seen by Reuters calls for ""credible, verifiable, sequenced and reciprocal steps"" starting with a truce to be monitored by technical committees.
That could involve beefing up the existing U.N. mission in Libya or deploying troops from Russia, Turkey or other states, the diplomats said. The draft vaguely mentioned long-delayed plans for elections and a national government, without any timeline, just calling for U.N.-led follow-up meetings.
MIGRANTS AND MILITANTS
Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov urged Haftar and Serraj to come together in Berlin without adding conditions and blaming each other afterwards. ""Relations between them are currently very tense, they don’t even want to be in the same room together,"" he told reporters on Friday.
Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Dendias met Haftar on Friday and urged him to adopt a ""constructive spirit"" in Berlin. Athens, which opposes a recent Turkey-Libya pact on Mediterranean sea boundaries, had wanted to participate in the summit.
Chaos in Libya has made it a hub for human traffickers to ship migrants to Italy, while Islamist militants have also exploited the disorder. The latest conflict has not, however, disrupted oil output at about 1.2 million barrels per day.
In the complex outside power-play, there was no indication that Egypt and the UAE, which see the former Gaddafi general Haftar as the best bet for stability, will end their support.
But Western diplomats hope they have realized Haftar cannot take Tripoli and that a stalemate would give Turkey a foothold, which Cairo especially fears. Turkey-Egypt ties have been frosty since the Egyptian army in 2013 ousted Muslim Brotherhood president Mohammed Mursi, an ally of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
""The longer the war takes, the stronger the Turkish presence in Libya,"" the diplomat said.
Even if Haftar breached Tripoli defenses, he would still have to conquer Misrata, a power center in western Libya allied to Serraj and home to thousands of fighters.
Some Russian mercenaries have been pulled back in recent weeks from the Tripoli frontline, undermining recent progress by Haftar's forces as Russia pressures him for a ceasefire.
Those displaced by the conflict live in cramped schools and buildings, with some recently moving closer to the city as Haftar's forces advanced.
Saleh's husband died of a heart attack in April when the war started, cutting off his state pension of 450 dinars ($322.53).
""My 17-year-old son sleeps at night in our car so he can give us enough space,"" she said, covering her face as she cried.
Saleh's neighbor, 36-year old father-of-five Mohamed Siddiq, was optimistic. ""Our hope is very, very big (that the Berlin conference) will announce a ceasefire.""

747,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 17, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","Having fled bombing, Syrian children learn to read in borderland tent schools","By Khalil Ashawi
AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - Syrian teacher Ahmad al Hilal listens to his young pupils sitting on a mat reciting the Arabic alphabet in a makeshift school in a tent on the outskirts of a sprawling refugee camp city along the Turkish border.
Many ran for their lives with their mothers under heavy aerial bombing by Syrian and Russian jets that paralyzed day-to-day life and damaged dozens of schools and hospitals.
Now, already enduring the difficult winter conditions in the camp, where many tents get flooded, the children huddle on the floor, learning how to read with scraps of paper and pencils.
""These kids suffer from illiteracy. They don't read or write. They have no one to help them,"" said Hilal, who teaches over 140 young Syrians in three tents scattered across several large overcrowded camps on the outskirts of the border town of Azaz.
Women and children form a majority of more than 350,000 people who have fled the renewed assault since December that has pushed deeper into the Syria's opposition-run bastion in the northwest, according to the United Nations.
“We came here as refugees, there are no more schools because of the air strikes, so we haven’t been going to school but we’re studying in the camp here,"" said 14-year-old pupil Khaled, who did not give a family name.
Hilal was himself uprooted from his town of Abu Dahur in Idlib province after the army, backed by pro-Iranian militias seized it. 
""We bought some books and parts of the Koran and now teach them inside the camp,"" said Hilal, 48, who was a teacher before the conflict that began almost nine years ago.
The U.N. children's agency UNICEF has warned that the war will leave a generation who have never enrolled in school, having a devastating toll on education, with 7,000 schools destroyed and about 2 million children out of class.
At a nearby camp in al Bab, volunteers have converted a school bus into the Bus of Knowledge classroom.
Inside the decorated bus around 50 girls and boys as young as five take lessons in maths, life skills, Arabic and religion. 
""Children are unable to go to the schools in the city. So we at the bus come to them with knowledge and provide them with the learning essentials such as reading and writing and basic mathematics,"" said Mawiya Shular, 32, who fled a former rebel-held enclave in Homs three years ago.

""The feeling of being displaced gives me the motivation to work with these children. I want to get children out of their sense of alienation"" said Shular, also a family counselor.

The meme was the hashtag #SeduceSomeonein4Words. Submissions on Thursday ranged from ""You hungry? I'm cooking"" to ""Donald Trump Is Impeached"". Then @GermanyDiplo, the foreign ministry's English-language channel, came up with ""Your visa got approved"".
That got hundreds of retweets and thousands of likes. But it also got a fair amount of criticism, much of it from people suffering through the process of acquiring a German visa. 
Germany attracts migrants from the world over, with its free universities, strong economy, high wages and almost full employment. In 2015's migrant crisis, hundreds of thousands from the Middle East and Africa overwhelmed Europe's border controls and flooded into Germany.
But eye-catching influxes like that mask the thousands of daily frustrations and family tragedies that take place at the consulates of rich countries. Would-be immigrants spend fortunes and wait weeks and months applying for visas that would let them work, study, or be reunited with loved ones far away.
That gives the consular officials who award the coveted stamp immense power. British and U.S. officials have been investigated for abusing that power, allegedly requiring sex in exchange for visas.
So Twitter reaction was mixed. ""Even though it's terribly hard and sometimes humiliating to try to get visa from German Consulate, the joke is still very funny!"" wrote Turkish journalist Rahsan Gulsan.
GermanyDiplo rapidly backtracked, deleting the tweet and four hours later issuing a rueful apology.

""Being funny is apparently not always our strong suit,"" the ministry wrote. ""We know the visa process is complex, and visa decisions can deeply affect peoples' lives. Our colleagues take these decisions very seriously.""

Bocuse combined a passion for food with a nose for self-publicity that brought him fame and fortune beyond his native France.
""Although we are upset by the inspectors' judgment, there is one thing we never want to lose, and that is the soul of Paul,"" the Bocuse family and his restaurant said in a statement. 
L’Auberge du Pont de Collonges, near Lyon in France's gastronomic southeast, was the nerve-centre of his culinary empire and originally belonged to his father.
The chef's Bocuse d'Or organization said on Twitter it offered its ""unwavering support to 'Maison Bocuse'"" after the withdrawal of its third star.
L’Auberge du Pont de Collonges acquired its first Michelin star in 1961 when Bocuse was helping his father build up the business. After his father’s death he took it to the top three-star status in 1965.
The Michelin Guide has awarded the restaurant two stars in its 2020 guidebook, the Bocuse family said. 

Representatives for the guide said the restaurant remained ""excellent, but no longer at the level of three stars"".

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk submitted his resignation on Friday after an audio recording suggested he had criticized the president, but then appeared to suggest that he might stay in his job.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy would consider the resignation letter later on Friday, the president's office said. 
Speculation over Honcharuk's position has grown this week after a recording of a man discussing Zelenskiy's purported lack of knowledge of economics was circulated on messaging channels, apparently at a meeting of the prime minister, finance minister and the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) in December.
Zelenskiy is a former comic actor who had no political experience when he swept to power in an election last year on the back of public anger over high-level corruption.
Honcharuk said on Friday the recording had been doctored and was made up of different fragments of what had been said at government meetings.
""Its contents artificially create the impression that my team and I do not respect the president, who is our political leader,"" Honcharuk said on social media. He did not say whether it was his voice heard in the recording. 
Central bank officials and the finance minister have declined to comment on the recording. 
Contacted by Reuters shortly after his announcement and asked whether he indeed intended to step down, Honcharuk said: ""Do not jump to conclusions."" 
Under Ukraine's previous president, Honcharuk's predecessor as prime minister, Volodymyr Groysman, also made threats to resign but ultimately stayed the course until last July's parliamentary election which Zelenskiy's party won. 
Honcharuk, appointed by lawmakers last August, declined to say whether he was using his resignation letter as a way of testing the president's confidence in him.
""It doesn't show the prime minister's desire to resign, but rather it's a way for him to fight to stay in his position,"" Volodymyr Fesenko, a Kiev-based political analyst. 
""MODEL OF OPENNESS AND DECENCY""
Honcharuk announced his resignation in a message on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) where he also praised Zelenskiy as ""a model of openness and decency"".
""However, in order to remove any doubts about our respect and trust in the President, I wrote a letter of resignation and handed it to the President with the right to submit it to Parliament,"" he said.
Honcharuk appeared in parliament later on Friday and reaffirmed his respect for the president, adding that Ukraine must remain united in the face of what he called information attacks and manipulations.
He was given a standing ovation by a number of lawmakers, though some shouted ""shame on you"". 
Since taking office, Honcharuk has set out an ambitious reform agenda and secured provisional agreement from the IMF for a three-year-loan program seen as key to maintaining investor confidence and economic stability.
Ukraine's dollar bonds softened slightly after the news but later recovered. 
""Seems likely Zelenskiy will reject it,"" said Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management about the letter of resignation. 
""Question is if Zelenskiy accepts it, would any credible reformer opt to sit in Honcharuk's place when the said govt session with the NBU was leaked, and Honcharuk was only being honest,"" he wrote on Twitter. 
Honcharuk's government managed to secure a $5.5 billion IMF loan program in December but this is still subject to Ukraine's performance on reforms and tackling vested interests.

""(The resignation offer) will not affect them,"" Honcharuk said in his comments to Reuters on Friday, replying to a question about his government's reforms and the IMF program.

Collins, 69, pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and making false statements in October in federal court in Manhattan, a day after resigning his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Although he faces a maximum of five years in prison for each of the two charges, prosecutors have agreed as part of a plea deal that a reasonable sentence would be a total of less than five years.
A few months after he was criminally charged in 2018, Collins had narrowly won re-election to the 27th Congressional District in western New York.
He was convicted for trading on insider information while a board member and a 16.8% stakeholder of Australian biotechnology company Innate Immunotherapeutics Ltd.
After learning from an email sent by the company's chief executive that an experimental multiple sclerosis drug had failed a clinical trial, Collins relayed the news to his son, allowing him to sell shares before the news became public and eroded their value. His son also passed the tip on to others."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Intense thunderstorms with heavy rains dampened bushfires on Australia's east coast on Friday, to the relief of exhausted firefighters and farmers battling years of drought, and granting a reprieve to the organisers of next week's Australian Open.
Australia, famous for its pristine beaches and wildlife, has been fighting bushfires since September, with fires killing 29 people and millions of animals, and destroying more than 2,500 homes while razing an area roughly a third the size of Germany.
Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, three of the states most affected by drought and bushfires welcomed this week's drenching rain, with fire services saying it would not extinguish all the blazes, but would greatly aid containment. 
""Our fingers are crossed that this continues over the coming days,"" New South Wales fire services said on Twitter on Friday.
Severe storms are forecast to continue in many fire-stricken regions of New South Wales and Queensland, including areas that have not seen heavy falls for years, weather officials in New South Wales said, slightly easing a three-year drought. 
""The recent rain has just been absolutely fantastic,"" said cattle farmer Sam White near the northern town of Guyra in New South Wales.
""It's producing significant amounts of runoff, which is what we need, and it's getting into our dams.""
While the wet weather brings relief to fire fighters and drought-hit farmers, it also comes with dangers, such as flash flooding and falling trees. One wildlife park had to rescue koalas from floodwaters and beat back crocodiles with brooms.
The heavy downpours have helped to clean smoky air in Australia, but Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne remained in the world's top 100 polluted cities on Friday, a pollution ranking by AirVisual showed. 
Melbourne, shrouded this week in thick smoke that disrupted the Australian Open qualifying matches and other competitions, is forecast to again be blanketed by unhealthy air over the weekend, before the Grand Slam begins in earnest on Monday. 
But fears the smoke would return on Saturday for the final round of qualifying eased on Friday, when the Environmental Protection Agency forecast air quality in the Melbourne area would be ""moderate"" rather than ""very poor"".
The smoke haze plaguing Australia's major cities for weeks has been tracked by NASA circumnavigating the globe and the space agency's satellites showed on Thursday there was also a large concentration of lower smoke over the Pacific Ocean. 
Here are key events in the bushfire crisis: 
* Early on Friday, 82 fires were burning across New South Wales, 30 uncontained, and several in Victoria, fire authorities said.
* An emergency evacuation order was issued for parts of Victoria's northeast, with an out-of-control bushfire threatening the Buffalo River Valley.
* Firefighters, family and the community of Holbrook in New South Wales bade farewell to Samuel McPaul, a 28-year-old volunteer who died in December while fighting a massive and fast-moving blaze.
* Australia will have to wait until March for rains heavy enough to bring sustained relief from dry weather that has fuelled the bushfires, the weather bureau said.
* Top tourism body estimates the bushfire crisis has cost the Australian industry almost A$1 billion ($690 million). [L4N29L069]
* Players' complaints about pollution blighted qualifying rounds of the Australian Open in Melbourne, the year's first tennis Grand Slam.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to South Korea drew criticism from the highest levels of government in Seoul on Friday for suggesting that Seoul consult with Washington about the possibility of reopening tourism with North Korea.
U.S. ambassador Harry Harris has even been criticized by some local media and anti-U.S. activists over his moustache, which they have compared with those of officials in the Japanese colonial government that ruled Korea from 1910 to 1945.
Seoul and Washington have been at odds over a number of issues in recent years, including South Korean President Moon Jae-in's desire to engage economically with the North, and a U.S. demand that Seoul pay billions of dollars more to maintain its troops stationed in South Korea.
Harris told international media in Seoul on Thursday that it would be better for South Korea to run any plans to engage with North Korea through a joint working group established with the United States to avoid any ""misunderstandings"" that could trigger sanctions.
That drew a rebuke from an official at the presidential Blue House on Friday.
""It's very inappropriate for the ambassador to make such a mention in the media over remarks by the president of the host nation,"" the official said, speaking to media on condition of anonymity.
Harris said South Korea was a sovereign nation and noted that tourism is not banned by international sanctions imposed on the North. But he said some aspects of a tourism program could potentially run into trouble with sanctions.
A spokesman for the South's Unification Ministry, which handles relations with the North, declined to comment specifically on Harris' remarks but said ""our policy with regard to North Korea comes under our sovereignty.""
Others criticized Harris more directly, with some even commenting on his Japanese-American heritage. Harris was born to a Japanese mother and an American father.
In an interview with a local radio station, a ruling party lawmaker compared him with a ""governor general"" of the Japanese government during the colonial period.
Speaking on Thursday, Harris also mentioned the public comments about his heritage and the mockery of his moustache - despite the fact that many famous Korean historical figures had similar facial hair.
""My moustache, for some reason, has become a point of some fascination here,"" Harris said at the briefing on Thursday.
In a protest outside the U.S. Embassy in December, for example, activists plucked the moustache hairs from posters of Harris' face.
""I understand the historical animosity that exists between both of the nations,"" Harris said of the lingering tensions between South Korea and Japan.

""But I am not the Japanese-American ambassador to Korea — I am the American ambassador to Korea.""

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - While drinking in a nightclub in Mozambique in 2015, Kamal Moukheiber had an idea: a luxury cigar made not in Cuba, but in southern Africa.
The Lebanese former banker glanced at a customer puffing at what looked like an imported cigar and thought: ""What's wrong with Africa producing cigars?""
""Africa has been growing tobacco for 100 years,"" Moukheiber, 50, told Reuters. We have the land, we have the water, we have the skill set. So what's missing?""
His business, Bongani Cigars - it means ""be grateful"" in Zulu - was conceived as a small, fun project. Now it produces nearly 10,000 cigars a month, small numbers compared to the big producers. It sells in South Africa, Kenya and Mozambique, where some of its tobacco is grown.
Moukheiber said Bongani would launch in Nigeria this year and, he hoped, the United Kingdom, and aims to be the cigar of choice for African professionals who want to flaunt their wealth or success.
""A cigar is ... just like champagne, just like some wines. It's about the message,"" he said. ""By smoking a Bongani you are communicating ... your African identity.""
He traveled to the Dominican Republic to recruit a head of production, Anthony Padilla Perez, and move him to Maputo, where he helped train a workforce in the precise art of rolling by hand. Bongani now employs five rollers.
Becoming a household name won't be easy: Moukheiber admits luxury markets are difficult to crack, and Bongani, which sold its first cigar in 2016, can't boast 30-year-aged tobacco like some rivals.
It prices its cigars around 10% less than the equivalent Cuban, with its standard smoke selling for around $13. He says they appeal to those looking for an African ""terroir"" - the French term denoting taste imparted to wine by the environment in which it is produced.
""When I got my first ... big order from a distributor from South Africa I was almost in tears,"" Moukheiber recalls. ""I had never produced anything in my life that someone would want to buy."""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - The tropical Maldives may lose entire islands unless it can quickly access cheap financing to fight the impact of climate change, its foreign minister said.
The archipelago's former president Mohamed Nasheed famously held a cabinet meeting underwater to draw attention to submerging land and global warming a decade ago.
Yet the Maldives, best known for its white sands and palm-fringed atolls that draw luxury holiday-makers, has struggled to find money to build critical infrastructure like sea-walls.
""For small states, it is not easy,"" Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid told Reuters in New Delhi. ""By the time the financing is obtained, we may be underwater.""
At the U.N. climate talks in Madrid in December, the Maldives and other vulnerable countries pushed for concrete progress on fresh funding to help them deal with disasters and longer-term damage linked to climate change - but failed.
Shahid was hopeful the next round of talks, slated to take place in Glasgow in November, would yield better results.
One of the world's lowest-lying countries, more than 80% of the Maldives' land is less than one meter above mean sea levels, making its population of around 530,000 people extremely vulnerable to storm surges, sea swells and severe weather.
In 2004, the Indian Ocean tsunami ravaged the Muslim-majority state, causing financial losses of around $470 million - 62% of GDP - and hitting infrastructure, including its only international airport that was shut for several days.
'WE NEED IT'
Two of the country's main industries - tourism and fishing - are heavily dependent on coastal resources, and most settlements and critical infrastructure is concentrated along the coast.
In 2014, more than 100 of the archipelago's inhabited islands were already reporting erosion, and around 30 islands are identified as severely eroded.
The Maldives spends around $10 million annually for coastal protection works, but will need up to $8.8 billion in total to shield all of its inhabited islands, according to a 2016 estimate by its environment ministry.
""In order to protect the islands, we need to start building sea walls,"" Shahid said. ""It's expensive, but we need it. We can't wait until all of them are being taken away.""
The United Nations has created a pot to help developing nations, called the Green Climate Fund, which has already approved nearly $24 million in funding to the Maldives, according to its website.
Some individual nations have also offered help, including Japan which contributed to a sea wall round the Maldives' capital Male. Shahid did not specify where his government was pushing for more funding.
However, Environment Minister Hussain Rasheed Hassan said recently his country would have to turn to banks given inadequate funding elsewhere despite the fact small nations like his were paying the price for the developed world's pollution.
""We have to beg some of these (big) emitters to provide money for us. Is that fair?"" he said."

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban will implement a 10-day ceasefire with U.S. troops, a reduction in violence with Afghan forces and discussions with Afghan government officials if it reaches a deal with U.S. negotiators in talks in Doha, two sources have said.
If an agreement is sealed, it could revive hopes for a long-term solution to the conflict in Afghanistan.
Taliban and U.S. negotiators met on Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the signing of a peace deal, according to a spokesman for the Taliban office in Qatar. The talks were ""useful"" and would continue for a few days, the spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, said on Twitter early on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump had called off the stop-start talks to end the 18-year war in September after an U.S. soldier was killed in an attack by the militant group. 
They resumed but were interrupted again in December after the Taliban launched a suicide attack on a U.S. base outside Kabul killing two civilians. 
Two sources close to the matter told Reuters on Wednesday that the Taliban's top leadership had now agreed to implement a 10-day ceasefire with U.S troops once a deal was signed in Doha, and to ""reduce"" attacks against the Afghan government.
A senior Taliban commander said: ""The U.S. wanted us to announce a ceasefire during the peace talks which we had rejected. Our shura (council) has agreed to a ceasefire the day the peace accord is signed."" 
Once an agreement is in place, the Taliban and Afghan government could meet face to face in Germany, said the commander. Previously, the Taliban had refused to engage in talks with the Afghan government.
The U.S. team in Doha had demanded a ceasefire ""which we had declined due to some issues,"" the Taliban commander said. ""Now most of our reservations have been addressed."" Another source close to the talks confirmed the commander's version of events.
A signing date has not been fixed, but the Taliban commander said he expected it to be ""very soon.""
Both sources asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter. 
A U.S. State Department spokeswoman declined to comment and the Pentagon referred queries to the State Department.
An Afghan presidency spokesman said a ceasefire was the only way to achieve sustainable and dignified peace. ""Any plan which proposes a ceasefire as a basic step will be acceptable for the government,"" Sediqi Sediqqi tweeted on Friday.
Violence in Afghanistan rose after the breakdown of talks in September.

The Taliban's readiness to reduce violence revives odds of the peace process moving forward before the militant group launches what is usually an annual spring offensive around early April.

During a spike in tension, Iran launched missiles at U.S. targets on Jan. 8 in response to a U.S. drone strike on Jan. 3 that killed Qassem Soleimeni, a powerful Iranian general who was close to Khamenei.
""The fact that Iran has the power to give such a slap to a world power shows the hand of God,"" Khamenei said, after referring to the launch of missiles against U.S. targets as a ""day of God"". His comments were met by chants of ""Death to America!""."

Germany has one of the oldest populations in the world and has recorded more deaths than births ever since 1972. The aging population is a challenge for the country's public pension system and is causing headaches for companies eager to hire skilled workers.
The number of people living in Germany grew by around 200,000 year-on year, according to the initial estimate by the statistics office.
Net migration was estimated at between 300,000 and 350,000 in 2019 after close to 400,000 in the previous year. That marks a decline for the fourth consecutive year, the statistics office added.
More than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and beyond have flocked to Germany since Chancellor Angela Merkel opened Germany's borders to them in 2015. Many of them have been attracted by Germany's robust economy, its relatively liberal asylum laws and generous system of benefits."

MYITKYINA, Myanmar (Reuters) - The streets of Myanmar’s capital Naypyitaw were festooned with banners celebrating 70 years of Myanmar-China relations ahead of the arrival of President Xi Jinping on Friday for his first visit to the Southeast Asian nation as China's leader.
But for thousands of villagers living in northern Myanmar, close to the Chinese border, there is another anniversary that no-one can celebrate. It is 10 years since they were kicked off their land for a $3.6 billion dam, an unfinished project backed by Beijing that dogs relations between the two neighbors.
The Myitsone hydropower dam in Kachin state is one many multi-billion-dollar infrastructure projects that form part of Xi’s flagship Belt and Road Initiative. The Chinese leader intends to discuss his grand plan for what has been described as a “21st century silk road” during his two-day visit to Myanmar.
Construction of the dam was suspended in 2011 after a public outcry over evictions and expected environmental damage, which included the flooding of an area the size of Singapore, but villagers have not been allowed to return home, and Myanmar's leader Aung San Suu Kyi has indicated it could still move ahead.
“The major losses were the farmlands,” said Reverend Tu Hkawng, a member of the ethnic Kachin minority, who are mostly Christian, adding that residents had been moved into sub-standard housing provided by China and many had been forced to look for work across the border.
“I would say our social structure was destroyed,” he said. “We used to help and care for each other. Such things are gone.”
An open letter from dozens of Kachin civil society groups published a day ahead of Xi’s arrival called on the Chinese leader to permanently scrap the project and said broader Chinese investment in the region, including massive banana plantations, had had a “broad social and environmental impact including land problems and threats to nature and historical sites.”
Chinese investment has “disrespected local traditions and values and failed to consult local people”, it said.
Xi is scheduled to meet state counselor Aung San Suu Kyi and army chief Min Aung Hlaing in the capital Naypyitaw, as well as the heads of minor political parties.
Protesters plan to gather outside the Chinese embassy in Yangon on Saturday to oppose the “exploitation of natural resources” in Myanmar, including the Myitsone project.
Aung Soe Myint, an activist opposed to the dam, said Suu Kyi should beware of what China offers, or risk being punished at a general election expected in November.
“If Aung San Suu Kyi agrees to it, it would be political suicide,” said Aung Soe Myint.
UNCRITICAL RELATIONS
Myanmar has had a historically fraught relationship with China, with many people suspicious of Beijing's clout in its smaller neighbor. But relations warmed after China avoided joining the international condemnation of Myanmar over the expulsion of ethnic Rohingya Muslims in 2017.
More than 730,000 Rohingya were forced to flee western Myanmar after a military crackdown the U.N has said was executed with “genocidal intent”, though the government maintains it was a legitimate counter-insurgency operation launched in response to militant attacks on security forces.
China has defended Myanmar on the global stage and is viewed as the biggest obstacle to a prosecution of its leaders at an international war crimes tribunal. China is the second biggest investor in Myanmar, after Singapore.
In an editorial published in Myanmar state media on Thursday, Xi said the visit was about “result-oriented Belt and Road cooperation” and move from “the conceptual stage to concrete planning and implementation” of projects like the y-shaped Myanmar-China Economic Corridor, connecting China to the Indian Ocean, which has seen slow progress.
Analysts say while the Kachin state dam may feature in discussions, Myanmar is unlikely to agree to a full resumption ahead of elections coming up at the end of the year. China's Yunnan province, the intended destination of the dam's electricity, now has a surplus.
Talking to reporters last week, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Luo Zhaohui said the two sides were in contact over the dam, and any co-operation would be “in line with the long-term plan of the Myanmar side”.
Hla Kyaw Zaw, an analyst based in Yunnan on the Myanmar-China border, expects the two sides to work out some compromise over the stalled project.
“They will find a win-win solution for the Myitsone project,” Hla Kyaw Zaw said. “It seems they (China) know and realized that here are some mistakes from their side too. They have been silent about this issue.”"

""We request all sides not to make human issues, particularly this tragic accident, into an excuse for political gestures,"" Abbas Mousavi was quoted as saying by the semi-official ISNA news agency.
Five countries whose citizens died when Iran shot down the airliner last week said on Thursday that Tehran should pay compensation to families of the victims, and that the world was watching for its response.
Mousavi said Iran had cooperated ""beyond expectations"" with countries whose citizens were killed in the crash, according to ISNA.
Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and Britain also said after a meeting of officials in London that Iran should hold a ""thorough, independent and transparent international investigation open to grieving nations"". 
Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards admitted accidentally shooting down the Ukrainian airliner with a missile, killing all 176 aboard. 
Mousavi said it was ""strange"" that Canada's foreign ministry had asked for consular access related to the crash, noting that almost all of the victims of the crash have been identified.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - A U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Thursday, the island's defense ministry said, less than a week after Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen won re-election by a landslide on a platform of standing up to China which claims the island.
The ship sailed in a northerly direction through the sensitive waterway and Taiwan's armed forces monitored it throughout, the ministry said in a brief statement on Friday, describing the sailing as an ""ordinary mission"".
""People can rest easy,"" it added.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial and diplomatic issue and Beijing has never ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. The narrow Taiwan Strait which separates the island from China is a frequent source of tension.
China sailed its latest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, through the waterway twice in the run-up to Taiwan's election last Saturday.
Taiwan denounced that as attempted intimidation.
The U.S. Navy said the Ticonderoga-class guided-missile cruiser USS Shiloh had completed a transit of the Taiwan Strait, without giving details. The United States has been conducting sporadic missions through the strait in the last two years.
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the government also ""closely watched"" and monitored the ship's passage, urging the United States to ""appropriately deal with the Taiwan issue in a way that doesn't hurt Sino-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait"".
Washington has no formal ties with Taiwan but is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself and is its main source of arms.
Meeting the de facto British ambassador to Taiwan later on Friday, Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said the island would ensure peace in the Taiwan Strait.
""As a responsible member of the international community, Taiwan will continue to dedicate itself to protecting peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,"" the presidential office cited Tsai as telling Catherine Nettleton.
Under the Trump administration, the United States has made bolstering its defense and other ties with Taiwan a priority, in spite of Chinese anger.
The top U.S. diplomat in Taiwan, Brent Christensen, told a forum in Taipei on Friday that his office's theme for this year was ""real friends, real progress"", and took what appeared to be an indirect dig at China.
""Perhaps this concept sounds simple, but it is important to consider its significance within the current context,"" said Christensen, director of the American Institute in Taiwan.
""Some use the cover of friendship to dominate and manipulate; promising mutual benefit but instead delivering extortion; exporting problems rather than solutions,"" he added.
Christensen said the United States this year will seek to further Taiwan's engagement in the world, something the island has found difficult due to China blocking Taiwan's participation in most international organizations.
""The United States and Taiwan are members of the same family of democracies,"" he added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Suicides in Japan in 2019 fell to their lowest number in more than 40 years, police said on Friday, marking the 10th straight year of declines.
Though suicide has a long history in Japan as a way of avoiding shame or dishonor, and its suicide rate still tops the Group of Seven nations, a national effort has brought Japanese suicides down by about 40 percent in roughly 15 years.
The number of suicides in 2019 fell by 881 people, bringing the overall number under 20,000 for the first time since record-keeping began in 1978, according to preliminary police data published Friday.
The suicide rate edged down to 15.8 people per 100,000, a dip of 0.7. By contrast, the suicide rate in the United States, with more than twice Japan's population, was 14 per 100,000 in 2017, the latest year for which data was available - although suicide is a growing problem there.
By gender, 13,937 men and 6,022 women took their lives. There was no breakdown by age group.
Japanese suicides peaked at 34,427 in 2003, alarming policy makers and drawing foreign attention.
Though the police did not give any reason for the decline, and an improving economy has undoubtedly helped, and a 2007 suicide prevention program tweaked in 2016 to allow for regional differences is apparently bearing fruit.
Increased psychological services, a growing number of hotlines, and other volunteer outreach groups that help people express their innermost feelings have all played a role.
Corporations, prompted by lawsuits from families of those who kill themselves because of overwork, have made it easier to take leave, with more offering psychological support. A law caps overtime, and the government mandates annual stress tests in companies with over 50 employees."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese environment minister Shinjiro Koizumi, who has said he will take paternity leave https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-minister-paternity/japan-minister-koizumi-to-take-paternity-leave-aims-to-be-role-model-idUSKBN1ZE04C in a rare move for a Japanese man, announced on Friday the birth of his first child: a boy. 
Koizumi, son of charismatic former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi and seen as a future leader himself, said on Wednesday he was planning to take two weeks of leave over three months, in an effort to become a role model for Japan's working fathers.
But some lawmakers have criticized his interest in taking parental leave, saying he should prioritize his public duties.
The telegenic Koizumi, popularly known as Shinjiro to distinguish him from his father, grabbed headlines in the summer of 2019 with news he was marrying Christel Takigawa, a French-Japanese television personality, and that they were expecting a child. Soon after, he was named environment minister.
Koizumi told reporters he had come straight from the hospital and had been by his wife's side for the birth.
""As a father I'm really happy that a healthy boy was safely born,"" a tired but happy Koizumi told a news conference. ""Both of them are doing well, that's the most important thing.""
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying to encourage more men to take paternity leave, and for businesses to allow a better work-life balance, as part of his ""Womenomics"" program of bolstering women's employment. 
While Japan's parental leave policies are among the world's most generous, providing men and women with partially paid leave of up to a year, or longer if there is no public child care, just 6% of eligible fathers take child care leave, and most of them for less than a week, according to government data.
Koizumi acknowledged that he has heard comments both for and against his decision. 
""I'll keep a priority on policy and on managing anything unexpected that comes up, while also carving out time for childcare,"" he said. 
Cabinet ministers lauded Koizumi's decision, with Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura - a father of three daughters - hoping it would have a positive social impact.
""I hope he can take as much time as possible. It'll be really good if many more men follow his example and take time off.""
Koizumi himself seemed to still be adjusting to his new role.
""I don't really feel like a father yet, but that should come soon. I want to be a father like my dad was,"" he was quoted by NHK television as saying.

Shinjiro's father divorced his mother when she was pregnant with their third son and never remarried. He told the couple when they announced their marriage that everybody ""should try matrimony once"".

AGONCILLO, Philippines (Reuters) - Thousands of residents under orders to evacuate from a town near the Philippine volcano Taal were allowed to briefly visit homes on Friday to rescue their animals and recover some possessions, taking advantage of what appeared to be waning activity.
Daniel Reyes, mayor of the Agoncillo town inside the danger zone of the 311 meter (1,020 feet) volcano, said he allowed around 3,000 residents to check their properties and retrieve animals, clothes and other possessions.
""If I would not let them rescue their animals, their animals would die and together with them their sources of livelihood,"" Reyes told Reuters.
A long line of cars, trucks, motorcycle taxis carrying pigs, dogs, television sets, gas stoves and electric fans, were seen leaving Agoncillo, among the towns blanketed in thick layers of volcanic ash. 
""Our bodies are fine, but our minds and hearts are in pain"", said resident Peding Dawis, 63, while resting after taking his cows to safer areas. 
Dawis said there were 200 more pigs that needed rescuing in his neighborhood.
""It's hard to leave our homes and livelihood behind."" 
More than 40,000 residents of Agoncillo have abandoned their homes since Taal, one of the Philippines' most active and deadliest volcanoes, began spewing massive clouds of ash, steam and gas on Sunday, Reyes said.
The majority of residents are now staying with families elsewhere, but the rest are among a total of 66,000 people sheltering in evacuation centers. 
SIGNS OF CALM
Taal has shown signs of calm since Thursday and Reyes said he took advantage of this window to allow residents to collect their belongings. 
""Based on what I saw outside, I thought I would be doing them more good if I let them return to their homes,"" Reyes said. ""The help they are getting now is only momentarily"".
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) said it observed ""steady steam emission and infrequent weak explosions"" from the volcano's main crater, but it continued to record dozens of earthquakes in nearby towns. 
The institute said on Friday the danger level posed by the volcano remained at 4 out of a possible 5, meaning ""hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days"".
""We do not base the alert level simply on what we see on the surface. We have to try to interpret what is happening below,"" Renato Solidum, Phivolcs' chief, told CNN Philippines.
""There are sometimes waning activity but the activity below is still continuing.""
The impact of the volcano on the $330 billion national economy has been a blip, despite canceled flights and a day of work lost on Sunday because of a heavy ashfall in the capital Manila, 70 km (45 miles) away.
But for some of the farmers growing pineapples, bananas and coffee nearby it has been a disaster.
Volcanic ash has caused an estimated 3.06 billion pesos ($60.17 million) worth of damage to crops, livestock and fish farms, based on the latest data from the agriculture department. 

Although Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes, it can be deadly. An eruption killed more than 1,300 people in 1911.

BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - China will impose more curbs on agriculture and widen restrictions on industrial development in the next five years in a bid to protect scarce, already contaminated water supplies from further pollution, a government official said on Friday.
The government is planning to restrict farming that encroaches on major rivers, restore wetlands and ecosystems and tackle excess water consumption in its 2021-2025 five-year plan, said Zhang Bo, head of the water department at the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, speaking at a news briefing.
With per capita water resources only a quarter of the global average, China has made the restoration of contaminated supplies a priority. Zhang said the government would now take ecological value into consideration as well as economic value.
Beijing has been drawing what it calls ""ecological protection red lines"" that make areas off-limits to agriculture and industry. But with water demand still on the rise, it must strike a balance between bolstering economic growth, maximizing agricultural output and protecting its rivers.
""Farmland that encroaches on the river is essentially not allowed to be there anyway,"" Zhang told Reuters on the sidelines of the briefing in Beijing. ""The drawing of 'ecological protection red lines' will take food security into consideration and strike that balance.""
China is in the middle of a campaign to restore the environment of the Yangtze river, which provides water to around 40% of the country's population. The river has been damaged by decades of land reclamation, water diversion and the dumping of toxic waste.
Local governments have already been demolishing dams, relocating chemical plants, restoring wetlands and banning farming and fishing in ecologically sensitive areas, but some regions still fail to meet state water standards.
Earlier this week, China's top prosecution office said 7,084 people were arrested for environmental crimes on the Yangtze in 2019, up 43% on the year, with offences including illegal fishing and sand mining as well as the dumping of waste.
The environment ministry said water quality was improving overall, with 75% of surface water sampled at 1,940 sites across the country up to standard in 2019, up 3.9 percentage points compared to 2018.
China divides its water into six grades, with the first three considered safe for human use. The ministry said 3.4% remained ""below grade V"" - meaning it was unfit even for industrial or agricultural use - down 3.3 percentage points on the year."

The attack was retaliation for a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3 that killed Qassem Soleimani, the commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran's Revolutionary Guard.
President Donald Trump and the U.S. military had said there were no casualties after the strike on the Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq and a facility in its northern Kurdish region.
""While no U.S. service members were killed in the Jan. 8 Iranian attack on Al Asad air base, several were treated for concussion symptoms from the blast and are still being assessed,"" Captain Bill Urban, spokesman for U.S. Central Command, said in a statement.

""When deemed fit for duty, the service members are expected to return to Iraq.""

As many as 1,500 Americans were deployed at the vast base deep in Iraq's Anbar desert.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Haiti's President Jovenel Moise, who began ruling by decree this week, wants to use his new power to overhaul the constitution in an attempt to break a ""decades-long cycle of political crises,"" a planned presidential statement seen by Reuters shows.
""We will work with all political actors and our international partners to draft constitutional reforms to ensure a widely acceptable, workable, democratic balance of power which will then be put to the Haitian people in a referendum,"" reads the statement, due to be released early on Friday according to a source close to Moise.
The statement does not specify the precise changes sought but Moise is likely aiming to strengthen the presidency which was weakened in Haiti's 1987 Magna Carta due to a mistrust of strong figureheads in the wake of the Duvalier family dictatorship.
Critics say the changes went too far, delivering too much power to parliament and have made it hard to govern. Haiti has had 15 presidents in the past 33 years.
In the statement, Moise calls for the formation of a unity government to propose constitutional changes ""to address flaws in the 1987 text"". These have fostered political instability that has prevented development in the poorest country in the Americas, he says.
The president aims to get the new constitution drafted within three months of being started, the source said, and voted on in a referendum by year-end.
The presidency's office confirmed the veracity of the statement.
Moise has flagged his desire to amend the constitution before but until this week has not had the power to do so. It is the first time a timetable for reform has been laid out.
NO SILVER BULLET
There is wide agreement among politicians and analysts in Haiti on the need for constitutional reform, even if they do not depict it as a ""silver bullet"" for the country's problems.
""The constitution has been amended a few times already but the structure simply does not give the needed results, it is one of the causes of the political instability in this country,"" said one Haiti-based western diplomat.
""This is a historic opportunity where all the political class agrees on the need for change.""
The diplomat said one necessary change to foster greater political stability and save money was to institute elections every five years rather than every two years.
Yet many opposition politicians do not think Moise, who has faced fierce anti-government protests over graft allegations, galloping inflation and crime over the past year, is the right person to lead constitutional reform and are unlikely to join a unity government.
""It is illusory to believe a president who is rejected by the people could change the constitution,"" said Andre Michel, a politician with the opposition Democratic and Popular Sector.
""We are all for a new constitution but it is up to a transition government to do it.""
The president can try to carry out constitutional reform without broad backing given he started ruling by decree this week but it could lack legitimacy and spark new unrest.
The mandate of all deputies and most senators expired at the start of the week and there were no successors as parliament failed to approve an electoral law last year necessary for holding legislative elections.
In the statement, Moise said he was governing by executive order ""reluctantly, knowing this is not how a thriving and fair democracy should function"".
But his camp and others in the international community have made it clear they see an opportunity to get around what they see as parliament's ""obstructionism"" and get things done.
It is not without precedent. Both his immediate predecessor Michel Martelly and before that Rene Preval ruled for a while by decree.
""We have a window of opportunity,"" the presidential statement reads. ""I want to take it to fix what has been broken in the Haitian system for far too long and finally allow us to move forward.""
The source close to Moise said he did not aim to rule without a parliament until the end of his term. Instead he hoped to hold legislative elections in order to reinstate parliament by year-end."

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's government said on Thursday prosecutors carried out raids and arrested a former mayor accused of corruption as the U.S. embassy announced it had revoked visas for some ex-officials in the Central American country this year.
The attorney general's office said the raids led to the arrest of a former Mayor Ángel Ren Guarcas of Chiche wanted for campaign finance violations, but two other targets, including the economy minister who served under former President Jimmy Morales, could not be found.
The ex-minister, Acisclo Valladares Urruela, is accused of laundering money in a bribery scheme benefiting high-ranking officials and powerful business owners, prosecutors said.
The rapid efforts to close in on officials who enjoyed immunity until recently are among the first signs of action from President Alejandro Giammattei, who was sworn in on Tuesday.
On Wednesday, prosecutors issued warrants for five former lawmakers, including a close ally of Morales, and a special forces soldier who ran for the presidency last year.
Giammattei's drive to uproot corruption from political life will be closely watched after Morales chased out the U.N.-backed anti-corruption body that put several senior figures behind bars and led an investigation into him and his family.
Most right-of-center politicians, including Giammattei, came to see the corruption body, known as CICIG, as an unacceptable violation of Guatemala's sovereignty.
Giammattei said he will quickly create an anti-corruption force tied to the president's office instead.
Separately, the U.S. embassy said in a statement some of the visas it had revoked in recent weeks belonged to government officials, citing criminal activity in some cases. Another 250 visas were revoked in 2019, the embassy added.
It did not name the people whose visas were withdrawn, nor detail the causes."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders has been steadily climbing in popularity this year and is now tied with former Vice President Joe Biden for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination among registered voters, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national poll.
The online poll, released Thursday, shows that 20% of registered Democrats and independents said they would back Sanders over 11 other candidates to run in the general election against President Donald Trump, an increase of 2 percentage points from a similar poll that ran last week. 
Another 19% supported Biden, 12% said they would vote for Senator Elizabeth Warren, 9% backed former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and 6% said they would support Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
Sanders and Bloomberg have increased their level of support in each of the last three Reuters/Ipsos polls starting in mid-December, while support for Biden, Warren and Buttigieg has remained flat. 
The poll also shows that about one in five potential primary voters remain undecided. And among those who have picked, nearly two out of three say they are open to changing their minds. 
Sanders, an independent who built a national network of fervent supporters while running for the party's nomination in 2016, has consistently ranked among the most popular candidates since he entered the race.
The poll shows that standing does not appear to have been hurt by his recent confrontation with Warren over Sanders' views of women and politics.
Warren, who is aligned with Sanders on a variety of issues, has accused him of telling her in 2018 that a woman could not be elected president. Sanders disputes that claim, and the two sniped at each other after this week's presidential debate about how they were framing the conversation in public. 
The dispute has the potential to reconfigure a Democratic nomination race that has stagnated for months with no single candidate emerging as the clear front-runner. 
According to Reuters/Ipsos polling from December to January, women are the party's biggest swing group: they are more than twice as likely as men to say they are undecided about which candidate to support. Among those women who have picked a candidate, nearly two out of three say they are open to changing their minds.
So far, Sanders' and Warren's support remains unchanged among women, with about 15% supporting Sanders and 11% supporting Warren. 

The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted in English throughout the United States from Jan. 15-16. It gathered responses from 681 Democrats and independents, including 552 who were registered to vote. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 5 percentage points.

BERLIN (Reuters) - A Libyan military commander waging an offensive to capture the capital Tripoli is committed to a ceasefire, Germany said on Thursday, in an apparent advance for efforts to end a near-decade of turmoil in the North African country.
German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, after visiting the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi, also said commander Khalifa Haftar is willing to attend a conference in Berlin on Sunday about the conflict.
Haftar's office was not available for comment. But three sources close to the matter told Reuters that Haftar was expected to have talks in Athens on Friday with Greece's prime minister and foreign minister during a stopover on his way to Berlin.
Maas's comment follows failed efforts by Russia and Turkey to persuade Haftar on a visit to Moscow this week to agree to a lasting ceasefire and halt the offensive on Tripoli. Haftar left Moscow without signing the proposal.
The nine-month-old war over Tripoli is just the latest bout of chaos in Libya, an OPEC member that has become a hub for human traffickers to ship migrants by boats to Italy, while Islamist militants have exploited the widespread disorder.
""If developments in Libya are allowed to continue, then Libya will be the next Syria and we don't want that to happen,"" Maas said later on German television.
The conference to be hosted by Germany on Sunday would bring together Libyan rival camps and the foreign powers that support them to try to end the war over Tripoli and resume talks on a power sharing deal.
Among those attending would be Russian President Vladimir Putin, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and European leaders, Maas said.
""General Haftar has signalled his readiness to contribute to the success of the Libya Conference in Berlin and is willing to participate. He has repeated his commitment to observe the existing ceasefire,"" Maas said in a tweet sent by his ministry.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed the move and said the conference aimed to get parties to honour a weapons embargo.
""At the Libya conference we must above all see that the weapons embargo is adhered to again, which is basically agreed by the U.N. but unfortunately not honoured,"" she told reporters.
Maas said on German television that after a ceasefire and arms embargo had been observed, a political process must take place under the auspices of the United Nations to give Libya a prospect of ending its civil war. 
OUTSIDE POWERS
Libya has been fractured and deeply unstable, with outside powers providing support to rival armed factions since veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in a 2011 uprising.
Turkey backs Fayez al-Serraj's internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) while Haftar - whose forces control much of Libya's east and south - has received support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Russian mercenaries.
Turkey is beginning to send troops into Libya in support of Serraj's government, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday.
""In order for the legitimate government in Libya to remain standing and for stability to be established, we are now sending our soldiers to this country,"" Erdogan told an event in Ankara.
Greece is furious at the pact between Turkey and Serraj's government as it seeks to map out a maritime boundary that skims the Greek island of Crete and which Greece and allies say is contrary to international law. Maritime boundaries could give nations the right to explore for hydrocarbons in an as-yet untapped part of the Mediterranean.

Greece says it will exercise a European Union veto on any peace pact in Libya that does not void the Turkish-Libyan deal.

GREENBELT, Md. (Reuters) - Three suspected members of a neo-Nazi group appeared in a Maryland court on Thursday to face federal charges after the FBI arrested them for carrying an assault rifle and planning to incite violence at a gun-rights rally in Virginia. 
Earlier on Thursday, the FBI arrested the trio: Brian Lemley, 33, a former cavalry scout in the U.S. Army; Patrik Mathews, 27, a combat engineer in the Canadian Army Reserve who authorities said had illegally entered the United States; and William Bilbrough, a teenager who prosecutors called a serious flight risk, saying he expressed a desire to fight with Ukrainian nationalists.
Their appearance in the U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, came the day after Virginia Governor Ralph Northam declared a state of emergency banning any weapons around the grounds of the state capitol in Richmond. 
He said investigators had seen groups making threats of violence ahead of the gun-rights rally planned at the legislative building for Monday.
Federal prosecutors said the three suspects were members of the neo-Nazi group The Base, a small militant organization dedicated to committing violence against minorities and obstructing authorities from learning about their activities. When Lemley and Mathews were arrested, they smashed their cellphones and dumped them into the toilet before submitting to federal agents, Assistant U.S. Attorney Thomas Windom said.
Standing calmly before Judge Charles Day, Lemley wore a T-shirt and pajama pants, while Mathews sported camouflage pants and a bushy blond beard. 
Both men answered ""yes"" when the judge asked if they understood the charges against them, which include transporting a firearm with intent to commit an offense. They answered ""no"" when asked if they were under the influence of drugs or alcohol. 
Bilbrough, redheaded and wearing glasses, listened as prosecutors read the charges against him, including transporting and harboring aliens. He smiled several times as prosecutors described his alleged activity with the Base.
Lemley and Mathews remained in federal custody due to their alleged firearms violations. The judge decided to detain Bilbrough after prosecutors said the 19-year-old defendant might go into hiding or try to flee the country since he had repeatedly expressed a desire to travel to Ukraine to fight with ""nationalists"" there.
Bilbrough's defense attorney denied that his client posed a flight risk, noting that he lived with his grandmother and lacked a passport.
The judge set the three defendants' detention hearings for Wednesday. 
The FBI and the Department of Homeland Security have been sharply criticized for not focusing enough on the threat of far-right extremism following a spate of attacks on synagogues and a 2017 white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Heads of both of those agencies have said in recent months that they were taking the threat more seriously.
Several thousand gun rights supporters are planning a large rally in Richmond, Virginia's capital, on Monday in response to the newly Democratic-controlled state legislature's push to stiffen gun laws. 
Virginia, where Democrats took control of the legislature by promising stronger gun laws, has become the latest focal point for the contentious American debate around the right to bear arms. Many gun-rights groups contend the U.S. Constitution guarantees their ability to possess any firearm. Those opposed say gun laws would help lessen the number of people killed by guns each year. 
The three men are accused of interstate commerce of weapons, harboring illegal aliens, an alien in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and aiding and abetting. The FBI also said in the court filing that the men had attempted to manufacture DMT, a powerful psychedelic that is an illegal drug under federal law. 
While federal authorities can bring criminal terrorism charges against those suspected of working on behalf of foreign extremist groups like al Qaeda, they lack those tools when pursuing affiliates of domestic extremist groups, whose views are protected by the free-speech clause of the U.S. Constitution.
The men were in possession of what looked like a fully automatic rifle, according to an FBI agent who watched the men fire the weapon at a gun range.
Shortly after firing the weapon on Jan. 2 at a Maryland gun range, Lemley told Mathews, ""Oh, oops, it looks like I accidentally made a machine gun,"" according to the court document. 

Lemley and Mathews lived together in Delaware, while Bilbrough resided in Maryland. Mathews illegally crossed over the border into the United States in August, the court document said.

COBARGO, Australia (Reuters) - For two weeks, builder Rod Dunn has been living at a showground in a borrowed caravan, wearing an old coat donated by a friend.
His house, car, sheds and work tools were wiped out by the ferocious New Year bushfires that swept through the Australian town of Cobargo, killing three of its residents and destroying dozens of homes, farms and vehicles.
Though he has lost everything, he counts himself lucky.
""We live in the best place in the world,"" he said, nodding his head with certainty. ""This has united people like you'd never have imagined.""
Standing outside a shabby caravan with plastic chairs and dogs roaming around, Dunn recalls how a friend risked his life to rescue him from his blazing property, and how strangers from a town 70 km (43.5 miles) away gave him and his wife a tent to sleep in.
""That tent saved us,"" said Dunn, a 62-year-old with an unkempt white beard that reaches his chest. ""I'm totally overwhelmed by what we've seen here, the generosity of mankind.""
Wildfires on a massive scale have killed 29 people since September in Australia, fueled by record temperatures and tinder-dry conditions, turning swathes of farms and woodlands black, and blanketing the sky in haze.
While residents of many of the fire-threatened towns and villages heeded advice to leave and head to evacuation centers elsewhere, Cobargo's less than 1,000 people chose not to abandon their town.
A handful of fleeing locals set up their caravans and tents at Cobargo's showground, defying orders by police to move to designated locations outside the town in New South Wales state.

'WE STAY AS A COMMUNITY'
Word quickly spread that a commune was forming. Caravans in tow, more evacuees arrived, among them farmers, some bringing horses.
A kitchen, laundry facilities and a food bank were set up, and medics, a counsellor and a chaplain joined to support the displaced. Meetings were nightly and trucks rolled up daily, bringing water, food, animal feeds and huge hay bales for farms.
""We made the call that we stay as a community,"" said Tony Allen, a former mayor in the district. ""We knew then that was a big risk, it's breaking every rule in the book, but this is the way to do this. We keep the community together.""
In Cobargo, a town known for its bookstores, century-old buildings and its annual folk festival, shops opened to accept donated goods, putting up signs that said ""open to everyone"" and offering clothes, linen, blankets and ""free hugs"".
A set of amber-coloured firefighter overalls was hung on the fence of one house, with a sign saying ""thanks guys"".
Volunteers from elsewhere in Australia helped to clean solar panels, repair farmers' fences and clear debris from rural roads.
""There has been so much help and support. Everybody looks after each other. There are so many good people here,"" said Philippe Ravanel, a Swiss blacksmith, standing in the rubble of a 150-year-old home that he bought in 2006, of which only the fireplace remains.
Hundreds of people flocked to a fundraiser at the local pub, The Cobargo Hotel, cheering and embracing firefighters as army personnel opened their vehicles to children and former sports stars mingled with evacuees and farmers.
Homes are already becoming available. Peter Hisco is moving to Sydney, Australia's largest city, and will rent his two-storey house to two displaced families. “My wife has a new job in Sydney so we’ll rent both floors out at a reasonable price.""
Former butcher Barry Parkes, 68, who lost his house, two vehicles and his Harley Davidson motorcycle, said friends had asked him to house-sit for them. “We’ve had a lot of people offering us places,” he said.
Rod Dunn, the builder, said a friend had kindly offered him use of his property, rent-free for a year.
""It's a good place too,"" he said, smiling. ""I should know, I built the bloody place."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has considered sending Brazilian migrants crossing the border from Mexico back there to await their U.S. court hearings, according to a U.S. official and a Mexican official familiar with the discussions.
The deliberations came in response to an increase in Brazilians arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border seeking asylum in the United States, the officials said. The administration of President Donald Trump has also explored the possibility of sending Brazilian asylum seekers to other nations, according to the U.S. official.
Trump, who is seeking re-election in November, has made immigration a central focus of his pitch to voters. During his presidency, he has railed against asylum seekers and argued the bulk of migrants arriving at the border lack a valid claim for protection.
If the plan moves forward, Brazilians could be sent to Mexico under a program known as the Migrant Protection Protocols. More than 57,000 non-Mexican migrants have been returned to Mexico under that effort since it launched a year ago, according to the DHS.
The program previously had covered Spanish-speaking migrants. But the addition of people from Brazil, where Portuguese is the official language, would expand its reach further.
DHS spokeswoman Heather Swift did not confirm or deny the possibility Brazilians could be sent to Mexico, but said the department ""is always looking at ways to expand and strengthen the program to include new locations, populations, and procedures.""
Officials from Mexico and Brazil did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The possibility of including Brazil in the program emerged as the number of Brazilians arrested at the U.S.-Mexico border - a metric used to gauge illegal crossings - soared over the past year.
Border Patrol caught roughly 17,900 Brazilians at the southwest border in the last fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, 2018. The figure was a sharp increase from 1,500 arrests a year earlier.
Brazilians made up a small portion of the more than 850,000 people picked up at the border last year, but the surge of Brazilians has continued in recent months, even as overall arrests have declined, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics.
Another avenue to deal with the Brazilian arrivals could be an asylum agreement brokered by the Trump administration with Honduras last year.
A Honduran diplomat told Reuters earlier in January that Honduras has agreed to receive Brazilians, Guatemalans, Mexicans, Nicaraguans, and Salvadorans beginning in late January or early February."

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - At least 2,200 people have entered Guatemala in a fast-growing U.S.-bound caravan from Honduras, authorities said on Thursday, putting pressure on the region to satisfy Trump administration demands to curb illegal immigration.
Mexico's government is bracing for the arrival of hundreds of Central Americans on its southern border in coming days, an event likely to be closely monitored by the U.S. government, which has made cutting illegal immigration a priority.
Guatemala's National Migration Institute said in a statement that at least 2,274 people had entered the country. Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for the institute, said the migrants had mostly crossed the northern part of the border with Honduras.
U.S. President Donald Trump has pressured Mexico and Central American nations to accept a series of migration agreements that aim to shift the burden of dealing with asylum-seekers on to them, and away from the United States.
Most migrants caught on the U.S. border with Mexico depart from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador, seeking to escape chronic poverty or gang violence.
Unlike Guatemala, Mexico has refused to become a so-called safe third country obliging it to accept asylum claims from migrants that set foot on its soil. Still, Trump has threatened trade sanctions if it does not contain the flow of people.
Guatemala's new president, Alejandro Giammattei, said on Wednesday that Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard had told him Mexico would not allow the new caravan to pass.
Mexico's foreign ministry has not responded directly to that assertion. However, Interior Minister Olga Sanchez said the border would be policed and that the Mexican government would not be issuing any visas of safe conduct to the migrants.
""That's very clear,"" she told reporters.
According to communications shared by some of the migrants on messaging service WhatsApp, some of the Hondurans said that they planned to meet in the town of Santa Elena in northern Guatemala and head for the Mexican border on Saturday.
Under a freedom of movement accord between northern Central American countries, Giammattei said he would let the caravan enter Guatemala provided people had the necessary paperwork.

Some migrants were turned back at the Guatemalan border on Wednesday and Honduran police fired tear gas on others who tried to cross without going through migration checks.

Writing on his Twitter account, Ernesto Araújo said Brazil was also pulling out because the organization, known as CELAC, had become a ""stage"" for authoritarian states, citing Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua.
""CELAC had not been generating results in defense of democracy or in any area,"" Araújo said.
Appointed by Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, Araújo has echoed the Brazilian leader's longstanding criticisms of leftist Latin American governments.
Countries across the region have, over the past few years, oscillated between left-wing and conservative governments, often with radically different economic and social policies.
Bolsonaro is the most visible right-wing leader in Latin America, while Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is the highest-profile leftist leader. Brazil is the region's biggest economy, followed by Mexico.
Since last year, anger at inequality and poverty have pushed conservatives out in Mexico and Argentina, while fueling protests in recent weeks that forced Ecuador and Chile to water down austerity-focused economic policies.
Next year, Mexico will assume the CELAC presidency, which was established in Venezuela during the late President Hugo Chavez's government but has lost influence in recent years.
Despite pulling out of the CELAC, Araújo said Brazil remained committed to working in all other regional bodies, such as the Organization of American States (OAS) and Mercosur."

TORONTO/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan's decision to step back from royal duties and split their time between Britain and Canada is expected to boost Canada's brand abroad and benefit tourism, although marketing consultants say the effect will be limited.
Royalty is big business globally. It is estimated that the British monarchy as a whole contributed 1.77 billion pounds ($2.31 billion) to the UK economy annually, a 2017 report by London-based brand valuation firm Brand Finance found.
That comes from intangible assets such as the uplift given to brands with a royal warrant, tourism to landmarks like Buckingham Palace, and the impact of their service as goodwill ambassadors on trade.
Last week, Prince Harry, 35, and former actress Meghan, 38, said they would reduce their royal duties and spend more time in North America, while also becoming financially independent. That sparked a crisis in the British monarchy and led to questions about what it will mean for Canada.
Any potential economic boost will depend on how Canada's newest immigrants relate to their new home, said Charlie Scarlett-Smith, a marketing director with Brand Finance in Montreal.
""If they start really cherishing Canadian brands and cherishing a Canadian identity, then we'll see aspects of those parts of our economy - tourism, etc - start to boost as well,"" he said.
But any broader impact is likely to be negligible, especially given that the couple appear to want out of the limelight, said Doug Porter, chief economist for BMO Capital Markets.
""The very fact that part of what's motivating this is to step away from the public eye suggests we can't expect any big boost in merchandising or tourism or that sort of thing. I don't expect it would really move the needle at all on the Canadian economy,"" he added.
The couple, who announced the decision to step back shortly after spending their Christmas holidays in the Canadian province of British Columbia, have trademarked the Sussex Royal brand name. 
The UK royal family remains generally popular in Canada, a former British colony that retains Queen Elizabeth as its official head of state.
A poll by pollster Angus Reid found 69% of 1,154 Canadians surveyed hold Prince Harry in a favorable light, although 45% of respondents said Canada should not continue as a constitutional monarchy indefinitely.
Destination BC, the official tourism bureau of British Columbia, estimated that when Prince William and his wife Kate visited in 2016, the print and online coverage of that trip translated into the equivalent of some C$2 million ($1.53 million) worth of advertising in the UK alone.

""As they start doing public events, and confirm their plans for their stay in Canada, I'm sure we'll see more spikes in interest which could certainly lead to visitation as BC gets itself gets more attention,"" said Clare Mason, spokeswoman for Destination BC.

Officials found the bodies of the six and the child of one of their neighbors in a mass grave in the indigenous region of Ngabe-Bugle, said Rafael Baloyes, senior prosecutor of the Bocas del Toro province of western Panama.
In a video published by the office of Panama's attorney general, Baloyes said the grave came to light after locals alerted authorities at the weekend about several families being held against their will in a local indigenous-run church where exorcisms were believed to have taken place.
""We're talking about seven victims, six minors between the ages of one and 17,"" Baloyes said. ""Six from one family, the mother and her five children, and the mother was pregnant.""
On Wednesday, authorities freed 15 people being held by the religious sect. Ten sect members were arrested on suspicion of responsibility for the killings, prosecutors said.

STRASBOURG (Reuters) - Britain's 73 EU lawmakers packed up their offices in Strasbourg on Thursday: for some a moment of triumph, for others, disaster.
This week marked the last sitting of the European Parliament in the eastern French town before Brexit Britain leaves the bloc on Jan. 31 and all those lawmakers lose their jobs. 
There is one more session to go in the assembly's main base in Brussels. But for the British MEPs, from Thursday, there will be no more first-class train journeys trips across the Ardennes to their regular sessions in Strasbourg, and no more dining out on its Alsatian wine, choucroute and tarte flambee.
The Brexit Party's Ann Widdecombe, for one, said she was ""delighted"" to be winding up her near eight-month career as a Member of the European Parliament.
""I came here to get Brexit done, she told Reuters. ""That's why I came and we've been pretty successful."" 
Her possessions in Strasbourg, she said, fitted into one cardboard box. She was looking forward to returning to her home in southwest England, to writing, to giving speeches on cruise ships and to getting involved in pantomimes.
The 751 members of parliament (MEPs) convene in Strasbourg four days a month and in Brussels for the remainder, an upheaval that costs millions of euros a year - something that Brexiteers such as Widdecombe regularly hold up as evidence of EU waste.
Fellow Brexit Party member Claire Fox said she had no regrets about saying goodbye to the French border town. She had only joined the European Parliament to get her country out of the whole institution. Britain had stayed ""longer than we should have"".
""THE MOST INTERESTING JOB""
Not long enough for Luisa Porritt, a lawmaker from the Liberal Democrats, which campaigned to stay in the European Union.
Her career as an MEP was as short as Widdecombe's but she said felt ""very lucky"" to have had the experience.
""I've been grateful for every extra day that I've had,"" said the 32-year-old, who is planning to take a break in Iceland after Jan. 31.
Caroline Voaden, head of the EU assembly's Liberal Democrat delegation, said she felt devastated.
""It's been the most interesting job of my life, but that's so minimal compared to the sadness I feel about what it means for Britain.""
The job had given her an opportunity to speak out on mental health, shape the EU's new Green Deal and work in a multicultural environment. It had been ""gruelling"", but she would miss it and struggle to settle back in to her small hometown in England.
All four women joined the European Parliament at the last elections in May 2019, so they will not qualify for the assembly's golden goodbye - one month of salary for every year in office, capped at 24 months, for MEPs with more than a year under their belts.

In just over two weeks time, they will be shutting up their even bigger offices in Brussels, and handing back their access and voting cards, office keys and laptops.

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - An Israeli court on Thursday ordered closed-door hearings in Amnesty International's legal bid to stop NSO Group exporting surveillance software, which rights groups say is used to spy on journalists and dissidents worldwide.
A Tel Aviv District Court judge cited national security concerns when she banned the public and the media from court sessions, drawing quick condemnation from the campaign group. 
""It's outrageous we have to be gagged,"" Gil Naveh, an Amnesty spokesman, told reporters. 
Israel's defence ministry - which asked for the court restrictions - and NSO declined to comment on Amnesty's lawsuit, which could decide whether the government needs tougher oversight on cyber exports - a sector in which Israel is a world leader. 
Amnesty says governments have used the Israeli company's cellphone hacking software, Pegasus, to crack down on activists across the world. A study by University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab has linked it to political surveillance in Mexico, the UAE and Saudi Arabia.
NSO has said it only sells its technology to state and law enforcement agencies ""to help them fight terrorism and serious crime"".
Judge Rachel Barkai initially had said she would allow Amnesty's arguments to be heard publicly but government lawyers argued it would then look as if the state was admitting to Amnesty's accusations and Barkai changed her mind.
NSO came under particular scrutiny when a Saudi dissident close to murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi filed a lawsuit alleging that NSO had helped the royal court to take over his smartphone and spy on his communications with Khashoggi.
NSO has denied that its technology was used in Khashoggi’s murder.
In October, WhatsApp, which is owned by  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB), sued NSO in the U.S. federal court in San Francisco, accusing it of helping government spies break into the phones of about 1,400 users across four continents.

NSO, which was purchased by London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital last year, announced in September it would begin abiding by U.N. guidelines on human rights abuses.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union is considering banning facial recognition technology in public areas for up to five years, to give it time to work out how to prevent abuses, according to proposals seen by Reuters.
The plan by the EU's executive - set out in an 18-page white paper - comes amid a global debate about the systems driven by artificial intelligence and widely used by law enforcement agencies.
The EU Commission said new tough rules may have to be introduced to bolster existing regulations protecting Europeans' privacy and data rights.
""Building on these existing provisions, the future regulatory framework could go further and include a time-limited ban on the use of facial recognition technology in public spaces,"" the EU document said.
During that ban, of between three to five years, ""a sound methodology for assessing the impacts of this technology and possible risk management measures could be identified and developed.""
Exceptions to the ban could be made for security projects as well as research and development, the paper said.
The document also suggested imposing obligations on both developers and users of artificial intelligence and that EU countries should appoint authorities to monitor the new rules.
The Commission will seek feedback on its white paper before making a final decision, officials said. EU digital and antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager is expected to present her proposals next month.
The U.S. government earlier this month announced regulatory guidelines on artificial intelligence technology aimed at limiting authorities' overreach and urged Europe to avoid aggressive approaches."

AMMAN/GENEVA (Reuters) - Around 350,000 Syrians, mostly women and children, have fled a renewed Russian-backed offensive in the opposition-held Idlib province since early December, and have sought shelter in border areas near Turkey, the United Nations said on Thursday.
Conditions for people were deteriorating because of the increased hostilities, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said in its latest situation report.
Russian jets and Syrian artillery have pounded towns and villages in a renewed assault backed by pro-Iranian militias and aimed at clearing the opposition.
""This latest wave of displacement compounds an already dire humanitarian situation on the ground in Idlib,"" David Swanson, Amman-based U.N. regional spokesman for Syria, told Reuters.
Russian and Syrian jets resumed bombing of civilian areas in the opposition enclave two days after a ceasefire agreed between Turkey and Russia formally took effect on Sunday.
Russia's Ministry of Defence on Thursday denied media reports that it had bombed civilian targets in Idlib province, saying there had been no military flights since a ceasefire was introduced on Jan. 9, RIA reported.
Residents and rescuers said dozens of towns and villages were in ruins from weeks of intensive aerial bombing.
The Russian-led campaign has also knocked down dozens of hospitals and schools, international aid agencies said.
Karen AbuZayd, a U.N. war crimes investigator on Syria, told reporters in Geneva that many of the destroyed or closed schools in opposition-held areas were now being used as shelters for people fleeing the violence.
The latest wave of displaced people comes on top of close to 400,000 people who fled earlier fighting for the safety of camps near the Turkish border, U.N. officials said.
Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria, told reporters on Thursday that many uprooted families now in makeshift camps were running short of food and water.
The latest offensive has brought the Russian-steered military campaign closer to heavily populated parts of Idlib province, where nearly 3 million people are trapped, according to the United Nations.
Rescuers and residents said that on Thursday Russian and Syrian jets pounded the devastated city of Maarat al-Numan. It is one of the main urban centres in the province and lies on a main highway held by rebels.
The army and Iranian-backed militias are advancing towards the city. Its capture would be a strategic government gain in the current campaign, which is intended also to regain control of major trade arteries important to Syria's war-torn economy.

On Wednesday at least 21 civilians were killed in heavy aerial strikes, among them 19 people who died when bombs were dropped on a busy market place in the centre of Idlib city, the provincial capital.

LONDON (Reuters) - Five countries whose citizens died when Iran shot down an airliner last week said on Thursday that Tehran should pay compensation to families of the victims, and warned that the world is watching for its response.
Canada, Ukraine, Sweden, Afghanistan and Britain said Iran should hold a ""thorough, independent and transparent international investigation open to grieving nations,"" in a statement issued after a meeting of officials in London.
The airliner was struck by a missile on Jan. 8 shortly after it left Tehran en route to Kiev. Iran admitted on Saturday it had shot down the Ukraine International Airlines plane in error, after initially denying it had a role in the incident. All 176 people aboard, including 57 Canadians, were killed.
The five countries asked Iran to conduct the process of identifying victims with dignity and transparency while respecting the wishes of families regarding repatriation.
""The eyes of the international community are on Iran today. I think that Iran has a choice, and the world is watching,"" Canadian foreign minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said at a news conference in London.
The countries said they welcomed Iran's engagement to date.
Earlier on Thursday, the foreign ministers of the five countries each lit a candle to commemorate the victims at the Canadian High Commission in London, and paused for a moment of reflection.
Most of those on Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 were Iranians or dual citizens, many of them students returning to studies abroad or families on their way home after visiting relatives in Iran.
The premier of Ontario, Canada's most populous province, proposed a fund on Thursday to disburse 57 scholarships of C$10,000 ($7,663.42) each, in honour of the number of Canadians killed in the crash.
Many of the victims were academics, researchers and students linked to 19 Canadian universities.
Ukrainian Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko said on Thursday that he had discussed with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif the repatriation of the bodies of Ukrainian victims.
The bodies of all 11 Ukrainians who were killed have been identified and will be transported back to Ukraine on Jan. 19, the interior ministry said in a statement to Reuters."

Ankara's relations with Cairo have been frosty since the Egyptian army ousted Muslim Brotherhood president Mohammed Mursi, an ally of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, in 2013. The two countries have also been at odds over maritime jurisdiction and offshore resources in the eastern Mediterranean.
""Hilmi Balci, one of our four employees detained in Egypt, has been released. We expect the others to be released on bail,"" general manager Senol Kazanci was quoted as saying by Anadolu.
Balci is the only Turkish citizen among those who were detained, Anadolu said, without specifying the nationalities of the others.
Egypt's interior ministry has confirmed the raid and detentions, saying the location - which it said was a flat - had been used to produce false and ""negative"" information.
It accused Turkey and the banned Muslim Brotherhood of being behind ""adverse activity"" at the flat.
Turkey's Foreign Ministry condemned the raid as ""an act of violence"" against Anadolu. It later said that it had also summoned the Egyptian charge d'affaires over the matter."

The U.S. military grounded Saudi pilots and restricted the some 850 visiting Saudi military personnel in the country to classroom training as part of a ""safety stand-down"" during which time it reviewed vetting procedures.
Next week, Defense Secretary Mark Esper is due to visit the base in Pensacola, Florida, where the shooting took place and will brief base leadership on planned improvements in vetting of foreign military personnel and changes to security procedures, including physical security at U.S. bases, the Pentagon said.
Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the U.S. military also expected to soon announce a resumption in operational training.
""We're looking forward to turning that (training) back on in the coming days,"" Hoffman told a news briefing, adding ""we should have an announcement for you soon.""
Three U.S. sailors were killed and eight other people were wounded in the attack at the Pensacola Naval Air Station. A deputy sheriff shot dead the gunman, Saudi Air Force Second Lieutenant Mohammed Saeed Alshamrani.
U.S. Attorney General William Barr on Monday called the shooting an act of terrorism and announced Saudi Arabia's withdrawal of 21 cadets after an investigation showed they either had child pornography or social media accounts containing Islamic extremist or anti-American content.
The Dec. 6 attack further complicated U.S.-Saudi relations at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and Iran, Saudi Arabia's regional rival.
It also threw a spotlight on the extensive U.S. military relationship with Saudi Arabia, which is under scrutiny in the U.S. Congress over the war in Yemen and Saudi Arabia's killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018."

The army said two soldiers were killed and four wounded in fighting late on Tuesday in Khartoum with former members of the country's once-feared security service before government forces quelled the uprising.
It was the biggest confrontation so far between the old guard and supporters of the transitional authorities, which helped topple Bashir in April after 30 years in power.
The Transitional Sovereign Council, which runs the country, accepted the resignation of General Abu Bakr Dumblab, the head of the General Intelligence Service, formerly known as National Intelligence and Security Service, a council statement said.
The council appointed General Jamal Abdul Majeed as a new head of the service. He had headed military intelligence.
Dumblab resigned ""to open the door for a new leadership to take over the agency at this sensitive and delicate stage,"" the intelligence service said in statement. Dumblab had become head of the service after the removal of Bashir.
Former agents of the intelligence service, who had been protesting against their severance packages, also shut two small oilfields on Tuesday.
The military took control of the two fields, which have an output of around 5,000 barrels a day, and production resumed on Wednesday.
The revolt also forced the authorities to close Sudan's airspace but it was reopened on Tuesday.
In a speech early on Wednesday, the sovereign council head, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, vowed to stand firm against any coup attempt and added that the army was in control of all buildings used by the intelligence service.
Restructuring the security apparatus, blamed by many Sudanese for suppressing dissent under Bashir, was a key demand of the uprising that had forced his removal. However, once dismissed by the new transitional government, many of the security agents returned to barracks without handing in their weapons."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Approval for Chile's President Sebastian Pinera has sunk to just 6% since widespread protests against elitism and inequality broke out, with less than half of Chileans now believing the country is a functioning democracy, according to a poll released on Thursday. 
The Center for Public Studies (CEP) survey found that 81% of those polled believed the government had handled the outbreak of unrest - which started over public transport fares on Oct. 18 and continues sporadically - ""badly or very badly.""
The results came the day after Pinera, a center-right billionaire elected in December 2017 on a promise of economic growth and greater development, announced an overhaul of Chile´s hated privatized pensions system after admitting the country had treated its elderly ""ungratefully.""
He added that in response to the protests his administration was drafting new laws to improve the quality of public education and the health service and cut waiting lists, protect jobs and improve earnings, better protect workers, consumers and citizens' rights and introduce stiffer penalties for monopolistic practices and white-collar crime. 
But so far, Pinera´s pledges have had a limited impact in the world’s top copper exporter. 
In the CEP poll, support for him fell 19 points compared with the previous poll in May last year, while disapproval rose 32 points to 82%.
""This is the worst evaluation a president has had since the return to democracy,"" said Ricardo Gonzalez, CEP´s coordinator of Public Opinion.
Chile´s police and armed forces, both central and controversial players in the protests amid accusations of human rights abuses, saw trust in them plummet. 
Support for the police went from 37% in 2017 to 17% today, while trust in the armed forces - who were called out by Pinera in the early days of the arrest to police a curfew - eroded from 40% to 24%. 
More than half of respondents expressed support for the demonstrations and 64% said they believed the police violated human rights.
A total of 47% believed that democracy in Chile, which returned in 1990 after 17 years of military rule under General Augusto Pinochet, worked ""badly or very badly,"" while 44% believed that it worked ""fine.""

The poll was based on 1,496 interviews across the country between Nov. 28 and Jan. 6, with a margin of error of plus or minus three points.

The period, good through April 9, allows transactions in the construction, mining, manufacturing or textiles sectors of Iran's economy that could be targeted under last week's action to be wound down without exposure to sanctions, the Treasury Department said in an update to its frequently asked questions, or FAQs, on Iran sanctions on its website.
Entering into new business that falls under the sanctions imposed on Friday, however, would not be considered winding down and could still be sanctionable, the FAQ said.
The United States imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday in retaliation for its missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq last week and vowed to tighten the economic screws if Tehran continued ""terrorist"" acts or pursued a nuclear bomb.
The targets of the sanctions included Iran's manufacturing, mining and textile sectors as well as senior Iranian officials who Washington said were involved in the Jan. 8 attack on military bases housing U.S. troops.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have spiked since Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.

Those U.S. sanctions have driven down Iranian crude sales, the Islamic Republic's main source of revenues, but so far have not brought Iran back to the negotiating table to discuss a new nuclear pact as sought by Trump.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Liberal grassroots groups on Thursday launched a bid to calm tensions between supporters of the two progressive standard-bearers in the Democratic presidential race, U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, who have engaged in a days-long feud after months of non-aggression.
Led by the political action committee Democracy for America, the 18 groups announced the ""Progressives Unite 2020"" campaign, which includes a promise to ""focus our fight for the nomination against candidates supported by the corporate wing, instead of fighting each other.""
The spat between Warren and Sanders stems from a private conversation they had in December 2018 to discuss the 2020 race, when both senators were laying the groundwork for a presidential campaign to challenge incumbent Republican Donald Trump.
Warren has said Sanders told her he did not believe a woman could be elected president, a comment that Sanders has denied making.
The dispute intensified on Wednesday, when CNN aired previously unreleased audio of the two speaking after Tuesday night's Democratic debate in Iowa. Warren, ignoring Sanders' offer to shake hands, said, ""I think you just called me a liar on national TV.""
Sanders responded that Warren, in fact, had called him a liar but said they should discuss the incident another time.
The new coalition includes groups that have backed Sanders, such as Our Revolution and the Sunrise Movement, as well as organizations supporting Warren, such as the Working Families Party and the Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Change Campaign Committee.
The groups said they would ask their members to sign a pledge to ""vote strategically"" in their states to ensure either Warren or Sanders emerges as the nominee. In other words, if their top choice falters, they would vote for the other liberal despite the current feud.
Warren and Sanders had informally agreed not to attack one another at the campaign's outset, a truce that largely held until last weekend, when Politico reported that the Sanders campaign was training its canvassers to tell voters that Warren would not expand the party's base."

BEIRUT (Reuters) - An upsurge of violence in Lebanon's protests against the ruling elite, with police meting out beatings and protesters hurling stones, has alarmed rights groups and whipped up public fury.
After a brief lull in largely peaceful protests since October, people filled the streets again this week, angry at a political class that has steered Lebanon into its worst economic crisis since a 1975-1990 civil war.
On Tuesday and Wednesday, police wielding batons and firing tear gas wounded and arrested dozens as protesters lit fires and smashed bank facades and ATMs, Reuters journalists saw.
""These past two nights, they (police) were really barbaric,"" said Cynthia Sleiman, a charity worker and protester who ended up in hospital after Wednesday night's violence in Beirut.
""I had just arrived and was looking for my friends when the policeman grabbed me, hitting me on the head and neck. I fell to the ground and blood was streaming out,"" she said.
Lebanon's Internal Security Forces (ISF) said they were pursuing rioters and 100 policemen were injured this week. ""The force member is suffering daily in the street,"" ISF chief Imad Othman said on Thursday. ""He is not a robot, he is a human.""
A security source said at least 80 protesters were injured in two days and 72 others arrested. Many of those in detention would be released on Thursday, the source said.
Since the protests led Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to resign in October, politicians have failed to agree a new cabinet or rescue plan for the heavily-indebted economy. The Lebanese pound has lost nearly half its value, dollar shortages have driven up prices and confidence in banks has collapsed. 
Azza al-Masri, a media researcher also injured on Wednesday, said she saw a woman faint after police beat her up. ""The viciousness was unlike anything I've seen,"" she said.
Activists believe police violence may indicate Lebanon's establishment has lost patience with protesters and is also stung by public wrath against banks, which have curbed access to savings and blocked most transfers abroad.
Human Rights Watch's Beirut director Lama Fakih told Reuters the group was concerned at excessive force by security forces amid rising frustrations on both sides. She said there was no ""strong message"" from government that police would be held responsible.
A Lebanese media group said 15 journalists were attacked on Wednesday. One of them was a Reuters video journalist, who was treated in hospital for head injuries and released. 

On Thursday, lawyers, journalists and activists gathered at the interior ministry and the justice palace in Beirut to complain about police violence. Interior Minister Raya al-Hassan told reporters she had not ordered a clampdown and denounced attacks on media, while also urging understanding for police.

795,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 12:21PM ET</span>",Special Report: How secrecy in U.S. courts hobbles regulators,"By Mike Spector, Jaimi Dowdell and Benjamin Lesser
LEBANON, Ohio (Reuters) - Something wasn’t right with the Rhino.
Reports started trickling in to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in 2005 of people being killed or injured in the Yamaha Motor Co off-road vehicles when they tipped over. But no clear pattern emerged, and in the rough and tumble off-road world, accidents are common. The agency took no action.
Then, in 2007, ten-year-old Ellie Sand was killed in a Rhino when it flipped in a cornfield in Warren County, Ohio. Her father, house painter John Sand, started reading up on other Rhino crashes. He spoke to other parents whose children had died or been seriously injured in similar incidents. He became convinced that Rhinos were the problem.
Using a computer in a Cincinnati law library, Sand found more than a dozen lawsuits alleging that the vehicles were dangerously unstable. Some of the lawsuits – like the one he filed against the company in 2008 – claimed that design flaws caused the Rhinos to roll over even at slow speeds on flat ground. Sand sent the results of his research to CPSC, highlighting details from the lawsuits of the tip-overs that led to deaths and injuries.
Soon after, CPSC sent a subpoena to Yamaha, forcing it to hand over a trove of information, much of which had lain hidden under judges’ protective orders in the lawsuits against the company. By then, more than 40 people, including more than a dozen children, had been killed in Rhino crashes.
The impact of Sand’s work was confirmed in a voicemail message Sand received a few months later. Yamaha had agreed to a voluntary recall covering more than 100,000 Rhinos to fix the stability problems. “As a result of the information – a lot of the information that we received from you – we’ve gotten this far, so I wanted to thank you,” Marc Schoem, then deputy director of CPSC’s compliance and field operations, said in the March 31, 2009, message, which was reviewed by Reuters.
Five years after the recall was announced, CPSC staff noted in a 2014 briefing that crashes involving the Rhino had “decreased noticeably.”
Sand told Reuters he “was elated that the work I’d done could help stop the carnage.” Still, he was surprised that it took an “average Joe” like him to flag the lawsuits to CPSC.
A CPSC spokesman said that the agency had investigated Rhino incidents and that establishing a pattern that would have supported finding the vehicles defective proved challenging. Schoem declined to comment, as did Yamaha.
ERRORS AND INCONSISTENCIES
CPSC is one of more than a dozen regulatory agencies tasked with protecting Americans from dangerous products. And the Rhino episode reveals a troubling dynamic in the way these watchdogs do their jobs: Sometimes the only way they can learn about and act on a possible threat to consumers is from evidence produced in lawsuits, but that evidence is often hidden behind a wall of secrecy.
Most regulators have their own reporting systems for conducting oversight. But their databases can be vast and unwieldy, stuffed with thousands and even millions of consumer complaints and reports from manufacturers of safety concerns, injuries or deaths. The reports are often rife with mistakes and inconsistencies. Not all consumers even know they can file complaints. And companies regularly flout legally mandated reporting requirements.
That leaves the courts as a conduit for alerting regulators to potential harm, and it’s far from perfect. As Reuters has documented in earlier articles in this series, a thick blanket of secrecy covers product-liability litigation in the United States. In just a handful of cases over the past several decades, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or injured by defective products – cars, drugs, guns – while information about the risks was hidden from consumers and regulators, sometimes for years, behind broad protective orders.
These orders, though meant to protect specific information such as medical records and trade secrets, often give companies wide latitude to designate as confidential material exchanged between litigants in the pretrial discovery process – internal emails, data, research, meeting minutes, sworn depositions and the like. The secrecy typically persists for the life of the case, and long after, though court documents are, by law, presumed to be public.
In an analysis of some of the largest mass defective-product cases consolidated in federal courts over the past 20 years, Reuters found 55 in which judges sealed information concerning public health and safety. And among those, only three had protective orders containing language specifically allowing information exchanged by the litigants to be shared with regulators.
Regulators may subpoena information from a manufacturer after spotting a suspicious cluster of lawsuits, or after being alerted by a consumer like Sand in the Yamaha Rhino case.
But those are rare exceptions. And regulators themselves aren’t inclined to mine court records as a means of oversight. In the 55 big cases Reuters reviewed, public court filings contained no indication that regulators had requested any information arising from the lawsuits.
A few years ago, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and CPSC issued pleas for easier access to evidence introduced in court under protective orders. But the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 15 other federal departments or agencies surveyed by Reuters did not point to any explicit policy or guidance on gaining access to court evidence potentially relevant to their oversight functions.
Yet regulators have repeatedly documented the failures of existing safeguards. Since 2009, NHTSA and CPSC have fined a total of at least 90 companies for failing to meet safety-reporting requirements, while the FDA has issued more than a dozen warning letters to manufacturers of drugs and medical devices for similar lapses.
Big business and its lobbyists contend that regulators have all the tools they need to do their jobs well – including the power to subpoena information subject to a judge’s protective order.
“The protective order cannot block the government,” said Victor Schwartz, a partner at law firm Shook, Hardy & Bacon LLP who has defended companies in civil litigation. “Litigation gets publicity. If the government sees something about a case … it can use its power, the subpoena power, to find out more detail,” he said.
That argument, former U.S. regulatory officials said, doesn’t hold water when litigation is cloaked in secrecy. “It’s a catch-22,” said David Friedman, a former NHTSA official. If documents and other evidence in litigation are sealed, “how are you supposed to know about them?” Friedman said. “If you don’t know about them, you can’t get them.”
DEFECTIVE SWITCH
Friedman was at NHTSA during General Motors (NYSE:GM) Co’s notorious 2014 recall of millions of cars with defective ignition switches, ultimately linked to 124 deaths and 275 injuries. A 2015 deferred prosecution agreement between GM and federal prosecutors showed the company scrambled for years to make sense of mounting reports of deaths and injuries while keeping regulators and the public in the dark about the switches, even after uncovering clear internal evidence they were defective.
As early as 2003, NHTSA received complaints that Saturn Ions were stalling and, by 2004, that their airbags were failing to deploy in collisions. Similar complaints soon cropped up about Chevrolet Cobalts. In the ensuing years, the agency examined several fatal Cobalt crashes, each involving switches that slipped out of position and disabled airbags.
Yet NHTSA didn’t make the connection between the switch problem and airbag failures. That was partly because its investigators misunderstood how GM’s airbag system operated, but also because NHTSA rules gave automakers a lot of leeway in how they reported certain information regarding safety risks. As a result, similar incidents were reported inconsistently. One was listed as an “engine and engine cooling” issue, for instance, while another as an “electrical” problem. That made it difficult for regulators to detect a pattern.
From the first consumer complaints and incident reports, it would be more than 10 years and scores of deaths and injuries before NHTSA and the public learned of the link between defective ignition switches and airbag failures – and then only after evidence of what GM knew emerged in litigation and prompted the automaker to pursue a recall. 
In June 2011, the parents of Jennifer Brooke Melton filed a product-liability lawsuit against the company in a Georgia state court. Melton, a 29-year-old nurse, was killed in March 2010 when her Cobalt stalled on a rainy highway, crossed into oncoming traffic, collided with another vehicle and careened into a creek.
The Melton case started, as many like it do, under a veil of secrecy. In December 2011, Judge Kathryn Tanksley approved a broad protective order, keeping from the public and NHTSA any documents that GM designated “in good faith” as confidential.
Tanksley, now retired, said she approved the order because both the Meltons’ lawyer and GM agreed to the terms. “The role of litigation is not to regulate GM,” she said. When NHTSA officials want more information, she said, they “have to pursue it not through the court, but through their own power.”
The documents GM began turning over to Lance Cooper, the Meltons’ lawyer, were damning. They showed that in 2005, for example, a company engineer suggested a fix for less than $1 per vehicle, but it was rejected as too costly and not effective enough. Cooper also obtained evidence that the company modified the switches between 2005 and 2008 to keep them from slipping. The evidence built a strong case that GM had known for years that the switches were faulty.
The Meltons were eager to go public with the evidence to prevent others from dying as their daughter had, but Cooper worried that if he challenged the protective order and regulators didn’t conclude the switches were defective, it would hurt their case. GM wanted to settle.
“We thought that people needed to know. There were still people out there driving those cars,” Beth Melton told Reuters. “It’s a real shame that these things are kept secret and other people (suffer) because of it.”
Meanwhile, a Cobalt crash in Quebec, Canada, killed another driver. The airbags did not deploy. The ignition switch was later found to be in accessory mode, the position between on and off that could cut power to airbags.
GM settled with the Meltons in September 2013 for $5 million. Five months later, after conducting its own investigation, GM recalled about 600,000 vehicles with the ignition switch.
Cooper still wasn’t satisfied, based on what he had learned in the Melton lawsuit, and having obtained a settlement for his clients, he decided it was time to share evidence with NHTSA. “I basically said: ‘The hell with it,’ ” Cooper said. “If we can get this information to the federal government, they need it. Really, it was just a strategic decision to violate the protective order.”
In a letter to NHTSA , he suggested that the automaker knew about the defect far longer than its recall paperwork said and had not recalled enough vehicles. He urged the agency to investigate, citing evidence from the Melton case that he had seen as much as a year earlier.
Eventually, NHTSA, Congress and federal prosecutors all investigated, relying heavily on evidence from the Melton case. GM increased the size of the recall, which eventually covered 2.6 million vehicles.
In May 2014, NHTSA fined GM $35 million for failing to alert regulators to the defective ignition switch in a timely manner. The next year, GM entered into the deferred prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York to settle criminal charges of concealing information from government officials and wire fraud. Under the deal, GM agreed to pay a $900 million fine and to submit to three years of oversight by an independent monitor. In 2018, a federal judge dismissed the charges against the company after prosecutors said the company had complied with the agreement.
“The most damning information came out in litigation,” said Kevin Vincent, NHTSA’s head lawyer at the time. Though the facts eventually came to light, Vincent said, initial confidentiality in the Melton case “stymied” the agency. “That was evidence the agency needed to see,” he said. “We could have acted sooner.”
In a statement to Reuters, GM said: “Since 2014, we have undertaken comprehensive reforms across the company to ensure that something like the ignition switch crisis never happens again.” The company hired additional safety investigators, created a new executive position charged with overseeing global safety and recalls, and launched a program aimed at giving employees and dealers easier ways to flag potential vehicle defects.
A NHTSA spokesman said the agency took 17 steps the U.S. Transportation Department inspector general recommended in the wake of the ignition-switch recall to improve collection and analysis of vehicle safety data.
PLEAS FOR ACCESS
In 2016, NHTSA and CPSC, seeking to address what they acknowledge is a blind spot in their efforts to safeguard consumers, issued bulletins recommending that judges and litigants agree to protective orders that would allow them to share confidential evidence pertinent to public health and safety with the relevant regulators.
“Our job is to protect consumers,” said Marietta Robinson, a CPSC commissioner at the time. “Obtaining information about an allegedly dangerous product from a lawyer representing a consumer who has been injured or killed is critically important to us doing that job.”
NHTSA’s bulletin, which cited the GM ignition-switch case, argued that keeping such information hidden from regulators clashes with federal legal requirements for courts to show “good cause” before allowing companies to keep it secret.
But the bulletins, published in the Federal Register, where the government publishes new rules, proposals and public notices, carried no enforcement power, and they have had little impact.
Judges have rarely shown willingness to grant requests from plaintiffs, expert witnesses or news organizations to share information with regulators or the public. Lawyers challenged defendants’ claims of confidentiality for material relating to public health and safety in 26 of the 55 big cases Reuters analyzed, and in most of them, judges refused to unseal the evidence. Some of those cases involved attempts to share information with the FDA.
The FDA declined to comment on specific cases for this article. In general, the agency said, its powers to inspect drug makers' plants and launch criminal investigations, along with voluntary reporting requirements for drug makers, “provide FDA with the tools to keep patients and consumers safe and fulfill its mission to protect and promote the public health.”
However, in the case of  Pfizer  (NYSE:PFE) Inc’s popular drug Chantix, which helps people quit smoking, court secrecy excluded possibly pertinent information from the agency’s process for assessing safety.
The FDA approved Chantix in 2006. Three years later, it placed a black box warning – its strongest – on the drug’s label after receiving “reports of changes in behavior such as hostility, agitation, depressed mood, and suicidal thoughts or actions.”
Over time, Pfizer faced thousands of lawsuits blaming Chantix for such side effects. The company turned over millions of documents to plaintiffs under the condition they be kept confidential.
In 2014, after Pfizer settled most of the cases for about $300 million, two plaintiff experts decided the FDA and the public should see internal Pfizer documents and expert reports that had been introduced in litigation.
Through their lawyer, clinical psychiatrist Joseph Glenmullen and drug safety researcher Thomas Moore asked the judge overseeing the bulk of the Chantix litigation to unseal the information, which they said was important for “shedding light on Pfizer’s awareness of Chantix’s behavioral risks.”
Two days after their request was filed, U.S. District Judge Inge Johnson in Alabama rejected it. Her brief order did not address the substance of the request.
Johnson did not respond to requests for comment.
The upshot was that, two years later, an FDA advisory panel did not have access to all the information the two men had sought to make public as it considered a Pfizer request to remove the black box warning. Pfizer’s request was based on its own study claiming that Chantix did not have a significant association with depression and suicide.
The advisory panel of medical experts in September 2016 recommended in a close vote to remove the black box warning. The FDA removed the black box warning a few months later. Chantix bottles still carry a less severe warning of potential mental health side effects.
Moore acknowledged that it’s impossible to know whether the evidence he and Glenmullen sought to provide to regulators would have changed the panel’s decision. But he said he remains frustrated that information “central” to the question of Chantix’s safety never made it into regulators’ hands.
“The FDA should be able to see it,” Moore said.
Pfizer, in a statement to Reuters, said: “The FDA and its 2016 advisory panel had access to all of the data and science on Chantix, and all of the adverse events reports.” The plaintiff experts’ reports, the company noted, were not original science and instead reflected views of the underlying science that differed from the FDA and the advisory panel’s conclusions.
Members of the FDA advisory panel Reuters contacted said they were unaware of Moore and Glenmullen’s efforts.
One of them was Dr Jess Fiedorowicz, director of the University of Iowa Mood Disorders Center. He voted to remove the black box warning. He said he didn’t know whether the evidence from the two experts would have changed his mind, but, “I’m all for transparency in research.”
SEEKING SUNSHINE
In September, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, a New York Democrat, said he planned to reintroduce the Sunshine in Litigation Act to address the problem of court secrecy. The bill would allow parties in litigation to share evidence related to public health and safety with state and federal regulators, regardless of protective orders.
Nadler’s pledge came during a hearing on courtroom transparency that was called after Reuters began publishing its series on court secrecy and its impact on public health and safety. Previous iterations of the bill introduced repeatedly since the early 1990s, despite enjoying bipartisan support, have ultimately failed in the face of sustained opposition from business groups that contend it would increase the costs and burdens of litigation for companies that are already meeting regulatory reporting requirements.
However, as the Yamaha Rhino episode and others like it show, regulators and the public can’t assume manufacturers are meeting disclosure and reporting rules.
A few months after John Sand sent a packet stuffed with his research to CPSC, the agency told Yamaha it had received information indicating that the Rhino could roll over at low speeds on flat ground, posing “an unreasonable risk of injury or death to riders.” It told the company to send it all relevant information, including documents from Rhino-related litigation.
CPSC spent the next few months trying to get Yamaha to comply, at one point complaining to the company that it was sending “duplicative” material and that “the only new item seems to be a Model Year 2009 owner’s manual for the Rhino.”
Only after CPSC subpoenaed Yamaha did the company send to the agency a 70-page written response, a hard drive and 62 DVDs that contained all of the records the company had produced in years of litigation, including company documents that had been subject to protective orders.
CPSC would have known about the Rhino much earlier if Yamaha hadn’t repeatedly violated the rules for notifying the agency of a possible defect, according to William Kitzes, a former adviser to the agency and an expert witness for plaintiffs in Rhino litigation who reviewed correspondence between the regulator and Yamaha.
Companies must report to the agency immediately upon learning that a product is defective or can cause injury or death, or when a product is subject to three or more personal-injury lawsuits in a two-year period that are settled or decided in favor of plaintiffs. From 2004 to late 2008, Yamaha faced about 250 lawsuits alleging that Rhinos were unsafe.
“Certainly no later than, and by many measures well before the end of 2005 ... Yamaha had adequate information to report,” Kitzes wrote in a report for plaintiffs.
CPSC didn’t fine Yamaha for failure to report Rhino incidents. The agency and Yamaha jointly announced the Rhino recall on March 31, 2009 – referred to at the time, on Yamaha’s insistence, as a “free repair program.”
In 2011, the Ohio jury hearing Sand’s case found the Rhino defective, but awarded Sand no damages. Ellie was not wearing a helmet when she was killed, and the jury determined that she, her parents and others were negligent in her death.
Yamaha stopped making the vehicles in 2013.

STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A surge in drug-linked gang-violence in Sweden led to a 60% increase in bomb blasts in 2019, government statistics showed on Thursday, as police work to rid the streets of explosives and guns with more officers on patrol.
Sweden has been hit by a wave of shootings and bombings over the past couple of years which police have linked to gang conflicts in major cities, shocking Swedes, who have long considered their country as one of the safest in the world.
Some 257 bomb attacks were reported to police last year, up from 162 the previous year, the statistics from the National Council for Crime Prevention showed. 
The agency did not give any information about the types of explosives used most frequently or any other details, but Swedish media have reported some attacks using make-shift bombs made from vacuum flasks packed with explosive material.
The public outcry over increased violence has forced the government to boost spending on the police and to launch a program to fight organized crime as law and order becomes one of the main political battlefields.
""This government has lost control over crime in Sweden. We have seen in recent years how the number of fatalities has increased. Now bomb blasts are also increasing in a way that lacks international equivalence,"" said Ulf Kristersson, leader of opposition party the Moderates. 
The offices of Prime Minister Stefan Lofven and of the justice minister declined to comment on the figures, which were contained within a broader run-down of reported crime, which overall was down marginally in 2019 against the previous year.
Interior Minister Mikael Damberg on Monday told Swedish news agency TT he was convinced a new police task force would make a difference, and that he aimed for sentences for bomb attacks and smuggling to be stiffened by the end of the year. 
Police have identified around 60 deprived areas, mainly in and around larger cities, where unemployment is high, incomes low and where drugs and gangs have gained a firm foothold. 
In November, they set up the task force to fight violent crime following the death of a 15-year-old boy in Malmo when a gunman open fire on a pizza restaurant. 
At the time, the police said the task force would focus on getting criminals off the streets, reducing access to guns and explosives and increasing the police presence in affected areas. 
However, they said the problems were impossible to solve by the police alone.
""There is no silver bullet. There is no simple solution to complex problems,"" Stefan Hector, the head of the task force, said in November.
An explosion on Sunday in one of Stockholm's most high-end neighborhoods destroyed part of a residential building and several cars parked outside. The blast could be heard several kilometers away. No one was injured. 

In a separate incident, in June, 20 people were wounded when a bomb exploded on a residential street in Linkoping in southern Sweden.

Canada's Francois-Philippe Champagne and Britain's Dominic Raab, with the foreign ministers of Ukraine, Sweden and Afghanistan, each lit a candle to commemorate the victims at the Canadian High Commission in London, and paused for a moment of reflection before the meeting began.
The five nations had citizens on the plane, which was downed on Jan. 8 shortly after it left Tehran en route to Kiev, and have formed an international response group to co-ordinate their next steps. Ukraine and Canada have raised the prospect of legal action against Iran. 
Iran admitted on Saturday it had shot down a Ukraine International Airlines plane in error, after initially denying it had a role in the incident. All 176 people aboard, including 57 Canadians, were killed. 
Most of those on Ukraine International Airlines flight 752 were Iranians or dual citizens, many of them students returning to their studies abroad or families on their way home after seeing relatives in Iran.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivian former President Evo Morales retracted his call for the organization of militias in his home country on Thursday after the comments sparked outcry from its interim government.
""A few days ago, my words about the formation of militias were made public. I retract them. My deepest conviction has always been the defense of life and peace,"" Morales said in a statement tweeted from Argentina, where he is living in exile.
Morales told Reuters on Sunday that Bolivians had the right to organize and defend themselves, without firearms, from what he said were attacks by Bolivia's interim government, which he says took power in a coup late last year.
At the time, he confirmed that he was the voice in a recording played on Bolivian radio calling for creation of armed militias ""as in Venezuela,"" but said he meant slingshots rather than guns.
The comments prompted Bolivia's interim government to send a letter to Argentine Foreign Minister Felipe Sola, asking that Argentina disavow the comments made by Morales.
""We have not received an answer yet, but in fact there has been an indirect response, implicit, in the warnings that the government of Mr. Fernandez has given to Mr. Evo Morales, warning that he should lower the tone of his statements and should not make the kind of threats that clearly border on crime,"" Bolivia's acting foreign minister, Karen Longaric, told journalists in La Paz on Thursday.
A spokesman for Argentina's foreign ministry declined to comment on whether the government had spoken to Morales about his comments.
Morales, a former coca farmer who led Bolivia for almost 14 years, fled his home country in November after political unrest sparked by his controversial election win. After initially going to Mexico, he moved to Argentina, where he has continued to play a key and vocal political role with his Movement for Socialism party ahead of new elections called for May 3.
Argentina's center-left Peronist President Alberto Fernandez, who was inaugurated on Dec. 10, has previously supported Morales' rights to speak freely, though granting him asylum has created tensions between his new administration and the United States."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - An imbroglio over former Pope Benedict's involvement in a book has sparked calls by some Vatican officials for clear rules about the status of any future pontiffs who may resign rather than rule for life.
Senior official sources said they hope Pope Francis addresses the issue after the death of Benedict, who in 2013 became the first pope in 700 years to abdicate and who is now a frail 92-year-old. 
The idea of such rules, which is being discussed informally, is important because, as people live longer than they did in the past, it may become the new normal for popes to step down, said the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Francis, 83, has said he too would resign if ill health prevented him from properly running the 1.3 billion-member Catholic Church, as Benedict did.
Church law says a pope can resign, but it lacks specific rules on his status, title, and prerogatives. The issue exploded this week amid controversy around a book the publishers say was co-authored by Benedict and Cardinal Robert Sarah, a leading Vatican conservative, on the issue of priestly celibacy.
On the eve of publication, Benedict said he wanted his name removed as co-author. The publishers refused. Sarah said Benedict had known he would be listed as co-author and dismissed accusations he had manipulated the ex-pontiff.
""The pope emeritus has been dragged yet again into an unseemly power play against Francis,"" wrote Austen Ivereigh, author of two biographies of Francis, adding that ""the emeritus papacy has proved a disorderly institution, one vulnerable to manipulation ..."" 
Supporters of Francis see the timing of the book as interference by Church conservatives such as Sarah, coming as the pope considers allowing older married men to be ordained in the remotest areas of the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), to deal with the shortage of priests there.
Since he stepped down, Benedict has occasionally allowed his views on specific subjects to be aired outside the Vatican, to the joy of fellow conservatives who have used them as ammunition to contest Francis' more open-minded papacy.
Papal resignations are still a new frontier. Days before Benedict abdicated on Feb. 28, 2013, he scripted his own rules, investing himself with the title pope emeritus, deciding to continue to wear white and to live in the Vatican.
'SYMBOLS ARE IMPORTANT'
Some critics believe he should have stepped further away from the papacy and kept strictly to his promise to ""remain hidden from the world"" after abdicating.
""In the Catholic Church, symbols are important,"" said Father Tom Reese, a Washington-based Catholic author and commentator for Religion News Service.
""Symbols communicate, they teach. If you are not the pope, you should not be wearing white. Having two men wearing white sitting next to each other makes them look like they are equals, when they are not,"" he wrote.
Reese said an ex-pontiff should not be called pope, should return to wearing either the red or black garb of a cardinal or priest, and should return to using his own name.
Since a pope is also the bishop of Rome, Reese and others have suggested that a former pontiff should be called ""bishop emeritus of Rome"".
He would then be subject to the same written rules, last updated in 2004, that cover retired bishops.
Those rules say any bishop emeritus ""will want to avoid every attitude and relationship that could even hint at some kind of parallel authority to that of the diocesan bishop, with damaging consequences for the pastoral life and unity of the diocesan community"".

MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - Army helicopters flew rescue missions for the third day running in an avalanche-hit area of Pakistani-Kashmir as the death toll from the disaster rose to 77 on Thursday, officials said.
The latest victim of the avalanches in Neelum Valley, in the Himalayan region disputed by Pakistan and India, was a six-year-old girl, Safia, who died in hospital on Thursday. 
Safia had been pulled out alive on Tuesday after being buried for close to 20 hours, a doctor, quoting the child's family, said. ""She had suffered fractures in her skull and orbital bones and left leg and despite our best efforts died of her brain injuries,"" the doctor, Adnan Mehraj, told Reuters.
Safia's family were elated when she was found alive, her uncle, Naseer Ahmed told Reuters, but now relatives were in shock. Safia was the 19th member of the family to perish in the Neelum Valley avalanches. 
""I am not in my senses … We have lost almost everyone in the family from young kids to elderly members,"" said a visibly disturbed Ahmed.
""This extreme weather has played havoc with the lives of people living in high altitude mountains,"" Pakistani-Kashmir’s top administrative official, Mathar Niaz Rana, said. 
""We are trying our best to alleviate their sufferings,"" he told Reuters as two helicopters were being loaded with relief supplies, including food and medicine, in Muzaffarabad, the capital of Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
Meanwhile, in a separate area in Pakistan, further north, five personnel of the Pakistan army were killed when an avalanche hit them as they were carrying out rescue efforts, according to a senior official. 
The five were from the engineer corps and helping clear roads covered by landslides in an area of Gilgit-Baltistan, a mountainous region that borders China. Avalanches in the area had earlier killed a woman and child, an official of the local disaster management authority, Farid Ahmed, said.

In total, 109 people have died across Pakistan in snow and landslide-related incidents over the last five days, including 20 deaths in the south-western province of Baluchistan.

801,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 10:03AM ET</span>","Harvey Weinstein jury selection: bias, big data and 'likes'","By Tom Hals
(Reuters) - When lawyers in the Harvey Weinstein rape trial question potential jurors on Thursday, they may already know who has used the #MeToo hashtag on Twitter or criticized victims of sexual harassment in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) discussion. 
The intersection of big data capabilities and prevalence of social media has transformed the business of jury research in the United States, which once meant gleaning information about potential jurors from car bumper stickers or the appearance of a home. 
Now, consultants scour Facebook, Twitter, Reddit and other social media platforms for hard-to-find comments or ""likes"" in discussion groups or even selfies of a juror wearing a potentially biased t-shirt.
""This is a whole new generation of information than we had in the past,"" said Jeffrey Frederick, the director of Jury Research Services at the National Legal Research Group Inc.
The techniques seem tailor-made for the Weinstein trial, which has become a focal point for #MeToo, the social media movement that has exposed sexual misconduct by powerful men in business, politics and entertainment. 
Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assaulting two women. The once-powerful movie producer faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault.
On Thursday, the legal teams will begin questioning potential jurors, a process known as voir dire. More than 100 people passed an initial screening and the identities of many of those people have been known publicly for days, allowing for extensive background research. 
Mark Geragos, a defense lawyer, said it is almost malpractice to ignore jurors' online activity, particularly in high-profile cases.
When Geragos was representing Scott Peterson, who was later found guilty of the 2002 murder of his pregnant wife Laci, it came to light that a woman told an internet chatroom she had duped both legal teams to get on the California jury. 
""You just never know if someone is telling the truth,"" said Geragos.
Weinstein's lawyer, Donna Rotunno, told Reuters recently that her team was considering hiring a firm to investigate jurors' social media use to weed out bias.
The Manhattan District Attorney's office does not use jury consultants and office spokesman Danny Frost declined to comment if prosecutors were reviewing potential jurors' social media.
Frederick's firm, which has not been involved in the Weinstein case, creates huge databases of online activity relevant to a case, drilling down into interactions that do not appear in a user's social media timeline. His firm combs through Facebook news articles about a particular case or topic, cataloging every comment, reply, share as well as emojis or ""likes,"" in the hopes some were posted by a potential juror.
""The social media aspect can be enormously helpful in looking at people's political motives,"" said defense attorney Michael Bachner. He said Weinstein's team will probably want to know about a potential juror's ties to women's causes, with ""#MeToo being the obvious one.""
Consultants only use public information and focus on those with extremist views, said Roy Futterman of consulting firm DOAR.
""You're looking for the worst juror,"" he said.
Julieanne Himelstein, a former federal prosecutor, said the best vetting tool remains a lawyer's questioning of a potential juror in the courtroom.
""That trumps all the sophisticated intelligence gathering anyone can do,"" said Himelstein. 
But trial veterans said that potential jurors are reluctant to admit unpopular viewpoints during voir dire, such as skepticism about workplace sexual harassment.
During questioning in a trial involving a drug company, consultant Christina Marinakis recalled a potential juror who said he did not have negative feelings toward pharmaceutical companies.
""We found he had a blog where he was just going off on capitalism and Corporate America and pharmaceutical companies especially,"" said Marinakis, the director of jury research for Litigation Insights. The juror was dismissed.
Marinakis said the blog was written under a username, and only came to light by digging through the juror's social media for references to pseudonyms.
Lawyers can reject an unlimited number of potential jurors if they show bias. Each side can typically use ""peremptory"" challenges to eliminate up to three potential jurors they believe will be unsympathetic, without providing a reason. 
In a Canadian civil trial, jury consulting firm Vijilent discovered that a potential juror who appeared to be a stay-at-home mom with no history of social activism, in fact had been arrested three times for civil disobedience while promoting the causes of indigenous people. 
""Unless you got into her social media, you wouldn't have known that information,"" said Vijilent founder Rosanna Garcia.

Sakellaropoulou, 64, is now president of the Council of State, Greece's top administrative court. She will succeed President Prokopis Pavlopoulos, whose term expires in March.
The process to select a president, a largely ceremonial role, can go up to five voting rounds in parliament, with the election threshold starting at 200 votes and gradually falling to the majority of those present in the room.
Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis' New Democracy party controls 158 seats in the 300-seat house.
To win straight away, his presidential candidate would need support from opposition parties including leftist Syriza, which lost power in an election last July. Syriza has 86 deputies in parliament.
""We will allow the new president to be elected with a wide majority, as this is appropriate for anyone who takes on the heavy responsibility, under the constitution, of expressing the unity of the people and our democracy,"" Syriza Leader Alexis Tsipras said in a televised statement.
The Socialist PASOK party, with 22 deputies, convened to discuss the issue on Thursday but it was also expected to support Sakellaropoulou."

Germany faces dearth of organ donors,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Siegfried Richtsteig has been waiting in hospital for more than 130 days for a heart that would allow him to do the things he enjoyed most, like playing with his grandchildren, before a stroke damaged the organ beyond repair.
But time is ticking. He is 64 and under German rules when he turns 65 he will not be eligible for a transplant as scarce organs are saved for younger patients in a country where some 10,000 are on the national waiting list.
""I am already 64 and time is running out,"" said Richtsteig, sitting in his hospital bed, connected to a small machine that keeps his heart beating. ""It could then end up that I have waited for nothing."" 
He has reason to be pessimistic.
The German parliament on Thursday voted against a proposal by Health Minister Jens Spahn that would have made it easier for authorities to collect organs of people who die in Germany, where only 36% have an organ donor pass.
In 2018 only 955 people donated organs in a country of more than 80 million people, according to the Health Ministry.
The draft law proposed by Spahn would have allowed authorities to collect organs of people who die if two conditions were met: they did not state during their adult life that they did not wish to be donors and their families did not object to their organs being collected after their death.
Systems which effectively make being an organ donor the default have seen donation rates increase in some countries adopting them - although that increase is not universal.
The bill was defeated in a vote of 379 against and 292 for.
The Bundestag approved instead a proposal backed by Green and conservative lawmakers that seeks to encourage more Germans to become donors by creating a simplified national register for donations. 
""The is no right or wrong and it was not about winning or losing,"" Spahn said on Twitter after the vote. ""It is about helping people. The public debate that has been generated was something in itself.""
Manfred Hummel, director of the Paulinen hospital in Berlin, said Germany was importing organs from European neighbors who have a surplus because of simpler collection rules and less bureaucracy such as Austria, Belgium and the Netherlands.
""Citizens are not eager in my view to be proactive and say 'I'll become a donor',"" said Hummel, standing by Richtsteig's bed.
He added that the government's priority after the defeat in parliament should be to campaign to encourage organ donation.

""There is so much paperwork involved in order to make any donation possible,"" said Richsteig. ""Faced with a pile of papers, people say: 'I can't be bothered'.""

GAZA (Reuters) - The interim head of the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian refugees accused the United States on Thursday of lobbying foreign parliaments to stop donations to the organization, to which Washington cut off funding in 2018.
Christian Saunders, in an interview with Reuters in his Gaza office, also said Israel was seeking to replace United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) services for Palestinians, mandated by the U.N. General Assembly, in occupied East Jerusalem with those of its own.
UNRWA has faced budgetary difficulties since 2018, when the United States, its biggest donor, halted its annual aid of $360 million. The United States and Israel have both accused UNRWA of mismanagement and anti-Israeli incitement.
Last November, UNRWA commissioner-general Pierre Krahenbuhl resigned amid an investigation into misconduct allegations.
In the interview, Saunders, now acting commissioner-general, said the inquiry by the U.N. Office of Internal Oversight Services was complete and Secretary-General Antonio Guterres had confirmed there had been no corruption or misuse of funds.
Saunders said the investigation had uncovered mismanagement related to human resources and abuse of authority, and that major donors, who had withheld funding while the inquiry was under way, have resumed contributions.
But he said the United States was ""advocating against funding UNRWA in the European parliaments and elsewhere"".
""We are engaged with the U.S., we will continue to engage with them in the hopes that they will see UNRWA as a reliable partner and worth supporting,"" Saunders said.
UNRWA, Saunders said, was also feeling ""the pressure in East Jerusalem in particular"", where Israel was in the process of building schools and institutions ""to compete"" with the agency and stop it from operating there.
""The important thing to remember here is that UNRWA has a mandate from the (U.N.) General Assembly, from the rest of the world, the member states, to provide services to Palestinian refugees in East Jerusalem,"" Saunders said.
Israel considers all of Jerusalem, including the eastern part captured along the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war, as its ""indivisible capital"". Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of a state they seek to establish in the West Bank and Gaza.
Last month, the U.N. General Assembly renewed UNRWA's mandate for another three years. The agency aids more than 5 million registered refugees in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem, as well as in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.

Saunders said he felt confident UNRWA had enough money for at least the first quarter of 2020, but it still faced a tough road ahead.

A housing shortage that has sparked sharp hikes in rental costs and homelessness has been the defining domestic issue of Varadkar's near three-year premiership and is the focus of opposition criticism ahead of the Feb. 8 poll.
Dublin City Council said the man was injured on Tuesday when tents placed in precarious and dangerous locations were being removed. His case put paid to Varadkar's hopes of framing early campaigning on his diplomatic successes on Brexit and Ireland's fast growing economy.
National broadcaster RTE said the man was in a serious condition in hospital after his tent was removed by an industrial vehicle. The council said the matter was being investigated by police and had no further comment.
The story dominated newspaper front pages on Thursday. Opponents accused Varakdar of politicizing the issue by calling on Dublin's lord mayor to make a statement on the issue. The lord mayor, Paul McAuliffe, is running for parliament for the rival Fianna Fail party.
The lord mayor is primarily a ceremonial role filled by an elected local councilor. Varakdar said he was not seeking to make it a party political issue.
Varadkar's Fine Gael and the fellow center-right Fianna Fail are closely matched in opinion polls, and some distance ahead of their other rivals. This means it is increasingly likely that one of the two parties, which have broadly similar policies on the economy and Brexit, will head another minority administration.
Ireland was left with surplus housing stock after a property crash in 2008, but it has come nowhere near providing the homes needed to keep up with a rapid economic recovery, with rents in Dublin almost 40% above their pre-crisis peak."

PARIS (Reuters) - French trade unions blocked ports and disrupted power production on Thursday, searching for a way to force President Emmanuel Macron to ditch a planned pension overhaul as the impact of transport strikes weakens. 
Ferry services to Britain suffered delays and at least 20 bulk carriers waiting to export cereals were kept at anchor outside France's major ports, data from financial data provider Refinitiv showed. Electricity output was down about 9% of available capacity.
The public sector strikes are now in their 43rd day but the industrial action has lost momentum since Macron's government made a concession over the age of retirement and as strikers face mounting financial pressure to return to work. 
Only 10 percent of workers at the state-run SNCF railways walked out on Thursday, compared with more than half when the strikes began on Dec. 5.
Data collated by Reuters from public transport agencies show the number of SNCF and Paris metro trains operating has risen and strike observance has fallen. 
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has offered to withdraw plans to raise the retirement age for full pension benefits by two years to 64 if the pension budget can be balanced another way, driving a wedge between unions determined to see the reform scrapped and those more open to reform. 
""It's never too late to force a government to cave in,"" said Philippe Martinez, head of the far-left CGT union, before a street march in Paris in a sixth round of nationwide protests. 
Macron, a former investment banker, wants to streamline France's convoluted pension system and give French people an incentive to stay in work longer to pay for some of the most generous retirement benefits in the industrialised world.
It would be the biggest overhaul of the system since World War Two and is central to the president's drive to make the French labour force more flexible and more competitive globally.
Trade unions accuse Macron of eroding hard-earned benefits.
The CGT this week set its sights on French ports as participation rates in strikes on Paris public transport services declined. 
On Thursday, vessels set to export a total 536,000 tonnes of cereals, mostly wheat, were held up outside French ports, data showed. 
The three-day walkout by dockers which began on Tuesday has already led to production outages at some livestock feed factories. Imported soybean meal is used to provide protein in livestock feed rations, alongside cereals that offer energy.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's military said on Thursday it will hold a meeting to discuss whether it will discharge the first soldier to have undergone gender reassignment surgery, which has sparked national debate about the treatment of LGBT troops. 
The soldier, who holds the rank of staff sergeant and is stationed in Gyeonggi Province, north of Seoul, received the operation overseas last year while on leave, and expressed hope to continue serving in the female corps, an army official said. 
The military has not identified the soldier. The official said the soldier was at a military hospital receiving post-surgery treatment.
The military will hold discussions as early as next week to decide on the soldier's fate as there are no regulations in Korea concerning transgender troops, the official said. 
""We'll have to see it as a partial change in the body which we apply for those who were injured in accidents,"" the official told Reuters. ""We will likely discharge the soldier as there are different qualifications for men and women to meet in joining the military."" 
The case has triggered debate over the treatment of transgender troops and soldiers from the wider LBGT community in the country, which requires all able-bodied men to serve for around two years.
Gays are not banned from the South Korean military but sex acts between two male soldiers are punishable by up to two years in prison.
Online portal sites showed mixed reaction to the transgender soldier's case, with some supporting the ""courageous decision"" while others saying the soldier should be discharged and reapply to join the female corps if necessary. 
Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have criticized South Korea's military for discriminating against LBGT troops. The Seoul-based Military Human Rights Centre accused the military of treating LBGT troops ""as if they are criminals"" or people with disabilities. 
""The staff sergeant is a young soldier who has the loyalty and service spirits for the country and the people that are second to none, and loves the military more than anyone,"" the group's head Lim Tae-hoon told a news conference in Seoul. 
""We strongly urge the military should turn over a new leaf by deciding to let the officer continue service.""

The resolution passed on Thursday states that EU lawmakers are concerned about the government's ""intimidation, harassment, and arbitrary arrest of journalists, human rights activists and members of the opposition"".
It says the media in the east African nation work in a ""climate of fear"", creating conditions that are not conducive for credible elections.
Burundi government officials were not immediately reachable for comment on the resolution. The government has previously consistently denied violating human rights or restricting freedom of expression.
President Pierre Nkurunziza, who won a referendum last year that could allow him to stay in power until 2034, has said repeatedly that he will not seek a fourth term in office, but his ruling party has not named a candidate for the vote.
Hundreds of Burundians have been killed in clashes with security forces since 2015, when Nkurunziza won his third term in office. The opposition said his candidacy violated the terms of a peace deal that ended the east African nation's civil war - but Nkurunziza disputed this.
The EU parliamentary resolution is non-binding, but it adds to a steady stream of international criticism.
U.N. investigators warned in a September report that Burundi was at risk of a new wave of atrocities as the election neared and that there was a climate of intimidation against anyone who did not show support for the ruling party.
Burundi's Human Rights Minister Martin Nivyabandi told Reuters at the time that the government denied the allegations. ""The content of the report doesn't match the reality known within the country,"" he said.
The EU resolution condemned the government's decision to charge four Burundian journalists with undermining state security after their arrest in October while covering clashes between rebels and government forces in the north-west of the country.
In December, the public prosecutor asked for a 15-year sentence for the journalists. 
""The journalists' detention and trial comes amidst a suffocating atmosphere for Burundian journalists,"" said Lewis Mudge, Central Africa director at Human Rights Watch. ""These are not conditions for free and fair elections."""

But the legislation brings hope to women who campaigned to force the West African nation to accept that rape must stop.
The young woman fled a violent husband and went to live with her sister. But a family friend gained her trust and raped her.
""It's really hard to suffer a sexual assault but it is even harder to suffer a sexual assault that ends up in a pregnancy, I was really traumatized, I did not want to live anymore,"" she told Reuters Television.
After trying to abort her baby and kill herself, the woman ended up in hospital. She was transferred to the Maison Rose, where she gave birth last year.
The Maison Rose, or the Pink House, in a suburb of Dakar, offers women support that had been lacking in a country where rape was a misdemeanor and not a crime.
""For some years now I feel women have wanted to stand up to say stop,"" said Maison Rose founder Mona Chasserio.
""Women said it needed to stop. They all said 'Stop!',"" said member of parliament Awa Gueye.
Widely publicized cases of rape in Senegal paved the way for the change in the law. Women who had kept silent began to campaign to give a voice to rape victims, drawing confidence from the #MeToo movement in the United States.
After a unanimous vote in parliament to criminalize rape, President Macky Sall signed the decree into law on Jan. 10. Previously, rape drew a maximum prison sentence of 10 years and campaigners say convictions were rare. The new law sets a minimum of 10 years and a maximum of life.
At the Maison Rose, the young victim is glad the law has changed and says the challenge now is to apply it."

James Ibori, who was governor of Delta State from 1999 to 2007, pleaded guilty at London's Southwark Crown Court in 2012 to 10 counts of fraud and money-laundering. He received a 13-year jail sentence.
The case was a rare example of a prominent Nigerian politician being punished for his part in the endemic corruption that has blighted Africa's most populous country for decades. Since then, several other Nigerian former state governors have been convicted in their own country.
Having served half of his sentence in pre- and post-trial detention, Ibori was released from jail in December 2016 and is now back in Nigeria.
In 2013, a first attempt was made in Britain to confiscate his assets, but it was aborted after three weeks of hearings because of unresolved legal disputes.
Then the confiscation process was stalled for several years while Ibori and several of his associates, who had been convicted for their roles in laundering his money, appealed unsuccessfully against their convictions.
Restarting the process at Southwark on Thursday, prosecution counsel Jonathan Kinnear began listing assets that Britain seeks to confiscate from Ibori and return to Nigerian public funds.
The total value of the known proceeds of his crimes came to 117 million pounds ($153 million), he said. However, only a portion of that sum is likely to be recoverable.
During his time in office, Ibori, 57, amassed a portfolio of luxury properties in Nigeria, London, Washington, Houston and Johannesburg. He traveled all over the world, staying in the most expensive hotels and spending lavishly in luxury stores.
His lifestyle during those years was a far cry from his modest beginnings in life. As a young man, he had worked as a shop assistant at a branch of the home improvements chain Wickes in London, where he was caught trying to steal from the store and was convicted of theft.
Britain's National Crime Agency estimates that around 1 billion pounds in dirty money moves into or through the United Kingdom every year. Ibori is one of the only ultimate beneficiaries of such practices to have been convicted.
The case is expected to last around four weeks."

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has filed a lawsuit for defamation against Kosovo's outgoing prime minister, who has repeatedly said Rama was involved in talks about dividing up Kosovo along ethnic lines, a court in Pristina said on Thursday.
Kosovo, where the population is more than 90% Albanian, is a former province of Serbia that declared its independence in 2008 but has still not been recognized by Belgrade.
Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said in public appearances throughout last year that his country's president Hashim Thaci, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic and Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama had all been promoting the idea of a land swap between Belgrade and Pristina.
Rama, who has distanced himself from the idea of a land swap or a partitioning of Kosovo, had said he would sue Haradinaj over his comments.
That lawsuit was filed on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Pristina Basic Court said without elaborating.
The Pristina-based Betimi per Drejtesi (Oath for Justice) think tank that monitors the courts said Rama claims in his suit that he has been portrayed by Haradinaj as ""a traitor.""
In 2018, presidents Thaci and Vucic had appeared to suggest in separate comments that they might be amenable to a land swap to resolve their territorial claims, although they never discussed the idea directly.
They each faced strong opposition to the idea both at home and abroad, and Haradinaj said any such deal would not be acceptable to Kosovo.
Haradinaj, who said last July that would resign after he was interviewed as a suspect by war crimes prosecutors who are part of Kosovo's justice system but located in the Netherlands, said he was ready to face Rama's accusations in court.
""The lawsuit of Prime Minister Rama is completely unfounded and a political diversion made by him to hide after media dramas and to avoid responsibility,"" Haradinaj said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Rama and Haradinaj have in the past referred to each other as brothers but in the last year they have cut all communications and swapped various accusations in public.
Serbia lost control of Kosovo after NATO bombed Serb forces in 1999 to stop them killing and expelling Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians during a counter-insurgency.
Kosovo has now been recognized by more than 110 countries including the United States, but not by Serbia, Russia or China.
The United States and the EU have encouraged Serbia and Kosovo to normalize relations. If they do, Kosovo would be able to apply for membership of the United Nations, a move that Serbia's old ally Russia is currently blocking."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - A report on alleged Chinese corruption in the Maldives will be completed by June, the Maldives' Foreign Minister Abdulla Shahid said on Thursday, as the current government investigates a surge of investments by China in recent years.
The tropical archipelago grew closer to Beijing under the rule of former president, Abdulla Yameen, with China funding an airport, bridge and social housing as part of its Belt and Road Initiative.
Critics of Yameen, who was voted out in 2018 after five years in office, say government contracts were awarded at inflated prices, and that the spending threatened to sink the islands' tiny economy.
Incumbent President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih announced a commission in November 2018 to look into deals made during Yameen's rule. It will reveal its findings in the first half of this year, Shahid told Reuters during an interview in New Delhi.
""In Beijing, I found a willingness to engage with the current government,"" Shahid said regarding the deals made by Yameen. ""The irresponsible borrowing of the previous government is being looked at.""
""But China will remain a friend.""
The Maldives is now attempting to balance its relations with traditional ally India as well as China, which holds huge influence in the island nation.
Mohamed Nasheed, president of Solih's ruling Maldivian Democratic Party and a former leader of the country, told Reuters in November 2018 that the Maldives would pull out of what he termed a one-sided free trade agreement between Male and Beijing.
But Shahid said on Thursday the government may now not be able to back out of the deal.
""We have very clearly said as members of parliament, that the process was flawed,"" Shahid said. ""It is a thousand-page document and the process (of the free-trade deal passing through parliament) took something like five minutes.""
""But now we are in government, and we also have to honor the sovereign decision of a government that has taken place, but it would be unfair for us to decide without examining the contents of the agreement.""
China has consistently said its projects in the Maldives are aimed at developing its economy, and that contracts were awarded fairly.
Yameen, who was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for money laundering in November, denies corruption in his deals with China."
817,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 07:32AM ET</span>","Seeking peace in Libya and Iran, past inaction haunts EU diplomacy","By Ulf Laessing and Robin Emmott
CAIRO/BRUSSELS - (Reuters) - After war broke out again in Libya early last year, a special team of EU diplomats in Tripoli was forced back to neighboring Tunisia to do what they had been doing for several years: wait.
As Germany holds a U.N summit on Sunday for a path to end the conflict in Libya, in turmoil since the 2011 fall of Muammar Gaddafi, European powers believe they can now begin to overcome such inaction and defend interests on their southern doorstep.
But like the bored EU experts tasked with supporting Libyan ministry officers at their temporary mission offices in Tunis over the past five years, EU diplomacy has often arrived too late to make an impact and, in Iran, been left exposed by U.S. President Donald Trump's ""America First"" policy.
""We Europeans, since we don't want to participate in a military solution, we barricade ourselves in the belief there is no military solution,"" the EU's new foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told the European Parliament this week.
""Nobody will be very happy if, on the Libyan coast, there is a ring of military bases from the Russian and Turkish navies in front of the Italian coast,"" he said.
The economically powerful EU, once able to boast of a soft power that helped transform communist neighbors into thriving market economies, first sent a mission to Libya to train border guards in 2013 but was reduced to running all its training outside of Libya from 2015, returning briefly in 2017 and 2019.
With Libya's migration routes close to European shores and its energy supplies in the Mediterranean sought by Turkey, policy toward a country that was an EU priority has instead become a symbol of its divisions.
Former colonial power Italy has supported the Tripoli-based, U.N-backed government of Fayez al-Serraj, while France favored Khalifa Haftar, commander of the eastern Libyan National Army.
Paris and Rome held rival peace conferences, while Russia and Turkey, two countries sometimes at odds with the EU's values of democracy and human rights, sidelined the bloc. First talks on a ceasefire last week took place in Moscow, not Brussels.
Washington, Europe's closest ally, has been largely absent, a far cry from 2011 when the United States and Europe cooperated under NATO in a bombing campaign that backed the rebels who overthrew Gaddafi.
""In the Middle East and North Africa, the EU never had a clear idea of what its objectives are, so it could not be proactive, only reactive. We have let many opportunities pass,"" said Sven Biscop, an analyst at Belgium's Egmont Institute.
""EUROPEAN APPROACH""
The EU, facing a crisis in Iran over the unraveling of the 2015 nuclear deal, now senses an opportunity in Libya after Moscow failed to reach a ceasefire deal with Haftar.
Shock over the fallout from U.S. drone strike on an Iranian general on Jan. 3 has galvanized Europeans over Libya, some EU envoys say, settling on a new ""European approach"".
Britain, France and Germany already this week showed a new determination to pressure Tehran to comply with the Iran accord, triggering a dispute mechanism that could lead to the reimposition of U.N. sanctions.
However, with Sunday's conference on Libya approaching, Italy and France have yet to put aside their differences and rally behind the government in Tripoli.
Germany, which sees itself as more neutral than France and Italy, has sought to take the lead, with German Chancellor Angela Merkel investing time in seeking the support from her Russian, Turkish and Egyptian counterparts.
The EU's new leadership in Brussels also wants to be more ""geopolitical"" and stem the waning of Europe's influence. It launched into a frenzy of diplomacy in early January amid fears of a Middle East conflagration after the U.S. drone strike in Iran.
Top EU officials held talks with Serraj in Brussels, called an emergency meeting of EU foreign ministers, held calls with Iran's president and joined French President Emmanuel Macron at a conference on the Sahel.
""We are not trying to have an aggressive external policy ... but the heads of state need a new mindset to be more assertive,"" said a senior EU official involved in foreign policy.
Friendly foreign governments do want to see the European Union succeed in the world, officials and diplomats said. Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido has regularly called for EU help to increase pressure on President Nicolas Maduro.
Since Trump withdrew from the Iran nuclear accord and reimposed U.S. sanctions, Tehran has repeatedly called on the EU to save a nuclear deal by keeping trade channels open.
But with Britain, one of Europe's two main military powers with France, leaving the European Union, the EU could find it hard to live up to its ambitions.
Neither the EU nor NATO have plans to deploy troops in Libya. The EU naval operation, Sofia, which rescued migrants off the Libyan coast and helped enforce an arms embargo, has been taken off the water, and European allies have rejected U.S. calls at NATO to help patrol Gulf shipping lanes.
Sometimes just agreeing statements has proved too divisive.
""The positive sign is that everyone now agrees this is unsustainable,"" said Bruno Macaes, a former Europe minister for Portugal and now a foreign policy consultant."
818,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 07:19AM ET</span>",Erdogan says Turkey starting troop deployment to Libya,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is beginning to send troops into Libya in support of the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday, days before a summit in Berlin which will address the Libyan conflict.
Last week, Turkey and Russia urged Libya's warring parties to declare a ceasefire. However, despite talks in Moscow aimed at halting Khalifa Haftar's months-long campaign to seize the Libyan capital, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement when Haftar failed to sign a binding truce on Monday.
Turkey, which backs Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA), has previously said that it sent a training and cooperation team which is now active in Libya.
On Thursday, Erdogan said Turkey was starting the deployment of its troops to Libya and that it would use all its diplomatic and military means to ensure stability to its south.
""In order for the legitimate government in Libya to remain standing and for stability to be established, we are now sending our soldiers to this country,"" Erdogan told an event in Ankara.
Erdogan warned on Tuesday that Turkey will not refrain from ""teaching a lesson"" to Haftar's eastern Libyan forces if their attacks against the GNA continue. The talks in Moscow were the latest attempt to stabilize Libya, which has been beset by turmoil since Muammer Gaddafi was toppled in 2011.
On Sunday, Germany will host a summit on Libya involving the rival camps, their main foreign backers and representatives from the United Nations, the United States, Russia, Britain, France, China, Turkey and Italy. Haftar and Serraj have also been invited, but it is unclear if they will attend.
Turkey and Libya signed two agreements in November, one on military cooperation and another on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean. Erdogan said on Thursday that Turkey will quickly start granting licenses for exploration and drilling in the region.
""In the areas that remain between Turkey and Libya, it is now legally impossible for there to be exploration and drilling activities or a pipeline without the approval of both sides,"" he said. 
""After these licensing efforts, our Oruc Reis seismic exploration ship will begin its seismic research operations in the region,"" he added.

Greece, Cyprus and other regional actors have opposed this accord, calling it illegal. Turkey has rejected the accusations.

819,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>",Iran accuses Europe of yielding to 'high school bully' Trump in nuclear row,"By Parisa Hafezi and John Irish
DUBAI/PARIS (Reuters) - Iran said on Thursday three European states had succumbed to ""high school bully"" Donald Trump when they triggered a dispute mechanism in a nuclear pact the U.S. president opposes, a step that could eventually lead to reimposing U.N. sanctions.
The pact, known as the JCPoA, was agreed in 2015 between Tehran and world powers, offering Iran sanctions relief if it curbed its nuclear work. Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and reimposed U.S. sanctions, saying he wanted a tougher deal.
Iran has responded by scaling back its compliance with terms of the pact, saying this month it rejected all limits on uranium enrichment, although it says it wants to keep the deal in place.
Britain, France and Germany triggered the accord's dispute mechanism this week. London said it was now time for a ""Trump deal"" to replace it, while Paris said broad talks were needed.
The Washington Post reported on Wednesday that Washington had threatened to impose a 25% tariff on European automobile imports if the three European capitals did not formally accuse Iran of breaking the nuclear agreement.
""Appeasement confirmed. E3 sold out remnants of #JCPOA to avoid new Trump tariffs. It won't work my friends. You only whet his appetite. Remember your high school bully?"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter.
Two European diplomats confirmed Washington had threatened tariffs but said leaders of the three European states had already decided to trigger the mechanism before that.
Another diplomat said Washington risked ""discrediting the Europeans, but then Trump doesn’t really care about that,"" adding a U.S. threat to impose tariffs on the Europeans would send a message to Iran that only Washington mattered.
The European Union said on Thursday its top diplomat, Josep Borrell, held ""frank"" talks with Zarif on the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi.
'SNAPPING BACK'
The Europeans have long opposed Trump's decision to withdraw from the nuclear deal. The dispute mechanism begins a diplomatic process that can end with U.N. sanctions on Iran ""snapping back"" into place, although the Europeans say that is not their aim.
In announcing the launch of the dispute mechanism, the European powers said they were not backing a U.S. policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Iran, and they hoped to save the accord.
The nuclear dispute lies at the heart of Iran's long-running standoff with the West that spiraled into open conflict this month when Washington killed an Iranian general in Baghdad and Tehran responded with missile strikes on U.S. targets in Iraq.
While on alert for U.S. reprisals, Iran shot down a civilian airliner by mistake, triggering days of anti-government protests at home. Anger at the state has continued at victims' funerals.
""Death to the dictator,"" mourners shouted as they buried two victims of the plane disaster in the city of Sanandaj on Thursday, videos posted online showed, referring to Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Facing unrest at home and pressure from abroad, Khamenei will deliver a sermon at prayers on Friday, the first time he has addressed the prominent weekly gathering in eight years.
U.S. sanctions have added to the Iran's challenges, driving up prices as the currency crumbles in value.
""Pressure has increased on Iran but we continue to progress,"" President Hassan Rouhani said on Thursday, adding Iran was now enriching more uranium than before the 2015 deal. 
Enriched uranium can be used to create material for nuclear warheads. Iran denies Western accusations it wants such weapons and says it wants nuclear material for peaceful purposes.
The U.S. administration has said a new deal should not only cover Iran's nuclear program but also its development of ballistic missiles and activities in the region, where it wields influence via allied militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen.

Iran has repeatedly said it will not talk with sanctions in place. It has also said it cannot negotiate with Trump who broke U.S. promises by abandoning the previous deal.

The measure removes exit visas for hundreds of thousands of domestic workers left out of earlier reforms - mainly from Asian nations like Nepal, India and the Philippines - whom rights groups said were left open to abuse by being excluded.
Unions and activists have documented labor exploitation, dangerous conditions and deaths of workers building stadiums and infrastructure for both the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the upcoming event in Qatar.
The Gulf state, which hopes the 2022 World Cup will boost its economy and development, is eager to show it is creating a modern system that protects all expatriate workers.
""The removal of exit permits is an important milestone in the government's labor reform agenda,"" said Houtan Homayounpour, head of the International Organization for Labour (ILO) office in Qatar, which welcomed the move.
Qatar in 2018 eliminated exit visas for many foreign migrant workers. But the reform did not apply to domestic workers, government and public institution staff, the oil and gas sector, and workers employed at sea and in agriculture.
Under the new system, exit permit requirements will remain in place for members of the armed forces and for a limited number of workers in key company posts.
""Employers have the right to identify a maximum of 5% of their workforce whose exit from Qatar will continue to require prior approval,"" a government statement said.
A ""kafala"" sponsorship system for workers is common in Gulf states with large foreign communities. In gas-rich Qatar, it requires workers to obtain employers' consent before changing jobs, which activists say fosters exploitation.
Qatar has only 300,000 citizens of its own.
In 2017 the ILO, a United Nations' body, dropped a case against Doha over its treatment of foreign workers after it committed to far-reaching reforms.
Qatar has imposed a minimum wage and established dispute resolution committees to fast-track complaints of unpaid salaries. It also says work is underway to enable workers to change employers more easily."
821,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 06:53AM ET</span>",Germany's other migration wave: the pensioner exodus,"By Stoyan Nenov and Thomas Escritt
SIRAKOVO, Bulgaria (Reuters) - As retirement neared a decade ago, German butcher Waldemar Hackstaetter took stock of his finances and concluded he and wife Hildegard couldn't afford to remain in their home country.
So they moved to rural Bulgaria, where they knew their combined income of 1,200 euros ($1,340) would buy a lot more.
""The month stretched further than our pension did (in Germany) and we didn't want to become a burden to our children,"" 78-year-old Waldemar said.
If the Hackstaetters were pioneer emigrants, they are now part of what is slowly becoming a diaspora.
Since they left, Germany's economy has prospered, drawing a steady flow of immigrants that peaked with over a million who crossed its borders at the invitation of Chancellor Angela Merkel during the refugee crisis of 2015.
Over the same ten years, numbers of German retirees persuaded by poverty to move the other way have risen as much as eightfold. 
While modest in absolute terms, the trend is clear. In 2002, 107 Germans were getting their state pensions wired to Bulgaria. By 2018 it was 652. The equivalent increase in Thailand was from 671 to 5,415.
Many, like the Hackstaetters, will have emigrated for economic reasons, and growing numbers of pensioners in Germany are now living below the poverty line.
That loss of purchasing power has been a factor in the flood of elderly citizens - a traditionally loyal conservative voter base - who have ditched Merkel's mainstream alliance for more radical parties, weakening her position as head of government.
Others in that category interviewed by Reuters https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-politics-bavaria/between-berlin-and-bavaria-merkels-uneasy-allies-idUSKBN1CB1S5 cited the perception that asylum seekers were getting more financial support than pensioners. 
In the 2017 national election, one in ten voters in the 60-69 age group deserted the chancellor's CDU/CSU conservative alliance and one in 12 switched to the far-right AfD.
A row over state pensions has come close to dismantling Merkel's coalition with the center-left Social Democrats. In November they agreed to create a ""basic pension"" for people who have been employed all their working lives. 
But that truce appears fragile, and the debate over pensions is expected to be a pivotal factor in the next national election earmarked for 2021.
While German pensions have outstripped inflation over the past decade, inequalities have also grown. The proportion of pensioners living in poverty rose to 19% last year from 16% in 2017, federal data shows. 
""HOME IS WHERE I CAN AFFORD""
""For me, home is where I can afford to live, and I can't live in Germany,"" said Waldemar.
Sirakovo, the village where he and Hildegard settled, has drawn other elderly Germans while many of its younger Bulgarian residents have left to work abroad.
So Germany's economically driven pensioner exodus mirrors, albeit on a far smaller scale, the flows of young migrants from poor to richer countries, with both groups often facing uncertain futures.
Joerg Dunsbach, a German Catholic priest who ministers to compatriots in Thailand, speaks sadly of those who die unmourned after emigrating on retirement and losing contact with their families.
""Every year, 40 to 60 German, Swiss or Austrian citizens die here alone, almost all of them pensioners,"" he said.
But in Sirakovo, the good life goes on. 
The Hackstaetters' German neighbor, Brigitte Haager-Horn, has come round for drinks.
""I find it ...a terrible sign of impoverishment that so many pensioners can't manage in Germany,"" she said.
""But I'm very grateful to be here. This year I've managed to make my first batch of homemade wine, and my first rakija (brandy),"" she said. ""Cheers!""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Harry made his first public appearance on Thursday since Queen Elizabeth acceded to the wishes of her grandson and his American wife Meghan to step back from their senior royal roles and seek a more independent future.
The prince, sixth-in-line to the throne, watched children playing rugby league in the back garden of Buckingham Palace ahead of making the draw for the sport's World Cup next year.
The event is his last scheduled royal engagement before he and Meghan begin a ""period of transition"" to their new roles.
Last week, Harry, 35, and former actress Meghan, 38, sparked a crisis in the British monarchy by announcing they wanted to reduce their royal duties and spend more time in North America, while also becoming financially independent.
The public announcement caught the rest of the royal family by surprise and left the queen and other senior Windsors hurt and disappointed, according to royal sources. A friend of Harry and Meghan said the couple felt they had been driven out. 
Following a family summit on Monday at her Sandringham estate attended by Elizabeth, Harry, his elder brother Prince William and his father and heir to the British throne, Prince Charles, it was agreed that the couple would split their time between Britain and Canada.
""Although we would have preferred them to remain full-time working members of the Royal Family, we respect and understand their wish to live a more independent life as a family while remaining a valued part of my family,"" the 93-year-old monarch said in a rare, highly personal statement.
COURT ACTION
The couple have said they want a ""progressive"" new role for themselves and the ability to fund themselves. Currently they are not allowed to seek private income and most of their money comes from the private estate of Harry's father.
Meghan is currently in Canada with the couple's baby son Archie where she has carried out a couple of low-key events this week. Media reported that Harry would stay in Britain for meetings next week as details about their future are hammered out before joining her. 
On Wednesday, Harry, who served for a decade in the British army, published a video to announce Germany would host the next Invictus Games sporting event for wounded military personnel, indicating he would still give his support to causes he feels strongly about.
As one of the world’s most glamorous couples, they have struggled with intense media scrutiny, with Harry describing some coverage of Meghan as bullying, akin to the treatment his mother Princess Diana endured before her death in a 1997 car crash.
Some observers have criticized British media for racism in its coverage of Meghan, whose mother is African-American.
This week, the Mail on Sunday newspaper submitted its defense to court action by Meghan over the publication of a private letter she sent to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. The case could see Markle testify against her.

""There is a huge and legitimate public interest in the royal family and the activities, conduct and standards of behavior of its members,"" lawyers for the paper said in documents submitted to London’s High Court.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - The United States urged a Cambodian court on Thursday to allow journalists to attend the treason trial of opposition party leader Kem Sokha, who is accused of plotting to overthrow longtime leader Hun Sen.
Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 and his party banned as the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen cracked down on opposition, civil society groups and the media in the run-up to 2018 parliament elections in which the ruling party won every seat.
Reporters were barred from court proceedings after morning sessions on Wednesday and Thursday. A Reuters witness saw some empty seats during the Wednesday session attended by diplomats and officials.
""We are aware that court officials have excluded media and civil society members from the proceedings, and we have urged the court to allow them in,"" Emily Zeeberg, a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy told domestic broadcaster Voice of Democracy.
""Freedoms of expression and the press, an active civil society, and tolerance of dissenting views are vital components of any democracy.""
A telephone call to seek comment from Taing Sunlay, the director of the Phnom Penh Municipal Court, was not immediately answered on Thursday.
The court postponed Kem Sokha's trial proceedings to next week, lawyers for both sides said.
Kem Sokha's treason charges stem from accusations that he was conspiring with the United States to overthrow Hun Sen. He denies the charges, saying they are politically motivated.
As hearings continue, Zeeberg said, the United States urged authorities to address its shortcomings and follow standards of impartiality, transparency, and fair trial guarantees consistent with the constitution.
A coalition of 82 Cambodian civil society groups also urged the court to open the trial to the public, independent media and civil society groups.
A Reuters reporter was among those in court on Wednesday morning but was not allowed to return.
In the treason case, government lawyers submitted in evidence a photograph of one of Sokha's daughters having a meal with foreigners, defense lawyers told reporters.
""I eat rice with journalists or with foreigners, and there is a photo, can this be used or not to charge me with treason?"" asked Sokha's lawyer Meng Sopheary.
""Eating a meal isn't a crime."""
825,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 05:37AM ET</span>","In Japan, foreign parents lead charge against child 'abduction'","By Chang-Ran Kim
TOKYO (Reuters) - A growing number of foreigners in Japan are speaking out against what they say is a little-known but entrenched system that allows one parent in a broken relationship to take away the children and block the other from visiting them.
The issue of what media in Japan and overseas call parental child ""abduction"" has regained international attention recently, particularly in Europe where documentaries have been made about European fathers whose children were taken by their Japanese wives.
Japan's judicial system has drawn global attention with the lengthy detention - and subsequent fleeing - of former auto executive Carlos Ghosn in what critics have characterized as a ""hostage justice"" system.
Australian Scott McIntyre was the latest foreigner to raise his voice against the estrangement of separated parents from their children in Japan.
McIntyre was detained for 1-1/2 months in Tokyo for trespassing when he went to his in-laws' apartment to seek information on his two children. He remains married, has no restraining order against him, retains full parental rights, but has not been able to see his children since May, when his wife left with them.
""Sitting here today, I don't know if my children are alive or dead,"" McIntyre told a news conference on Thursday, a day after he received a six-month suspended sentence.
He said he had made numerous requests to the police and his wife's lawyers - the two are going through a divorce mediation - to let him know whether the children are safe, but that those were ignored.
The wife's legal representative, Jun Kajita, said he could not go into specifics but there were some facts that were ""not consistent"" in McIntyre's claims.
""This is only going to change when Japanese parents speak out as well,"" McIntyre said, adding that he had received many letters of support from local parents suffering the same plight. ""Children should have access to both parents - it's a fundamental human right.""
No official statistics exist on how widespread the issue is. But non-profit organization Kizuna Child-Parent Reunion estimates that roughly 150,000 children lose contact with a parent every year in Japan because of estrangement from the non-custodial parent.
Although divorce is increasingly common in Japan - about one in three marriages end in one - it's still stigmatized, and Japanese society generally accepts the alienation of the non-custodial parent, largely because there is no joint-custody system after divorce.
COMMON PATTERN
Many parents say there is a pattern to the problem: one day, your spouse leaves with the children; you go to the police asking for help; they refuse, saying it's a ""family matter"". In some cases, a domestic violence claim is made against you, accepted as fact and never investigated. Your children's school can also shut you out because the wishes of the co-habiting parent - usually the mother - are uncontested.
Justice ministry officials have said in parliament that the abduction of a child by a parent is a crime, but that individual cases were up to the family courts to deliberate.
Asked about the legality of one parent taking away a child without the other's consent, a Tokyo Metropolitan Police spokesman said the agency ""could not state in general whether it was illegal.""
He said police could also not say in general whether they needed to respond to an estranged parent's request to investigate an alleged abduction of the children.
""For anyone outside Japan, it's a crazy system,"" said opposition lawmaker Seiichi Kushida, who has been fighting for a joint-custody system in parliament.
The plight of such parents last year prompted French President Emmanuel Macron and Italian Prime Giuseppe Conte to raise their concerns with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Some Japanese and foreign parents have collectively launched a complaint to the United Nations' human rights body.
""It's heartening to see all the attention foreign parents are bringing to this issue,"" said Kenjiro Hara, director at non-profit activist group Convention on the Rights of the Child Japan.
""It's thanks to them that more Japanese people feel emboldened to take action,"" he said, noting that several class-action lawsuits have been filed against the government seeking legislation to help reunite parents with their children."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's ruling party on Thursday unanimously backed President Vladimir Putin's surprise choice for prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, a man with almost no political profile.
Mishustin's elevation is part of a sweeping shake-up of the political system announced by Putin on Wednesday, which led to the resignation of Dmitry Medvedev as prime minister along with his government.
The changes are widely seen as giving Putin, 67, scope to extend his grip on power once he leaves the presidency in 2024. He has dominated Russian politics, as president or as prime minister, for two decades.
Russia's State Duma, the lower house of parliament, is expected to vote on Mishustin's candidacy later on Thursday after he has addressed the chamber. United Russia, the ruling party, has a majority in the Duma, meaning Mishustin's confirmation, barring an unexpected upset, is assured.
Mishustin, 53, ran the country's tax service where he won praise for dramatically improving tax collection.
Critics have long accused Putin, a former KGB officer, of plotting to stay on in some capacity after his term ends and continue to wield power over the world's largest nation, which is also one of its two leading nuclear powers.
The constitutional reform proposals, which he set out on Wednesday and suggested should be put to a referendum, would give him the option of taking an enhanced role as prime minister after 2024 or a new role as head of the State Council, an official body he said he was keen to build up. Putin could even become speaker of a new, supercharged parliament.
PUTIN TO ""RULE FOR LIFE""?
Opposition politician Leonid Volkov said it looked as though Putin was digging in.
""It's clear to everyone that everything is going exclusively toward setting Putin up to rule for life,"" he wrote on social media.
The Kommersant business daily on Thursday called Putin's shake-up ""the January revolution"". The proposals looked, Kommersant wrote, like the start of many more changes to come. 
Under the current constitution, which sets a maximum of two successive terms, Putin is barred from immediately running again for the presidency in 2024, but his supporters find it hard to imagine Russian political life without him.

Putin remains popular with many Russians who see him as a welcome source of stability, even as others complain that he has been in power for too long, that their pensions and standard of living are being steadily eroded, and that poverty is widespread and healthcare poor.

827,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 05:24AM ET</span>",Angola's dos Santos moots presidency run despite charges,"By Victoria Waldersee
LISBON (Reuters) - Africa's richest woman and Angola's ex-first daughter Isabel dos Santos expressed interest on Thursday in running for the presidency despite an asset freeze and accusations of diverting more than a billion dollars of state money.
It was the first time the daughter of former president Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who ran Angola for 38 years until Joao Lourenco took the helm in 2017, has mooted entering politics.
Asked in an interview with Portuguese TV channel RTP whether she would be interested in the role of president, which is next up in 2022, dos Santos said: ""It's possible"".
Lourenco has cracked down on the role of his predecessor's children, firing dos Santos from her job chairing oil firm Sonangol and her brother from the sovereign wealth fund.
The 46-year-old businesswoman nicknamed ""The Princess"" at home is estimated by Forbes magazine to be worth more than $2 billion, while two thirds of her compatriots live on less than $2 a day, according to the World Bank. 
In the past, she has consistently identified herself as an entrepreneur, not a politician. 
Dos Santos, her husband Sindika Dokolo and associate Mario Leite da Silva were subject to an asset freeze on Dec. 31 after accusations of steering more than $1 billion from Sonangol and official diamond trader Sodiam to firms where they held stakes.
She denies the allegations as a ""witch hunt"" forming part of an attempt to erase her father's legacy and distract from failures under the new government.
In the RTP interview, she framed the accusations not just as an attack on her family but as a campaign against future candidates for office.
""We cannot use corruption, or the supposed fight against corruption, in a selective way to neutralize who we think could be future political candidates,"" she said. 
""It's about the fight for power.""
Internal leadership elections for the ruling MPLA party, from which Lourenco and the dos Santos family hail, are set for 2021. Dos Santos told Reuters in an interview last week that economic doldrums mean a candidate from the rival UNITA party stands a real chance of winning the national poll in 2022.
Dos Santos, who lives abroad, divides opinion in Angola.
Supporters see her as an inspiring entrepreneur, while detractors say she embodies African corruption, with her fortune and Instagram-published jet-setting offensive to the poor.

Dos Santos holds significant stakes in several important Portuguese firms, including in Eurobic bank, telecoms company NOS, engineering company Efacec, and oil and gas company Galp Energia.

828,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 03:51AM ET</span>",South Korea should coordinate with U.S. to avoid 'misunderstandings' when engaging North: ambassador,"By Josh Smith
SEOUL (Reuters) - To avoid any ""misunderstandings"" that could trigger sanctions, South Korea should run any plans to engage with North Korea through a joint working group established with the United States, the U.S. ambassador to South Korea said on Thursday.
Ambassador Harry Harris said that he did not have an official U.S. position on South Korean proposals such as reopening individual tourism to its northern neighbor, but that it is important for Washington and Seoul to consult closely with each other.
As denuclearisation negotiations with North Korea stall, South Korean President Moon Jae-in has said he would seek to move forward on inter-Korean projects as a way to improve ties with Pyongyang.
""In order to avoid a misunderstanding later that could trigger sanctions... it's better to run this through the working group,"" Harris told reporters, referring to a group established in 2018 in a bid to bridge the two allies' sometimes divergent approaches to North Korea.
""South Korea is a sovereign country and will do what it sees as best for its national interest,"" Harris added, noting that it's not the United States' place to approve South Korean decisions.
But as South Korea's biggest ally, Washington has an interest in inter-Korea cooperation and ""fruitful"" discussions with Seoul are ongoing, he said.
""President Moon's continued optimism is encouraging. I think his optimism creates hope, and that's a positive thing,"" Harris said. ""But with regard to acting on that optimism, I have said that things should be done in consultation with the United States.""
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha discussed the projects in meetings with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in California this week.
South Korea and the United States are also seeking to narrow disagreements over how much Seoul contributes toward maintaining the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops in the country.
Harris declined to confirm reports that the United States had demanded billions of dollars in additional funding, and acknowledged that a ""gap remains"" between the two positions.
The current cost-sharing agreement technically expired at the end of 2019, and the top U.S. commander in South Korea is using ""residual funds"" to try to minimize the impact on about 10,000 South Koreans employed by the U.S. military, Harris said. A mandated furlough notice could soon be issued to those workers, he added.
The latest round of negotiations ended on Wednesday without an agreement.
""We did not reach a conclusion in Washington, so there will be further discussions,"" he said. ""I think we're narrowing the differences.""

South Korea's purchase of U.S. weapons is one factor being negotiated, but Harris said other issues like a U.S. request for South Korea to contribute troops to a Middle East maritime force have not been discussed in the cost-sharing negotiations.

""We are enriching more uranium before the deal was reached ... Pressure has increased on Iran but we continue to progress,"" Rouhani said.

The pact, or JCPOA, was agreed in 2015 between Tehran and world powers. U.S. President Donald Trump withdrew from the deal in 2018 and imposed stringent U.S. sanctions on Iran, telling Tehran he wanted a new broader deal on nuclear and other issues.
""Appeasement confirmed. E3 sold out remnants of #JCPOA to avoid new Trump tariffs. It won't work my friends. You only whet his appetite. Remember your high school bully?"" Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif wrote on Twitter.

Aside from adoption enquiries received by child protection services, at least six women have written to local daily The New Paper saying they wanted to care for or adopt the baby. 
""I am willing to do anything for the baby,"" Shahirah Slamat, 34, said in comments published by the paper. 
""I feel so jealous when I see people pregnant. My sister has five children...We want a child so much."" 
Rubbish collectors found the crying baby last week in a bloody plastic bag while clearing rubbish from a bin at the foot of a trash chute on a local housing estate.
A local politician said the baby could have been crushed by a compactor if it were not for the cleaners' intervention.
In the wake of the incident, many have lamented the rare case of abandonment in the wealthy island nation which has the second-fastest aging population in the world after South Korea and one of the lowest fertility rates globally.
Latest data shows the number of births in Singapore fell to an eight-year low in 2018. 
""Oh why people abandon their babies? We are in need of a population growth so don't abandon the babies and I'm more than happy to adopt one if the conditions are right,"" social media user Leong Lim said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
The Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said in response to Reuters' questions on Wednesday that several people had enquired about adopting the baby, which was in stable condition. Police said investigations into the incident were ongoing. 
While the child's birth parents, who have not been named by authorities, were mostly criticized on social media, some said more understanding was needed considering the stigma surrounding single mothers.
""We should step up efforts to support them and reduce stigma rather than judge these women and young girls who may be not far from being children themselves,"" said another Facebook user Abirame Subramanian.

Baby abandonment is rare in the city-state, which has a population of about 5.7 million. There were such 17 cases from 2009 to 2019, according to the MSF.

833,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 02:31AM ET</span>",Australian tourism industry seeks urgent help as cost of bushfires grows,"By Lidia Kelly
MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's peak tourism body estimated the country's bushfire crisis has so far cost the industry almost A$1 billion ($690 million) and called for urgent help from the government to lure back visitors.
Industry bosses were due to meet with Tourism Minister Simon Birmingham later on Thursday as storms and heavy rain brought some respite from months of fierce bushfires across Australia's east coast. 
The fires, which have killed 29 people and razed bushland across an area the size of Bulgaria, have hit several coastal towns at the height of the profitable summer season. 
""People have basically stopped travel,"" Simon Westaway, executive director of Australian Tourism Industry Council (ATIC), told Reuters. ""And that's absolutely understandable: human nature kicks in."" 
Even though recent cooler conditions have led some tourist destinations to reopen after they were evacuated because of the fires, people remain wary of visiting.
Images of burnt-out towns, people huddled on beaches to escape huge flames, dead wildlife and thick smoke hanging over major cities have been beamed around the world. 
The qualifying rounds of Australian Open in Melbourne this week, the first tennis Grand Slam of the year, have been blighted by complaints from players about the pollution.
""The imagery of the fires in the global marketplace is very bad for our country,"" Westaway said. ""We are worried about the contagion that may have.""
Tourism accounts for more than 3% of Australia's A$1.95 trillion economy, with 9 million foreigners visiting the country annually and domestic tourism growing. 
Accommodation booking cancellations in non-fire zones have reached upwards of 60%, while in fire-affected areas there were no tourists at all, Westaway said. Many destinations rely heavily on domestic tourism, as well as international visitors.
This week's wet weather brought some temporary respite for fire-hit areas, but also came with the warning of potential flash floods and lightning that could ignite new fires.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier this week welcomed a U.S. move to downgrade a travel warning and has stressed that Australia is open for business.
Birmingham said he would seek firsthand feedback from tourism bosses at Thursday's meeting and devise a strategy to reassure visitors that many tourism destinations are untainted by fires.

Following are some highlights of what is happening in the bushfire crisis: 
** The Australian Bureau of Meteorology provided some welcome news on Thursday with a new forecast that there is a 50% chance that the bulk of the country's east will receive average rainfall from March 1 through May 30. Still, BOM warned that warned that follow-up rains will be needed to end a three-year drought.
** There were 85 fires burning across the state of New South Wales on Thursday, with 30 of them yet to be contained, while 19 fires were alight in Victoria, according to fire authorities.
** The rain has brought relief for a number of firefighters working across New South Wales state. ""Although this rain won't extinguish all fires, it will certainly go a long way toward containment,"" state fire services said.
** Emergency responders in Victoria have dealt with nearly 600 cases of falling trees, flash flooding and other damage in since late Wednesday and warned of more risks from storms starting Monday.
** Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne ranked among the top 50 most polluted major cities worldwide on Thursday, according to AirVisual's pollution ranking for major global cities, with winds set to bring more smoke to Melbourne over the weekend.
** The smoke haze that has plagued Australia's major cities for weeks and has been tracked by NASA circumnavigating the globe.
** Australia's conservative government has softened its rhetoric on climate change amid the crisis, acknowledging this week that changes are real and the country needs a strategy of ""adaptation"" and ""resilience"".
** Australia's Wollemi Pines, giant prehistoric trees that were thought to be extinct until 1994, were specially protected by firefighters as blazes swept through their secret location in a NSW national park.

834,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 02:20AM ET</span>","'One country, two systems' can continue beyond 2047: Hong Kong leader","By Felix Tam and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - The principle that ensures Hong Kong enjoys freedoms unavailable in mainland China can continue beyond its 2047 expiry date as long as the city's youngsters do not destroy it with ""temporary misunderstandings,"" Chief Executive Carrie Lam said on Thursday.
The Chinese-ruled city, roiled by months of pro-democracy protests fueled by perceptions that Beijing is tightening its grip, was handed over to China by Britain in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" framework valid for at least 50 years.
Beijing denies meddling there, says it is committed to the principle, and blames the West for fomenting unrest.
The handover agreement states that the Asian financial hub is part of Communist-ruled China, but is assured freedoms such as those of expression and assembly, plus a different institutional framework, including an independent judiciary.
The protests escalated in June over a now-dead bill that would have allowed suspects to be extradited to the mainland for trial in courts controlled by the Communist Party, but have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.
""There is enough reason to believe 'one country, two systems' ... will not change after 2047,"" Lam said in her first appearance in the city's Legislative Council this year.
She said the understanding and the implementation of the principle required maintaining the ""foundation of one country"" and respecting the difference ""of two systems.""
Lam urged the city's youngsters, which have been at the forefront of the often-violent protests, to not violate the principle because of ""temporary misunderstandings.""
""The scenario they worry about today may be triggered by their own hand,"" Lam said.
Hong Kong's protest movement is supported by 59% of city residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute in December. Only 17% expressed support for seeking independence from China.
Almost 9 in 10 of the respondents aged 18-20 say they support the protests.
Lam also rejected allegations of police brutality, which have been another source of anger in the protests.

""I do not accept allegations that police violence has occurred during the handling of seven months of social unrest,"" she told legislators. ""Unfortunately, in the past few months, we have seen continuous smearing and demonising of the Hong Kong police force, with the intention to weaken the law enforcement ability of the police force.""

MANILA (Reuters) - A Philippine volcano that has been spewing ash for days appeared to be calming down on Thursday, but seismologists said the danger of an eruption remained high and authorities warned evacuees not to return to their homes.
Some residents took advantage of what they perceived as a lull in the activity of Taal, one of country's most active and deadliest volcanoes, to return home even though a 14 kms (nine mile) exclusion zone remained in place. 
""We are analyzing what this seeming calm of the volcano means,"" Maria Antonia Bornas, chief science research specialist at the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), told reporters.
The lake inside Taal has dried up, Bornas said, which was to be expected since it began spewing lava fountains a day after it shot giant clouds of ash miles into the air on Sunday.
Phivolcs said volcanic activity had ""generally waned to weak emission of steam-laden plumes"". Even so, it had recorded more than 100 tremors since Wednesday, meaning magma was still rising.
More than 53,000 residents have abandoned their homes around Taal to take shelter in evacuation centers, but thousands more are refusing to leave or have already drifted back to check on their animals and possessions.
Power has been restored in some areas in nearby Tagaytay city where business owners were cleaning away the ash and preparing to start trading again. 
Although Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes at only 311 meters (1,020 feet) high, it can be deadly. One eruption killed more than 1,300 people in 1911.

Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, with the most recent in 1977. The Philippines lies on the ""Ring of Fire"", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.

836,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 16, 2020 12:32AM ET</span>",Trump walking fine line in supporting Iran protesters,"By Steve Holland and Humeyra Pamuk
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With tweets of solidarity in Farsi and technological tools to circumvent internet shutdowns, U.S. President Donald Trump might be close to exhausting his options to support Iranian protesters rising up against their rulers. 
U.S. officials say the administration needs to avoid any overtures that could draw accusations of foreign meddling - like direct financing - and increase the chances of a violent crackdown on the people it wants to support. 
The day after protests broke out in Tehran and other cities following Iran's admission on Saturday after days of denials that it shot down a Ukrainian airliner, killing all 176 people aboard, Trump sent a tweet in Farsi aimed at Iran's leaders: ""DO NOT KILL YOUR PROTESTERS."" It was retweeted almost 80,000 times.
U.S. officials said the intent of Trump's tweet and other voices of support within the administration was to reinforce the message that Washington stands in solidarity with the Iranian people, while helping shine a light on the motivation of the protesters and let the Tehran government know “we are paying attention.”
The demonstrators met a fierce police response in several places during four days of protests. In November, a crackdown on protests caused by fuel price hikes killed hundreds of people.
The Ukraine International Airlines flight from Tehran to Kiev was downed by Iranian air defenses when the armed forces were on high alert for U.S. reprisals, hours after Iran launched missiles against U.S. targets in Iraq in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed top Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3. Most of those on board were Iranians or dual citizens.
""We’re not looking for regime change or all-out war,"" said one U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""We’re just telling you (that) you can’t have a nuclear weapon and don’t shoot protesters.""
The United States has worked with technology companies to help create tools for the Iranian people to circumvent Tehran's restrictions on the internet, said Brian Hook, U.S. special representative for Iran. During the November protests, tens of thousands of people used those tools to communicate, he added.
""We're going to continue to look for technology tools to help the Iranian people circumvent the regime censorship and internet shutdown,"" Hook told Reuters when asked what tangible efforts Washington could offer to help protesters.
PUNISHING SANCTIONS
Some see hypocrisy in Trump's show of concern.
While the administration emphasizes that it stands by the Iranian people, heavy U.S. sanctions reimposed by Trump have hastened the economy's deterioration and worsened economic conditions for ordinary Iranians, experts say. 
""His words carry almost no credibility with an Iranian public who saw him just now impose more sanctions,"" said Aaron David Miller, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
""So if you ask me if Trump has a public relations strategy when it comes to supporting these protests, the answer is no. It's all driven by his moods, his political needs and his desire to separate himself from his predecessor.”
While the United States says its sanctions are laser-focused to hurt Iran's leaders, many foreign banks and companies are deterred from doing business with the Islamic Republic, even for supplies of food and medicine, which are exempt from sanctions.
Democrats say there is more the White House can do to send a message to the Iranian people, such as lifting the ban on travel by Iranians to the United States. Iran was included in a travel ban Trump launched early in his presidency aimed at stopping the export of what Washington calls state-sponsored terrorism.
There has been no indication yet that Trump is considering doing so. 
While some analysts believe the United States would not be totally uncomfortable with a regime change, Washington has reason to be wary of overstepping too much. The latest example of foreign diplomats landing in hot water in Iran came last week, when Britain's ambassador to Tehran was briefly detained, accused of attending a protest.
""We leave the future of Iran to the Iranian people. It will not be decided by the United States government and that's been our policy for almost three years,"" Hook said.
Asked if Trump would post more on protesters, Hook said: ""It would not surprise me. I think you can expect the president to continue communicating directly with Iranian people.""

XINGU INDIGENOUS PARK, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian indigenous tribes and rubber tappers joined forces on Wednesday to oppose steps by Brazilian far-right President Jair Bolsonaro that they say are destroying the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) forest they depend on.
Some 450 members of 47 tribes met for a second day to discuss how to resist Bolsonaro's moves to weaken public agencies that are meant to protect the environment and native land rights. Bolsonaro has said tribes have too much land and he wants to open up the reservations to commercial mining and agriculture to develop the Amazon and lift indigenous people from poverty.
Kayapó chief Raoni Metuktire, who called the meeting in his village on the Xingu river, called on Brazil's Congress to block the president's policies.
""We are here to defend our land and to tell him to stop talking badly about us,"" said Raoni, who became a global reference for his environmental campaigning in the 1980s with musician Sting at his side. He said he would never accept mining on his ancestral lands.
Among those attending the meeting was Angela Mendes, daughter of rubber tapper, trade union leader and environmentalist Chico Mendes who was killed by a rancher in 1988 for his efforts to protect the rainforest.
""United we can resist. They have the power of the state, but we have the force of the waters, the flowers and ancestral land,"" she said at a news conference.
The existence of non-indigenous extractivist communities that live off rubber tapping and selling the fruits of the forest is being endangered by deforestation, she warned.
Mendes struck an alliance with Sonia Guajajara, head on the APIB umbrella, Brazil's largest organization of tribes.
""This is a very grave moment in our history. It looks like a war scenario,"" Guajajara said, accusing Bolsonaro of serving the interests of Brazil's powerful agribusiness and farming sectors that have advanced into the Amazon region. 
The rise in violence against Brazil's 850,000 indigenous people due to land conflicts with farmers and illegal mining and logging on reservations threaten the tribes' future, she said.
Bolsonaro has vowed to integrate indigenous people into the Brazilian economy and society, an assimilation that Guajajara said was tantamount to the death of their cultures and languages.

Brazil's indigenous affairs agency, Funai, run by a police officer appointed by Bolsonaro, said the meeting in the Xingu was a ""totally private event"" that it could not support because it was not ""in line"" with government policy.

The House members were politely ushered to a bench at the rear of the Senate chamber, where they sat in silence as the House clerk announced the impeachment resolution had passed, and Grassley responded: ""The message will be received.""
The procession took place four weeks after the Democratic-led House voted to impeach the Republican president on charges of abuse of power for asking Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden and obstruction of Congress for blocking information sought by investigators.
Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and McConnell have since feuded over how to conduct the trial.
Pelosi delayed signing the impeachment articles while she waited for word from McConnell about the trial's scope. During the delay, Democrats and Republicans squabbled over Trump's status because he had been impeached, but had not had his trial.
Pelosi used a few dozen pens to sign, at a desk bearing a placard reading #DefendOurDemocracy. Afterward, she handed pens to the impeachment managers and committee chairs involved in the investigation. 
""It makes a funny signature,"" she said.
Reflecting the deep partisan divide, the House vote to impeach Trump was nearly along party lines. Many of his fellow Republicans in the Senate have made clear they view the impeachment as a political stunt by Democrats as Trump seeks re-election in the November election.
The dispute did not end when the articles were handed over.
Senate Republicans said Democrats would have to repeat the delivery on Thursday. McConnell said he had invited the House managers to exhibit the articles at noon before U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts swears in the senators.
""We will pledge to rise above petty factionalism and do justice for our institutions, for our states, and for the nation,"" McConnell said in a statement.

The trial starts on Tuesday after a holiday weekend.

Australia's Prime Minister Scott Morrison secured re-election in May 2019, defying polls that had indicated voters would punish the conservative government for the backbench revolt that ousted former leader Malcolm Turnbull in 2018.
Looking to regain lost support in the run-up to the election, Morrison's government promised increased spending on local sport, but the Australian National Audit Office said late on Tuesday that then Minister for Sport Bridget McKenzie used the public funds to win favor with voters.
The report said 400 projects received funding. The Australian National Audit Office said more than 70% of those that received funding had done so without any endorsement by the governing body for sport in Australia.
""The award of funding reflected the approach documented by the minister's office of focusing on 'marginal' electorates held by the Coalition as well as those electorates held by other parties or independent members that were to be targeted by the Coalition at the 2019 election,"" the report read.
The report fuels pressure on Morrison, who is already struggling under a barrage of criticism over his government's handing of ragging bushfires that have destroyed an area the size of Bulgaria.
McKenzie did not dispute the findings of the report, though she insisted no rules had been broken.
""Ministerial discretion was actually written into the guidelines for a purpose,"" McKenzie told Australian Broadcasting Corporation Radio.
""Right now, as a result of our investment, parents are watching their kids get active on a Saturday morning.""
Australia's current Minister for Sport Richard Colbeck said the government would take action on the audit's findings, though he did not specify what changes would be made."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former film producer Harvey Weinstein on Wednesday asked a New York state appeals court to delay his rape trial and move it out of Manhattan, the day before the final phase of jury selection is scheduled to begin.
In a filing with the Appellate Division, Arthur Aidala, one of Weinstein's lawyers, said the trial should be moved because ""the current venue has devolved into a carnival-like atmosphere that no potential juror can avoid.""
He said that atmosphere had been stoked by heavy press coverage, protests outside the courthouse and the appearance on Monday of supermodel Gigi Hadid, who was called as a potential juror.
Aidala also said that, out of 142 potential jurors who had filled out written questionnaires, 130 said they had heard of the case before.
Weinstein asked the appellate court to move the trial once before, on the grounds that media attention would prevent him from getting a fair trial in Manhattan, but that request was denied in October.
On Jan. 8, the day after jury selection began, Weinstein filed a motion for Justice James Burke to remove himself from the case, accusing him of bias, but the judge denied that motion.
A spokesman for the office of Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment on Weinstein's latest motion.
Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assaulting two women, and faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault.
Since 2017, more than 80 women, including many famous actresses, have accused him of sexual misconduct dating back decades. Weinstein has denied the allegations, saying any sexual encounters he had were consensual.
The allegations helped fuel the #MeToo movement, in which women have gone public with misconduct allegations against powerful men in business, entertainment and politics.
Many potential jurors were dismissed in pre-screening after saying they could not be fair and impartial in the case.
Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most powerful producers, made his mark with critically acclaimed films such as ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love.""

On Jan. 6, as the New York trial began, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced new sexual assault charges against Weinstein.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The government of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is failing to tackle violence that has pushed homicide rates to record highs and turned the country into a ""butcher's shop,"" Human Rights Watch said on Wednesday.
Mexico has been racked by violence for years as successive governments battled brutal drug cartels, often by taking out their leaders. That has resulted in fragmentation of gangs and increasingly vicious internecine fighting.
Lopez Obrador won office in 2018 vowing to adopt a more conciliatory security strategy focused on the root causes of crime, in particular by reducing poverty and corruption.
But the violence has ground on during Lopez Obrador's first 13 months in charge, with 2019 set to be the bloodiest on record, surpassing the 29,100 murders in 2018.
His government has also revised upwards the total number of disappeared people to 61,637 from about 40,000. Most victims were disappeared after the so-called ""war on drugs"" began in late 2006, with more than 5,000 going missing last year.
Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of New York-based Human Rights Watch's Americas division, said at a news conference the figures were ""scandalous"" and a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""
Discussing the Mexico section of his group's annual report on human rights, Vivanco said the ""butcher's shop"" violence, including incidents where victims were dissolved by criminal gangs, continues apace with no signs of progress.
""How can it be that the highest authorities in the country don't give importance to this issue,"" he said, questioning government policy and desire to investigate incidents where police may have ""colluded"" with cartels.
""What's the current government's priority? It's lacking action on certain crimes, completely disregarding the reality in Mexico,"" he added.
The government did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Vivanco's remarks.
Earlier in the day, Lopez Obrador defended his record on crime, saying he had inherited vast problems. He doubled down on his promise to curb crime by addressing its origins.
""If people have work, if young people are taken care of, if wages rise, if we don't have problems of family break-ups, if cultural, moral, spiritual values ​​are strengthened, we will calm down the country,"" Lopez Obrador said.
It was not fair to expect all of Mexico's problems to be solved in a year, but even so, many institutions were not fully focused on going after criminals, Vivanco said.
""At least you should be able to see an effort, serious effort,"" he said."

GUATEMALA CITY/TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Guatemala's new president on Wednesday faced an early test of his ability to manage migration as a caravan of hundreds of people left Honduras for the United States, and said Mexico would halt its progress.
President Alejandro Giammattei inherited a contentious deal that his predecessor's government struck with Washington designed to make migrants from Honduras and El Salvador seek asylum in Guatemala rather than the United States.
Giammattei met with Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard early on Wednesday, and later told reporters that Mexico was determined to halt the caravan's advance.
""The Mexican government told us that they won't let it pass,"" said Giammattei, ""that they will do everything in their powers to stop it from passing.""
Mexico's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Giammattei's remarks.
Earlier, Ebrard said on Twitter that Mexico and Guatemala will hold bilateral talks on migration once the new Guatemalan government has become familiar with ""the situation.""
In accordance with a freedom of movement agreement between northern Central America countries, Giammattei said he would allow the caravan to enter Guatemala provided its members had the required paperwork.
Still, tensions flared when a group of about 300 migrants approached the Guatemala border at Corinto from Honduras. 
According to Honduran security ministry spokesman Jair Meza, Honduran police fired tear gas when a group of people tried to cross without passing through migration controls. 
Some reached the Guatemalan side, where 15 people were detained by Guatemalan authorities and sent back, Meza said. 
Giammattei, a conservative who has already discussed migration with top U.S. officials, is scheduled to speak by phone with his U.S. counterpart Donald Trump on Wednesday.
Giammattei has yet to detail how he will treat the U.S. migration agreement, instead focusing on economic development.
""Physical walls aren't going to stop migration... the only things that stop migration are walls of prosperity,"" Giammattei told Mexican broadcaster Televisa.
Before dawn, the caravan of several hundred people set off from San Pedro Sula in northern Honduras, about 25 miles (40 km) from the Guatemala border.
""Here there's no work, there's nothing. That's why we are fleeing to the United States,"" a young man traveling with his wife and two children told Honduran television.
San Pedro Sula, one of Central America's most violent cities, also was the departure point for a large caravan in 2018 that angered Trump, prompting him to press governments in the region to do more to contain migration.
Guatemala's former President Jimmy Morales last July agreed with the U.S. government to implement measures aimed at reducing U.S. asylum claims from migrants fleeing Honduras and El Salvador, averting Trump's threat of economic sanctions.

Giammattei said a top priority would be reviewing the text of migration agreements made with the United States.

Lebanon has been swept by a wave of mostly peaceful protests aimed at the country's elite that prompted Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri to resign on Oct. 29, pushing the country deeper into economic crisis.
On Tuesday night, riots broke out in Beirut's Hamra area, with bank facades smashed and stones pelted at security forces who fired back with tear gas.
The unrest continued on Wednesday when anti-government protesters hurled stones and fireworks at security forces outside a Beirut police station where some demonstrators were being detained from the night before.
Police dispersed the protests with batons and tear gas.
The Lebanese Red Cross said that 45 people had been injured, 35 of whom had been transferred to hospitals for treatment.
Security forces injured a Reuters video journalist who was treated in hospital and released. Lebanese broadcasters Al Jadeed and MTV said security forces injured a cameraman for each of them as well.
Lebanon's internal security forces did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In a statement caretaker interior minister Raya al-Hassan condemned the violence and called on demonstrators to remain peaceful.
""We do not accept the attack of journalists which are doing their duty to cover events and developments, nor do we accept the attack of security forces which are maintaining security,"" Hassan said.

The ministers met in Washington this week and agreed to fill the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) in stages during the wet season, taking into account the impact on downstream reservoirs, the U.S. Treasury Department, which hosted the meeting, said in a statement.
They will meet again in Washington on Jan. 28-29 to finalize the agreement with technical and legal discussions, the statement said.
Cairo fears the dam, announced in 2011 and under construction on the Blue Nile near Ethiopia's border with Sudan, will restrict supplies of already scarce Nile waters on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent.
Addis Ababa denies the dam will undermine Egypt's access to water and says the project is crucial to its economic development, as it aims to become Africa's biggest power exporter with a projected capacity of more than 6,000 megawatts.

Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Ed Markey introduced the legislation after writing President Donald Trump to urge him to press Beijing to free detained Americans and U.S. residents, including those targeted by exit bans.
""It is immoral and unjust that the Communist Chinese government uses so-called 'exit bans' to prevent American citizens from leaving China. We must protect our citizens and ensure that they are able to return home when they travel abroad,"" Rubio said in a statement on Wednesday.
Markey highlighted the case of two of his Massachusetts constituents, Victor and Cynthia Liu, who had been ""unfairly"" barred from leaving China since June 2018.
""In addition to having their lives upended by not being able to return home, they face regular surveillance, harassment, and threats from Chinese authorities,"" he said.
In the letter to Trump on Tuesday, the lawmakers said Victor and Cynthia Liu's mother, Sandra Han, was detained on criminal charges in China and the family’s New York-based attorney believed they were being used as human collateral to coerce their father, Liu Changming, to return to China to face fraud charges.
The legislation, if it eventually becomes law, would deny or revoke visas of Chinese officials involved in the planning and execution of the “exit ban” policy and require the State Department to report publicly on the number of Americans being punished by the policy.
The statement said it was estimated that at least two dozen U.S. citizens had been prevented from leaving China over the past three years.
The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the proposed legislation, news of which came the same day as the United States and China signed an initial trade deal to defuse an 18-month row between the world's two largest economies.
Georgetown University in Washington said Victor Liu was a student in the university's graduating class of 2021 and called for his urgent release.""We sincerely hope a diplomatic solution can be reached for his return home as soon as possible,"" the university's president, John DeGioia, said in a statement."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican officials on Wednesday presented lawmakers a proposal to overhaul the criminal justice system, paving the way for the Senate to take up the plan next month which could facilitate security cooperation with the United States.
According to a draft of the reform reviewed by Reuters, the plan would allow private communications to be used as evidence and limit legal challenges to avoid extradition delays for criminal suspects, many of whom are U.S.-bound.
Mexican Attorney General Alejandro Gertz told senators the plan would attack entrenched corruption and impunity as well as the roots of criminal activity.
""This law aims for the following: preventing crime from the start, protecting daily life against the seige of common crime and its collusion with police and officials,"" he said. ""There have been efforts over the last 20 years, generating partial responses, that never have ended up creating a real solution.""
The proposal will be formally presented in early February.
A change to rules on wiretaps could make it easier to convict suspects, which has been a problem in the past, a former U.S. official told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
To go into effect, the reform would need to amend several articles of the constitution, create a new federal criminal code, set out new procedures, modify an existing law that defines legal challenges, and change the legal framework of the attorney general's office and its regulations.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's leftist National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) and its allies control both chambers of Congress, and his proposals are typically approved.

Britain is set to leave the EU on Jan. 31 after agreeing a divorce deal late last year but will remain bound by all the bloc's rules until the end of 2020 under an agreed transition phase aimed at smoothing its exit.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson insists he will not ask for more time, even as European leaders, including EU Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, cast doubt on the feasibility of agreeing a trade deal over the next 11 months.
""There is only one of the two who can ask for an extension and that is the United Kingdom. We will see mid-year where we are at,"" Von der Leyen told a news conference in Dublin.
She said that Brussels was well-placed to move as fast as possible following her meeting with Johnson last week.
A spokesman for Von der Leyen added that while both sides can formally ask for an extension, it would have to be commonly agreed to.
If the transition period is not extended beyond 2020, trade relations between the EU and Britain from the start of 2021 will either be governed by whatever agreement can be hammered out by the end of this year, or by World Trade Organization rules.
Johnson has also insisted there will be no customs checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK after Brexit.

GENEVA (Reuters) - Last year was the Earth's second-hottest since records began, and the world should brace itself for more extreme weather events like the bushfires ravaging much of Australia, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) said on Wednesday.
The Geneva-based WMO combined several datasets, including two from the U.S. space administration NASA and the UK Met Office.
These showed that the average global temperature in 2019 was 1.1 degree Celsius (2.0 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, creeping towards a globally agreed limit after which major changes to life on Earth are expected.
""Unfortunately, we expect to see much extreme weather throughout 2020 and the coming decades, fuelled by record levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,"" said WMO Secretary-General Petteri Taalas.
Australia had its hottest, driest year ever - a precursor to the bushfires.
Scientists say climate change is likely to have contributed to severe weather in 2019 such as a heatwave in Europe and the hurricane that killed at least 50 people when it barrelled through the Bahamas in September.
Governments agreed at the 2015 Paris Accord to cap fossil fuel emissions enough to limit global warming to 1.5 Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels - after which global warming is expected to be so severe that it will all but wipe out the world's coral reefs and most Arctic sea ice.
However, the WMO has previously said that much greater temperature rises -- of 3-5 Celsius (5.4-9.0 Fahrenheit) -- can be expected if nothing is done to stop the rise in harmful emissions, which hit a new record in 2018.
The United States -- the world's top historic greenhouse gas emitter and leading oil and gas producer -- began the process of withdrawing from the Paris Agreement last year. U.S. President Donald Trump has cast doubt on mainstream climate science.
On a conference call with reporters on Wednesday, however, U.S. scientists said it was clear from the data that greenhouse gas emissions were warming the planet.
""We end up with an attribution of these trends to human activity pretty much at the 100 percent level ... All of the trends are effectively anthropogenic (man-made) at this point,"" said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
The hottest year on record was 2016, when a recurring weather pattern called El Nino pushed the average surface temperature to 1.2 Celsius (2.2 Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels, the WMO said.

""In the future we easily can expect warmer El Ninos than the previous ones,"" said WMO scientist Omar Baddour. ""We can raise a red flag now.""

Northam, who is leading the push for stronger gun laws in his state, said he wants to avoid a repeat of violence that erupted at a 2017 white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, when a march by white nationalists erupted and led to the death of a counterprotester.
Gun-rights advocates, including militia groups and ultraconservative activists, are planning a ""Lobby Day"" rally on Monday, seeking to block gun control legislation backed by Northam, a Democrat, whose party recently won majorities in both chambers of the state legislature.
""We're seeing threats of violence. We're seeing threats of armed confrontation and assault on our capitol,"" Northam said. ""These are considered credible, serious threats from our law enforcement agencies.""
Several measures - including universal background checks and ""red flag"" laws - that would toughen gun laws in the state are quickly making their way through the Senate and House, and could be passed before the end of the month.
The Virginia Citizens Defense League, which is organizing the rally, hopes that a large turnout by gun-rights proponents, most of whom will be openly carrying weapons as allowed by state law, will persuade lawmakers not to back the measures, according to materials posted online by the group.
""A substantial crowd will be here in Richmond,"" State Police Superintendent Colonel Gary Settle told reporters on Wednesday. ""We're talking several thousands of people.""
Everyone attending Monday's rally will be required to enter through a security checkpoint, authorities said.

Last week, Virginia lawmakers approved a new gun policy prohibiting firearms inside the Capitol and a nearby office building. But they did not extend the ban to Capitol Square (NYSE:SQ), the public space outside that includes monuments to prominent Virginians and the Virginia Civil Rights Memorial.

The complaint filed by Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George significantly broadens the scope of Epstein's alleged sexual misconduct, saying it occurred as recently as 2018 and targeted girls as young as 11 or 12.
It seeks a variety of damages from Epstein's estimated $577.7 million estate, including the forfeiture of his two private islands, Little St. James and Great St. James.
A lawyer for the estate and its executors did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The lawsuit could reduce the sums available for other Epstein accusers who are suing the estate, after his death cost them a chance to see him convicted.
Epstein died Aug. 10 at age 66 by hanging himself in a Manhattan jail cell, after he had pleaded not guilty to charges he abused women and girls in his Manhattan townhouse from 2002 to 2005.
He had pleaded guilty in 2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge and completed a 13-month jail sentence.
According to Wednesday's complaint, Epstein and his alleged accomplices ""trafficked, raped, sexually assaulted and held captive underage girls and young women"" at his Virgin Islands properties.

CARTAGENA (Reuters) - The eradication of Colombia's plantations of coca, the raw material for cocaine, is the best way to protect peace efforts and fight the drug trafficking that fuels violence in the South American nation, President Ivan Duque said on Wednesday.
Colombia, long a leading source of the world's cocaine, announced last week it eradicated a record amount of coca last year after coming under pressure from the United States following a jump in crop figures.
""The great security challenge is derived from drug trafficking,"" Duque told Reuters ahead of a meeting of the United Nations Peacebuilding Commission. ""Drug trafficking is the fuel of criminality and the fuel of terrorism.""
Duque said narcotics smuggling in Colombia provided revenues not only to criminal groups like the Clan del Golfo - the country's largest crime gang - but also to the Marxist-led National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident members of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who have rejected a 2016 peace deal.
Colombia ripped up more than 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) of coca plantations last year. Such efforts are ""a way of taking space away from these criminal groups,"" said Duque, who took office 17 months ago with a pledge to crack down on rising cultivation.
""We need to confront this exponential growth and we have,"" said the 43-year-old president.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has praised stepped-up eradication efforts under Duque, who supports restarting the aerial fumigation of coca - which is more efficient and safer for troops than manual eradication as coca fields are often guarded or booby trapped by armed groups.
Aerial spraying of the herbicide glyphosate was banned by the Constitutional Court in 2015 over cancer concerns but Duque has said a restart under safety conditions set by magistrates could be possible this year.
Also key to fighting remaining rebels and crime gangs are security efforts in rural areas and investments in education, healthcare and other social programs, Duque said.
""Our goal is to keep deepening our security agenda in rural areas,"" Duque said. ""Our responsibility is first to dissuade and at the same time break up, confront and make an example of these criminal structures via sentencing.""
An expert mediator told Reuters this week that the ELN and FARC dissidents - whose ranks include several well-known commanders who abandoned the peace accord - may increase bombings in urban areas amid rising security tensions.
The 2016 accord formally ended the FARC's part in more than five decades of conflict that killed more than 260,000 people.
FARC dissidents want to destabilize rural areas and spread anxiety among civilians, Duque said. The dissidents allege Duque's government failed to comply with the terms of the deal, which was negotiated by his predecessor.
The Colombian police said over the weekend they had thwarted an assassination attempt by dissidents against former rebel commander Rodrigo Londono.
Though dissidents are attempting to hurt implementation of the deal, most ex-combatants remain committed to the peace process, Duque said.
""I think we are on a good path - I don't want to be triumphalist or euphoric. We are on a good path, we have been able to take very important steps in these 17 months."""

Russian President Vladimir Putin suggested last month that Poland shared responsibility for the war because it connived in Nazi German plans in 1938 to dismember Czechoslovakia. The speaker of the Russian parliament has called for Poland to apologise for starting the war.
""Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not his own facts. The Commission's role here is to talk about facts,"" EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova told the European Parliament.
""The European Commission fully rejects any false claims that attempt to distort the history of the Second World War or paint the victims, like Poland, as perpetrators,"" she said.
Jourova said it was the pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, signed by foreign ministers Joachim von Ribbentrop and Vyacheslav Molotov on Aug. 23, 1939, that paved the way for war.
""The Nazi-Soviet alliance enabled the attack on Poland by Nazi Germany on 1 September, 1939, and subsequently Soviet troops on 17 September. These events marked the beginning of the Second World War – these are the facts,"" she said.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Armed civilians attacked a convoy of vehicles carrying Venezuelan opposition politicians to congress on Wednesday, backing recent efforts under President Nicolas Maduro to bar opposition leader Juan Guaido from presiding over parliament.
A crowd of men hit the cars with traffic cones and crowbars, breaking one car's back window, according to a video recorded by an opposition member from inside the vehicle. The convoy then sped away, tailed by several individuals on motorbikes.
Guaido's spokesman said four opposition politicians were in the vehicles, including Carlos Berrizbeitia, Guaido's second congressional vice president. No one was injured.
On Jan. 5, troops blocked Guaido from entering congress and the Socialist Party declared allied legislator Luis Parra as head of parliament, allowing Maduro to seize control of the one Venezuelan institution outside his grip.
Opposition legislators in a separate plenary that day re-elected Guaido to a second term as head of the National Assembly and he later returned to the legislative palace to hold session. Guaido has branded Parra, who defected from the opposition after becoming embroiled in a corruption scandal in December, ""a traitor.""
Guaido will instead hold Wednesday's scheduled parliamentary session in the Caracas suburb of El Hatillo, the National Assembly said on Twitter.
""We are not going to risk the lives of our lawmakers,"" Carlos Prosperi, one of the deputies in the vehicles, told reporters after the attack.
Diosdado Cabello, head of the Constituent Assembly, a separate legislature controlled by the government, gloated over the attack during a session, calling the opposition ""crazy"" and ""finished.""
""I feel proud because this is a group defending these spaces belonging to the Bolivarian Revolution,"" Cabello said, referring to the socialist movement first started by Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez. As he spoke, other pro-government lawmakers chanted ""The homeland must be defended.""
The U.S. Treasury on Monday imposed sanctions on Parra and six of his allies and said they ""attempted to block the democratic process in Venezuela."" Parra condemned the sanctions as a foreign nation meddling in the assembly's affairs.
Last January, Washington recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate head-of-state and began ratcheting up sanctions and diplomatic pressure in an effort to oust Maduro. Guaido calls Maduro an usurper for securing re-election in a 2018 vote widely considered fraudulent.

A year later, however, Maduro remains in power, backed by the military as well as Russia, China and Cuba.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranians buried their dead from an airliner shot down by the military as authorities on Wednesday identified more of the 176 victims of last week's crash, which led to days of rage against Iran's rulers followed by a police crackdown. 
Emotions have been running high as the victims of the Jan. 8 crash are mourned. The national flag was ripped from the coffin of one victim when relatives collected the body and the mother shouted ""Tear it off,"" an online video post showed. 
Protesters took to the streets of Iranian cities for four days after the armed forces finally acknowledged on Saturday, after days of denials, that they had brought down the plane. In several places, demonstrators met a fierce police response.
Iranians on social media called for more protests on Wednesday but there was no sign of the kind of rallies of previous days. Instead videos showed riot police massed outside universities, the focal point for demonstrations.
In earlier protests, footage showed police beating protesters, sounds of gunshots, teargas and blood on the ground.
The full scale of the unrest and the crackdown is difficult to determine because of restrictions on independent reporting.
Police denied opening fire and said officers were told to act with restraint. But just two months ago, a crackdown on protests caused by fuel price rises killed hundreds of people.
""The government sees itself under siege from all sides right now and is not going to allow any protest to snowball into a nationwide movement,"" said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group.
Iran is battling several fronts. A new international crisis has erupted over its nuclear program, the economy is in tatters under U.S. sanctions and a long-running standoff with the United States briefly spiraled into open conflict.
The plane was downed by air defenses when the armed forces were on high alert for U.S. reprisals, hours after Iran launched missiles against U.S. targets in Iraq in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian commander on Jan. 3.
'UNFORGIVABLE ERROR'
Most of those on Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, bound for Kiev, were Iranians or dual citizens, many of them students returning to their studies abroad or families on their way home after seeing relatives in Iran.
The head of the coroner's office in Tehran said 123 of the 176 victims had been identified, ILNA news agency reported.
Several victims were buried in the sprawling Behesht-e Zahra cemetery south of Tehran, while others would be transferred abroad, Iranian media said.
On Thursday, Canada, Ukraine, Britain and other nations who had citizens on the downed plane meet in London to discuss legal action against Iran, Ukraine has said.
The military and top officials apologized for the ""unforgivable error"" in bringing the plane down and said it would prosecute those to blame. The judiciary said people had been arrested who were accused of having a role in the disaster.
But the government has also sought to galvanize loyalists at home. A state-sponsored body has called for rallies on Friday to show support for the leadership and to commemorate ""martyrs"" of the plane disaster, Iranian media reported.
Iran has also been fending off international pressure over its nuclear ambitions. On Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani dismissed the idea of a new agreement to resolve the nuclear row, as proposed by U.S. President Donald Trump and described by Britain's prime minister as a ""Trump deal.""
Rouhani said Trump, who quit an existing nuclear pact in 2018, always broke his promises.
Tehran has repeatedly said it would not hold talks while under U.S. sanctions, reimposed as part of Washington's ""maximum pressure"" campaign on Iran aimed at pushing Tehran into a new deal that would put stricter limits on its nuclear work, curb its missile program and end its role in regional conflicts.
The commander killed in the Jan. 3 drone strike, Qassem Soleimani, was responsible for building up Iran's proxy militias abroad that created an arch of influence across the Middle East.

Morales told Reuters on Sunday that Bolivians had the right to organize and defend themselves, without firearms, from what he said was attacks by Bolivia's interim government, which he claims took power in a coup late last year.
""We ask the Argentine government to repudiate the practices of Evo Morales, at odds with the law and international public order,"" Bolivia's government said, adding it had sent a diplomatic letter to Argentine Foreign Minister Felipe Solá.
Bolivia's interim government has done little to hide its anger that Morales has continued to play a key and vocal political role with his Movement for Socialism party ahead of new elections called for May 3.
A spokesman for Argentina's Foreign Ministry said the country did not recognize Bolivia's interim government and was waiting for ""transparent elections to recognize the next government of Bolivia.""
Argentina's center-left Peronist President Alberto Fernandez has previously supported Morales' rights to speak freely. Granting him asylum has, however, created tensions between his new administration and the United States.
Bolivia's interim President Jeanine Anez is rallying opposition to Morales ahead of the May election. Morales is not running but is orchestrating the campaign of his party.
Anez has also rekindled Bolivia's relationship with the United States. Mauricio Claver-Carone, a senior adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump, is currently visiting Bolivia, a sign of warming relations between the two countries.
Bolivia's top court also agreed to extend the term limit on Anez's caretaker government which had been due to expire later this month, local media reported, defusing some tensions after Morales had urged her to step down."

The German lower house of parliament last year approved a major climate protection package to help the country meet its 2030 target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Environmentalists have said the measures are insufficient.
""This is no longer just about future generations. To us, this is about our generation, our lives and the fact that the non-action of the government terrorises our freedom,"" said Luisa Neubauer, from the German chapter of the youth climate group 'Fridays for Future', one of the plaintiffs.
Their lawsuit is one of three filed in the past week against both the government and parliament, invoking Germans' basic right under article one of their constitution to live in dignity.
""From today the question is whether the government's non-action is compatible with the constitution. We are convinced it is not and that's why we are suing,"" said Neubauer.
One of the lawsuits was filed by a group of Nepalis and Bangladeshis, though it was not immediately clear why they were seeking legal redress through the German courts. Nepal and Bangladesh border, or are near to, China and India, two of the world's biggest polluters.
Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, Environmental Action Germany and Germanwatch said they supported the lawsuits.
But conservative lawmaker Jan-Marco Luczack dismissed the claims as a good ""PR gag"" and said courts had nothing to do with climate policy.
""It is the duty of politicians to weigh and make (climate) policy,"" he said in an interview with the Funke group of newspapers ""The Constitutional Court will not do the job of lawmakers.""
Climate activists say Germany could do more to achieve its target of cutting greenhouse gas emissions to 55% of their 1990 level by 2030 were it not for the government's strong ties to the car industry, which supports some 800,000 jobs.
They point to government resistance to introducing a speed limit on all of German motorways. The lack of such a limit on large sections of the network encourages drivers to race unashamedly and emit more carbon dioxide, activists say."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration’s envoy on Venezuela said China appears to be scaling back economic support for President Nicolas Maduro, and Beijing acknowledged a diminishing role largely due to U.S. sanctions against the OPEC nation.
As China's economic activities have declined, Maduro and his socialist government are becoming more reliant on Russia and its oil giant Rosneft as his financial lifeline for staying in power, Elliott Abrams, President Donald Trump administration’s special representative on Venezuela, told Reuters on Tuesday.
Abrams said China's involvement in Venezuela “is diminishing, not growing” because of Beijing’s increased concern about economic mismanagement and corruption under Maduro. Washington and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido, not Maduro, as the country’s legitimate president
“It is primarily their view that it's a mess,” Abrams said of Beijing's misgivings, adding that Chinese officials have expressed these privately.
He declined to provide specifics on how China had scaled back in Venezuela, except to say “we're not aware of any new Chinese loans or investments in 2019.”
But when asked about Abrams' comments, China's foreign ministry said that after decades of growing economic ties, ""presently, China and Venezuela are stopping or slowing down some of our cooperation, namely due to sanctions and other factors.""
""Sanctions are the root cause behind the deterioration of the Venezuelan people’s daily lives. China urges the relevant countries to immediately stop the unilateral sanctions against Venezuela,"" the ministry said.
The two countries had built an economic partnership in the early 2000s based on late Venezuelan socialist leader Hugo Chavez’s need for financing and China’s desperate search for crude oil as its economic growth exploded.
But as Chinese growth leveled off and crude became plentiful after the 2014 oil price collapse, China had less to gain from the relationship. Caracas, caught in an economic meltdown, is estimated to owe Beijing nearly $20 billion in outstanding loans.
There has been a steady drop-off in Chinese financing, with Beijing reluctant to approve new loans, since the opposition took over the country’s legislature in 2016.
Beijing's comments signal that China is likely to continue to provide diplomatic support for Maduro along with Russia, including at the United Nations.
GROWING ROLE OF RUSSIA
Abrams sought to highlight the roles of China and Russia nearly a year after the Trump administration threw its support behind Guaido, who last January invoked the constitution to assume a rival interim presidency, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was a sham.
Despite a U.S.-led pressure campaign, Maduro – who accuses Guaido of being Washington’s puppet - remains in office, backed by the military as well as longtime ally Cuba. His staying power has been a source of frustration for Trump, U.S. officials have said privately.
Abrams insisted, however, that the growing roles of Russia and Rosneft appeared to be the result of the impact of the sanctions program, which he said had forced other countries and companies to turn away from Venezuela. 
“That reduces the ability of the regime to earn money,” he said.
Asked whether Washington is preparing Venezuela-related sanctions against Russia and Rosneft, Abrams said their roles “continue to attract a lot of attention here.” But he declined to discuss any specific measures.
U.S. officials are mindful of the need for caution in targeting a company as large and far-reaching as Rosneft because of the risk of cause unintended damage to U.S. and allies’ interests.
Rosneft has helped Venezuela market its crude since Washington imposed sanctions on state oil company PDVSA last January.
Moscow has acted as a lender of last resort for Venezuela, with the government and Rosneft providing at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006, and has also provided diplomatic support.

Venezuela's oil exports plummeted 32% last year, according to Refinitiv Eikon data and PDVSA's reports, with Rosneft the largest receiver and intermediary with 33.5% of total exports, followed by state-run China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) and its units with 11%, and Cuba's state-run Cubametales with 7%.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Irish farmers paralyzed parts of central Dublin for the second time in as many months by parking over 100 tractors in the streets on Wednesday in a protest against the government on the first day of its re-election campaign.
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar launched his party's campaign for the Feb. 8 vote - which he called on Tuesday - near the border with Northern Ireland to focus on his key role in Britain's divorce deal with the European Union.
But in Dublin farmers arrived on tractors from all over Ireland to protest over low beef prices and government climate-change initiatives they say unfairly target their livelihoods.
Varadkar acknowledged on Tuesday that more had to be done for people to feel the strength of the booming economy in their pockets and his re-election could hinge on the attitudes of those whom opposition parties say feel left behind. 
""(Varadkar's Fine Gael party) will suffer in rural Ireland,"" said protester Ollie Gargan, 43, who runs a farm with 30 suckler cattle in the northern county of Cavan. He voted for Fine Gael in the 2016 election but ruled out doing so again.
""They are just throwing crumbs from the top table. There's no future for young farmers,"" Gargan said.
Farmers staged a similar protest in cordoned-off areas of Dublin in November when, rather than leave at the allotted time, many slept in their vehicles overnight and refused to leave until Agriculture Minister Michael Creed met them.
Creed said on Wednesday the government could not intervene on beef prices but had secured an extra 120 million euros ($133.88 million) of income support for farmers this year in what he acknowledged was a difficult year for the industry.
At the wheel in tractors covered in placards with slogans such as ""Stop Farmer Exploitation"" and ""Help Save Rural Ireland"", angry farmers said that was not enough.
""There's been no effort. Zilch,"" said John Denash, a 50-year-old beef farmer from the western county of Roscommon.
The woes farmers face, including potential losses from increased barriers to trade with post-Brexit Britain, may become a battleground in rural districts just as high rents and housing shortage is set to dominate the campaign in urban areas.
Fine Gael and the main opposition Fianna Fail are closely matched in opinion polls, some distance ahead of their other rivals, increasingly the likelihood that one of the two centre-right parties will head the next government.

Giulio Regeni, a 28-year-old postgraduate student at Cambridge University, vanished in Cairo in January 2016. His body was found almost a week later and a post mortem examination showed he had been tortured before his death.
Intelligence and security sources told Reuters in 2016 that police had arrested Regeni outside a Cairo metro station and then transferred him to a compound run by Homeland Security. The police have denied this.
Egyptian public prosecutor Hamada El-Sawy told a visiting group of Italian investigators that ""a new investigation team was formed and is working on studying the case"", the statement said.
The team ""is working on taking all the necessary investigation procedures to clarify the truth in a completely neutral and independent way,"" it added.
The prosecutor did not say why the new committee had been formed. Italian investigators have repeatedly complained about a lack of cooperation from their Egyptian counterparts.
Egyptian investigators ""heard the views"" of their Italian counterparts in joint meetings over Tuesday and Wednesday, the prosecutor's office said.
The committee was formed after Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte visited Cairo on Tuesday, meeting President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi.
Italy last year placed five members of Egypt's security forces under official investigation for their alleged involvement in the disappearance of Regeni.
Egyptian officials have repeatedly denied any involvement in Regeni's killing."

They said the towns of Khan al Subl, Maasaran and several others in southern Idlib were targeted after a two-day lull in aerial strikes on the last rebel bastion that had been pounded for over a month in a renewed assault.
""The Russian air strikes have shattered two days of relative calm that gave people a small relief from daily raids,"" said Mohamad Rashid, a civil affairs activist.
Later in the day, Syrian government and Russian air force jets hit two main markets, one in Idlib city where at least 15 people were killed, witnesses said. Footage by activists showed bodies strewn in debris-filled streets.
Rescuers said three other civilians were killed in attacks on several other towns since the aerial bombing resumed. 
Moscow says its forces along with Syria's army and Iranian-backed militias are fending off attacks by al Qaeda militants whom they accuse of targeting populated, government-held areas in a ""de-escalation zone"" brokered in 2018 by Turkey and Russia.
Hundreds of thousands of people have fled Idlib province in recent weeks as Russian jets and Syrian artillery have pounded towns and villages in a renewed government assault aimed at clearing the opposition.
U.N. officials said this month the humanitarian crisis had worsened with at least 300,000 civilians now on the run in Idlib province on top of over half a million who fled earlier bouts of fighting to the safety of camps near the Turkish border.
The latest offensive has brought the Russian-steered military campaign closer to heavily populated parts of Idlib province, where nearly 3 million people are trapped, the vast majority women and children, according to the United Nations.
Moscow, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad biggest ally in his war with rebels and militants, announced earlier this week it had opened safe corridors to allow people under opposition rule in Idlib province to flee to government-held areas.
Residents say few people have crossed into state-controlled areas, where they fear retribution, while most have headed to the relative safety of areas near the Turkish border.
Many of the residents of the opposition enclave fear the return of Assad's authoritarian rule and look to Turkey to halt the Russian-led campaign that has killed hundreds and left dozens of towns and villages in ruins. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said his country was determined to stop Syrian government violations of the ceasefire in the northwest.

Acting Foreign Minister Gent Cakaj identified the diplomats in a statement on social media as Mohammad Ali Arz Peimanemati and Seyed Ahmad Hosseini Alast. They were expelled for activity incompatible with their diplomatic status, a phrase often used in cases of spying.
""The two representatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran have been asked to depart immediately from the territory of the Republic of Albania,"" Cakaj said.
In December 2018, Albania expelled Iran's ambassador and another diplomat for ""damaging its national security"". Iran said at the time Albania had acted under pressure from Israel and the United States.
For the past six years, NATO-member Albania, a U.S. ally, has hosted a camp for members of the People's Mujahideen Organisation of Iran, which opposes Iran's clerical rulers.
The group relocated to Albania under an agreement reached with U.S. support, after its members had come under attack at their previous base in Iraq.
The presence of the dissidents has been a source of constant friction with Iran. Albanian media widely reported comments by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei this month referring to Albania as ""a small but evil European country where American elements conspire with Iranian traitors and plan attacks against the Islamic Republic"".

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemalan prosecutors on Wednesday issued arrest warrants for five former lawmakers, including a close ally of Jimmy Morales, who left office as president just hours earlier, and a special forces soldier who ran for the presidency last year.
Prosecutors executed the warrants in a series of raids, capturing one of the former lawmakers, all of whom enjoyed immunity from prosecution until Tuesday, when their terms in Congress came to an end.
""I am not going to cover up any leaks,"" new President Alejandro Giammattei said in an interview with Mexican network Televisa, when asked about his government's will to fight corruption.
Several former officials and lawmakers, including Morales and his vice president, rushed to be sworn in as members of Central America's regional parliament (Parlacen) late on Tuesday night, hours after leaving office, despite efforts by egg-throwing protesters to stop them.
In the regional parliament they also enjoy some protection from prosecution. Morales' name was not among the warrants despite an investigation against him for electoral finance violations. He denies wrongdoing.
Former presidential candidate Estuardo Galdamez, a right-wing former member of the feared Kaibil special forces, who ran for Morales' party in the 2019 election, was among those on the prosecutor's wanted list. He was not found in the morning raids.
Another target was Othmar Sanchez, a close ally of Morales. Sanchez is wanted for fraud and money laundering in a case that also involves Morales' brother and son.
Giammattei's strategy to uproot corruption from political life will be closely watched after Morales chased out the U.N.-backed anti-corruption body that led the investigation into him and his family.
Most right-of center politicians, including Giammattei, came to see the corruption body, known as CICIG, as an unacceptable violation of Guatemala's sovereignty. Giammattei said he will quickly create an anti-corruption force tied to the president's office instead."

PARIS (Reuters) - When French trade unions declared a nationwide strike to protest against planned pension reforms, Nicolas, a 34-year-old maintenance technician with the Paris metro, went on strike for three straight weeks. Then he went back to work.
""It was a financial thing,"" he said as he headed home after working an early shift on the metro, explaining his return to the job. While on strike he forfeited 1,000 euros ($1,114) in salary, money he needs to support his 2 1/2-year-old daughter.
He still contributes to his union's strike fund, and goes out on strike for a day or two at a time, but says that he cannot join the all-out, indefinite strike that union leaders have sought.
Forty-two days into the strike -- now the longest since the 1960s -- there are still protests and disruption of public transport in Paris.
But the financial pressures facing Nicolas and people like him are one reason the strikes, aimed at forcing President Emmanuel Macron to back down on his planned pension reform, have not had the impact union leaders sought.
Data collated by Reuters from public transport agencies shows the impact of the strike is on the wane. [https://tmsnrt.rs/2FESaHb ]
For example, the average share of railways staff on strike in the past 7 days was 12%, compared with 29% in the first week.
That plays into the strategy of Macron's administration, which believes it can eventually win the stand-off by wearing down the strikers, according to four people close to Macron's administration who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity.
A government minister said of the strikers: ""It's starting to hit wallets.""
Another pro-Macron lawmaker said the strikes had not had the same nationwide breadth as walkouts in 1995 prompted by a previous pension reform. ""France was not paralyzed,"" he said. ""Of course that's helping us.""
HARD TIMES
In the biggest overhaul of France's state pension system since World War Two, Macron wants to end privileges for some professions and provide incentives for people to stay in work longer.
Faced with the strike, he has softened the impact for some professions and provisionally withdrawn a measure that would extend the retirement age by two years for many people.
But he has shown no sign of bowing to the demand of hardline unions that he ditch the reform altogether. Winning the standoff would strengthen his hand to embark on further pro-business reforms as he eyes re-election in 2022.
Nicolas, the metro worker, spends his working life walking the filthy metro tunnels making sure electricity connections are sound. He earns 2,200 euros in an average month.
Losing his income on strike days has been tough, especially as his wife, who works in theater costume departments, did not work in December.
""You shouldn't feel any shame about going back to work if you have personal issues,"" said Nicolas, who did not want his surname published to protect his family's privacy.

LONDON (Reuters) - Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has won his bid to hold a party on Brexit night in front of parliament with speeches, music and possibly the chimes of the Big Ben bell on the day when Britain is due to leave the European Union.
The Brexit-supporting campaign group ""Leave Means Leave"" said it had been successful in an application to take over Parliament Square (NYSE:SQ) on the evening of Jan. 31, the moment Brexit is due to take place. 
""It is a big moment in the history of this nation to celebrate,"" Farage said on Wednesday.
The party is likely to be one of the photographed events to mark the moment when Britain ends almost half a century of integration with the bloc. 
The decision to grant permission for the event comes as the government has yet to explain its own plan to commemorate Brexit. So far the government has refused public funds to ensure that Big Ben, which is currently being renovated, can ring out at the moment of Britain's departure.
Farage has complained that plans to hold the party are being undermined by officials opposed to Britain's departure from the world's biggest trading bloc.
On Tuesday, Farage said they had been struggling to gain permission to hold a five-minute firework display as part of the celebrations. He said permission had been denied to launch fireworks from a government building, the River Thames and St James' Park.
""But do you know something? We're not giving up on trying,"" he told his LBC radio show. ""We will mark this moment in history, I promise you.""
A spokesman for the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said provisional approval has been given for the event to take place. 
More than 12,000 people have already applied for tickets.
A separate row has taken place over whether Big Ben, which has been silenced for renovation work on the Elizabeth Tower, can chime on the night.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it might be possible to crowdfund the 500,000-pound cost of restoring the bell's clapper and delaying refurbishment work.
Brexit Party chairman Richard Tice said if it is not possible to allow the bell to ring out they will play the sound of the bell on a speaker system.

MUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan (Reuters) - A 12-year-old girl was found alive on Wednesday after being buried for 18 hours when an avalanche in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir engulfed the family house.
Samina Bibi recalled screaming and shouting for help as she lay trapped in a room under the snow.
The death toll from Monday's avalanches in Pakistan's Neelum Valley, in the Himalayan region disputed by Pakistan and India, rose to 74, according to Pakistani officials, as rescuers continued to recover bodies.
Samina was one of the lucky ones. ""I thought I would die there,"" she told Reuters from a hospital bed in Muzaffarabad, where she and dozens of other injured people were receiving treatment after being airlifted out of the avalanche area.
For Samina's mother, Shahnaz Bibi, who lost a son and another daughter, the rescue was nothing short of a miracle. After being pulled out of the snow earlier, Shahnaz said she and her brother, Irshad Ahmad, had given up hope of finding Samina alive.
Samina said she could not sleep while she waited to be rescued. Her leg was fractured and blood was oozing from her mouth.
For the family, the disaster happened very fast. ""We didn't hear a rumble,"" Shahnaz said, recalling the moments before the avalanche buried the three-storey house where she and her family were sheltering with others from the village. At least 18 of them died.
Samina and her family were huddled round a fire when the avalanche hit. ""It happened in the blink of an eye,"" said Shahnaz.
Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said the total number of deaths in snow-hit areas in Pakistan over the last couple of days had jumped to 100. More heavy snowfall is expected in the region from Friday.
Another 10 people were killed in the Indian part of the Kashmir valley.
Kashmir has been divided between India and Pakistan since their independence in 1947. In 2012, an avalanche engulfed a Pakistani army headquarters near the Indian border, killing at least 124 soldiers and 11 civilians."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Wednesday named the first woman to hold a high-ranking post in the Secretariat of State, the male-dominated Vatican's diplomatic and administrative nerve center.
Italian lay woman Francesca Di Giovanni, 66, will assume a newly-created post in a division known as the Section for Relations with States where she takes the rank of under-secretary, effectively one of two deputy foreign ministers.
The Roman Catholic Church allows only men to be ordained as priests and women have traditionally been consigned to the shadows of its administration.
However, women's groups, including the International Union of Superiors General (UISG), an umbrella group of Catholic nuns, have long called on the pope to appoint more females to senior jobs within the Vatican bureaucracy.
They cite figures showing that more than half of the world's 1.3 billion Catholics are women and that membership of female religious orders is about three times larger than male orders.
A Vatican statement confirming Di Giovanni's appointment said she will look after multilateral relations in the Secretariat where she has worked since 1993. Di Giovanni is a specialist in international law and human rights
The Vatican, a sovereign state surrounded by Rome, has diplomatic relations with more than 180 countries.
Despite the pope's promises to appoint more women to decision-making jobs in the Vatican, Di Giovanni joins only about half a dozen others to hold them.
The two most prominent are Barbara Jatta, head of Vatican Museums, and Cristiane Murray, deputy head of the press office.
Last year, Francis also appointed four women as first female councillors for the Synod of Bishops, a department founded more than 50 years ago that prepares major meetings of world bishops held every few years on a different topic."

Two of the projectiles were shot down by Israel's Iron Dome air defense system, the military said in a statement. Israel's Channel 13 television said the other two projectiles struck uninhabited areas.
Sirens warning of rocket fire sounded in several Israeli communities near the Gaza frontier. Israel's Magen David Adom ambulance service said no injuries or damage were reported in the first such attack in three weeks.
There was no immediately claim of responsibility from the Palestinian Gaza Strip, which Israel keeps under blockade citing security concerns over its Islamist rulers Hamas.
Last month, a rocket was launched from the Gaza Strip at the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon as it hosted a rally with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, prompting him to seek shelter briefly before returning to the venue. No one was hurt.
But simmering tensions have mostly remained calm since a two-day surge of violence in November between Israel and the armed Gaza-based faction Islamic Jihad that left 34 Palestinians dead and dozens of Israelis injured."

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Wednesday it was too early to say whether a ceasefire in Libya had collapsed after Khalifa Haftar, commander of eastern Libyan forces, failed to sign a binding truce accord at talks this week.
Russo-Turkish talks in Moscow have aimed to halt Haftar's nine-month campaign to seize the Libyan capital Tripoli from forces aligned with the internationally recognized government of Fayez al-Serraj.
Serraj, whose embattled government has struggled to repel the nine-month campaign, signed the truce proposal but Haftar left Moscow without adding his signature. He has not commented since then whether he will sign it or not.
Since veteran dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in a 2011 uprising, the North African country has been in turmoil, with outside powers providing support to rival factions.
Turkey backs Serraj's government, while Haftar has received support from Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Russian mercenaries.
""We cannot say that the ceasefire has collapsed, it's much too early for such an interpretation,"" Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar told reporters in Ankara. He added that Ankara was awaiting the outcome of diplomacy by Moscow, which has relations with Serraj even as it has given support to Haftar.
Turkey has sent a training and cooperation team which is now active in Libya, Akar said. Turkey committed to military support for the Tripoli government in December after the arrival of Russian mercenaries helped Haftar's Libya National Army (LNA) make some small gains along the Tripoli frontline. 
President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday Turkey would ""teach a lesson"" to Haftar if his attacks on the Tripoli-based government continued.
On Sunday, Germany will host a summit on Libya involving the rival camps, their main foreign backers and representatives from the United Nations, the United States, Russia, Britain, France, China, Turkey and Italy. Haftar and Serraj have also been invited but it is unclear whether they will come, a German government spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
The nine-month war over Tripoli is just the latest bout of chaos in Libya, an OPEC oil exporter that has become a hub for human traffickers to ship migrants by boats to Italy, while Islamist militants have exploited the widespread disorder.

The conflict also risks disrupting oil production, the state oil firm has warned.

The 2018 killing of 64-year-old Bishop Epiphanius, at Saint Macarius Monastery in the desert, rattled Egyptian Coptics who make up about 10 percent of the predominantly Muslim population.
Wael Saad, known by his monastic name Isaiah al-Makari, and Ramon Rasmi Mansour, known as Faltaous al-Makari, were convicted by a criminal court last year. Both had pleaded innocent.
Prosecutors said Saad, who had a history of differences with superiors, struck the bishop three times in the back of the head with a steel pipe while Mansour stood guard outside.
But the judicial sources told Reuters the cassation court abolished the death sentence after an appeal from the monks and will hear the case itself next April. Its rulings are final.
At the first trial, prosecutors and witnesses said Saad had been investigated for breaking monastic rules, including by trying to buy and sell land. He was defrocked in 2018.
After the murder, both men tried unsuccessfully to commit suicide, Saad by poisoning himself and Mansour by jumping off the monastery roof."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iranian President Hassan Rouhani dismissed on Wednesday a proposal for a new ""Trump deal"" aimed at resolving a nuclear row, saying it was a ""strange"" offer and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump for always breaking promises.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who has praised Trump as a great dealmaker, called on Tuesday for the president to replace Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers with his own new pact to ensure Tehran does not get an atomic weapon.
Trump said he agreed with Johnson that a “Trump deal” should replace the Iran nuclear deal. In a televised speech, Rouhani told Washington to return to the nuclear pact, which Washington abandoned in 2018, under which Tehran curbed its nuclear work in return for the lifting of international sanctions on Iran.
Since quitting the agreement, Washington has reimposed sanctions to throttle Iran's oil exports as part of a ""maximum pressure"" policy.
The United States says its aim is force Tehran to agree a broader deal that puts stricter limits on its nuclear work, curbs its ballistic missile program and ends its regional proxy wars. Iran says it will not negotiate as long as sanctions remain in place.
Tehran has gradually taken steps to reduce its compliance with the deal, which prompted Britain, France and Germany to formally accuse it on Tuesday of violating the terms.
""This Mr. Prime Minister in London, I don’t know how he thinks. He says let’s put aside the nuclear deal and put the Trump plan in action,"" Rouhani said. 
“If you take the wrong step, it will be to your detriment. Pick the right path. The right path is to return to the nuclear deal."" 
Iran denies any intent to acquire nuclear weapons and says its breaches of the deal would be reversed if Washington lifts sanctions. ""All of our activities are under the supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency(IAEA),” said Rouhani.
""NOT DEAD""
Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif told Reuters that the deal was still alive: ""No, it’s not dead. It’s not dead,"" Zarif said on the sidelines of a conference in New Delhi.
But he told the conference Trump's withdrawal from the earlier deal made new negotiations with Washington pointless: ""I had a U.S. deal and the U.S. broke it. If I have a Trump deal, how long will it last?""
In its biggest step away from the agreement yet, Iran announced on Jan. 5 it would abandon all limitations on enriching uranium set down in the pact. 
Britain, France and Germany reacted by activating a dispute mechanism in the deal on Tuesday, which eventually could lead to the reimposing of U.N. sanctions. Iran called this step a “strategic mistake”.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Washington now expects the U.N. sanctions to ""snap back into place"" as a result of the European move. The European countries have said that is not their goal.
Rouhani upbraided European powers for not standing up to Trump. Iran says the Europeans have reneged on promises to find ways to circumvent the U.S. sanctions.
The flare-up in nuclear diplomacy comes as military confrontation between Washington and Tehran has also reached a new peak. 
The United States killed an Iranian general in a drone strike in Baghdad on Jan. 3. Tehran responded a week ago by launching missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq. No Americans were hurt, but hours later Iran shot down a Ukrainian airliner in what its authorities have acknowledged as a tragic mistake, prompting anti-government protests at home. 
Rouhani repeated Iran's longstanding position that peace can come to the Middle East only when the United States withdraws.

""American soldiers today are not secure in the region ... We don’t want there to be insecurity in the world. We want you to go from here, but not with war. We want you to leave the region intelligently and it’s to your benefit,"" Rouhani said.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanese politicians are watching on as the economy collapses and protests turn angry, a senior U.N. official said on Wednesday, rebuking a ruling elite that has failed to agree a government or rescue plan for a country in deep crisis.
With banks tightly limiting access to cash, lenders were targeted in a night of violent protests in Beirut's Hamra district. Bank facades and ATMs were smashed and dozens of people wounded in confrontations with police.
Heavily indebted Lebanon has struggled since the government was toppled by the resignation of Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri in October as a result of protests against corruption and bad governance that are root causes of the economic problems.
Political rivalries have obstructed a deal on a new cabinet as the crisis hits ordinary people: the Lebanese pound has lost around a half of its value while anger at banking controls have led to rows and violence in branches.
""Another day of confusion around the formation of a government, amidst the increasingly angry protests and free-falling economy,"" Jan Kubis, U.N. special coordinator for Lebanon, wrote on Twitter. ""Politicians, don't blame the people, blame yourselves for this dangerous chaos.""
Kubis appeared to credit central bank governor Riad Salameh, saying he had sought ""extraordinary powers to at least somehow manage the economy while those responsible watch it collapsing"".
""Incredible,"" he wrote.
Salameh asked for extra powers last week, saying he wanted to standardize the banking controls.
Looking to assure anxious depositors, parliament speaker Nabih Berri said work was underway to safeguard people's money, especially small depositors and those of expatriates, without specifying further.
""BEGGING"" IN THE BANK
The long-brewing economic crisis snowballed last year as hard currency inflows slowed down, leading to a shortage of dollars needed to finance the state's deficit and import needs.
The violence in Beirut's Hamra area was some of the worst since anti-government protests began in October. Security forces fired tear gas outside the central bank to disperse protesters who pelted them with stones and fireworks.
One man hurled a car battery at the glass facade of a bank as another hit it with a metal pole, Reuters TV footage showed. On Wednesday morning, glass was being swept up at one vandalized bank as workers tried to fix a broken ATM at another.
A woman on Hamra street who gave her name as Hind said she supported protests against banks. ""I have been coming here for the last three days and only could take $300 ... we are begging, working 55 years to come and beg at the end,"" she told Reuters.
""I was expecting what happened yesterday. Unfortunately the chaos is because of the politicians,"" said Hamra shopkeeper Mohammad al-Rayyes.
The banking association condemned the attacks as the work of a ""mercenary mob"" and not the ""real revolutionaries of Lebanon"" seeking reform. It condemned the ""severe and irresponsible tardiness in forming a new government"", saying this made it look like banks were responsible for deteriorating conditions.

The powerful Iranian-backed group Hezbollah and its political allies last month nominated Hassan Diab, a little-known former minister, to form a new government after the failure of efforts to forge a deal with Hariri, a traditional ally of the West and Gulf Arab states.

Prosecutors said they believed the fraud was orchestrated by two Mafia clans in eastern Sicily who obtained at least 5.5 million euros ($6.1 million) in EU farm subsidies for land they did not own between 2010 and 2017.
Amongst those arrested were the heads of the two families, a number of public officials who help farmers apply for EU aid, a local mayor and an accountant. Some 150 companies were also seized as part of the investigation.
""The Mafia (there) has such power that they took control of 15 hectares of land through a simple phone call. No threats were necessary,"" Judge Sergio Mastroeni wrote in the arrest warrant.
""With the Mafia, you only have to say your name, if necessary mentioning the fact that you just got out of prison.""
However, Mastroeni said the families had managed to obtain the funds thanks to the help of ""white-collar workers"" who enabled them to negotiate the bureaucratic world of EU funding.
The EU pays out nearly $60 billion a year in subsidies to support farmers around the 28-nation bloc and keep rural communities alive. 
Italian Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova said the police operation showed the changing face of Sicilian mobsters, traditionally associated with drug trafficking and protection rackets but now looking to profit from EU scams.
""The gravity of what has emerged is enormous,"" she said in a statement. ""It is also clear how damaging it is to take significant European resources away from good agriculture and quality businesses, which make up the majority (of firms) in eastern Sicily, and direct them toward Mafia gangs.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai health officials are stepping up monitoring and inspection at its airports for the new mystery virus from China ahead of Lunar New Year, when Chinese visitors flock to the Southeast Asian country, a health official said on Wednesday.
The procedures comes days after a Chinese woman was quarantined in Thailand with the mystery strain of the coronavirus, in the first instance of its detection outside of China.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS.
The World Health Organisation has said there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in China within families.
Authorities in the central Chinese city of Wuhan confirmed on Wednesday that a married couple were among 41 people diagnosed with pneumonia believed to be caused by the new virus.
The prospect of human-to-human transmission of a new virus has put Thai authorities on alert.
The president of the Tourism Council of Thailand told Reuters on Wednesday that about 800,000 visitors from China were expected to visit the country over the Lunar New Year holiday later this month.
The Public Health Ministry has increased its monitoring at four airports that have daily flights from Wuhan - Suvarnabhumi, Don Mueng, Chiang Mai and Phuket - and any airports that receives charter flights from the city.
Preliminary lab tests cited by Chinese state media showed the 41 pneumonia cases in Wuhan, where one patient has died, could be from a new type of coronavirus. There have since been no new cases or deaths, Wuhan health authorities said on Tuesday.
""Usually there are 1,200 arrivals from Wuhan in Thailand, which can go up to 1,500 to 1,600 during Lunar New Year, so we will increase personnel,"" Thai Disease Control Department Director Sophon Iamsirithaworn told Reuters on Wednesday.
""Currently, officers are working 24 hours in three shifts of 5 to 6,"" he said adding that two infrared thermal scan machines were being used, with two in reserve.
Memories remain fresh in Asia of a 2002-2003 outbreak of SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China and killed nearly 800 people worldwide."

A Russian Jew, Dushman is one of the last surviving soldiers to have taken part in the liberation of the camp in January 1945 and he still struggles to explain how such a catastrophe could happen.
Dushman, who later became an Olympic fencer, joined the Red Army in 1941 after Nazi Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union.
""When we arrived we saw the fence and these unfortunate people, we broke through the fence with our tanks. We gave food to the prisoners and continued,"" Dushman told Reuters.
""They were standing there, all of them in (prisoner) uniforms, only eyes, only eyes, very narrow - that was very terrible, very terrible,"" Dushman recalled.
""We had not known that Auschwitz existed,"" said Dushman, speaking in his flat in Munich, southern Germany, where he has lived since 1996.
More than 1.1 million men, women and children lost their lives at Auschwitz, built by the Nazis in occupied Poland as the largest of their concentration camps and extermination centers.
Some six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust.
Asked why Auschwitz happened, Dushman is flummoxed.
""I'm not a politician, it's hard for me to say. Of course it's completely incomprehensible,"" he said, adding he hoped nothing like it would ever happen again.
Soon after arriving at Auschwitz, Dushman was ordered to leave and push on toward Berlin.
One of just 69 men in his 12,000-strong column of tanks to survive World War Two, Dushman was seriously wounded and he had to have part of one lung removed. That did not stop him becoming a professional fencer.
""I couldn't walk at all because I got out of breath. I started … I made up my own workout routine for one minute per day. So very, very gradually, slowly, slowly I reached a point where in 1951 I became the champion of Russia (in fencing).""
Dushman may have forged a new life but the scenes he witnessed during the war are still with him. He used to meet old comrades in Moscow every year but these days no one is left.
""I receive congratulations from (Russian President Vladimir) Putin every year on Victory Day. May 9 is the (anniversary of the) end of the Second World War,"" he said, looking with pride at the special letter."

Kunashiri island is one of the four Russian-held islands off Hokkaido, which Japan calls the Northern Territories, known as the Southern (NYSE:SO) Kuriles in Russia.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Holders of more than $20 billion of Oman's dollar bonds want the new sultan to push through urgent reforms to ward off a credit crunch in the Gulf's worst performing economy.
The swift appointment of Haitham bin Tariq al-Said after the death on Friday of Sultan Qaboos bin Said reassured investors, as some had feared a protracted succession that could have exposed Oman to external interference.
While world leaders welcomed Haitham's promise to uphold a balanced foreign policy, analysts said he needed to tackle unemployment and strained public finances in the indebted country.
""It is in the domestic politics and economic policy realm where the ultimate success of Haitham's leadership will be determined,"" said Robert Mogielnicki of the Washington-based Arab Gulf States Institute.
Rated junk by all three major agencies, Oman's debt to GDP ratio spiked to nearly 60% last year from around 15% in 2015, and could reach 70% by 2022, according to S&P Global Ratings.
It faces rising refinancing risks as a result of large government external debt maturities in 2021 ($4.3 billion) and 2022 ($6.4 billion) that could add significant pressure to foreign exchange reserves if the debt is not rolled over, S&P associate director Zahabia Saleem Gupta said.
The relatively small oil producer has relied heavily on debt to offset a widening deficit caused by lower crude prices and held back on austerity measures that could cause unrest.
""The country is pursuing a sustainable fiscal adjustment path: austerity measures are to be combined with a decisive impulse towards diversification,"" said Fabio Scacciavillani, chief economist at Nuverse and former chief economist at an Omani sovereign wealth fund.
""It is a delicate balancing act which might encounter resistance in certain quarters,"" he said.
DECENTRALIZING
Qaboos was finance minister and central bank chairman. He was also premier, defense and foreign minister and head of the armed forces.
He resisted turning to Gulf neighbors for financial aid in order to maintain an independent foreign policy.
When protests broke out in Oman during the 2011 Arab Spring, Qaboos sacked more than a third of the cabinet, created thousands of jobs and gave money to the unemployed.
Haitham cannot afford such largesse.
""Qaboos had too many roles and was reclusive and that meant his advisers would not tell him the challenges the country was facing,"" said a diplomat in Oman.
""Inevitably he (Haitham) will be more receptive to the challenges of the country.""
Haitham, who was culture minister and in charge of Oman's development plan, is likely to form a team of policy advisers after 40 days of mourning, which started on Sunday.
If he appoints a prime minister and moves to decentralize power this would signal willingness to improve decision making, the diplomat said.
REFORMS LAG
Oman will be the Gulf's worst performing economy over the next two years, with gross domestic product growth forecast at 0.5% this year and 0.8% in 2021, according to Jason Tuvey, senior emerging markets economist at Capital Economics.
This year, it plans to raise over $5 billion in debt to partly cover some $6.5 billion of estimated deficit, equivalent to 8% of GDP.
It will cover the rest of the deficit by drawing from reserves, already eroded in recent years at a pace which has raised concerns over the sustainability of the Omani rial's peg to the U.S. dollar.
Fiscal slippage could occur in Haitham's first year, when spending tends to increase, said Carla Slim, economist at  Standard Chartered  (LON:STAN).
But his ascension ""could act as a catalyst for the pace of reform and medium-term fiscal planning"", she said.
Oman has delayed bringing in a 5% value added tax from 2019 to 2021, and economic diversification has lagged, with oil and gas still accounting for over 70% of government revenues."

(Reuters) - Puerto Rican bees are abandoning hives as weeks of earthquakes disrupt colonies, experts said, raising concerns that a subspecies seen as a possible solution to the global bee crisis could take another hit after being decimated by hurricanes in 2017.
Bees have deserted up to 25% of hives in towns like Guayanilla in southern Puerto Rico after hundreds of tremors and a 6.4 magnitude earthquake rattled the area, said Hermes Conde, director of the island's Eastern Apiculture School. The quakes have shifted the position of many hives, confused returning bees and caused destruction inside the wooden boxes, he said.
They have also disrupted beekeepers' normal feeding of hives during winter months as farmers recover from quakes that collapsed hundreds of homes and caused at least one death. Thousands of Puerto Ricans are sleeping outdoors, fearful their houses could collapse in another big aftershock.
As the U.S. territory seeks a disaster declaration from President Donald Trump to increase relief resources, the island's beekeepers are appealing for U.S. donations of ""protein patties"" and other bee food to save their hives.
""Bees are looking for calmer areas, fleeing all the movement in the earthquake zone,"" said Conde, who has lost 10 of his 50 hives in Guayanilla and fears more may go if quakes continue.
Puerto Rico's hardy, productive bees are the descendants of Africanized bees. They are seen as a possible substitute for western honey bees that have died off in unprecedented numbers due to so-called colony collapse disorder (CCD).
Scientists say Puerto Rico's bees are less susceptible to parasites blamed for CCD, a phenomenon which has caused economic losses worldwide in crops that depend on western honey bees for pollination.
Around 85% of Puerto Rico's bees were wiped out by Hurricane Maria in 2017, which killed about 3,000 people on the Caribbean island. The bee population has since recovered to around 60% of its former size, according to Conde.
Bee expert Tugrul Giray, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, said the principal reason bees were abandoning hives was likely a lack of food as beekeepers tended to other priorities in their lives.
But he said bees hated vibration, and the repeated tremors and earthquakes since Dec. 28 had caused them to become less docile and leave nests.
""Puerto Rico's beekeepers need special help right now,"" said Giray, warning locals to take care when encountering the island's stressed-out bees."
892,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>",Meghan could face father in London court over publication of letter,"LONDON (Reuters) - A British newspaper which is being sued by Meghan, Britain's Duchess of Sussex, will use evidence from her father Thomas Markle, in a court battle over its publication of a private letter from the royal to him, it has said in legal documents.
Last October, Meghan began legal action against the Mail on Sunday tabloid with her lawyers describing the publication of her letter as part of a ""campaign by this media group to publish false and deliberately derogatory stories about her, as well as her husband"".
In a statement at the time, husband Prince Harry called the coverage of his wife by the British press ""bullying"", likening it to the hounding his mother Princess Diana had suffered before her death in a Paris car crash in 1997.
The couple said the Mail on Sunday had printed articles based on a private and confidential letter to her father, in breach of her human rights and copyright, accusations the paper rejected saying her royal position meant the stories were valid.
""There is a huge and legitimate public interest in the royal family and the activities, conduct and standards of behavior of its members,"" lawyers for the paper said in documents submitted to London's High Court this week.
""This extends not merely to their public conduct, but to their personal and family relationships because those are integral to the proper functioning of the monarchy.""
The Daily Mail reported on Wednesday that Markle was prepared to testify against her. A spokeswoman for Harry and Meghan was not immediately available for comment.
The disclosure comes after 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth reluctantly agreed on Monday to grandson Harry and Meghan's request to step back from their senior royal roles, and allow them to split their time between Canada and Britain and become financially independent. 
Meghan, who is currently in Canada with the couple's baby son Archie, made her first public appearance since that decision at a woman's center in Vancouver on Tuesday. 
Her father became the focus of huge media attention in the run-up to Meghan and Harry's star-studded 2018 wedding at the queen's home Windsor Castle. 
The former lighting director for U.S. TV soaps and sitcoms pulled out days beforehand after undergoing heart surgery and it also emerged that he had staged photos with a paparazzi photographer. He has since given a number of interviews to British tabloids, saying he had been ignored by his daughter.
In its 44-page defense, the newspaper said that unnamed friends of Meghan had put her version of events in interviews with the U.S. magazine People and Markle had the right to put his side.

""Thomas Markle had a weighty right to tell his version of what had happened between himself and his daughter including the contents of the Letter,"" the Mail's defense said.

The explosion in Tarragona a day earlier left another eight injured, rescue officials said, and the fire continued to burn on Wednesday.
While the blaze has been brought under control, local authorities said on Twitter they had yet to identify the second victim: ""There is structural risk in the area and work is being done to stabilize the area and safely reach the victim.""
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's office said he was in touch with Catalan authorities and that Madrid was ready to ""provide the necessary support due to this serious event, which has caused several injuries and substantial material damage.""
The plant is operated by petrochemicals firm Industrias Quimicas del Oxido de Etileno (IQOXE), a producer of ethylene oxide, a highly flammable gas used to make, among other things, ethylene glycol used in computers and vehicles.
An employee of IQOXE, which is owned by Spain's CL Grupo Industrial SA, declined to comment when contacted by phone on Wednesday.

Until now, migration issues were managed by a department of the country's Civil Protection Ministry.
The new conservative government, elected in July, announced plans to shut overcrowded refugee camps on Greek islands and replace them with more restrictive holding centers, mostly on the mainland.
It has promised to deploy more border guards to ""shut the door"" to migrants not entitled to stay.
""What is needed is a faster implementation of this plan,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas told state TV ERT.
The government appointed deputy Labour Social Affairs Minister Notis Mitarachi as head of the new Ministry of Migration and Asylum."

MAPUTO (Reuters) - Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi was sworn in on Wednesday at a ceremony attended by cheering supporters and dignitaries, but boycotted by opposition politicians who dispute his October election win as fraudulent.
After a civil war that killed around 1 million people before a 1992 truce, and periodic violence since, Nyusi signed a deal with rebels-turned-opposition party Renamo in August meant to bring definitive peace to a country on the cusp of becoming a global gas exporter.
Instead, October's election exacerbated decades-old wounds: Nyusi, of the ruling Frelimo party, won with over 70% of votes but his main rival Ossufo Momade said the poll was rigged.
Neither Momade nor any Renamo lawmakers turned up for the swearing-in at Independence Square (NYSE:SQ) in central Maputo.
Speaking after the ceremony, Nyusi said over his next five-year term he would seek to ensure peace lasts. ""Peace has been and will be our absolute priority,"" he told the crowd.
Renamo secretary general Andre Magibire told Reuters the party does not recognize Nyusi as legitimate leader, but would also not be drawn back into violence.
""There's no way we can derail the peace deal, even though Frelimo keeps pushing us toward war,"" he said on Tuesday.
Frelimo spokesman Caifadine Manasse dismissed that.
""The opposition is crying foul, in general it uses this tactic to spark instability,"" the spokesman said.
Renamo is fracturing. A breakaway group of former fighters have been staging attacks in former heartlands.
This low-level fighting threatens to draw resources away from efforts to tackle a festering Islamist insurgency in the north, on the doorstep of blockbuster gas projects led by Exxon (NYSE:XOM) and Total.
Mozambique's top court dismissed Renamo's challenge against the results in November.
While analysts say the August peace deal is likely to survive, its implementation has stalled amid infighting, with even some in Renamo's political wing believing the party has backed down too easily. Some are agitating for protests or even violence, said a party lawmaker who asked not to be named, though he added there was still party discipline.
After such a wipe-out in the official election result, Momade's time as party leader seems limited, said Alex Vines, head of Africa program at the Chatham House thinktank.
Contenders for the job would include an ""ambitious bunch"" from a faction of Renamo's political wing, some of whom have been accused of encouraging attacks from the former fighters, he said.
Momade's relationship with Nyusi was central to sealing the peace pact, and his leadership remains important for the ongoing process, Vines said. But the group of disgruntled former fighters - and some Maputo-based politicians - want him to resign."

Der Spiegel magazine, which first reported the raids, said one of the three suspects was a German national who until 2017 had worked as a senior diplomat for the European Union's foreign service, including multiple stints as an EU ambassador.
The case is the first in recent years involving concrete allegations of spying by China against Germany and the EU. It comes amid growing concern across Europe and the broader West at China's ramping up of its worldwide spying activity as it builds political influence to match its economic weight.
Germany and other European countries are under pressure from Washington to exclude China's state-owned telecoms equipment maker Huawei from tenders to build fifth generation mobile telephony networks.
""I can confirm that we are carrying out an investigation into intelligence agent activity,"" said Markus Schmitt, spokesman for German federal prosecutors. None of the suspects had been arrested, he said.
Raids were conducted in Brussels, Berlin and the two southern states of Baden-Wuerttemberg and Bavaria, the main centers for Germany's advanced manufacturing industries.
Der Spiegel reported that the former diplomat had held a string of senior posts in the EU's foreign service. On leaving the EU civil service he had set up as a lobbyist, the magazine reported.
He is also believed to have visited China in the company of his handling officer. Prosecutors declined to confirm the identity or professions of the three suspects."
897,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 05:23AM ET</span>",Displaced and scared: Yemenis still in limbo after almost five years of war,"By Adel Al-Khadhir and Ahmed al-Ansi
KHAMIR, Yemen (Reuters) - Widow Samirah Nasser and her eight children tried to return to their Yemeni village but were forced by relentless air strikes to return to the relative safety of a refugee camp.
Shivering through yet another camp winter, she is one of 3.6 million Yemenis - around 12% of the population - displaced during a nearly five-year war that has spawned what the United Nations says is the world's most urgent humanitarian crisis. 
""When we returned (to our village), planes were in the sky. They hit the market full of kids,"" Nasser said. ""I banned the children from going to school, fearing the warplanes."" 
The air strikes have deterred Nasser over the past three years from attempting another return to her native region of Saada, heartland of the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that has been battling a Saudi-led military coalition since March 2015.
""The war there does not stop. Our houses are destroyed, we don't have anywhere to stay, nothing,"" said Houriya Muhammad, a 40-year-old mother-of-three also unable to return to Saada, where she used to sell pots.
Both women now live in a refugee camp in Khamir, some 2.5 hours by road from the capital Sanaa. Life is very hard in the camps, where facilities are rudimentary.
""We are dying of the cold,"" said Muhammad. ""My kids and I sleep wedged together with three or four blankets on us.""
Children, with runny noses, warm themselves near open fires. Water leaks through holes in the makeshift tents.
The war in Yemen pits the Saudi-led coalition, backed by the West, against the Iran-aligned Houthis, who still control Sanaa and other major urban centers.
More than 100,000 people have been killed in the conflict, which has crippled basic services and infrastructure and ravaged the economy. More than 11 million people struggle to find enough food, and 240,000 people are living in famine-like conditions, according to The World Food Programme (WFP).
IMPROVEMENTS
Nor are the refugee camps as safe as aid organizations would want.
""Fighting is taking place less than 10 kilometers (six miles) from some of the main camps,"" said Sultana Begum of the Norwegian Refugee Council.
People trying to reach safety can be hampered either by Yemen's mountainous terrain or a lack of money and identification papers, Begum said.
Yemenis continue to be displaced from fresh conflict areas, with almost 400,000 people driven from their homes in 2019.
But it is not all bad news. Food security has improved over the past year and the WFP now feeds 12 million people a month.
Diplomatic initiatives have led to a decrease in air strikes in recent months and a semblance of normality has returned to some larger cities.
""We can sleep and our children can go to school without fear,"" said Abd Rahman Shouei, 28, a resident of the major port city of Hodeidah who ekes out a living by washing cars.
""True, there is no work, roads are closed and we have no electricity, but the situation in Hodeidah is better now because there is no fighting or bombing.""
Hodeidah is the entry point for most of Yemen's imports and a lifeline for millions. A truce in the Houthi-held city has largely held for more than a year, though a withdrawal of troops agreed last year has stalled and there are intermittent clashes.
In another flashpoint city, the port of Aden, residents also report some modest improvements in daily life despite continued tensions between Yemen's internationally recognized government and southern separatists.
""Electricity has improved, but water and sewage still fill the streets,"" said Muhammad Omar a 56-year old government worker. ""We live in a state of neither war nor peace.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - An Australian student who was briefly detained in North Korea last year over spy charges said he had been kidnapped by secret police and forced to make a false confession, according to an article written by him and seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
Alek Sigley was held for nine days from June 25 while studying for a postgraduate degree in modern Korean literature at the prestigious Kim Il-sung University in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital.
He was expelled from the country after Swedish officials helped broker his release.
North Korean state media KCNA said he had admitted his ""spying acts"" including passing data and photos he collected by utilizing his status as a foreign student to ""anti-state"" media outlets.
Beyond denying that he was a spy and saying he was sad to have lost access to North Korea, Sigley has not previously publicized details of his detention.
In his first-hand account carried by a South Korea magazine, Sigley said that what appeared to be agents from the Stasi-like State Security Department, known as bowibu, ""kidnapped"" him from his dorm at the university.
""I was innocent but they filed false charges against me,"" he wrote, without elaborating.
""They endlessly tried to teach me some kind of lessons by forcing me to make a written confession which was a concoction of fabricated evidence and crimes and illogical legal reasonings.""
Sigley said on Twitter on Wednesday he had avoided speaking directly to the media in favor of telling his story ""in my own words"".
The article was printed in North Korea Monthly, published by the Seoul-based North Korea Research Institute, and included stories from his childhood and details about the lives of international students in North Korea.
During his detention, Sigley said he had ""no idea"" when he would be released because he was ""completely cut off"" from the outside world, while Australian officials were scrambling to secure his freedom with other countries.
""They succeeded in teaching me one lesson: the falsehood of the North Korean legal system,"" he said.
During his time in North Korea, Sigley had published articles about daily life for NK News and other specialized websites.
The treatment of foreign citizens by the secretive North has sometimes become a geopolitical issue.
The death of American student Otto Warmbier in 2017 following his 17-month detention in North Korea lead to a spike in tensions between Washington and Pyongyang.
Warmbier was detained in 2016 and sentenced to 15 years of forced labor after being accused of trying to steal a propaganda poster in his hotel. He was returned to the United States in a coma and died soon after.
North Korea, heavily sanctioned over its nuclear weapons and missile programs, has expressed frustration at stalled denuclearization talks with the United States.
U.S. officials say North Korea must take more concrete steps to dismantle its weapons programs before sanctions can be eased."

The outbreak comes ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays in late January, when many of China's 1.4 billion people will be traveling to their home towns or abroad. The World Health Organization and Chinese authorities are taking steps to ensure the disease does not spread further.
WHO has said there may have been limited human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus in China within families. [L8N29J2O2]
And authorities in Wuhan confirmed on Wednesday that a married couple were among 41 people diagnosed with pneumonia believed to be caused by the new virus.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission did not say in the statement whether the couple represented an instance of human-to-human transmission. But it said the husband, who worked at a seafood market suspected of being at the epicenter of the outbreak, was the first to fall ill, and that his wife did not have any exposure to the market.
Some of the other people diagnosed also denied visiting the market, the commission said.
The authorities in Wuhan also confirmed that a Chinese woman quarantined in Thailand, the first case of the mystery strain of coronavirus to be detected outside of China, had come from Wuhan.
The State Department's notice referred to an alert by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging citizens in China traveling to Wuhan to avoid contact with animals, animal markets or animal products, among other precautions.
It also asked citizens those who had visited Wuhan and feel sick to seek medical care."

TAGAYTAY, Philippines (Reuters) - Farmer Jack Imperial woke to a picture of devastation after ash spewed from a volcano in the Philippines - his verdant green pineapple field had been transformed to a dirty dark gray.
Imperial said his chances of salvaging produce from his 1-hectare (2.5-acre) farm were small and, in any case, there was no one to sell them to with tourists avoiding the Tagaytay area on the archipelago's biggest island Luzon, 32 km (20 miles) from the Taal volcano.
""We just have to accept that we will incur a loss,"" said Imperial, 49, who had never seen such a sight in 17 years of farming. ""Even if we are able to harvest some pineapples, if customers are scared to come because of the eruption, the pineapples would just end up rotting.""
The impact of the volcano on the $330 billion national economy has been a blip, despite canceled flights and a day of work lost because of a heavy ashfall in the capital Manila, 70 km (45 miles) away, on Sunday.
But for some of the farmers growing pineapples, bananas and coffee nearby it has been a disaster.
Brushing ash from a fruit, Imperial said he feared that the hot ash had harmed his crop and made it inedible. He used to sell his pineapples, in slices, chunks and juice, at a small stall frequented by tourists beside his house.
But the tourists have disappeared and tens of thousands of people have been evacuated from a danger zone around Taal.
The alert level for the volcano stood at 4 on a 5-point scale on Wednesday, indicating that an ""explosive eruption"" remained imminent.
The volcanic ashfall has caused an estimated 578 million pesos (more than $11 million) worth of damage to crops so far, according to agriculture authorities.
Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, with the deadliest eruption killing more than 1,300 people in 1911. A 1754 eruption lasted for months. The last eruption was in 1977.
The Philippines lies on the ""Ring of Fire"", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes."

LONDON (Reuters) - Risks posed by climate change and environmental destruction top the concerns of world decision-makers as they prepare to head to this year's meeting of the global elite in the Swiss mountain resort of Davos, an annual survey found.
For the first time recorded by the report, which is produced by the think tank that runs the event, the top five concerns were all environmental - from extreme weather to biodiversity loss and events like oil spills and radioactive contamination. 
That came as trade wars and the rise of nationalist politics around the world were also cited by the panel of more than 750 experts and decision-makers surveyed as making it harder for countries to work together on solutions.
""The political landscape is polarized, sea levels are rising and climate fires are burning,"" said Borge Brende, President of the World Economic Forum (WEF), urging more collective action. 
This year's Davos, which runs next week, has chosen sustainability as its main theme and comes as campaigners such as Greta Thunberg ramp up pressure on business and governments to act on climate change and other environmental threats.
At the same time, leading economies are behind on pledges to cut carbon emissions made with the 2015 Paris Agreement and activists remain wary of empty promises, pointing to the huge subsidies and private funds still on offer for fossil fuels. 
U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to attend, although some world leaders will skip this year's Davos. New British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told his ministers to avoid an event seen by many as elitist, a source in his office has said.
CARBON NEUTRAL 
In a bid to preempt criticism that its jetset guests are part of the problem, the WEF said this year's Davos would use offsets to be fully carbon neutral, line up more electric vehicles and offer local food and non-meat protein options.
Environmental concerns have been rising up the list of its perceived long-term risks in recent years, a marked change from a decade ago when the West's biggest economies were thrown into recession by the financial crisis. 
The biggest risk that year was seen as a fresh collapse in asset prices, while inequality was the top concern from 2012 to 2014. Immigration loomed large in the 2016 survey as hundreds of thousands of migrants arrived in Europe, fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
Aside from the environment, the 2020 survey highlights concerns about shortfalls in governance of the technology sector, struggling health sectors and doggedly high inequality.
In its methodology for the survey, the WEF said a ""global risk"" was defined as one that could cause major harm to several countries or industries within the next 10 years. 

Two-thirds of the respondees were male, with a majority from Europe and North America and most aged between 40 and 59. For the first time, the survey included results from 200 under-30s around the world identified as future leaders in various fields.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Coastal nations around the Singapore Strait must step up surveillance and patrols of the strategic waterway after a sharp rise in piracy incidents last year, maritime watchdog ReCAAP said on Wednesday.
The number of piracy and armed robbery incidents in the Strait jumped to 31 in 2019, up from seven in 2018 and the highest since 99 in 2015, the group said in a report.
The incidents occurred amid a slight uptick in sea robberies across Asia with 82 total incidents, still the second-lowest since 2007. They were mainly minor cases of scrap metal theft although some did involve knives, machetes and, in one instance, a gun, the group said.
""We would like to ask the littoral states - Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia - to enhance the surveillance and control in the Singapore Strait because of this rapid increase of incidents,"" ReCAAP executive director Masafumi Kuroki said.
ReCAAP has received a number of enquiries from shipping firms expressing concern about the increase, Kuroki said.
Military leaders from Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand will hold talks this week in the city-state to discuss the increase of sea robberies in the Strait and possible measures to disrupt such incidents, Singapore's defense ministry said on Wednesday.
Singapore's Maritime Port Authority said it takes a ""serious view"" of the recent armed robbery incidents and has been broadcasting alerts to vessels to exercise vigilance when traveling along the Strait.
Analysts are divided over whether the rise in incidents pose any threat to Singapore's vital maritime industry.
""The attacks have occurred against a variety of ships and cargoes suggesting that they are opportunistic rather than targeted,"" said Ian Ralby, a maritime crime expert who works with both the United Nations and the U.S.-based think tank Atlantic Council.
""Caution will be heightened and additional measures may be taken, but for geographic, economic and practical reasons, Singapore's stature in maritime commerce will not be damaged."" 
But Bilveer Singh, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore's department of political science, called the rise ""simply unbelievable"" and said it comes at a bad time for Singapore's maritime trade which is already suffering from the U.S.-China trade war and a global economic slowdown.
For now, there has been a limited impact on the industry.
""The cost to the shipping industry of these claims is fairly low,"" said Jack Marriott-Smalley, regional underwriting director at Charles Taylor Mutual Management, an insurance services provider.
""While it will get a quite a few headlines, the impact on the shipping sector won't be that high."" "

The organization's global head, Kenneth Roth, was denied entry on Sunday to Hong Kong where he was expected to launch the report, which covers the global human rights situation but features China prominently.
The report condemns Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims in the Xinjiang region and warns that China's growing political influence and efforts to censor people abroad pose an ""existential threat to the international human rights system."" 
""If not challenged, Beijing's actions portend a dystopian future in which no one is beyond the reach of Chinese censors, and an international human rights system so weakened that it no longer serves as a check on government repression,"" Roth said in the report. 
China last month announced sanctions on HRW and other U.S. nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) as a countermeasure to the U.S. Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act, which supports anti-government protests in Hong Kong and threatens China with sanctions for human rights abuses.
Beijing says the NGOs are encouraging violent crime linked to anti-government protests in Hong Kong that have plagued the city for over six months. Roth rejected the accusation. 
Chinese state media has also broadly blamed fake news and Western interference for landslide victories against pro-Beijing election candidates in Taiwan and Hong Kong. 
On Wednesday U.S. democracy watchdog group Freedom House, which was also hit with sanctions, released a separate report criticizing Beijing's efforts to influence media overseas and calling on governments to impose penalties on Chinese officials.
Geng Shuang, a spokesman for China's foreign ministry, told reporters he would not read either report, adding that both organizations ""distort the truth"" and have no objectivity.
""Currently, China's human rights' situation is the best it's been in history,"" said Geng.
The HRW report, released at the United Nations on Tuesday, said Hong Kong police have used ""excessive force"" and have ""increasingly restricted freedom of assembly"" there. It criticized Hong Kong's pro-Beijing leader Carrie Lam for refusing to launch an independent investigation into police abuses.
TRUMP CREDIBILITY 
Beijing has previously criticized HRW over its investigations on surveillance technology and re-education camps in Xinjiang. The United Nations estimates roughly 1 million Uighurs have been previously detained in Xinjiang.
Beijing denies any mistreatment of Uighurs or others in Xinjiang, saying it is providing vocational training to help stamp out Islamist extremism and separatism and to teach new skills.
China has always been sensitive to rights allegations, but in the past year it has become increasingly forceful in rebuking criticisms, which have periodically threatened to derail trade negotiations with the United States. 
""To avoid criticism of them, the Chinese government is trying with increasing ferocity to use its economic and diplomatic clout to silence critical voices abroad and to undermine global institutions that protect human rights,"" Roth told a news conference at the United Nations. 
When it came to countering China on human rights, Roth said several important governments have been ""missing in action."" 
""(U.S. President Donald) Trump has lost credibility because he so often embraces friendly autocrats, rather than defend the human rights standards that they flout,"" Roth said. 
""The European Union has been diverted by Brexit, it's been obstructed by nationalist members, it's been divided over migration and as a result it's often found it difficult to adopt a strong common voice on human rights,"" he said. ""Other governments are simply bought off (by China.)"" 
Chinese diplomat Xing Jisheng addressed reporters at the end of the news conference, saying China totally rejected the HRW report as prejudiced and fabricated. 

""Hong Kong is a part of China, so given what you said here, I think it is clear to all why you have been barred such entry,"" Xing told Roth.

More than 730,000 Rohingya fled the Southeast Asian nation to Bangladesh in 2017 after a military-led crackdown. The United Nations has said the campaign was executed with ""genocidal intent"" and included mass killings and rape.
The military offensive has sparked a series of ongoing legal cases filed in recent months at courts across the globe, including the International Criminal Court (ICC) and the International Court of Justice (ICJ), both based in the Hague.
Zaw Min Htut, vice president of an advocacy group, Burmese Rohingya Association in Japan, said the ambassador's remarks were ""disturbing"".
""I am very disappointed and appealing again to the Japanese government. Please try to help Rohingya people and don't side with criminals,"" Zaw Min Htut told foreign correspondents in Tokyo.
""Today the Japanese government do not even cooperate, not supporting U.N. actions on Myanmar,"" he said.
His group supports about 250 Rohingya based in Japan.
Ichiro Maruyama, the Japanese ambassador to Myanmar, told local news website the Irrawaddy in December that he did not think the Myanmar military ""committed genocide or (had the) intent of genocide"". He was previously quoted by the same outlet as saying that potential trade sanctions on Myanmar over the Rohingya crisis would be ""utter nonsense"".
The ICJ, the United Nations' highest court, will issue a decision on a request for emergency measures in a genocide case against Myanmar on Jan. 23, the Gambian Ministry of Justice said on Monday.
The mainly Muslim west African country filed a lawsuit in November, alleging Myanmar was committing ""an ongoing genocide"" against the Rohingya in the western state of Rakhine.
The Myanmar government has strongly disputed that conclusion, categorizing the military operation as a legitimate counter-terrorism response to attacks by Rohingya militants.
Japan's foreign ministry said it was not in a position to comment on the legal case at the ICJ because it is between ""third parties"".
""Ambassador Maruyama did not mean to prejudge findings or judgement of this ICJ case,"" the ministry told Reuters in a statement. ""Rather, he merely expressed impression as a person working in the country, including showing understanding of the complexity of the situations in Rakhine state."""

TOKYO (Reuters) - An Australian man was freed on Wednesday after spending a month and a half detained in Tokyo on charges of trespassing when he went to his estranged in-laws' apartment building to look for his missing children.
The case of Scott McIntyre, a freelance sports journalist based in Tokyo, has drawn wide attention to the difficulties in Japan faced by parents who lose access to their children after their partners take them away.
Lawyers and legal experts say Japan effectively condones the act regardless of whether domestic violence is involved, and parents who are deprived of contact with their children face the threat of arrest if they try to retrieve or see them.
McIntyre was arrested on Nov. 28 for entering the common area of the building where his wife's parents live in late October in a bid to find his children.
He was released on bail last Friday after pleading guilty to the charges, and on Wednesday was given a prison sentence of six months suspended for three years.
Japan's judicial system has drawn global attention with the lengthy detention - and subsequent fleeing - of former auto executive Carlos Ghosn in what critics have characterized as a ""hostage justice"" system that relies on drawing out confessions. Ghosn has said Japan's justice system was ""rigged"".
""It's now 238 days since I've heard from or seen my children,"" McIntyre said at his hearing last week, choking back tears. ""I have no idea whether my children are dead or alive, and as a parent this causes me unbelievable grief.""
He testified that he had made numerous requests to the police and his wife's lawyers - the two are going through a divorce mediation - to let him know whether the children are safe, but that those were ignored. The day of the illegal entry, he had been worried about his children in the aftermath of a typhoon that ripped through the region, he said.
Why McIntyre's wife left him taking their daughter and son, now aged 11 and 7, was unclear. Prosecutors said she had claimed physical violence by McIntyre towards their daughter, which he denied, and material presented by the prosecution was dismissed as irrelevant to the trespassing charge.
It was also not clear why he was arrested more than a month after the illegal entry, or why he had been detained for so long. An earlier request for bail was denied on grounds that he could destroy evidence or flee the country."

Geng made the comments responding to the reports at a daily news briefing.
In its annual report on Tuesday, New York-based Human Rights Watch condemned Beijing's treatment of Uighur Muslims in the far western region of Xinjiang and warned of China's growing efforts to influence and censor others abroad.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Inter-Korean cooperation doesn't necessarily have to wait for the United States' denuclearization talks with North Korea to progress, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said on Tuesday after meeting her U.S. and Japanese counterparts in California.
""Our basic stance is that North Korea-U.S. talks and inter-Korean dialogue complement each other in a virtuous cycle,"" she told reporters after meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other diplomats in Palo Alto.
Kang said that with U.S.-North Korea talks in stalemate, it is essential to revive ""North Korea's engagement momentum"" through inter-Korean talks.
The meeting came after South Korean President Moon Jae-in said inter-Korean cooperation could help ease the way for sanctions to be lifted on North Korea.
It is unclear whether North Korea would welcome the proposed steps.
Pyongyang has spent the last year criticizing South Korea and has said it plans to demolish a tourist facility at Mount Kumgang, once seen as an example of inter-Korean cooperation.
South Korea suspended tours to the mountain in 2008 after a 53-year-old South Korean tourist was shot and killed when she entered an off-limits area.
Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman Kim Eun-han told a briefing on Wednesday that South Korea is actively considering starting ""individual tours"" to North Korea if they secure guarantees of tourist safety from Pyongyang.
""We understand individual tours are not bounded by the U.N. sanctions,"" he said.
""There are issues regarding inter-Korean cooperation that need discussions between South Korea and the United States, but also areas in which South Korea can proceed with independently,"" Kim said.
Unification Minister Kim Yeon-chul told a private gathering in Seoul on Tuesday that the South Korean government will do what it can to mend ties with Pyongyang this year rather than waiting for North Korea's relations with the United States to improve.
The U.S. State Department has said Washington and Seoul are committed to a unified response to North Korea.
Denuclearization talks are stalled amid North Korean demands for more concessions, and U.S. assertions that Pyongyang must take more concrete steps toward giving up its nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Kang also said Pompeo repeated a request for South Korea to deploy military resources to a U.S.-led naval force in the Middle East, with the U.S. secretary arguing nations that have ""economic stakes"" with the region should contribute.
South Korea has not committed to sending troops but Kang said Seoul would ""explore how to contribute."""

CHIAYI, Taiwan (Reuters) - An alarm sounds and the pilots rush to their jets, sitting at the ready under a hardened shelter in the warm winter sun of southern Taiwan. 
Their scramble into the air was only a drill before an audience of journalists. But for Taiwan's Air Force and its most advanced fighters, the newly upgraded F-16V, the threat from China across the narrow Taiwan Strait is very real. 
Surrounded by farmland near the coast, the Chiayi air base is Taiwan's first to be equipped with F-16Vs, which carry upgraded radars, avionics and will eventually field new air-to-air missiles. 
Chiayi's F-16 pilots are on call around the clock to see off the Chinese jets that regularly try to probe the airspace of the democratic island China claims as its territory, to be taken by force if needed. 
""If anything happens and we're needed, we can scramble,"" said pilot Yen Hsiang-sheng, 33, a lieutenant colonel who did his flight training at Luke Air Force base in the United states. 
Yen has intercepted Chinese H-6 bombers and J-11 fighters, and said he is confident in Taiwan's defense forces. 
""I believe that our performance can match the abilities of the mainland's newest J-10 and J-11 fighters,"" Yen said. 
China has sent about 2,000 bomber patrols a year to the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan Defence Minister Yen Teh-fa told parliament in November. 
President Tsai Ing-wen, re-elected in a landslide on Saturday after promising to stand up to China's threats, has made strengthening Taiwan's defenses a top priority, including boosting its domestic defense industry so it can make high-tech equipment like submarines. 
Taiwan's air force, though well trained, is dwarfed by that of China, which is adding stealth fighters and whose bombers have flown regular drills around the island since 2016, when Tsai first took office. 
China has not so far flexed its military muscles in response to the vote, but state media has suggested it is an option. 
The Chiayi F-16s fly regular patrols over the Taiwan Strait, sometimes skimming so low that they have to be washed when they return to remove the salt spray and prevent corrosion.
Due to Chinese pressure and Taiwan's diplomatic isolation, the United States is the only major country that sells the island weapons, and is indeed bound by law to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. 
Last year the United States approved an $8 billion sale of 66 new  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) F-16 fighters and 75  General Electric  (NYSE:GE) Co engines, as well as other systems. 

Taiwan is also upgrading its existing 144 F-16 A/B jets into the more advanced F-16V variant. That is expected to be complete by 2022. About 15 are already in service at Chiayi.

910,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 02:31AM ET</span>","In India, a firebrand's anti-Modi mantra resonates at nationwide protests","By Rupam Jain and Anushree Fadnavis
MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Standing on a stage in the center of one of India's most prestigious universities, the firebrand politician looked out at the cheering supporters before him and issued a sharp challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
""The idea of India is under threat,"" said Kanhaiya Kumar, a leftist politician from the northeastern state of Bihar, his voice rising in the cold evening air. ""We will not stop. Let the government use force. Let them bring the police."" He paused. ""We will rise to prove them wrong. Listen, Modi!""
""Freedom!"" the crowd chanted after each line Kumar barked from the stage, jabbing his hand in the air for emphasis and occasionally fingering the red scarf slung around his neck.
The 33-year-old Bihari politician has emerged in recent weeks as a major irritant and political challenge to Modi, a Hindu nationalist who has faced escalating protests over a citizenship law he introduced in December. Critics say the law, the Citizenship Amendment Act, marginalizes India's Muslim minority and undermines the country's secular ethos.
There is no single leader in the protests, which are sweeping university campuses and which some students say are inspired by the leaderless anti-government protests in Hong Kong. But a recording of Kumar's ""Freedom"" anthem is played at almost all of them, with the crowds joining in for the chorus.
Modi has won back-to-back national elections with strong majorities, and the Communist Party of India faction that Kumar leads has little clout nationally. But a senior aide to the prime minister says the government is worried that his prominence and messaging could undermine Modi's policies and weaken him politically.
Kumar's message has largely focused on accusations that Modi has failed to address rising unemployment and create jobs for millions of young Indians, and that his hardline pro-Hindu policies are undermining the country's secular identity and making life difficult for minorities like Muslims.
When asked about his policies in a telephone interview with Reuters, Kumar declined to make ""political promises"" beyond pledging to uphold the constitution, saying his main aim was to hold the government to account.
""Let us not forget Modi has used religion to accentuate the fault lines, and he has failed to create jobs. I don't want anyone to forget this,"" said Kumar.
OPPOSITION SUPPORT
While analysts say that Kumar's rise does not immediately threaten Modi, it could provide a basis for a resurgence of the opposition parties that were trounced by the prime minister's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the national elections in May.
Several political parties, including the main opposition Congress party, have tried to enlist Kumar to their camps, but he has so far been non-committal.
""His presence widens the scope for the fragmented opposition to unite in the near term to dent Modi's governing style,"" said Sanjay Kumar, director of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, an independent research institute in Delhi. 
Kanhaiya Kumar's speech at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), which has been rocked repeatedly by clashes between opponents and proponents of the new law, attracted hundreds of supporters on Jan 7.
But his words have resonated far beyond the gates of JNU’s leafy campus.
Kumar's speeches are watched avidly by his supporters – he has about 2 million YouTube subscribers and a million Twitter followers – and his anti-Modi slogans are chanted at protests across the country.
While he has been a well-known critic of the Modi government for several years, the recent protests have put him at center stage in the fragmented and weakened political opposition. 
""Kumar is unique and forces everyone to think and question. He has been able to fill the gap created by absence of opposition,"" said Sanjay Kumar of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.
COMMON ROOTS
While they are separated in age by almost four decades, Kumar has much in common with Modi, who is 69. Both come from humble backgrounds, are skilful orators and are firmly committed to their political ideologies. 
Modi is the son of a roadside tea seller; Kumar's father was a farmer and his mother works for a rural childcare center in Bihar, one of the most populous but also poorest states in India. Kumar did well at school, and was able to attend university in Patna, the state capital, where he studied geography and got involved in student politics. 
He was later admitted to JNU, which has a reputation for leftist politics, and earned a doctorate in African studies and became president of the student council.
It was also at JNU that Kumar first shot to national prominence. In 2016, he was arrested at an on-campus rally and charged with sedition for allegedly shouting anti-India slogans. 
In an interview with Reuters, Kumar denied the charges and said Modi government's was trying to muzzle dissent. The courts have yet to begin hearing in the case.
""My critical thinking and ability to question Modi's hard-line Hindu policies have scared the government since 2016,"" Kumar said. ""Now, I am not alone. More and more people are joining our movement against Modi.""
Kumar ran for a parliamentary seat from Bihar in the national elections in 2019, but was defeated by a candidate from the BJP, which is allied with the socialist party that dominates the politics of the state.
Since then, he has been traveling across India to spread his political views and mobilize grassroots followers. 
Kumar's appeal to young and first-time voters has worried Modi, the aide to the prime minister said on condition of anonymity. ""We watch him closely,"" he said.
The government was also closely tracking Kumar's personal life and his funding, the aide said, without elaborating.
The prime minister's office and the Home Ministry did not respond to repeated requests from Reuters for comment on Kumar.
SUPPORTING SECULARISM
Protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act have raged across India since December. At least 25 people have died and thousands of protesters have been arrested. The new law eases the path for people from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain Indian citizenship, but only non-Muslims. 
Critics fear the new law will be used to discriminate against Muslims in India, one of many measures issued by Modi's Hindu nationalist government that they fear is chipping away at India's secular constitution.
Modi's government maintains that the new law is necessary to help minorities facing persecution in Muslim-majority nations, and it has called the pan-India protests politically motivated. 
But Kumar said the protests were just one part of a larger drive to protect India's secular identity, which is guaranteed by the constitution.
Modi's critics say they are growing increasingly uneasy with his Hindu agenda, which appears to have gained emphasis since he was re-elected in May. 
In November, a Supreme Court decision handed Hindu groups control of a contested site where a 16th-century mosque was razed by Hindu zealots in 1992. In August, the government stripped the Muslim-majority state of Jammu and Kashmir of its special status and split it into two federally administered regions.

""The essence of India is at stake like never before,"" said Kumar.

911,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 15, 2020 01:13AM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.N. sanctions experts warn - stay away from North Korea cryptocurrency conference,"By Michelle Nichols
UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - United Nations sanctions experts are warning people not to attend a cryptocurrency conference in North Korea in February, flagging it as a likely sanctions violation, according to a confidential report due to be submitted to the U.N. Security Council later this month.
The warning comes after the independent U.N. experts told the council in August that North Korea generated an estimated $2 billion for its weapons of mass destruction programs using ""widespread and increasingly sophisticated"" cyberattacks to steal from banks and cryptocurrency exchanges.
North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs. The 15-member Security Council has unanimously strengthened those measures over the years, prompting Pyongyang to look for alternative ways to make money.
In April last year, North Korea held its first blockchain and cryptocurrency conference and an organizer told Reuters more than 80 organizations took part. An American who attended has been charged with violating U.S. sanctions.
The next conference is due to be held from Feb. 22-29, according to its website.
An excerpt from the upcoming annual report by the U.N. sanctions experts, seen by Reuters, warns that presentations at the conference ""have included explicit discussions of cryptocurrency for sanctions evasion and money laundering.""
It then spells out that U.N. sanctions require countries to prevent the provision of ""financial transactions, technical training, advice, services or assistance"" if they believe it could be contributing to North Korea's nuclear or ballistic missile programs or to the evasion of sanctions.
The full report is due to be submitted to the U.N. Security Council North Korea sanctions committee later this month.
North Korea's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
'NO EVIDENCE OF ENTRY'
A British government spokesman and a Security Council diplomat from another country, speaking on condition of anonymity, both said North Korea's cyber program was used to collect information, evade sanctions and generate revenue.
""Supporting the DPRK's use of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, risks violating the Security Council's resolutions because it would unavoidably increase the DPRK's ability to subvert sanctions and generate revenue for its weapons programs,"" the British spokesman said, citing North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
The United States formally charged American digital currency expert Virgil Griffith last week after he attended the North Korean cryptocurrency conference last year. Prosecutors accuse him of providing services to North Korea without U.S. approval and evading U.S. laws.
When Griffith - who has a doctorate from the California Institute of Technology - was arrested in November, prosecutors said he and other conference attendees had discussed how cryptocurrency technology could be used by Pyongyang to launder money and evade sanctions.
""Although the press was not allowed to attend the conference and its proceedings were not published openly, the recent indictment of an American for sanctions violations sheds light on the intended purpose of the conference,"" the U.N. sanctions experts wrote in the excerpt from the upcoming report.
U.S. prosecutors said Griffith had been encouraging other U.S. citizens to attend next month's conference in North Korea.
The conference website specifically notes that Americans are welcome to apply to attend and that their passports would not be stamped ""so there will be no evidence of your entry to the country.""
Cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin and ether, are created through a computer process called mining, which requires powerful hardware. Once generated, they can be exchanged on anonymous online platforms for fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, which in turn can help illicit activities like evading sanctions or laundering money.
Blockchain technology is a digital ledger that forms the backbone of many cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Three years ago, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, then Treasurer, brandished a lump of coal in parliament as a totem of how the ruling conservative coalition planned to keep the lights on and power prices low. 
Now, with the country experiencing one of its worst ever bushfire seasons and facing criticism for his pro-coal policies, Morrison is acknowledging climate change is real. He is also talking about ""adaptation"" and ""resilience"".
""I think we want to have a high level of confidence that as a nation we are improving our resilience and our adaptation to respond to the reality of the environment in which we live,"" Morrison told reporters in Canberra on Wednesday.
Australia's Science Minister Karen Andrews told the Sydney Morning Herald in an interview that climate denial was a waste of time, as she echoed Morrison's ""adaptation"" mantra.
As bushfires tore through New South Wales state in December, Morrison avoided drawing a link between the unusually early and ferocious fire season and climate change, saying the time was not right for such discussions. Just last week he said Sydney radio 2GB it was disappointing that people were conflating the bushfire crisis with Australia's emission reduction targets.
While the softening of his stance is significant, scepticism remains over whether it will translate to a stronger climate policy as large swathes of the country continue to burn.
""It's much overdue for the government to seriously engage on climate change adaptation,"" said Frank Jotzo, a professor at the Australian National University's Crawford School of Public Policy.
""But what also needs to happen is for the Australian government to take a proactive stance on climate mitigation, that is, to reduce green house emissions. And there is still no clear signs that's about to happen.""
Blazes burning since September have claimed the lives of 28 people, killed more than a billion animals and ripped through forests and farmland the size of Bulgaria.
The hazy skies in Australia's major cities have become a common occurrence, denting the country's clean and green image, hurting tourism and consumer sentiment. 
KING COAL
The mood in the country is also changing. 
A poll from the Australia Institute on Wednesday showed the country's bushfire crisis has intensified concerns about climate change with almost seven in 10 Australians wanting the government to lead on climate action.
Morrison, whose popularity has sunk to its lowest levels since he took over leadership in 2018 over the government's bushfire response, continues to espouse the merits of coal.
""Our resources industry is incredibly important to Australia,"" he reiterated on Wednesday, adding coal ""is worth A$70 billion ($48.3 billion) to Australia and it is important to communities across the country.""
Mining jobs account for just under 2% of all employment in the country, miniscule in comparison with construction, retail, healthcare and tourism-related sectors.
Morrison repeated his government will ""meet and beat"" a 26% global emissions reduction target agreed in Paris, ""without putting taxes on people, putting up electricity prices and pulling out the rugs from regional communities who depend on the sector for their livelihoods.""
Academics and climate scientists say 26% is a lowball reductions target especially if as planned Australia uses its old carbon credits from the 1992 Kyoto Protocol - another sore point for activists.
Australia’s reliance on coal-fired power makes it one of the world’s largest carbon emitters per capita and last year it approved a huge new coal mine by India's Adani Enterprises.
U.S. climatologist and geophysicist Michael Mann told Reuters that Morrison's position was ""ridiculous"".
""If we continue to warm the planet, then we will in all likelihood exceed our adaptive capacity,"" he said in an email.
""In other words, there is no amount of adaptation that will allow Australians to contend with the impacts of climate change if we allow for a further escalation of the problem.""
In fact, Mann said, Australia could become so hot and dry that its residents could join the ranks of the world's ""climate refugees.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A major reform of Mexico's criminal justice system would allow private communications to be used as evidence and limit legal challenges to avoid extradition delays for criminal suspects, according to a reform draft reviewed by Reuters on Tuesday.
It would also permit the Mexican penal code to be extended to crimes committed outside the country if the wrong-doing causes harm in Mexico or to Mexicans, as the government scrambles to address growing insecurity nationwide.

""When Chinese diplomats and security agents overstep their bounds and attempt to interfere with media reporting in other countries, the host government should vigorously protest,"" it said in a report, adding that such officials could also be expelled.
It also said the United States and other governments should support policies that require Chinese media to disclose spending on paid advertorials, ownership structures, and other economic ties to Chinese state actors.
In recent years, Chinese state media and private internet companies have invested heavily overseas, prompting concern from lawmakers and rights groups that Beijing could remotely curtail criticism and expand its sphere of influence.
""While some aspects of this effort are in line with
traditional public diplomacy, many others are covert, coercive, and potentially corrupt,"" said Freedom House, which is mainly financed by the U.S. government.
China has previously denied the accusations and has in turn criticized foreign social media companies for curtailing the voices of people who are supportive of the Chinese government.
Twitter and Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said in August they had dismantled a network of accounts that appeared to be part of a state-backed coordinated effort to undermine the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.
Freedom House was among several U.S. NGOs sanctioned by China in December over what Beijing says are efforts to interfere in its internal affairs.

SANTO TOMAS, Philippines (Reuters) - The fine ash drifting into the school gym on gusts of wind is a constant reminder for evacuees in the Philippines of the volcano that threatens to bury their homes forever.
As they sit in the spaces fenced in by the few bags and boxes of belongings they could carry, evacuees wonder how long they will have to wait to know whether Taal volcano will devastate the region or sputter back to sleep.
""It's all in God's hands now. We are not sure if we will have a home to return to,"" said Leonita Gonzales, 52, who fled with the rest of her household from the danger zone around Taal.
Her banana palms were destroyed by the ash that fell after the volcano started to gush smoke on Sunday. She is uncertain whether her home's tin roof will be able to bear the weight either.
Nearly 44,000 people have fled the 14km (nine mile) danger zone around Taal, where volcanologists have warned a devastating eruption could rain rocks and magma and set off a tsunami from the lake in which the volcano sits.
On Tuesday, more than 1,100 evacuees packed into the gym and classrooms at the state university at the Santo Tomas town, some 20 km (12 miles) northeast of where Taal continues to puff clouds of ash and steam through old and new fissures.
Occasional tremors signaled the forces rumbling beneath the earth and set hearts pounding.
""Don't tell me you're brave. When disaster strikes, you will call on all saints, big or small,"" said Obet Dionglay, 61, who had trekked through roads deep with ash to seek refuge.
CRUSHED
Dionglay's hut had been crushed by bamboos bent to the ground by the weight of the ash and he had little hope that his three pigs and dozen chickens would survive.
Dionglay recalled Taal's last eruption in 1977, when his hometown of Talisay had escaped largely unscathed.
Although Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes only 311 meters (1,020-foot) high, it can be deadly: an eruption killed more than 1,300 people in 1911.
At the evacuation center, a couple of dozen kids kept busy with an impromptu dance class. 
A delivery of water gave some people a chance to wash the grit from their bodies for the first time in days, but many complained of a lack of sleeping mats, blankets, toiletries and face masks despite generous private donations.

The remarks by Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne were some of the toughest from a Canadian official since the disaster in which 176 people died, 57 of them Canadian. 
Iran, which does not recognize the concept of dual nationality, said last week that only a handful of victims were Canadian, according to officials in Ottawa.
""What I would say is it's nonsense ... we will not accept that position,"" Champagne told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., saying he had raised the matter with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif earlier in the day.
""We have already pushed back and been very, very clear to the Iranian regime that this is not going to hold. I think the world is watching and under the circumstances I would expect, and I demand, that Iran would obviously respect what Canada wants when it comes to its own citizens.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday that Iran's admission it shot down the plane was an important step. Iran has granted visas for a Canadian team of investigators and consular officials.
Iran said on Tuesday it had arrested people accused of a role in shooting down the Ukrainian airliner and promised a thorough investigation.
""We are going to pursue full justice and we are going to make sure first we understand ... who committed this horrible crime and that these people are prosecuted in accordance with the highest standards of the law,"" said Champagne, who did not give details.

Champagne will preside over a meeting of his counterparts from Ukraine, Britain, Afghanistan and Sweden in London on Thursday to discuss their response. Canada has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 2012.

921,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 10:58PM ET</span>",Cambodia begins treason trial of opposition leader as criticism mounts,"By Prak Chan Thul
PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - A Cambodian court convened on Wednesday to begin the trial of opposition party leader Kem Sokha on charges of treason in a case that has drawn condemnation from rights groups as a move by longtime leader Hun Sen to crush political rivals.
Diplomats packed the Phnom Penh Municipal Court as the defendant arrived, and only a few journalists were allowed in to view the proceedings.
It could take up to three months to deliver a verdict, defense lawyers said on Tuesday, meaning the case could still be ongoing by the time the European Union (EU) makes a decision on its trade policy next month on whether to cut Cambodia's preferential trade status over its human rights record.
Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 and his opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party was banned ahead of a 2018 election in which the party of Hun Sen won all the parliamentary seats.
He was freed from house arrest in November but a ban on his engaging in political activity was kept in place.
The treason charges stem from accusations that Kem Sokha was conspiring with the United States to overthrow Hun Sen. He denies the charges, saying they are politically motivated.
Rights groups have decried the case. Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director of New York-based Human Rights Watch, said it was unlikely Kem Sokha would receive a fair trial. 
""Kem Sokha will be the victim of a staged trial on completely bogus treason charges,"" Robertson said. 
""The government should cut their losses by dropping the charges against him, but clearly Prime Minister Hun Sen decided instead to extract the proverbial pound of flesh from Kem Sokha for daring to challenge him.""
Ministry of Justice spokesperson Chin Malin declined to comment on the trial when asked on Tuesday. 
Many other opposition figures have fled into exile and have accused Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for 35 years, of establishing a one-party state. 
The EU, which accounts for nearly half of Cambodia's exports, will decide in February whether or not to remove Cambodia from its Everything But Arms trade scheme over its crackdown on political expression.
The only evidence presented against Kem Sokha in public so far is a comment he made at a public meeting in which he said he was getting advice from unspecified Americans on election strategy ahead of a 2013 ballot.

Kem Sokha's daughter Monovithya Kem called the trial against her father a ""farce"" as rights groups urged the case to be dismissed.

In the early hours of Monday, the president said the mandates of lower house deputies and most senators formally expired because no successors were elected in October after the troubled country failed to hold elections.
Moise argues the situation could break the Caribbean nation's political deadlock after weeks of turmoil, but his critics fear it will undermine a fragile democracy three decades since the end of the Duvalier family dictatorship.
Andre Michel, a politician with the opposition Democratic and Popular Sector, said the country was entering a crisis that would be worse than in 2019, when the impoverished country was racked by violent protests against the government.
""Today we see that Jovenel Moise is devoid of any popular legitimacy,"" Michel told a news conference.
Moise blamed parliament for having failed to approve the electoral law required to hold last year's elections while his opponents accused him of trying to take advantage of the law.
Haiti has had 15 presidents in the past 33 years.
Jean Tholbert Alexis, a former speaker of the Lower House of Congress, said parliament had been undermined.
""It's not good for the rule of law in a country to have all power in the hands of a single office,"" he said on Twitter.
Under Moise's predecessor, Michel Martelly, parliament was dissolved in January 2015 when negotiations for a deal that would have extended lawmakers' mandates failed.
Martelly ruled by decree until the end of his term.
Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas and is still reeling from several natural disasters, including Hurricane Matthew in 2016 and a devastating earthquake in 2010."

""If the bomb was ... thrown at a car, all the people inside the vehicle would definitely die,"" Chan said.
Those arrested were suspected of being members of an anti-government protest group, he said. Three of the men were tertiary students and were also charged with illegal assembly on New Year's day.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's A$50 billion ($35 billion) submarine order with French shipbuilder Naval Group is running nine months late and the defense department cannot show that A$396 million already spent on the contract was effective, according to an audit report.
The submarines are at the center of Australia's plan to expand its military and protect strategic and trade interests in the Asia-Pacific region. The first is due to be delivered in the early 2030s and the final vessel in the 2050s.
Australia's opposition Labor said the delay just one year after the contact was signed was ""deeply concerning"", but Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the program required a long-term focus.
Naval Group, then called DCNS, was named as preferred bidder for the 12-submarine contract in 2016 and signed a production contract in February last year following lengthy negotiations.
""The program is currently experiencing a nine-month delay in the design phase against Defence's pre-design contract estimates, said the report by the independent Australian National Audit Office (ANAO), referring to the Department of Defence.
At the same time, it said two major contracted milestones had been extended.
""As a result, Defence cannot demonstrate that its expenditure of A$396 million on design of the Future Submarine has been fully effective in achieving the program's two major design milestones to date,"" the report added.
The milestones were a ""Concept Studies Review"", the last part of a feasibility study, which was supposed to start in September 2018 before the final contract was signed, and a ""Systems Requirements Review"", which was supposed to be finished by October 2019 but did not start until December that year.
The report said the delays may be ""recoverable"" by the next milestone in January 2021, and the start of construction had not been affected.
""It is deeply concerning that this program is already experiencing a nine-month delay in the design phase,"" said shadow defense minister Richard Males in an email on Wednesday.
""On all three measures of this program – on time of delivery, on the cost of the project, and on the amount of Australian content – the numbers are all going the wrong way.""
However, Reynolds said the program was still in its early design phase and it was essential to get the design right.
""Doing so will reduce costly changes and uncertainties while the Attack class submarines are built,"" she said in a statement."

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran said on Tuesday it had arrested people accused of a role in shooting down a Ukrainian airliner and had also detained 30 people involved in protests that have swept the nation for four days since the military belatedly admitted its error.
Wednesday's downing of Ukraine International Airlines flight 752, which killed all 176 people aboard, has created a new crisis for the Islamic Republic's clerical rulers.
President Hassan Rouhani promised a thorough investigation into the ""unforgivable error"" in an address on Tuesday. It was the latest in a series of apologies by the leadership that has done little to quell public anger.
Britain, France and Germany also increased diplomatic pressure on Iran, launching a dispute mechanism to challenge Tehran for breaching limits on its nuclear program under an agreement which Washington abandoned in 2018.
Tehran has faced an escalating confrontation with the West and a wave of unrest since the United States killed Iran's most powerful military commander in a drone strike on Jan. 3.
Iran shot down the plane on Wednesday when its military was on high alert, hours after firing missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq. It admitted the mistake on Saturday after days of denials.
New security camera footage shows two missiles, fired 30 seconds apart, hitting the plane after takeoff, the New York Times reported on Tuesday.
U.S. intelligence officials said on Jan. 9 that the heat signatures of two surface-to-air missiles were detected near the aircraft. 
In Iraq, a military camp at Taji, north of Baghdad, was hit by Katyusha rockets Tuesday night but no casualties were reported, an Iraqi military statement said.
A person who posted a video online last week of a missile striking the plane has been taken into custody by the elite Revolutionary Guards, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.
Iranian judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said some of those accused of having a role in the plane disaster had been arrested, although he did not say how many or identify them.
Since the official admission, protesters, many of them students, have held daily demonstrations, chanting ""Clerics get lost!"" and calling for the removal of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in power for more than 30 years.
Police have responded to some protests with a violent crackdown, video posts on social media showed, with police beating protesters with batons, wounded people being carried, pools of blood on the streets and the sound of gunfire.
A video that emerged on Tuesday showed an officer using an electric baton to shock a man as he writhed on the ground.
Iran's police have denied firing at protesters and said officers were ordered to act with restraint. The judiciary said 30 people had been detained in the unrest but authorities would show tolerance towards ""legal protests"".
'WHERE IS JUSTICE?'
Protests on Tuesday appeared peaceful, with scores gathering at two Tehran universities. ""Where is justice?"" some shouted.
The extent of the unrest is difficult to assess because of limits on independent reporting. Demonstrations tend to gather momentum into the night.
The domestic unrest triggered by the plane crash comes just two months after the most violent crackdown on protests since the revolution. The authorities killed hundreds of people to put down an uprising in November when demonstrators torched banks and petrol stations.
Adding to international tension, the judiciary spokesman branded Britain's ambassador an ""undesirable element"", after he was briefly detained on Saturday, accused of inciting protests. The ambassador said he had been attending a vigil for victims.
London said it had not been notified of any move to expel its envoy, Rob Macaire, and said such a step would be regrettable. Iran's Foreign Ministry, rather than the judiciary, would be responsible for any decision to expel him.
London hosts a meeting on Thursday of Canada, Ukraine, Britain and other nations who had citizens on the plane. Ukraine said they would consider legal action against Tehran.
Rouhani said the government would be accountable to Iranians and those nations who lost citizens. Most of those on board the flight were Iranians or dual nationals and 57 were Canadian.
Canada's Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne dismissed as ""nonsense"" Tehran's insistence that only a few Canadians died on the plane and demanded full accountability for what it called a horrible crime. 
Iran, which does not recognize the concept of dual nationality said last week that only a handful of victims were Canadian, according to officials in Ottawa.
""We will not accept that position,"" Champagne told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp on Tuesday, saying he had raised the matter with Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif earlier in the day.
A team of Canadian experts joining the investigation visited the crash site on Tuesday, an Iranian news agency reported. It followed a meeting in Tehran between experts from Canada, Ukraine and Iran.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau asked for Kiev's help in talking to Iran about identifying the bodies of the Canadian citizens who were killed, the Ukrainian president's office said.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which operates Interpol's national bureau in Canada, said it was working with Canadian police to collect some DNA samples from Canadian victims' families within Canada to assist with identification.
""Currently no on-site disaster victim identification assistance from Canada is required in Iran,"" RCMP said in a statement.
ESCALATION IN TENSIONS
The shootdown and subsequent unrest comes amid one of the biggest escalations in tensions between Tehran and Washington since 1979.
Missiles launched at a U.S. base in Iraq killed an American contractor in December, an attack Washington blamed on an Iran-backed group. Confrontation eventually led to the U.S. drone strike on Jan. 3 that killed General Qassem Soleimani, architect of Iran's regional network of proxy militias.
Iran's government was already reeling from the reimposition of sanctions by the United States, which quit an agreement with world powers under which Tehran would secure sanctions relief in return for scaling back its nuclear program.
Since Washington withdrew, Tehran has stepped back from its nuclear commitments and has said it would no longer recognize limits on enriching uranium.

After months of threatening to act, European signatories to the deal, France, Britain and Germany, activated the agreement's dispute mechanism on Tuesday. Iran criticized the move and said it wanted constructive steps to save the nuclear deal.

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been trying to encourage more men to take paternity leave as part of his ""Womenomics"" program of bolstering women's employment. But change has been slow.
Some other lawmakers initially criticized Koizumi's interest in taking parental leave, saying he should prioritize his duty to the public as a cabinet minister.
Koizumi, son of charismatic former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi and often seen as a future leader himself, is expected to make an announcement shortly, an environment ministry spokesman said.
Public broadcaster NHK reported that Koizumi would only take about 2 weeks of leave over 3 months.
Japan's parental leave policies are among the world's most generous, providing men and women with partially paid leave of up to a year, or longer if there is no public child care. Policies are even more accommodating for government workers.
But just 6 percent of eligible fathers take child care leave, and most of them for less than a week, according to government data.
That is the 3 percent rate of a few years ago, but far short of the 13 percent target set by the government for 2020.
The telegenic Koizumi, popularly referred to as Shinjiro to distinguish him from his father, was appointed to the high-profile post in September. This was shortly after grabbing headlines with news that he was marrying Christel Takigawa, a French-Japanese television personality.
He has said Japan should eventually get rid of nuclear reactors, but he has also called for a low-carbon future, although he has yet to propose specific policies on how Japan should wean itself from its dependency on coal."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL) jet making an emergency landing at Los Angeles International Airport dumped fuel on the playground of an elementary school in the flight path on Tuesday, inflicting minor injuries on 17 children and nine adults, local and federal authorities said.
All of the injuries at Park Avenue Elementary School in suburban Cudahy were said to be minor and none of the victims needed hospitalization, the Los Angeles County Fire Department said on Twitter.
""Shortly after takeoff, Flight 89 from LAX to Shanghai experienced an engine issue requiring the aircraft to return quickly to LAX. The aircraft landed safely after a release of fuel, which was required as part of normal procedure to reach a safe landing weight,"" Delta said in a written statement.
""We are in touch with Los Angeles World Airports and the L.A. County Fire Department and share concerns regarding reported minor injuries to adults and children at a school in the area,"" the airline said. 
The Federal Aviation Administration said in a separate statement that it was ""thoroughly investigating the circumstances"" behind the incident and suggested the flight may not have followed fuel-dumping rules.
""There are special fuel-dumping procedures for aircraft operating into and out of any major U.S. airport,"" the agency said. ""These procedures call for fuel to be dumped over designated unpopulated areas, typically at higher altitudes so the fuel atomizes and disperses before it reaches the ground.""
The fire department said it had confirmed that jet fuel was the substance dropped on the school's playground while students were at recess and that 70 firefighters were on the scene treating the injured.Other students had been evacuated from the elementary school following the incident, a Los Angeles County Sheriff's spokeswoman said. 
Parents were notified to pick up their children near the school, which is about 16 miles east of the airport. Two streets were closed during the emergency response.

AMMAN (Reuters) - The Syrian army said on Tuesday Israeli jets attacked the main T4 air base in Homs province, saying its air defences downed several missiles in strikes that caused only material damage.
An army spokesman told state media that four Israeli missiles did reach the base, but said air defences intercepted several others. 
State television earlier did not say who was behind the attack on the major air base, which Israel accuses of hosting an Iranian military presence and has attacked several times in recent years.
""The Israeli airforce conducted new aerial aggression and immediately our air defences confronted the enemy missiles,"" an army statement said.
The Syrian army statement said the Israeli war jets flew from Tanf, to the southeast, where the United States has set up a base near the Iraqi-Jordanian border. 
Tanf lies on the strategic Damascus-Baghdad highway, a major supply route for Iranian weapons into Syria. This makes the base a bulwark against Iran and part of a larger U.S. campaign against Iranian influence in Iraq and Syria.
Israel has repeatedly bombed Iranian backed militia targets in Syria, saying its goal was to end Tehran's military presence which Western intelligence sources say has expanded in recent years in the war-torn country.
The Israel Defence Force did not immediately comment on the attack.
Tuesday's strikes are the first which Syria accused Israel of undertaking since the United States killed Iran's most powerful military commander in a drone strike on Jan. 3, sparking one of the biggest escalations between Tehran and Washington since 1979. 
Iran's proxy militias led by Lebanon's Hezbollah now hold sway in vast areas in eastern and southern Syria and northwest as well as several suburbs around the capital. 
They have also entrenched themselves in the strategically located border town of AlbuKamal on the Euphrates river in Deir Zor district in eastern Syria near the border with Iraq where Iraqi Shi'ite paramilitary groups have a strong foothold.
Western intelligence sources say Israel has been behind several strikes against Iranian assets in the border area in recent weeks.
The Iraqi side of the border had seen the deployment in large numbers of Iran-allied Iraqi Shi’ite militias who now de facto control large stretches of the frontier, with posts not far from military bases housing U.S. troops.
The U.S. military struck Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah militia group in areas in Iraq and Syria along the border area at the end of last month in what U.S. officials said was a response to escalating provocations from Iran.
Israel in the past has said Iran uses the T4 base to transfer weapons to Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shi'ite militia group with which it fought a deadly month-long war in 2006. Western intelligence sources say it has also been used as a base for Iran's Revolutionary Guards.
Israel, which previously has rarely acknowledged strikes in Syria, has become more vocal in pledging it will do what is needed to thwart the entrenchment of Iranian forces or arms transfers to Hezbollah.

Two Japanese patrol planes left Japan on Jan. 11 and are expected to start operations in the Middle East from Jan. 20. A Japanese destroyer is also expected to depart Japan for the region on Feb. 2 and begin patrols later in the month.
A poll by Kyodo news agency showed 58.4% of those surveyed opposed the deployment and opposition parties in Japan have called for its cancellation, given heightened tensions in the region between the United States and Iran.
Asked about the poll during a visit to Washington, Kono noted that nearly 90% of the crude oil imported by Japan came from the Middle East and more than 80% passed through the Strait of Hormuz. Iran has threatened to mine the Strait in the past.
""So it is (in) Japanese people's interests to protect the safety of the navigation in the area,"" Kono told reporters at the Pentagon.
In May and June 2019, several attacks took place on international merchant vessels in the region, including the Japanese-owned tanker Kokuka Courageous, which the United States and other nations blamed on Iran.
Tehran denied the allegations.
The Japanese operations in the Middle East are set to cover high seas in the Gulf of Oman, the northern Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
""We are committed to send (Japan's) Self-Defense Forces for information gathering,"" Kono said.
The United States is already leading a multi-national naval mission in the region aimed at deterring Iranian attacks. Called the International Maritime Security Construct, the mission includes Australia, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.
Kono cited restrictions in Japan's constitution when asked if it might join the U.S.-led mission.
""But we will be closely communicating with the United States as (an) ally,"" he said.
Kono said he told U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper that Tokyo would make ""persistent diplomatic efforts to ease the tension and stabilize the situation in the region."" He did not say what kinds of actions Japan might take toward those goals."

Two of the injured were in a critical condition, Miquel Buch, from the Catalan regional government, told TV3.
A spokesman for Catalonia's rescue services said the fire had been contained, adding that several of the injured had suffered burns.
The building in which one person died collapsed near the factory. This was due to a shockwave from the explosion, media including La Vanguardia and El Pais newspapers said.
""We dispatched two medical units (to the collapsed building) which confirmed the death of one person and treated a second person with less severe injuries,"" Catalonia's emergency medical service said in a tweet. 
Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's office said he was in touch with Catalan authorities and that Madrid was ready to ""provide the necessary support due to this serious event, which has caused several injuries and substantial material damage"".

Protesters set garbage dumpsters on fire and threw tear gas canisters back at riot police as ambulance sirens rang out. Young men, their faces covered, smashed bank storefronts and ATMs, another Reuters witness said. 
A wave of protests erupted last October against a ruling elite accused of steering Lebanon towards its worst economic crisis since the 1975-1990 civil war.
Since Saad al-Hariri resigned as prime minister in late October, politicians have failed to agree on new government or a rescue plan. The Lebanese pound has weakened on the parallel market, a hard currency squeeze has driven up prices and confidence in the banking system has been battered. 
""Everything we're suffering from is because of the banks and the central bank's policies,"" Ali, a 21-year-old college student, said at the protest in Beirut's Hamra commercial district. ""This is why there's no longer any money, and prices are rising.""
He said tight controls that banks have imposed, limiting dollar withdrawals and blocking most transfers abroad, have also fuelled outrage. ""They won't give people their own money.""
The head of the banking association told Reuters this week that the curbs sought to ""preserve the wealth of Lebanon, and Central Bank Governor Riad Salameh says deposits are safe. 
The civil defence said it treated some protesters and police who suffered injuries on Tuesday, without giving a toll. 

Lebanon's internal security forces called on protesters to leave Hamra street ""for their safety or else they will be deemed rioters and will be chased.""

Australia is in the midst of one of its worst fire seasons on record, with bushfires burning since September and claiming the lives of 28 people, killing more than a billion animals and razing forests and farmland the size of Bulgaria.
Some fires were so monstrous that they created their own weather pattern causing dry lightening and fire tornadoes as a three-year drought left woods tinder-dry.
""It is conceivable that much of Australia simply becomes too hot and dry for human habitation,"" said Mann, who is director of the Earth System Science Center at Pennsylvania State University.
""In that case, yes, unfortunately we could well see Australians join the ranks of the world’s climate refugees.""
Climate refugees, or environmental migrants, are people forced to abandon their homes due to change in climate patterns or extreme weather events.
Mann, the recipient of last year's Tyler Prize for Environmental Achievement, is on a sabbatical in Australia where he is studying climate change.
The co-founder of the award-winning science website RealClimate.org said the brown skies over Sydney in recent days was a result of human-caused climate change led by record heat and an unprecedented drought.
The remarks resonate with his peers who published a review of 57 scientific papers suggesting clear links.
Climate change has led to an increase in the frequency and severity of what scientists call ""fire weather"" - periods with a high fire risk due to some combination of higher temperatures, low humidity, low rainfall and strong winds, the review found.
A poll from the Australian Institute published on Wednesday showed the bushfire crisis has intensified Australians' concerns about climate change and its impact.
And yet, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his conservative government have sought to downplay the role of manmade climate change in making the country vulnerable to fires.
Morrison has repeatedly said his Centre-Right government would ""meet and beat"" a 26% global emissions reduction target agreed in Paris, albeit with a caveat that such goals should not come at the cost of jobs and the economy.
Mann, the author of four books including ""The Madhouse Effect,"" said Australia could still ""easily achieve"" the target by shifting toward renewable energy.
""It's possible to grow the economy, create jobs, and preserve the environment at the same time. These are things that all Australians could embrace,"" Mann said.
""They just need a government that's willing to act on their behalf rather than on behalf of a handful of coal barons."""

The legislators - six senators and House representatives - expressed ""deep concern"" about China's imprisonment or arbitrary detention of U.S. citizens and permanent residents and the imposition of exit bans on Americans.
""We request that you meet with the families of Americans whose loved ones are being held in China and that you persistently raise the... cases in discussions with Chairman Xi Jinping and other senior Chinese officials,"" they said in a letter to Trump made public on Tuesday.
It listed seven detained U.S. citizens or permanent residents, including two pastors, a businessman and two Americans who ran an English-language teaching company.
The letter said the Chinese government used exit bans as a tool ""that disproportionately targets American citizens of Chinese descent.""
The lawmakers also called on Trump to seek the release of relatives of American citizens and permanent residents detained in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region, where the Chinese government is accused of mass persecution of Muslims.
""These family members... need the administration to be tenacious advocates for them and the estimated 1.8 million ethnic Uighurs and other Turkic Muslims arbitrarily detained in the XUAR,"" the letter said.
The lawmakers who signed the letter were led by Republican Marco Rubio and Democratic Representative Jim McGovern, co-chairs of the Congressional Executive Commission on China.
The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Signing of the first part of the trade deal on Wednesday should ease Trump's 18-month trade war with China, but will do nothing to reduce a growing strategic rivalry, amid which U.S. officials have increasingly taken aim at China's human rights record.
China said in October that two U.S. citizens mentioned in the letter - Alyssa Petersen and Jacob Harlan, who worked for U.S.-based education company China Horizons - had been released on bail and were awaiting trial on charges of illegally moving people across country borders.
The congressional letter also named John Cao, a pastor and a U.S. legal permanent resident it said was sentenced to seven years in prison, also for allegedly organizing ""illegal border crossings,” and Kai Li, a U.S. citizen arrested on state security charges and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018.
The letter also listed David Lin, an American pastor detained in 2006 and convicted on fraud-related charges, who is not scheduled for release until 2030, and Victor and Cynthia Liu, whom it said had been prevented from leaving China since 2018.
The letter said their mother, Sandra Han, was detained on criminal charges in China and the family’s New York-based attorney believed they were being used as human collateral to coerce their father, Liu Changming, to return to China to face fraud charges."

Lebanese politicians have been unable to agree on a new government since Hariri resigned as prime minister in October, prompted by protests against state corruption and bad governance. This has left the country rudderless and with no rescue plan as the financial and economic situation worsens.
Asked if the caretaker administration should act on the economic crisis, Hariri said: ""We all know that any step we want to carry out in the economic file needs us to cooperate with the World Bank, the IMF and other international institutions.""
""Let's suppose that I spoke to the World Bank and we agreed with them on something, can I implement this agreement as part of a caretaker government. No, it is not possible,"" he said.
Only a government operating normally with the confidence of parliament could enact such an agreement, Hariri said in comments reported by Lebanon's National News Agency.
Last month, the powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah and its political allies nominated Hassan Diab, a little-known former government minister, to form the new government. But talks aimed at agreeing on the cabinet are mired in complications.
""The basis of the solution is to form a new government and not refloating a government that resigned at the request of the street,"" Hariri said."

SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - The top Anglican bishop of El Salvador has urged the United States not to deport his son back to the troubled Central American nation, fearing brutal gangs who have threatened to murder the 34-year-old for refusing to work for them.
Bishop David Alvarado said his son, Josue Alvarado, hopes to be granted asylum in the United States or Canada.
The younger Alvarado is in custody in Ohio. He went to the United States to work in construction in October 2016 to flee gangs in El Salvador that had forced him to distribute weapons and drugs as a taxi driver, his father, 57, told Reuters.
After refusing to continue, he received death threats before filing a complaint with prosecutors, the bishop added.
""If he returns, the gangs will go after him again,"" Bishop Alvarado said. ""He fled because of the threats.""
His son's U.S. asylum request was denied last month for lack of reasonable fear, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security notification seen by Reuters.
Josue Alvarado was arrested while waiting for highway assistance after suffering a flat tire. Police turned him over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement because he could not present documents showing he was in the country legally.
""Even though they've signed deals between the Central American governments ... and the United States that they are safe countries, we know that they're not so safe,"" the elder Alvarado added, referring to 2019 agreements to send migrants to seek asylum in Central American nations instead of the United States.
""We live here under a structure of violence going back many years because of the gangs,"" the bishop added.
El Salvador last year registered 36 homicides per 100,000 people, a drop of 25.5% compared with the prior year.
Gangs have a strong grip on the region, and have been one of the factors pushing Salvadorans north, despite tougher measures from the United States and Mexico to crack down on migration.
The number of Salvadorans deported from the United States and Mexico increased 40% last year compared with 2018."

(Reuters) - The younger son and daughter-in-law of News Corp (O:NWSA) Executive Chairman and Fox Corporation Co-Chairman Rupert Murdoch took aim at both organizations' coverage of climate change, widely viewed as a contributing factor to the Australian bushfires, in a statement to The Daily Beast on Tuesday.
“Kathryn and James (Murdoch's) views on climate are well established and their frustration with some of the News Corp and Fox coverage of the topic is also well known,” a spokesperson for the couple told The Daily Beast, and later confirmed the statement’s accuracy to Reuters. 
“They are particularly disappointed with the ongoing denial (of the role of climate change) among the news outlets in Australia, given obvious evidence to the contrary.”
Bushfires have raged in Australia since September, claiming the lives of 28 people, destroying more than 2,500 homes and wiping out forests and farmland the size of Bulgaria.
Critics of News Corp, the largest media company in Australia, say it has participated in the spread of misinformation about the fires and has downplayed the impact of climate change on them. 
James Murdoch sits on News Corp's board and is chief executive of private investment company Lupa Systems. His older brother Lachlan is co-chairman of News Corp and chief executive of Fox Corporation.
Kathryn Murdoch has, in the past months, become more vocal about her decade-plus work as a climate activist. 
A News Corp spokesperson declined to comment on James and Kathryn Murdoch’s statement to The Daily Beast. 
Addressing News Corp's coverage of the wildfires, he directed Reuters to a Jan. 11 editorial in the News Corp-owned newspaper The Australian, which said: 
“In our coverage, The Australian’s journalists report facts about how to tackle bushfires and about how to deal with the impact of climate change. Second, we host debates reflecting the political division that exists in Australia about how to address climate change without destroying our economy.""

""However, our factual account of bushfires, climate change and the remedies, as well as our editorial commentary on these issues, have been wilfully and ineptly misrepresented by The New York Times and Guardian Australia as climate denial.”

943,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",World Court to rule on emergency measures in Myanmar genocide case on January 23: Gambia,"THE HAGUE (Reuters) - The International Court of Justice, the United Nations' highest court, will issue a decision on a request for emergency measures in a genocide case against Myanmar on Jan. 23, the Gambian Ministry of Justice said on Twitter on Monday.
The mainly Muslim west African country filed the suit in November, alleging Myanmar was committing ""an ongoing genocide"" against its minority Muslim Rohingya population.
The ICJ did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Gambia has accused Myanmar of violating the 1948 Genocide Convention in a military campaign that expelled more than 730,000 Rohingya from the country.
It asked the International Court of Justice to order ""provisional measures"" to prevent more harm, a first step in a legal case that is expected to go on for years.
Myanmar's leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, travelled to The Hague last month to defend her country against the charges. She denied that genocide was taking place and said the court has no jurisdiction to hear the case.
Suu Kyi, once championed in the West for her decades-long fight for democracy for Myanmar, said Myanmar did investigate and prosecute soldiers and officers accused of crimes. She said that under those circumstances, the court should not intervene. 
Gambia lodged its lawsuit after winning the support of the Organisation for Islamic Cooperation (OIC), which has 57 member states. Only a state can file a case against another state at the ICJ.
Gambia has said Myanmar cannot be trusted to bring alleged military perpetrators of crimes against the Rohingya to justice.
It has asked the court to order provisional measures for Myanmar to stop its forces committing ""all acts that amount to or contribute to the crime of genocide"" against the Rohingya including killing, rape and destruction of homes and villages. 
Gambia also asked judges to order Myanmar to ensure any evidence of atrocities is preserved. 
The International Court of Justice's decisions are binding and not subject to appeal, though the court has no means of enforcement and countries have occasionally ignored them or failed to adhere fully.

GENEVA (Reuters) - There may have been limited human-to-human transmission of a new coronavirus in China within families, and it is possible there could be a wider outbreak, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday.
Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause infections ranging from the common cold to SARS. A Chinese woman has been quarantined in Thailand with a mystery strain of coronavirus, Thai authorities said on Monday, the first time the virus has been detected outside China.
In all, 41 cases of pneumonia have been reported in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, which preliminary lab tests cited by state media showed could be from a new type of coronavirus, and one patient has died. There have since been no new cases or deaths, Wuhan health authorities said on Tuesday.
""From the information that we have it is possible that there is limited human-to-human transmission, potentially among families, but it is very clear right now that we have no sustained human-to-human transmission,"" said Maria Van Kerkhove, acting head of WHO's emerging diseases unit.
The WHO is however preparing for the possibility that there could be a wider outbreak, she told a Geneva news briefing. ""It is still early days, we don't have a clear clinical picture.""
Some types of the virus cause less serious diseases, while others - like the one that causes MERS - are far more severe.
The U.N. agency has given guidance to hospitals worldwide about infection prevention and control in case the new virus spreads. There is no specific treatment for the new virus, but anti-virals are being considered and could be ""re-purposed"", Van Kerkhove said.
With Chinese New Year approaching on Jan. 25, when many Chinese tourists visit Thailand, the WHO called on Thai authorities, the public and holidaymakers to be on alert.
Richard Brow, the agency's representative in Thailand, said anyone with a fever and cough who had spent time in Wuhan should get checked out by a health worker."
946,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 14, 2020 02:35PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court justices skeptical about New Jersey 'Bridgegate' convictions,"By Lawrence Hurley
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Supreme Court justices signaled sympathy on Tuesday toward two associates of former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie who are seeking to have their convictions in the ""Bridgegate"" scandal overturned in a case focusing on what kinds of political acts can be prosecuted as criminal fraud.
Several justices - liberals and conservatives - appeared dissatisfied during arguments in the case with the U.S. Justice Department's reasoning in defending the prosecutions of Bridget Anne Kelly and Bill Baroni, although they asked tough question of both sides. 
The scandal centered on Christie's team engineering traffic chaos on the world's busiest bridge to punish a local mayor who refused to endorse his gubernatorial re-election bid.
The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2018 upheld the 2016 convictions of Kelly, a former Christie deputy chief of staff, and Baroni, a former deputy executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, for wire fraud and misusing Port Authority resources.
At issue in their appeals is whether their actions fit the definition of fraud under federal law.
Prosecutors accused Kelly and Baroni of creating days of lane closures in September 2013 on the George Washington Bridge, which connects Fort Lee, New Jersey, to New York City.
The closures caused traffic gridlock and were intended to punish the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, Mark Sokolich, after he declined to endorse the Republican Christie for re-election, prosecutors said. The traffic was so bad, local authorities warned at the time that it was a threat to public safety by delaying emergency responders.
Christie denied involvement and was not charged. The scandal marred Christie's reputation, damaged his campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and contributed to low public approval ratings in his home state.
PAINTING THE MAYOR'S HOUSE
The justices wrestled with whether changing a bridge's traffic lane patterns was akin to other types of government misconduct, citing examples like a mayor asking public employees to paint his house or snow plow his street before others.
""Now, that is not a good thing to do. It is really undesirable. And maybe it should be a crime. But 30 years in prison? That I'm not sure,"" said liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, referring to the maximum available sentence for fraud. 
Conservative Chief Justice John Roberts noted that although the lane-meddling created traffic problems, the public could still use the bridge.
""If people want to use the highway to get to Fort Lee, they can,"" Roberts said.
Liberal Justice Elena Kagan said that although government employees were commandeered as part of the scheme, their role was incidental.
Conservative Justice Samuel Alito, a New Jersey native and former federal prosecutor in the state, was among those tough on the prosecution, although he also appeared dissatisfied at what Kelly and Baroni's lawyers argued.
Christie, Kelly and Baroni all attended the arguments.
A ruling in favor of Kelly and Baroni could make it harder to prosecute public officials for certain political acts. The Supreme Court in 2016 threw out former Republican Virginia Governor Robert McDonnell's bribery conviction in a ruling that narrowed the types of conduct that can warrant such prosecution.
McDonnell and former media mogul Conrad Black, who also was prosecuted in a corruption case, filed legal briefs in support of Kelly and Baroni. President Donald Trump last year granted a full pardon to Black, who was convicted in 2007 of fraud and obstruction of justice and spent 3-1/2 years in prison.
After dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination, Christie threw his support behind Trump and served as an adviser, but Trump later fired him as the head of his transition team after being elected president.
Baroni initially started serving an 18-month prison sentence but was released after the Supreme Court agreed last year to hear the case. Kelly's 13-month sentence was put on hold while she appealed.

Kelly told Port Authority executive David Wildstein in an August 2013 email that it was "" (t)ime for some traffic problems in Fort Lee,"" and they helped invent a sham ""traffic study"" to justify the lane closures. Wildstein, the accused Bridgegate mastermind, was sentenced to probation in 2017 after pleading guilty and cooperating with prosecutors.

XINGU INDIGENOUS PARK, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazilian indigenous leaders on Tuesday began a four-day tribal gathering in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to plan their opposition to far-right President Jair Bolsonaro's push to open their reservations for commercial mining and agriculture.
Protected tribal lands have seen increasing invasions by illegal loggers and miners since Bolsonaro became president last year, leading to a rise in deforestation, fires and deadly clashes on several reservations.
Bolsonaro has vowed to integrate Brazil's roughly 900,000 indigenous people into the broader economy and society, while tapping the mineral riches and commercial farming potential of their 462 reservations.
Environmentalist say such a move will speed up clearing of the Amazon jungle, the world's largest tropical rainforest, which is considered vital for slowing global climate change.
This week's gathering at a village in the Xingu park was hosted by Kayapó chief Raoni Metuktire, who became a global reference for his environmental campaigning in the 1980s with musician Sting at his side.
""The year begins with this big meeting called by Raoni to draw up strategies to protect the Amazon from the threats, the criticism and the destruction that the Bolsonaro government is causing,"" Sonia Guajajara, head of an umbrella group called the Articulation of the Indigenous Peoples of Brazil (APIB), told Reuters en route to Xingu in the frontier state of Mato Grosso.
Indigenous leaders wearing ceremonial body paint and headdresses of exotic bird feathers performed ritual dances at the center of Raoni's village to kick off the meeting.
According to a draft seen by O Globo newspaper, legislation drafted by the government would not just open up reservation to mining, but also to oil and gas exploration, the building of new hydroelectric dams and commercial farms with genetically modified crops currently banned by law on tribal lands.
Indigenous communities would be consulted on economic projects, as stipulated in Brazil's Constitution, but they would not have the power to veto projects decided by the government, O Globo reported on Saturday.
The Bolsonaro government, which declined to comment on the O Globo report, has said it is attending to tribal leaders seeking economic development who are ignored by high-profile indigenous advocates.
Guajajara said some tribes that are planting soy may favor the easing of environmental restrictions, but the majority oppose mining on their lands."

LIMA (Reuters) - In a win for Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra, the country's top court ruled on Tuesday that his dissolution of Congress amid a long-running standoff with lawmakers was legal.
With four votes in favor and three votes against, the court said a claim that Vizcarra exceeded his powers by dissolving Congress on Sept. 30 was unfounded. The decision means legislative elections will move forward on Jan. 26.
Vizcarra dissolved Congress amid a protracted showdown with lawmakers over anti-corruption reforms. The move won him support among the armed forces, police and voters in the copper-rich nation.
In October, Peru's Constitutional Tribunal unanimously voted to admit a lawsuit to determine whether Vizcarra exceeded his powers with the shutdown.
The dissolution of Congress had been rejected mostly by lawmakers from the right-wing Popular Force party of opposition leader Keiko Fujimori.
The daughter of disgraced former President Alberto Fujimori was jailed last year for alleged money laundering and receiving illegal contributions from Brazilian construction company Odebrecht."

LA PAZ (Reuters) - Bolivia's interim President Jeanine Anez is pushing to unite a divided opposition to secure an election win in May and prevent the return to power of the socialist party of ousted leader Evo Morales.
Anez, a 52-year-old conservative who took office amid a power vacuum following Morales' resignation under pressure last year, said she was calling this week for a summit of political parties to help defeat Morales' Movement to Socialism (MAS).
She said, however, that she currently has no plans to run herself. Morales himself is in Argentina and has said he will not take part in May's election, but he is playing a key role in the campaign of the party he founded.
""If we dilute the vote obviously that will benefit Evo Morales,"" Anez said in an interview with Reuters at the presidential palace in the historic center of La Paz. ""We can not risk a return to the same 14 years of oppression and authoritarianism of Evo Morales, who is totally sick for power.""
The scrabble to unite the opposition underscores the challenge for Bolivia's conservatives in an election that could be key in deciding the future direction of the gas and lithium rich nation.
Anez, president almost by chance after she took over according to a line of succession when Morales and his deputy resigned, is at the heart of a political storm that has rocked Bolivia, where the image of Morales was ubiquitous from public transport to sports stadia for more than a decade.
Morales stepped down on Nov. 10 after a disputed election victory a month earlier sparked protests and led to allies, police and military pulling their support.
The political upheaval has left stark divisions in the country, which is heading for new elections on May 3. Candidates for some of the biggest parties have not yet been selected.
Morales says Anez and others led a U.S.-backed coup against him. His critics say that he held onto power too long, including running for a fourth term in defiance of term limits.
A heavy police presence outside the presidential palace acts as a reminder of last year's violent unrest. Anez denied any coup.
""It was a process won by all Bolivians when we went out into the streets to defend our democracy and freedom,"" she said. Her interim government's establishment of a new electoral tribunal and a timetable for new elections was evidence it was not trying to cling to power, she added.
U.S. PIVOT
Under Anez, Bolivia has shifted 180 degrees in its foreign policy, moving away from Morales' leftist allies in Venezuela and Cuba, and re-forging ties with the United States.
""Now that we are beginning an electoral process, we hope that they (United States) will help us, just as we are also receiving help from the European Union and the Organization of American States,"" she said.
Anez said a technical team from USAID, the U.S. development agency that was kicked out of Bolivia by Morales in 2013, was in the country, holding meetings with government departments to assess possible collaboration around aid.
""We will receive it gladly - though I stress within the framework of our own sovereignty. We will work with them,"" said Anez.
The shifting alliances have created issues for Bolivia, most prominently with leftist leaders in Mexico and Argentina. Bolivia expelled the Mexican ambassador over a diplomatic row while trade ties with Argentina have soured.
That has impacted negotiations over key exports of gas.
""We have done very well with Brazil but we have not yet entered into negotiations with Argentina, which will probably be more difficult,"" Anez said, citing political and ideological differences."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Former Pope Benedict wants his name removed as co-author of a new book on the issue of priestly celibacy, his personal secretary said on Tuesday, in the latest twist to a saga that has kept the Roman Catholic world riveted.
Archbishop Georg Ganswein told Reuters that, at the former pope's behest, he had asked the principal author of the book, Cardinal Robert Sarah, to contact the publishers to make the necessary changes.
The book, ""From the Depths of Our Hearts"", is due to be published in France on Wednesday. Excerpts were released at the weekend, angering some Roman Catholic scholars, who said Benedict risked undermining his successor, Pope Francis.
The book's American publisher, Ignatius Press, said in a statement that it still ""considers this a co-authored publication"", indicating that it may not comply with the former pope's requests when the English version is released next month.
The episode has underscored the polarisation between conservatives and progressives in the 1.3 billion-member Church and prompted fresh debate on the role of a former pontiff.
Hours earlier, Cardinal Sarah rejected media accusations that he had used Benedict's name without authorisation and that he had taken advantage of the frail, 92-year-old former pontiff, who in 2013 became the first pope to resign in 700 years.
""I solemnly affirm that Benedict XVI knew that our project would take the form of a book. I can say that we exchanged several texts to establish the corrections,"" Sarah, 74, wrote on Twitter. 
He later said that because of the polemics, in future editions of the book, Benedict would be named as a contributor and not a co-author. ""However, the full text remains absolutely unchanged,"" he said.
In the book, Benedict and Sarah defend priestly celibacy in what some have seen as a strategically timed appeal to Francis not to change the rules after a proposal that he allow older married men to be ordained on a limited basis to deal with a shortage of priests in the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Francis is preparing a document on the issue..
'DESPICABLE' ACCUSATIONS
Sarah also issued a long statement in his own defence, detailing his recent meetings with Benedict and restating that the former pope was informed of everything, including the cover of the book.
He said accusations that he was manipulating Benedict were ""despicable"" and that his allegiance to Francis was ""total"". He also published a signed letter from Benedict, in which the former pope wrote in Italian: ""For my part, the text can be published in the form you have foreseen.""
The episode has sparked heated debate, including on social media far from the Vatican, on the role Benedict should have, if any, and whether he is being used by others.
""Has the pope emeritus become a brand that some manipulate and administer at will?"" Luis Badilla, head of the Catholic website Il Sismografo, said in an editorial.
""Can the status of the emeritus pope be left in the hands of private people who do not have to answer to anyone?"" Badilla said in apparent reference to those with access to Benedict, who lives in seclusion in a former monastery in the Vatican. 
It is not the first time that Benedict has spoken out on Church matters despite his public vow to live ""hidden from the world"" after his abdication in 2013.
Benedict caused a stir last year with an essay in which he blamed the Church’s sexual abuse scandal on the effects of the sexual revolution in the 1960s.

Many Catholic theologians and abuse experts rebuked him, saying he was trying to shift blame away from the Church.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's new president discussed with Trump administration officials how to slow illegal immigration and improve border security in a meeting before he was due to take office on Tuesday, as Washington pushes him accept an asylum agreement.
A conservative former surgeon and ex-prison chief, Alejandro Giammattei, 63, ran for top office three times before his victory in an August runoff on a tough-on-crime platform that included returning the death penalty.
""We will bring back the peace this country so dearly needs,"" he told reporters on Monday, promising to overhaul the Central American nation's security forces and restructure ministries.
But at the top of his to-do list will be a decision on whether to roll back or expand an agreement with the United States forged by outgoing President Jimmy Morales that makes Guatemala a buffer zone to reduce U.S. asylum claims.
Acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, part of the U.S. delegation headed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for the inauguration, was expected to push Giammattei to expand the agreement to include Mexicans.
In a sign of the urgency of the relationship, Giammattei met Wolf and Ross in his first bilateral meeting on Tuesday morning, hours before he was due to be sworn in. The U.S. embassy tweeted that Wolf talked with him about containing illegal immigration and improving border security.
Giammattei said in a tweet that he and Ross discussed investment and economic growth to stem immigration.
Neither side has revealed additional details. Giammattei later met Colombian President Ivan Duque. 
Guatemala is one of Latin America's poorest and most unequal nations, with poverty increasing since 2000 despite strong economic growth rates, according to the World Bank. U.S. officials have previously threatened it with economic consequences if it fails to accept the Asylum Cooperation Agreement. 
Giammattei, who had previously suggested he would seek to change the agreement, appeared to soften his stance on Monday, saying he had not yet seen the deal's details.
Guatemala is central to U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating efforts to end illegal immigration and asylum claims from people making their way to the southwestern U.S. border.
Under the deal, implemented in November, the United States sends Hondurans and El Salvadorans seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border to Guatemala to ask for refuge there instead.
As of Friday, 128 Salvadoran and Honduran asylum seekers had been sent as part of the agreement, according to the Guatemalan Migration Institute. Only a handful have applied for asylum in a country that is itself a major source of U.S. bound migrants. Others have returned home.
CRIME AND CORRUPTION
Giammattei takes office as the nation suffers from the effects of drug trafficking on politics and distrust sowed by last year's forced departure of a United Nations-backed anti-corruption body.
Another looming decision will be whether to act on the recommendation of a congressional panel last week that judges and investigators who worked with the anti-corruption body, known as CICIG, be arrested.
CICIG helped topple sitting President Otto Perez Molina on corruption charges in 2015 and put dozens of politicians and businessmen behind bars, before a backlash led Morales to drive the body from Guatemala in September. 
Morales, himself investigated by the agency on election financing charges he denies, is due to be sworn into the Central American parliament a few hours after he leaves office, in a position offering him immunity.
On the bright side, Guatemala's homicide rate is down - to 22 murders per 100,000 residents in 2018, from 45 per 100,000 in 2009.
But the freedom with which drug traffickers influence politics is a challenge. Ahead of last year's election, presidential candidate and occasional Morales ally Mario Estrada was arrested in Miami on charges of seeking funding from drug cartels and conspiring to assassinate rivals. 

""We realized that narco-trafficking here is among the most intense in the region,"" Luis Hernandez Azmitia, an outgoing congressional representative of the Movimiento Reformador party told Reuters.

The U.S. Treasury Department announced the sanctions on the Korea Namgang Trading Corp and China-based North Korean lodging facility Beijing Sukbakso, despite U.S. efforts to revive stalled talks aimed at persuading North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons.
It said the former entity had facilitated, or been responsible for, the exportation of workers from North Korea to generate revenue for the North Korean government or ruling party. It said the latter ran a China-based lodging facility to facilitate labor export.
""The exportation of North Korean workers raises illicit revenue for the government of North Korea in violation of U.N. sanctions,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement.
The sanctions imposed on Monday freeze any U.S. assets of the blacklisted entities and generally prohibit Americans from doing business with them. They come at a time of heightened tensions between Washington and Pyongyang. 
Pyongyang has expressed frustration at what it calls Washington's lack of flexibility in talks and warned that there were no longer grounds for it to be bound by a self-declared moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear weapons testing. 
U.S. officials say North Korea must take more concrete steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs before sanctions are eased.
On Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he was hopeful North Korea would make the right decision despite slow progress.
""The sanctions that we have put in place on North Korea along with the rest of the world ... have certainly caused Chairman Kim to think seriously about the right path forward for his people,"" he said, referring to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.

Iraq's parliament has called for U.S. and other foreign troops to leave amid growing a backlash against Washington's air strike, which also killed a top Iraqi militia commander.
Iran launched a missile attack on U.S. targets in Iraq in retaliation for the death of General Qassem Soleimani, a move that heightened fears of a wider Middle East conflict.
""Go on soldiers of God, soldiers of the nation, onto a million man march condemning the American presence and its violations,"" Sadr tweeted.
""Iraqi space, its land and sovereignty are infringed upon by occupying forces."" 
Sadr has million of followers has been able to summon tens of thousands of people onto the streets of Baghdad for demonstrations in previous years.
He gave no details of when he was calling for the protest to take place, or where. 
Thousands are of Iraqis still gathering in separate anti-government demonstrations in Baghdad's Tahrir Square (NYSE:SQ) in protests that started on Oct. 1 - potentially setting the stage for rival groups to clash.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Dismissed ex-employees of Sudan's National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) shot in the air in Khartoum on Tuesday in protest at severance terms, prompting a heavy security force deployment and the temporary closure of the country's airspace. 
A Reuters witness saw members of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), Sudan's most powerful paramilitary group, and the army deploy in Khartoum's main streets and shut down roads after gunmen opened fire outside buildings used by NISS.
In a televised statement, Information Minister Faisal Mohamed Saleh said the gunmen were former employees angry at the terms they had been offered upon their dismissal.
The authorities ""continue their efforts to persuade the rebellious units to surrender and hand over their arms,"" said Saleh, adding that there were no casualties. 
Security forces blocked the road leading to one of the buildings, the witness added. The district is close to the capital's airport. 
Authorities closed Sudan’s airspace for five hours as a precautionary measure after the start of the shooting, a civil aviation ministry spokesman said. 
Sudan is undergoing a three-year political transition overseen by civilians and the military following the overthrow of long-time ruler Omar al-Bashir in April.
Lieutenant General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, deputy head of the military council and head of the RSF, said that former Sudan intelligence chief Salah Gosh was behind the shootings.
""This is a coordinated plan by Salah Gosh and another member of the National Congress party including some generals from intelligence service,"" he told a press conference during a visit to Juba in South Sudan later on Tuesday.
""The person behind this shooting today is Salah Gosh. He has many generals active within the security sector with an aim to create confusion and fighting.""
Dagalo said while he would not consider Tuesday's incident a coup attempt, any such action would not bee tolerated. ""We will not accept any coup, we will not accept any illegal change. The only change will come from the Sudanese people,"" he said.
Gosh could not be immediately reached for comment. 
Restructuring NISS was among the key demands of the uprising that called for Bashir's removal from power. The dismissals were part of the plan to restructure the intelligence agency. 
Masked members of NISS dressed in military uniform set up checkpoints in one of Khartoum's main residential streets near the building and were seen firing shots into the air, one of the witnesses said.
The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), the country's main protest group, called on state agencies to intervene immediately to stop ""these irresponsible operations that are causing terror amongst citizens.""

Unverified video footage posted on social media purporting to show the area where the clashes occurred featured sounds of gunfire.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The #MeToo movement may have given women's rights a boost but the drive for gender equality still takes ""two steps forward, and one step backwards,"" Nigerian novelist and activist Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie told Reuters on Monday. 
Adichie, whose TED talk, 'We Should All Be Feminists,' inspired a Beyonce song and a Christian Dior T-shirt collection, said women may be making strides in the workplace and public life, but still bear the lion's share of domestic work.
""The #MeToo movement in many parts of the world made it possible for women to start talking about things that women couldn't talk about, so for me that's progress of sorts,"" the author said on the sidelines of a conference in the Chilean capital Santiago. 
""Often, it feels as though it's two steps forward and one step backwards. We are talking about it but we haven't quite found the solutions yet.""
She said children were still often being raised with ""ingrained gender roles."" 
""The idea of domestic work, for example, who does it, is it something people should be paid for?"" she said. ""In many countries across the world, it's still thought of as something that women should do."" 
""Because of that, women are doing domestic work at home and also working outside the home. Women are now doubly burdened and so what can seem like equality really isn't. In the future, we have to address that; otherwise, it will take women back even more."" 
Adichie, whose award-winning novels - including Americanah, Purple Hibiscus and Half of a Yellow Sun - address issues of gender, race, identity and immigration, also took a swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump, saying his stricter approach to migration from Central and South America represented ""cruelty for the sake of cruelty."" 
""This administration has criminalized immigration in a way that I think is immoral,"" she said. ""Many people want to come to the U.S. not because they are criminals or bad people but because they want better for themselves.""
""I don't think all countries should have open borders but what's happening in the U.S., where children are being treated in the most horrendous way, is quite unnecessary. It's cruelty for the sake of cruelty."" 
Trump has made clamping down on migration a top priority of his current term in office and his 2020 re-election campaign. In July, the American Civil Liberties Union asked a judge to stop the Trump administration's practice of separating families https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-children/over-900-children-separated-at-u-s-border-since-policy-halted-aclu-idUSKCN1UP2KZ at the U.S.-Mexico border.

The complaint filed by attorney Jude Sabio in 2017 is one of several communications to the court calling for Duterte's indictment over thousands of alleged extrajudicial killings during his campaign against narcotics.
""I fervently request that it be expunged or erased from the record, and that it should not be used in any way in the ongoing preliminary examination,"" Sabio said in a 28-page letter addressed to ICC Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.
Sabio is the lawyer for Edgar Matobato, a man who has testified in the Philippines Senate that he was part of a hit squad that operated on Duterte's orders.
In his letter, Sabio said the ICC case had been used by opposition politicians as a ""tool for propaganda"" and should therefore be ""thrashed and set aside"".
Former Senator Antontio Trillanes, one of Duterte's most vocal opponents, said the president's allies must have a hand in Sabio's decision, saying it was an indication they are worried about the ICC case.
There was no immediate comment from Duterte's office.
Under ICC rules, a prosecution could still proceed after a submission were withdrawn by an external party.
While a complaint from a single, external party could alert the prosecutor to possible crimes, it would not in itself be the basis for a case. The prosecutor's office would initiate its own investigation to determine whether crimes under the ICC's statute had been committed and warranted charges.  
In a December 2019 report, the office of the ICC prosecutor said it would aim to finalize a preliminary examination to enable it to reach a decision on whether to seek authorization to open an investigation into the Philippines.
Duterte has been dismissive of the ICC process.
The firebrand leader unilaterally withdrew in March 2018 from the ICC's founding treaty, saying it skirted due process and the presumption of his innocence and sought to portray him as a ""ruthless and heartless violator of human rights"".
Last month he said he would refuse to cooperate if put on trial.
Human rights groups say Duterte's anti-drugs crackdown involved systematic executions and police cover-ups. Police reject that and say the nearly 7,000 people they have killed were armed drug suspects who resisted arrest."

ACEH, Indonesia (Reuters) - Thailand and Indonesia on Tuesday signed an intelligence sharing agreement that the Thai army chief said would help limit the movements of insurgents operating in the Muslim-majority southern region of Thailand.
Buddhist-majority Thailand and Muslim-majority Indonesia will share information on ""movements of extremists, rebels or perpetrator groups who have been undermining national security"", the official document seen by Reuters said.
It was signed during an official visit by Thai Army Chief General Apirat Kongsompong to the Indonesian province of Aceh on Tuesday.
""This is about limiting the freedom to operate by groups, because we will be sharing information and monitoring individuals,"" Apirat said.
Apirat said that Indonesia, particularly Aceh, has been used in the past by Thai insurgent groups to train as well as to hide and plan operations against Thailand.
Thailand is fighting a Muslim separatist insurgency in the southern provinces of Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat that has killed nearly 7,000 people since 2004, according to the Deep South Watch monitoring group.
In one recent attack, the insurgents stormed a security checkpoint and killed 15 people.
Top Indonesian general Perkasa did not mention any specific militant groups that Jakarta was requesting Thailand to monitor but stressed regional cooperation.
""In handling any security issue, we should handle it together,"" General Perkasa said.
Threats to Indonesia include Islamist militant groups like Jemaah Islamiyah and other Islamic State inspired groups.
Aceh was embroiled in an insurgency that killed 15,000 people over three decades until a 2005 truce between the Free Aceh Movement and Jakarta that gave the region special autonomy and allowed it to implement Sharia law.
Apirat, however, expressed no imminent hope for a peace deal with the southern Thai insurgents.
""I have said that the land within the Kingdom of Thailand cannot be separated, but there continues to be those who are against this all the time, so how can peace be achieved?"" he said."

BERLIN (Reuters) - German politicians and managers have set up an elite networking association to strengthen links to China at a time of tension over Hong Kong and a looming decision on whether to exclude Huawei from Germany's 5G rollout.
The organizers say the ""China-Bridge"" initiative is modeled on the ""Atlantic-Bridge"", a non-profit organization set up in 1952 to boost German-American friendship which has 500 decision-makers in business, politics, science and media as members.
China is a crucial business partner for export-oriented Germany. The two traded almost 100 billion euros in goods in the first half of last year.
""China will be one of the global powers that shape this century. Germany needs a dialogue led by business, politicians and civil society,"" Bavarian conservative politician Hans-Peter Friedrich, who will head the new body, told Reuters.
Other members include Andreas Hube, a manager at software company SAP and the head of the Sino German Hi Tech Park Holding in Heidelberg, Mike De Vries.
Those involved said the idea was not to tackle everyday political tussles but to create channels for dialogue between citizens and institutions of both countries. Friedrich also made clear the organization would not be uncritical of China.
Relations with China have deepened significantly in the 14 years Angela Merkel has been chancellor of Europe's biggest economy.
She visits the country regularly and plans to make China a priority of Germany's six-month presidency of the European Union in the second half of this year, culminating in an EU-China summit.
Violent protests in Hong Kong overshadowed her trip to China in September where she, accompanied by a large business delegation, pressed Beijing to open up its markets.
Her coalition will in the next few weeks or months decide on security rules for Germany's 5G network that could shut out China's Huawei.

MANILA (Reuters) - Nearly 40,000 people have been evacuated from near a Philippine volcano that could erupt violently at any moment, authorities said on Tuesday, but thousands more are refusing to leave or have already drifted back.
A cloud of ash and fountains of lava gushed for a third day from the crater of Taal, which lies in the middle of a lake about 70 km (45 miles) south of the center of the Philippines capital Manila.
Everyone living within 14 km (9 miles) of the volcano has been ordered to leave: potentially as many as 300,000 people, though disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal said he believed the actual number who had been there was much lower.
Officially, 38,200 have now been evacuated, the agency said.
Local officials complained that many others were complicating the evacuation effort by staying put.
""I had to put Talisay under lockdown to prevent residents, who were already in the evacuation centers from returning,"" said Gerry Natanauan, mayor of one town that is well within the danger zone of the 311 meter (1,020-foot) volcano. 
""They wanted to check their homes, possessions and animals, but they're not supposed to do that because it is very dangerous."" 
Although Taal is one of the world's smallest active volcanoes, it has a deadly history: an eruption in 1911 killed more than 1,300 people.
Several new fissures have opened, emitting plumes of steam, while dozens of tremors were felt as far as in Tagaytay city, a popular tourist destination 32 km (20 miles) away. 
RISK OF DEVASTATION
If an eruption happened, nobody would be able to return to their homes because they would be devastated, said Renato Solidum, director of the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Philvocs).
""The threat is really real,"" he told a media briefing.
However, many refused to heed the warnings.
In part of Balete town, which sits on the edge of the danger zone, Red Cross trucks were sent to bring out 1,000 residents, but they left with only 130 because people thought they were far enough from the volcano, local authorities said. 
No casualties have been reported so far, and seismologists said there was a chance this eruption could subside, but the signs still point to an imminent explosion.
Visiting the area on Tuesday, President Rodrigo Duterte joked that the government could try a traditional way to calm the volcano down.
""You should go there and, you know, say a little prayer and offer something. Let's go by the primitive way of doing it just like what our forefathers would do,"" he was quoted as saying by the Inquirer.Net website.
Taal has erupted more than 30 times in the past five centuries, most recently in 1977. A 1754 eruption lasted for months. The Philippines lies on the ""Ring of Fire"", a belt of volcanoes circling the Pacific Ocean that is also prone to earthquakes.

In Manila, government offices reopened on Tuesday after being closed on Monday because of a fine layer of ash that drifted from the volcano, but schools remained shut and many people still wore face masks.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia urged foreign tourists on Tuesday to put aside concerns about raging bushfires after the United States downgraded a travel warning, even as thick smoke disrupted preparations for the Australian Open tennis tournament in Melbourne. 
Australia is experiencing one of its worst bushfire seasons on record, with fires burning since September and claiming the lives of 28 people, destroying more than 2,500 homes and razing forests and farmland the size of Bulgaria. 
Prime Minister Scott Morrison welcomed the U.S. move to scale back its travel warning and said Australia was ""very much open for business"", amid concerns the fires would damage the tourism industry and the broader economy.
The United States last week warned citizens to exercise increased caution when traveling to Australia due to the fire risks, putting it on the same Level Two advisory as protest-wracked Hong Kong.
In its latest update, the State Department revised the advisory to Level One meaning ""exercise normal precautions"", however it maintained a Level Two warning for fire-hit areas including the central tablelands of New South Wales state and southeastern Victoria state.
Australia's tourism industry accounts for more than 3% of the country's A$1.95 trillion ($1.4 trillion) annual economic output. Americans are among the top visitors.
Victoria's state capital Melbourne, Australia's second-biggest city and a major tourist drawcard, was blanketed in hazardous smoke on Tuesday although cooler weather had eased the fire danger.
The city's air quality dropped to the ""worst in the world"" overnight as cooler temperatures brought particles in the air close to the ground, a senior state health official said. Residents were advised to stay indoors, bring pets inside and keep windows closed.
In Melbourne, a tennis player collapsed in a coughing fit and retired from Australian Open qualifying as organizers faced a storm of criticism for plowing ahead with matches despite the hazardous air quality.
The bushfires have affected a number of elite sporting competitions over the Australian summer including soccer, rugby league and cricket, and poor air quality has raised fears for players' health at tennis's first Grand Slam of the year.
The fires have also created an ecological disaster for native species including koalas and rock wallabies.
PERSISTENT THREAT
Despite cooler weather this week, officials warned that bushfire threat was far from over. 
At least 145 fires continued to burn across Victoria and New South Wales (NSW) states although widespread rainfall is forecast for fire-hit areas on the east coast from Wednesday.
About 18 bushfires were yet to be contained in NSW, Australia's most populous state, while in Victoria authorities upgraded warnings to show one fire burning at an ""emergency level"" and seven fires at the 'Watch and Act' category, one level below emergency status.
Morrison's conservative government has faced domestic and international criticism for its handling of the fire threat and its response to climate change.
Climate scientists warned that Australia's fires were a harbinger of what was to come for the rest of the world as the planet warmed due to human activity.
""Temperature conditions in Australia are extreme at the moment but they are what we expect to happen on average in a world of three degrees of global warming,"" said Richard Betts, Head of Climate Impacts Research at Britain's Met Office Hadley Centre.
""It brings it home to you what climate change means.""

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will not refrain from ""teaching a lesson"" to Khalifa Haftar if his eastern Libyan forces continue attacks against the internationally recognized government in Tripoli, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday.
Turkey and Russia failed to convince Haftar on Monday to sign a binding truce to halt his nine-month campaign to try to conquer the Libyan capital from forces aligned with the internationally recognized government.
The initiative was the latest attempt to stabilize the North African country beset by turmoil since the toppling of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Fayez al-Serraj, who heads the Tripoli-based government, signed the truce proposal after indirect talks in Moscow on Monday, but Haftar left the Russian capital without signing.
The Russian defense ministry was quoted by Interfax news agency on Tuesday as saying Haftar had been positive about the ceasefire deal and was taking two days to consider it.
But Erdogan said Haftar had ""run away"". Turkey's parliament voted this month to allow a troop deployment to help the Tripoli government to fend off Haftar, who is backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan and Russian mercenaries.
""If the putschist Haftar's attacks against the people and legitimate government of Libya continue, we will never refrain from teaching him the lesson he deserves,"" Erdogan said in a speech to his AK Party lawmakers in parliament.
'OUR KIN'
""It is our duty to protect our kin in Libya,"" Erdogan added.
He said Turkey had deep historical and social ties with the north African country and that Haftar would have taken over the entire nation if Ankara had not intervened.
Turkey will join Germany, Britain and Russia at a summit on Libya in Berlin on Sunday, he said. 
Haftar's office and his forces have not officially confirmed the commander rejected the truce proposal, but a website linked to the forces said he would not sign.
Haftar and Serraj did not meet in Moscow directly, talking instead via Turkish and Russian mediators. They last met in Abu Dhabi in February 2019 before talks broke down over a power-sharing deal and Haftar moved his troops on Tripoli in April, after expanding his control beyond the east and south.
Serraj told Reuters in June he would never sit down again with Haftar.
Conflict in Libya has wrecked the economy, disrupted oil production and triggered flows of migration to Europe that have now largely been stemmed.

Haftar's troops have not been able to breach Tripoli's defenses but have in recent weeks made some small advances with help from Russian mercenaries, residents say. That has pushed Turkey, which has business interests in the country, to deploy soldiers to Libya to help the Tripoli government.

As things stand, a referendum cannot take place without the consent of the UK government. Sturgeon wrote to Johnson in December asking him to enter negotiations on transferring the power to hold a referendum from London to Edinburgh.
""I cannot agree to any request for a transfer of power that would lead to further independence referendums,"" Johnson wrote in a letter which he posted on Twitter.
He said he had told Sturgeon she had agreed that a 2014 referendum, in which Scots voted by 55%-45% to stay in the United Kingdom, would be a ""once in a generation"" vote.
He added: ""Another independence referendum would continue the political stagnation that Scotland has seen for the last decade ... it is time that we all worked to bring the whole of the United Kingdom together.""
Sturgeon argues that the 2016 vote to leave the European Union, with Britain set to leave the bloc on Jan. 31, warrants a new independence referendum because Scots overwhelming voted against Brexit while a majority of English voters supported it. 
Polls suggest that Scots would narrowly reject independence again although Sturgeon's Scottish National Party won 48 of Scotland's 59 seats in Britain's national election last month, taking 45% of votes cast, an 8 percentage-point increase from 2017. 
The Scottish first minister said Johnson's response to her request was predictable and that he was blocking another vote because he did not have a positive case for keeping the more than 300-year-old union. 
""While today's response is not surprising - indeed we anticipated it - it will not stand,"" Sturgeon said in a statement.
""It is not politically sustainable for any Westminster government to stand in the way of the right of the people of Scotland to decide their own future and to seek to block the clear democratic mandate for an independence referendum.""
She said the Scottish government would set out its next steps later this month and would seek the devolved Scottish parliament's backing again for another plebiscite.

""Democracy will prevail,"" she added.

LONDON (Reuters) - As the 1st Brigade Combat Team of the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division departed for the Middle East amid rising tensions with Iran, their divisional commander gave a simple order. All personnel entering the region were told to leave smartphones and personal devices in the United States.
It was a clear sign of growing official nervousness over the potential vulnerability of items that had become an unquestioned fact of life for soldiers and civilians alike, but which Washington fears potential foes could track, exploit and use for targeting. Such concerns are far from new, but were regarded less seriously when America's primary enemies were seen as non-state groups such as Islamic State, the Taliban and al Qaeda. Now Washington is worried about other nations – not just Iran, but Russia and China – which are seen as a much more existential threat.
It also points to a much greater trend. Across the board, the communications revolution – and the vast sea of data it produces – has made surveillance much easier, a trend likely to be magnified by the growth of artificial intelligence. It has also facilitated the mass leaking of phenomenal amounts of information, as demonstrated by NSA contractor Edward Snowden. And simultaneously, it has overturned decades of tradecraft in espionage and associated fields, where despite the rise in ""fake news"" and online trickery, spy agencies like the CIA now reportedly find it almost impossible to maintain the multiple false identities on which they once relied.
""The foundations of the business of espionage have been shattered,"" former CIA official Duyane Norman said in a Yahoo (NASDAQ:AABA) news report, which outlined how foreign governments have become much better at tracking real and covert U.S. identities through phone and bank records, facial recognition and even the records of off-the-shelf DNA tests. ""The debate [within the intelligence community] is like the one surrounding climate change. Anyone who says otherwise just isn't looking at the facts.""
OPTIONS LIMITED
For military commanders, the options are also becoming limited. In Russia's war with Ukraine, Moscow's forces have shown remarkable skill in targeting counterparts on the battlefield as soon as they use their phones or radios. According to the U.S.-based Military Times, the U.S. Marine Corps already bans troops from taking personal devices on Middle East combat deployments. The U.S. Navy says it is reconsidering its rules, while the Army says such decisions - as with the 82nd Airborne - are at the personal discretion of commanders.
Decisions are inevitably compromises. Taking away devices reduces the ability of personnel not just to talk to their families, but can complicate communications and organization. But concerns are growing fast. This month, the Pentagon also demanded personnel stop using the Chinese-owned TikTok application, with other similar platforms including WhatsApp also added to some blacklists.
Reducing ""careless talk"" and unnecessary radio and other emissions is hardly new. As far back as World War One, British commanders discovered telephone systems in forward trenches had often been compromised by German signallers and did everything they could to ensure the most sensitive messages were instead carried by hand or word-of-mouth. Naval vessels, military aircraft and particularly submarines have long done everything possible to mask their signatures, particularly near enemy territory. Recent years, however, have seen growing lapses, including from those who might have been expected to know better.
FITNESS APP
In early 2018, data released by fitness app Strava identified assorted U.S., Russian and even Iranian secret bases in Syria where military personnel and contractors appeared to have recorded their exercise runs without realizing they would be highlighted and widely shared. The U.S. military has now gone so far as to incorporate such mistakes into training exercises, killing off an entire unit in one drill after a soldier posted a selfie photo whose geo-tagging gave away their position.
Authorities are also nervous about non-accidental release of information. This November, White House and military staff removed smartphones from reporters and presidential aides for the duration of President Donald Trump's unannounced Thanksgiving trip to Afghanistan, which appeared as much about ensuring the news did not leak as worries the phones themselves might be tracked.
In terms of the latter, the greatest threat will come when artificial intelligence and voice recognition software reach the point where phones can be used to monitor nearby conversations without use of a human analyst or translator. That may come sooner rather than later – one reason why some security experts are extremely nervous about Chinese firm Huawei being at the heart of 5G phone networks in several European countries. That may include Britain, due to make its own choice soon. This week, the head of Britain's Security Service told the Financial Times he believed that risk can be managed without barring the Chinese firm altogether. U.S. counterparts, however, are much more cautious.
For authoritarian states like China and Iran, both witnessing a major spike in often smartphone-coordinated protest and unrest, being able to access and track electronic devices – and the population at large – is seen as a priority. Most notably in Xinjiang province but also across the country, Beijing is turning China into the most sophisticated surveillance state in human history. Within its borders, China already has considerable, sometimes almost exhaustive, access to data and devices. Faster and more incisive artificial intelligence and machine learning will dramatically extend that reach.
The question for Western states will be how effectively their potential foes can repurpose that technology to gather information outside their borders. The United States and its allies have become used to being able to use whatever devices and communications they wished since the Berlin wall fell. Those days are ending fast.

The 2012 attack on the 23-year old physiotherapy student on the moving bus shocked India and led to tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases.
The victim died from her injuries two weeks later in hospital in Singapore.
The court said that there were no grounds to review its decision upholding the death sentence for the four men, all from working class neighborhood in the Indian capital.
""We have gone through the curative petitions and relevant documents. In our opinion, no case is made out within the parameters indicated in the decision of this court,"" the court said its order.
The men were convicted in 2013 and lost all appeals in a higher court. Last week, a Delhi court said they would be hanged on Jan. 22.
The family of the victim welcomed the court ruling.
""I am feeling good. We want to see them hanged. Only then will justice be served to our daughter who died in pain,"" said her father.
Sexual violence against women is a huge problem in India where a rape occurs every 20 minutes. Many of the cases have drawn revulsion and anger across the country.
A. P. Singh, a lawyer for the four defendants, said that he would read the written order of the court and decide the next course of action."

The law is part of a series of measures against what the government deems unfair foreign influence that are linked to its feud with Budapest-born U.S. billionaire George Soros. Prime Minister Viktor Orban has repeatedly accused non-governmental organizations (NGOs) funded by Soros of political meddling.
The crackdown has led the European Parliament to open a procedure against Hungary for allegedly breaching EU fundamental rights that could lead to the suspension of the country's voting rights in the EU.
Tuesday' opinion, which is not binding on the court but is likely to be upheld in the final ruling, is a new blow to Orban's government, which is accused in Brussels of limiting its citizens' rights with a series of laws that could restrict the independence of judges, the media and civil society.
The law requires civil organizations that receive funding from abroad to disclose in a public online register their foreign funders with donations exceeding 500,000 Hungarian forints ($1,670), once their foreign funding reaches a threshold set by the authorities.
The legal adviser to the European Court of Justice said the 2017 law violated the principle of free movement of capital within the 28-country bloc because it required disclosure only for foreign funding.
The law also unduly interferes with fundamental rights, such as the respect of private life and the protection of personal data, as it requires a disproportionate disclosure of donors' personal information, legal adviser Manuel Campos Sanchez-Bordona said.
Opinions of legal advisers are usually reflected in the court's subsequent rulings. If Hungary is found to be in breach of EU rules, it must change the law or face the risk of fines."

POHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - Hundreds of South Korean students braved freezing winter temperatures this week to test themselves against the rigors of Marine Corps boot camp.
First started in 1997, the week-long camp aims to challenge participants with its physical activities, but also inspire potential recruits for South Korea's massive military.
Nearly 600,000 South Korean troops are stationed around the country, aimed largely at deterring North Korea across the heavily fortified Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) that divides the two countries.
Dressed in combat uniforms, the mix of young men and women clambered aboard armored amphibious vehicles on Tuesday in a mock beach invasion that included smoke bombs.
More demanding activities included carrying heavy rubber boats along the beach, running through obstacle courses and learning to march.
""I was surprised because the training was more challenging than I’d thought, but I made it,"" Moon Eun-ji, an 18-year-old high school student who wants to become a Marine.
Kim Tae-un, a physical education teacher, said he brought his students to the camp to help them develop mental strength.
""Although it is very difficult, we are having a good time by relying on each other, helping each other and communicating,"" he said.
Faced with a declining number of eligible young men, South Korea's military is planning to shrink the number of active duty troops from almost 600,000 to 500,000 by 2025, while spending billions of dollars on new weapons to modernize the force, according to the Ministry of Defence.
South Korea is one the few countries in the world that has compulsory conscription for all able-bodied men, but that has come under increasing scrutiny, with the Supreme Court allowing for conscientious objection for the first time in 2018.
The government also announced that the commitment would be shortened. By this summer, new Marine Corps conscripts, for example, will be facing 18 months of service instead of 21."

""We won't mention the reason, but there have been many tweets about climbing inside large musical instrument cases. A warning after any unfortunate accident would be too late, so we ask everyone not to try it,"" the Japanese company said in a post on its twitter account on Jan. 11.
Ghosn, who is accused of hiding earnings, transferring investment losses to Nissan and misappropriating company funds, escaped from Japan at the end of December for Lebanon. Japanese authorities have vowed to pursue him and have issued an international wanted notice for him and his wife Carole.
The former auto executive and fugitive has declined to reveal how he slipped past Japanese airport security, or confirm media reports accomplices smuggled him through a private jet lounge in Kansai Airport in western Japan hidden in large speaker box that was too large to fit through the facility's X-ray scanner. 
Earlier reports, which Ghosn has dismissed, said he was carried out of his home in Tokyo in a double bass case. 

Yamaha, which makes instruments and equipment ranging from pianos and double basses to drums and heavy duty speakers, thanked people in second tweet for liking its first post, which was retweeted more than 50,000 times. It also reminded followers again that instrument cases are designed for instruments and not people.

In neighboring India, at least 10 people were killed after several avalanches hit the northern-part of Indian-administered Kashmir. 
Two Pakistani officials said many villagers were still stranded by the avalanches in the Neelum valley area following heavy rain that also triggered landslides. Many people were reported missing and feared dead as rescue efforts got under way, one of the officials said.
Meanwhile in western Pakistan, heavy snowfall in southwestern Balochistan destroyed several houses in the mountainous region, killing 17 people. 
The disaster management authority declared an emergency in seven districts of the mineral-rich province and sought the army's help for relief and rescue operations.
Key highways connecting Pakistan and Afghanistan were blocked due to heavy snow, forcing officials to suspend transportation of essential goods into Afghanistan.
Severe cold and heavy snow led to the death of 39 people in six provinces of Afghanistan in the past two weeks said Tamim Azimi, a spokesman for Afghanistan's Natural Disaster Management Authority in Kabul.
""We are distributing emergency assistance, including cash to families of the victims,"" said Azimi, adding that heavy rain and snow have hampered for rescuers.
A senior Indian police official said five soldiers were among the 10 killed near the border between India and Pakistan.
The area is one of the world's most militarily tense frontiers, where the neighboring armies have confronted each other over disputed territory for decades. Kashmir has been divided between Indian and Pakistan since their independence in 1947.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Cambodian opposition party leader Kem Sokha is set to go on trial on treason charges on Wednesday in a closely watched case as the European Union mulls suspending trade benefits over the Southeast Asian nation's human rights record.
It could take up to three months to deliver a verdict, defense lawyers said on Tuesday, meaning the case could still be ongoing by the time the European Union (EU) makes a final decision on its trade policy next month.
Kem Sokha was arrested in 2017 and his opposition Cambodia National Rescue Party was banned ahead of a 2018 election in which the party of longtime leader Hun Sen won all the parliamentary seats.
He was freed from house arrest in November but a ban on his engaging in political activity was kept in place.
The treason charges stem from accusations that Kem Sokha was conspiring with the United States to overthrow Hun Sen. He denies the charges, saying they are politically motivated.
Many other opposition figures have fled into exile and have accused Hun Sen, who has ruled Cambodia for 35 years, of establishing a one-party state.
One of Kem Sokha's attorneys, Chan Chen, said a court official had informed him that trial may take up to three months.
The EU, which accounts for nearly half of Cambodia's exports, will decide in February whether or not to remove Cambodia from its Everything But Arms trade scheme over its crackdown on the political expression.
The only evidence presented against Kem Sokha in public so far is a comment he made at a public meeting in which he said he was getting advice from unspecified Americans on election strategy ahead of a 2013 ballot.
Kem Sokha's daughter Monovithya Kem called the trial against her father a ""farce"" as rights groups urged the case to be dismissed.
""We hope that he will be acquitted if the court has any interest at all in starting to demonstrate its independence,"" his daughter said.
Amnesty International called the charges ""bogus"", saying authorities have not presented a shred of credible evidence to support them.
Ministry of Justice spokesperson Chin Malin declined to comment and Phnom Penh Municipal Court spokesman Y Rin couldn't be reached for comment on Tuesday."

The former aide accused the former deputy premier last month of trying to force him to have sex in September 2018. Anwar denied the accusation, describing it as ""politics at its worst"".
Solicitor general Engku Nor Faizah Engku Atek said that the investigation would be closed.
""Upon careful evaluation of all the evidence gathered in the investigation papers submitted by the (police), we found contradictions of material facts which could not support the prosecution of any person,"" she said in a statement.
Engku Nor Faizah also said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute.
The solicitor general's statement did not name Anwar or the accuser, but referred to allegations against a ""political personality"" in early December.
Anwar and Muhammed Yusoff's lawyer did not have an immediate comment.
Anwar spent nearly a decade in jail on two separate counts of sodomy and for corruption, charges that he and his supporters maintain were aimed at ending his political career. He was first jailed in 1999.
Same-sex acts are illegal in Muslim-majority Malaysia and carry penalties of up to 20 years in jail.
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 94, has promised to hand over power to Anwar despite the allegations.
Anwar was first jailed during Mahathir's first 1981-2003 tenure as premier. The pair joined forces to lead the opposition to an unexpected election victory last year.
Last week, Malaysia's attorney general declined to prosecute anyone linked to a series of leaked videos purportedly showing a senior cabinet minister having sex with a man. The minister, Azmin Ali, had denied links to the videos, saying they were a plot to end his political career.
Azmin has been regarded as a possible challenger for the premiership promised to Anwar."

LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday called on U.S. President Donald Trump to replace the Iranian nuclear deal with his own new agreement to ensure that the Islamic Republic did not get an atomic weapon.
""If we're going to get rid of it, let's replace it and let's replace it with the Trump deal,"" Johnson said of the 2015 nuclear arms control deal with Tehran. ""That would be a great way forward.""
""President Trump is a great deal maker, by his own account. Let's work together to replace the JCPOA and get the Trump deal instead,"" Johnson told the BBC.
Under the deal brokered in 2015, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Iran agreed with China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, to restrict its nuclear program.
But in 2018, Trump pulled out of the deal. European powers have repeatedly said they still support the deal though Tehran announced earlier this month it would abandon limitations on enriching uranium, a further blow to the deal.
""If you get rid of this nuclear deal, the JCPOA, it's what Trump wants. My point to our American friends is, look, somehow or other you've got to stop the Iranians acquiring a nuclear weapon,"" Johnson said.
""From the American perspective, it's a flawed agreement, it expires, plus it was negotiated by President (Barack) Obama. From their point of view it has many, many faults.""
Trump is confident he could still renegotiate a new nuclear deal with Tehran, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said earlier this month after Iran announced it would retreat further from the 2015 nuclear pact. 

""I don't want a military conflict between us, the United States and Iran, let's dial this thing down,"" Johnson said.

The move is part of the provincial government's effort to ""accelerate the promotion of new urbanization"" and improve county-level economies, Ma said while delivering the province's annual work report.
The Chinese government has encouraged the relaxation of residency restrictions in many of its smaller cities to help boost the urban population and revive slowing economic growth.
Guangdong's move follows guidelines from the State Council in December which called for the full removal of resident restrictions in cities with populations under 3 million, and the relaxation of restrictions in cities with populations of 3 to 5 million.
China has a population of around 1.4 billion people and household registration permits, known as ""hukou"", have been used to control internal migration for decades. Without a permit, a city resident is denied access to many public services such as education and healthcare. Such restrictions have often been blamed for pushing migrants to the margins of society in China's cities.
Guangdong is China's most populous province, with 113.5 million people in 2018, according to the provincial bureau of statistics. It has six cities with under 3 million people and three in the 3 to 5 million range.
Ma said that the province saw estimated economic growth of around 6.4% in 2019. Ma announced a 6% provincial growth target for 2020.
Shandong, China's second-most populous province, will also follow suit in easing the household restrictions for smaller cities, according to local media reports of a provincial housing conference held in Jinan last week."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia is concerned about India's new curbs on imports of palm oil after a diplomatic row, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Tuesday, but indicated he would continue to speak out against ""wrong things"" even if it costs his country financially.
India, the world's biggest buyer of edible oils, last week changed rules that traders say effectively ban imports of refined palm oil from Malaysia, the world's second-biggest producer and exporter of palm oil after Indonesia.
The move came after New Delhi objected to Mahathir's criticism of India's new religion-based citizenship law. The 94-year-old premier, whose outspoken nature has soured ties with both India and Saudi Arabia in recent months, earlier accused India of invading the disputed Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.
As Malaysian palm refiners stare at a massive loss of business, Mahathir said his government would find a solution.
""We are concerned of course because we sell a lot of palm oil to India, but on the other hand we need to be frank and see that if something goes wrong, we will have to say it,"" he told reporters. ""If we allow things to go wrong and think only about the money involved, then I think a lot of wrong things will be done, by us and by other people.""
The benchmark palm oil contract for March delivery was down 0.9% in afternoon trade.
Reuters reported on Monday the Indian government had informally instructed traders to stay away from Malaysian palm oil. Indian traders are instead buying Indonesian crude palm oil at a premium of $10 ton over Malaysian prices.
India's foreign ministry said on Thursday the palm curbs were not country specific but that ""for any commercial trading, the status of relationship between any two countries"" is something a business would consider.
India was Malaysia's biggest buyer of palm oil in 2019, with 4.4 million tons of purchases. In 2020, purchases could fall below 1 million tonnes if relations don't improve, Indian traders say.
To make up for the potential loss, Malaysian officials say they are trying to sell more to Pakistan, the Philippines, Myanmar, Vietnam, Ethiopia, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Algeria and Jordan.
But replacing the top buyer won't be easy, and that's why the Malaysian Trades Union Congress, whose members include palm workers, has urged the two countries to talk things out.
""We wish to implore upon both governments to use all possible diplomatic channels to resolve this issue putting aside any personal or diplomatic ego,"" it said in a statement.
Malaysia's Primary Industries Ministry, supported by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, is engaging with its Indian counterparts to try and sort out the issue, according to a Malaysian government source aware of the discussions. He declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to the media.
The ministries could not immediately be reached for comment."

Suspected followers of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen have been targeted in a sustained crackdown since a failed putsch in July 2016 in which some 250 people were killed. Operations against the network are still routine.
The latest police operation was coordinated from the western city of Izmir and targeted people in 49 provinces, Anadolu said. It said those facing arrest included 143 lieutenants, 97 of them serving, and 33 junior lieutenants, 11 of them serving.
Six F-16 warplane pilots were among those set to be detained, it added.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied any involvement in the attempted coup.

The reforms, crafted by the attorney general's office and presidential aides, are expected to be presented in the Senate on Wednesday and potentially passed during a new legislative session that begins in February.
Mexican law enforcement agencies have suffered several spectacular security setbacks since Lopez Obrador came to power a year ago, and his government, which controls both chambers of Congress, is scrambling to address growing insecurity nationwide.
The reform would amend several articles of the constitution, create a new criminal code, set out new procedures, modify an existing law that details legal challenges, and change the legal framework of the attorney general's office and its regulations.
""It's a very ambitious, broad reform,"" Sen. Ricardo Monreal, a key legislative leader in Lopez Obrador's leftist Morena party, told Reuters.
Interior Minister Olga Sanchez, Security Minister Alfonso Durazo, Lopez Obrador's judicial advisor Julio Scherer, and Attorney General Alejandro Gertz would attend a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the reform, Monreal said.
During the past year, Mexicans have seen cartel gunmen temporarily take over a major city, incidents in which soldiers have come under attack from heavily-armed bandits, as well as the gangland ambush in November of nine members of a family that included U.S. citizens."

Czech President Milos Zeman has pushed ties with China. But the capital's government has taken a much harder line, including Prague Mayor Zdenek Hrib's refusal to eject a Taiwanese diplomat from a conference at the demand of a Chinese official, and his decision to fly the Tibetan flag at City Hall to highlight human rights issues.
Billions of dollars worth of Chinese investments in the country have also not materialized.
Taiwan is China's most sensitive diplomatic issue, as the island is claimed by Beijing as Chinese territory to be taken by force if needed. China has stepped up pressure on foreign governments to fall into line in accepting its claims.
On Monday, Hrib and Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je signed a sister city agreement in Prague along with other cultural and tourism deals.
The government of Shanghai, mainland China's most cosmopolitan city and its financial hub, said in a statement that Prague's government had made many missteps on Chinese core issues such as Taiwan.
They have ""wantonly interfered in China's internal politics and publicly challenged the 'one China' principle"", it said. ""The Shanghai city government and people strongly rebuke this and express their stern opposition.""
Owing to the disappearance of the right ""political preconditions"", Shanghai will immediately suspend all official interactions with Prague, it added.
China is already angry with Taiwan after President Tsai Ing-wen won re-election by a landslide last weekend in a campaign in which she routinely denounced China's efforts at intimidation and said Taiwan would not be bullied into submission.
Tsai says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name, and points out that the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan.
Taipei Mayor Ko is no supporter of Taiwan's formal independence. He visited Shanghai last year and has said that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait are part of ""one family"".
Ko is widely expected to stand for the presidency in the 2024 elections."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking to build close ties with Washington, had previously invited Trump to attend India's annual Republic Day parade later this month, but the U.S. officials said it would clash with the president's State of the Union address.
""There has been an open invitation for him to visit, both sides are working out the dates,"" one of the sources said.
Another source said Trump could come in the second half of February and that he may visit a second city besides the national capital Delhi.
The Indian foreign ministry did not have an immediate comment on the proposed visit.
India and the United States have built close political and security ties, but in recent years trade frictions have come to the fore. Trump has frequently named India as one of the countries with the highest tariffs in the world and withdrawn a key trade concession for that reason.
The two sides have been trying to work out a new and limited trade pact on lowering tariffs, but these negotiations have run into problems over broader issues of data privacy and controls over e-commerce."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's human rights commission on Tuesday condemned plans by a mayor to launch raids targeting the LGBT community in his city after a local man was convicted in Britain of sexually assaulting 48 men.
Described by a prosecutor as ""the most prolific rapist in British legal history"", Indonesian student Reynhard Sinaga last month was convicted of 136 rapes against the men, whom he drugged, and given a life sentence with a minimum term of 30 years.
The mayor of Depok, Mohammad Idris, plans to enlist public order officers to raid residences of members of the LGBT community, according to a statement posted last week on the city's official website.
Homosexuality is not regulated by law in Indonesia, except in Aceh province where Islamic law bans same-sex relations. But the world's largest Muslim-majority nation has seen a rise in hostility toward the LGBT community.
""The raids increase the risk of persecution and other law-defying acts,"" the head of National Commission on Human Rights, Beka Ulung Hapsara, told Reuters.
The commission has also written to the Depok government.
Idris did not respond to Reuters requests for comment.
In the statement, Idris also said the town would establish a rehabilitative center to assist ""victims"" in the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community.
The Sinaga case has received widespread coverage in Indonesia and left many in the already vulnerable LGBT community feeling even more under fire.
Dede Oetomo, an Indonesian LGBT activist, said the community was braced for hysteria over the Sinaga case.
A 22-year-old Indonesian student living in Depok, who identifies as bisexual and declined to be identified, slammed the move, saying it ""violates private spaces"" and was a waste of money.
Nearly 90% of Indonesians who understand the term LGBT feel ""threatened"" by the community and believe their religion forbids same-sex relations, according to a 2018 survey.
Arus Pelangi, an LGBT advocacy group, reported in September more than 1,800 cases of persecution of gay Indonesians between 2006 and 2017."

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's new president takes office on Tuesday under pressure from the Trump administration on immigration and security and must decide his government's stance quickly on a U.S. asylum agreement he previously opposed.
A conservative former surgeon and ex-prison chief, Alejandro Giammattei, 63, ran for top office three times before his victory in an August runoff on a tough-on-crime platform that included returning the death penalty.  
""We will bring back the peace this country so dearly needs,"" he told reporters on Monday, promising to overhaul the Central American nation's security forces and restructure ministries.
But at the top of his to-do list will be a decision on whether to roll back or expand an agreement with the United States forged by outgoing President Jimmy Morales that makes Guatemala a buffer zone to reduce U.S. asylum claims.
Acting U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf, part of the U.S. delegation headed by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross for the inauguration, is expected to push Giammattei to expand the agreement to include Mexicans.
Giammattei, who in the past has suggested he would seek to change the Asylum Cooperation Agreement (ACA), appeared to soften his stance on Monday, saying he had not yet seen the deal's details.
Guatemala is central to U.S. President Donald Trump's escalating efforts to end illegal immigration and asylum claims from people making their way to the southwestern U.S. border.
Guatemala is one of Latin America's poorest and unequal nations, with poverty increasing since 2000 despite strong economic growth rates, according to the World Bank. U.S. officials have threatened it with economic consequences if it fails to accept the ACA.
Under the deal, implemented in November, the United States sends Hondurans and El Salvadorans seeking asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border to Guatemala to ask for refuge there instead.
As of Friday, 128 Salvadoran and Honduran asylum seekers had been sent as part of the agreement, according to the Guatemalan Migration Institute. Only a handful have applied for asylum in a country that is itself a major source of U.S. bound migrants. Others have returned home.
CRIME AND CORRUPTION
Giammattei inherits a nation suffering from the corrosive effects of drug trafficking on politics and the distrust sowed by last year's forced departure of a United Nations-backed anti-corruption body.
Another looming decision will be whether to act on the recommendation of a congressional panel last week that judges and investigators who worked with the anti-corruption body, known as CICIG, be arrested.
CICIG helped topple sitting President Otto Perez Molina on corruption charges in 2015 and put dozens of politicians and businessmen behind bars, before a backlash led Morales to drive the body from Guatemala in September.
Morales, himself investigated by the agency on election financing charges he denies, is due to be sworn into the Central American parliament a few hours after he leaves office, in a position offering him immunity.
On the bright side, Guatemala’s homicide rate is down - to 22 murders per 100,000 in 2018 residents from 45 per 100,000 in 2009.
But the freedom with which drug traffickers influence politics is a challenge. Ahead of last year's election, presidential candidate and occasional Morales ally Mario Estrada was arrested in Miami on charges of seeking funding from drug cartels and conspiring to assassinate rivals. 
""We realized that narco-trafficking here is among the most intense in the region,"" Luis Hernandez Azmitia, an outgoing congressional representative of the Movimiento Reformador party told Reuters.
Last year, 49 drug-smuggling aircraft used by cartels were found in Guatemala, according to local media reports. Authorities invoked emergency powers to regain control of one area of the country, where coca plantations and cocaine laboratories were discovered hidden in the hills."

DES MOINES, Iowa (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg was endorsed by veteran Iowa Congressman Dave Loebsack on Sunday, a high-profile boost for the White House hopeful just three weeks before the party's nominating contest begins in Iowa on Feb. 3.
The backing of Buttigieg by the seven-term congressman follows the endorsement this month of Joe Biden by another Iowa U.S. lawmaker, freshman congresswoman Abby Finkenauer. The third Democratic member of Iowa's House delegation, Cindy Axne, has not yet endorsed a presidential candidate.
Endorsements by members of Congress in their home states are particularly coveted for presidential candidates, because of their name recognition among local voters and their potential to deliver support. Loebsack represents Iowa's second congressional district in southeast Iowa, a swing region that narrowly backed Republican President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.
""I'm proud to announce that I'm endorsing Pete Buttigieg to be the next president of the United States,” Loebsack said in a statement. ""Pete offers a new kind of leadership that we desperately need. He's a Midwestern mayor, a veteran, and is from a new generation.""
Loebsack was due to introduce Buttigieg at an event in Des Moines, Iowa on Sunday evening.
Buttigieg, who turns 38 next week, was until this month the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, and spent seven months in Afghanistan with the U.S. Navy Reserves.
He has moved into a top tier of four candidates in both Iowa and New Hampshire, the first two states to vote in the Democrats’ nominating contest to pick a candidate to take on Trump in November's general election.
Iowa and New Hampshire are being closely contested by Buttigieg, former Vice President Joe Biden, and U.S. Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, according to polls."

Taekwondo champion Kimia Alizadeh, who won a bronze medal at the 2016 Rio Olympics, implied in an Instagram post that she had moved to Europe. She wrote on an account she has used for some time, but it was not immediately possible to verify her location.
""No one has invited me to Europe and I haven't been given a tempting offer. But I accept the pain and hardship of homesickness because I didn't want to be part of hypocrisy, lies, injustice and flattery,"" she said.
Mahin Farhadizadeh, a deputy Iranian sports minister, said: ""I have not read Kimia's post, but as far as I know she always wanted to continue her studies in physiotherapy,"" the semi-official ISNA news agency reported.
Alizadeh said the Islamic Republic's authorities had attributed her success to their management and the fact that she wore the Islamic veil, which is obligatory in Iran.
""I am one of the millions of oppressed women in Iran whom they've been playing for years... I wore whatever they told me and repeated whatever they ordered. Every sentence they ordered I repeated,"" she wrote.
""None of us matter for them, we are just tools.""
She said that while the government exploited her medals politically, officials would humiliate her with remarks such as ""It is not virtuous for a woman to stretch her legs!""
Alizadeh said at the time of her medal in the 57kg category that it had made her happy for Iranian girls.
On Sunday she appeared torn by her decision.
""Should I start with hello, goodbye or condolences? Hello oppressed people of Iran, goodbye noble people of Iran, my condolences to you people who are always mourning,"" she wrote.
In the past week, 176 people, many Iranians with dual citizenship, were killed when the Iranian military mistakenly shot a Ukrainian airliner down, and at least 56 died in a stampede at the funeral for an Iranian military commander killed by a U.S. air strike.
Alizadeh is the third top Iranian sports person to stop representing the country in recent months.
In December, Iran’s Chess Federation said top rated chess champion Alireza Firouzja had decided not to play for Iran over its informal ban on competing against Israeli players.

SRINAGAR (Reuters) - A senior police officer has been arrested in Indian Kashmir and accused of aiding militants after he was found driving two suspected insurgents toward Jammu, Kashmir's chief of police told reporters on Sunday.
The Muslim-majority Kashmir valley, claimed by both India and Pakistan, has been in turmoil since New Delhi announced in August that it would strip the territory of its long-held autonomy and statehood.
Arguing that special provisions for the region had hindered its development and fueled separatism, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government separated the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into two federally-controlled territories at the end of October.
The police officer, Divinder Singh, was arrested on Saturday along with two suspected militants, police chief Vijay Kumar said.
He named one of those Singh was arrested with as Naveed Mushtaq. Police officers have said previously they believe Mushtaq was involved in the killing of 11 apple traders, drivers and laborers last year.
""We have registered a case against (Singh) under the arms, explosives and unlawful activities acts,"" Kumar said. ""It is a sensitive case and we don't want any loopholes,"" he added, saying that Singh would be treated as a militant and jointly interrogated by all the intelligence agencies.
Reuters was unable to contact Singh, Mushtaq or their representatives for comment.
It is unusual for a serving police officer to be accused of involvement in Kashmir's 30-year insurgency.
Singh has played an active role in anti-militancy operations in Kashmir for which he received a gallantry award in 2019. It was not immediately clear how or why he came to be traveling with the suspected insurgents.
Mushtaq, who was arrested with Singh, was also a member of the Jammu and Kashmir police until 2017, two senior police officers told Reuters on Sunday.
In a separate incident, three members of the Hizbul Mujahideen group, including their top commander, Hamad Khan, were killed in a gun battle in Kashmir on Sunday, Kumar said.
The Hizbul Mujahideen is one of the largest groups fighting against Indian rule in Muslim-majority Kashmir.
""On specific information about presence of militants in the village, we cordoned off the area and asked them to surrender. They refused...and fired on troops, leading to a gun battle in which they were killed,"" said Kumar, adding that the incident took place in southern Kashmir's Tral area.
The Hizbul Mujahideen group have not publicaly commented and could not be reached by Reuters."

Speaking to national broadcaster RTE, Varadkar said he would meet his cabinet on Tuesday before announcing the date. He would have preferred to go to the country in summer but the parliamentary arithmetic has changed, he added. 
A minority government led by Varadkar's center-right Fine Gael has ruled since 2016 after an initial three-year cooperation deal with Micheal Martin's Fianna Fail was extended through to 2020 due to uncertainty created by Brexit talks.
With Britain set to leave the European Union at the end of this month, Varadkar and Martin had both said an election should be held by May.
However a demand by Varadkar for Fianna Fail support on a number of additional issues between now and then has raised the prospect of a snap election as early as next month if the parties cannot agree a short legislative program.
""I have made a decision but there is some respective protocol around this so I would like to speak to the cabinet and the leader of the opposition,"" said the prime minister.
""The cabinet will meet on Tuesday and the Dail (the lower house of parliament) will reconvene on Wednesday.""
Varadkar held talks with Martin last week to discuss the matter and is due to meet him again this week.
Independent lawmaker Michael Lowry, on whose support the government depends, said he expected Varadkar to call the election in early February. The headline in the Irish version of Sunday Times, meanwhile, proclaimed: ""Leo Varadkar poised to call election for February 7"". 

Fine Gael and center-right Fianna Fail are closely matched in opinion polls, and some distance ahead of their other rivals, increasingly the likelihood that whoever edges ahead at the next election will lead another minority government.

MANILA (Reuters) - A volcano near the Philippines capital spewed ash up to 15 km (nine miles) into the sky on Sunday, prompting the evacuation of thousands of people, the cancellation of flights and warnings of a possible explosive eruption and volcanic tsunami.
Taal volcano, one of the country's most active, is in the middle of a lake about 70 km (45 miles) south of the center of the capital, Manila. As tremors shook the area, volcanic lightning flickered in the column of steam and ash. 
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs) raised its alert level to 4 out of 5 - meaning ""hazardous explosive eruption is possible within hours to days"".
Phivolcs also warned of possible hazards of a volcanic tsunami and rapid currents of hot gas and volcanic matter that could hit areas around the Taal lake, a popular weekend getaway from Manila.
Evacuation of about 8,000 residents of the volcano island and other high-risk towns is underway, with about 6,000 already out of the danger zone as of early Sunday evening, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council told reporters.
Ash fell as far away as Manila, prompting the suspension of flights at the capital's busy international airport. General Manager Ed Monreal said the suspension would continue into Monday because there was ash on the runway.
Local authorities canceled school classes scheduled for Monday and urged people to stay indoors.
President Rodrigo Duterte had instructed authorities to move people within the perimeter of Taal out of the danger zone, his spokesman said in a statement.
The ash plume was clearly visible from the nearby city of Tagaytay, a well-frequented viewing spot for the volcano. 
""We were having lunch when we heard rumbling. We saw the volcano erupting. It rained and some small pebbles fell to the ground,"" Jon Patrick Yen, a restaurant customer in Tagaytay, told Reuters. 

""I did not expect to see such spectacle. We just went by to eat.""

The election will be the first under Nobel Peace Laureate Abiy, who took office in April 2018 and launched political and economic reforms.
His reform agenda has also stoked violence and highlighted ethnic divisions in the country of about 105 million people, and the election board said last June that the security situation could delay the 2020 election.
""On the schedule, I am not sure whether it is May or June, because the schedule will be declared by the election board but I think we will conduct an election this year because it is a constitutional mandate,"" Abiy said in response to a question at a media briefing with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.
""There might be lots of challenges, not only logistics but also peace and security... It is better for Ethiopians and for Ethiopian parties to conduct the election on time in a very peaceful and democratic manner,"" he said.
Ahmed is on an official state visit to South Africa. The two governments signed agreements to enhance cooperation, including on tourism and health.
Ethiopia has regularly held elections since 1995 but, with the exception of the 2005 election, no election has been competitive.
In the 2005 election, riots erupted after the opposition cried foul, security forces killed nearly 200 protesters, and the government jailed many opposition politicians.
Opposition politicians have warned against any delay in the election, and critics have said that postponing the vote could cause an adverse social reaction, fuel regional conflicts and damage Abiy's democratic credentials."

KABUL (Reuters) - A severe cold snap killed at least 17 people in Afghanistan on Saturday, government officials said, as heavy snowfall and rain continued to lash parts of the country.
Afghanistan is no stranger to extreme winter weather, during which various warring groups in the country have historically ceased hostilities, but this year has been particularly harsh, according to the country's metrological department.
The officials said the death toll could rise further, with Afghanistan's Natural Disaster Management Authority still trying to compile a total figure.
""We were not expecting such a bad cold wave in the country,"" Tamim Azimi, a spokesman for the Natural Disaster Management team told Reuters.
""We have received reports that heavy snowfall has caused casualties, but at the moment we don't have information on the exact number,"" he said.
Saturday's deaths bring the number of casualties from this year's cold snap to at least 24, as temperatures in parts of the country dropped to minus 12 degrees Celsius (10 Fahrenheit).
Heavy snowfall has closed many key roads since the New Year, including the Salang Tunnel connecting central Afghanistan with the north of the country, and the Kabul-Kandahar highway.
Afghanistan's western province of Herat has also been hit badly. On Saturday, heavy snow caused the roofs of two houses to collapse, killing at least eight people, including women and children, a spokesman for the province's governor said.
Other parts of the country have experienced heavy rainfall.
""We're now expecting more cold waves in the coming weeks,"" said Mohammad Nasim Muradi, the head of the forecasting wing of the meteorological department.
The United Nations had previously estimated that at least nine million Afghans are in need of humanitarian aid, including basic food and housing amid a drawn out war that has so far displaced hundreds of thousands of people."

The rulers of Qatar and the United Arab Emirate, which are locked in a protracted dispute, were among those who visited the royal palace in Muscat as was the foreign minister of Iran, which is an arch-foe of U.S.-allied Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
Oman's new sultan, Haitham bin Tariq al-Said, promised after assuming power on Saturday to uphold the foreign policy of his Western-backed predecessor under which Muscat balanced ties between larger neighbors Saudi Arabia and Iran as well as the United States.
""His challenge going forward will be to quickly develop his personal relationships with foreign partners and make clear his likely stance to stay-the-course with Oman's foreign policy,"" said Elana DeLozier, a research fellow at The Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank.
Qaboos, who died on Friday aged 79, managed to maintain Oman's neutrality, not taking sides in the Gulf dispute with Qatar, and helped to mediate secret U.S.-Iran talks in 2013 that led to an international nuclear pact two years later which Washington then quit in 2018.
President Donald Trump called Qaboos a true partner to the United States, working with nine different American presidents.
""His unprecedented efforts to engage in dialogue and achieve peace in the region showed us the importance of listening to all viewpoints,"" Trump said in a statement.
The British government said Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Prince Charles arrived in Muscat for the condolences ceremony for the longest-serving Arab leader, who took power in a palace coup in 1970 with the help of former colonial power Britain. Among other Western dignitaries was former French President Nicolas Sarkozy. 
Haitham assumes power at a time of heightened tensions between Iran and the United States that could destabilize a region vital to global oil supplies.

Qaboos' death leaves Kuwait's 90-year old Emir Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, who was also in Muscat on Sunday, as the last of the old guard leaders in the Gulf. The region has seen the emergence of young hawks in Riyadh and Abu Dhabi who are bent on curtailing Iran's influence.

Both the LNA and the Tripoli-based, internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA) had said they conditionally agreed to the truce.
But the GNA said in a statement that it had recorded gunfire in the Salaheddin and Wadi Rabea areas ""minutes"" after the ceasefire was meant to start at 0001 a.m. on Sunday (Saturday 2201 GMT). 
From early on Sunday morning exchanges of fire could be heard in Salaheddin and Ain Zara districts.
Any attempt to impose a lasting ceasefire will be hard to enforce because of the splintered nature of Libya's military coalitions, with disparate factions and foreign fighters deployed on both sides. Both sides refer to each other as militias.
""The (GNA) militias violated the truce on more than one battlefront, with all types of weapons,"" said LNA commander Al-Mabrouk Al-Gazawi, adding that forces were waiting for further instruction from LNA general command.
The GNA said in a statement it had recorded violations by ""the aggressor's militias"" but that it ""renews its commitment to the ceasefire, and emphasizes the need for commitment from the patrons of this ceasefire and the United Nations mission in Libya in applying it optimally"".
Turkey's defence ministry said it had observed that all sides were trying to abide by the ceasefire, and that the situation was calm except for ""one or two separate incidents"". 
The ceasefire call came after a recent escalation of fighting around Tripoli, and the LNA's advance into Sirte, a strategically important city midway along Libya's coastline.
It also came as the United Nations and European powers pushed for a summit in Berlin aimed at winding down foreign involvement and resuming a peace process upended by Haftar's advance.

The LNA has received backing from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Egypt and Russia, while Turkey backs the GNA and voted this month to allow a troop deployment to the North African country.

The furor over the remarks by Education Minister Rafael Peretz - who last year spoke favorably about gay ""conversion therapy"", a widely discredited method - reached into the Israeli cabinet, one of whose members is openly homosexual.
Asked by the weekend edition of the top-selling Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper what he would do if one his children had a ""different sexual orientation"", Peretz said: ""Thank God, my children grew up in a natural and healthy way. They are building their homes on the basis of Jewish values. I don't bother my head with 'what if' thinking.""
Several Israeli municipalities said they would open the new school week with tolerance classes in response.
""I will promote within the municipal educational system a program of democracy, equality, recognition of the other and acceptance of differences. In short - everything that is the opposite of Rabbi Rafi,"" Amir Kochavi, mayor of the city of Hod Hasharon near Tel Aviv, said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Peretz, who heads the ultra-nationalist Jewish Home party, assumed the education portfolio within Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's conservative coalition government in June. 
Justice Minister Amir Ohana, a member of Netanyahu's Likud party who has children with a same-sex partner, condemned his cabinet colleague's remarks as ""wretched, and not for the first time,"" adding that they ""do not reflect the government's position"".

""I grew up in a healthy, good and loving family, as are my children and the children of many LGBTs from all parts of the country, from all over the political spectrum,"" Ohana tweeted.

VALLETTA (Reuters) - Political newcomer Robert Abela was set to become Malta's new prime minister having been elected leader of the ruling Labor Party following a vote on Saturday.
Joseph Muscat is stepping down as leader and prime minister amid claims that he protected associates who had links to people allegedly involved in the 2017 murder of anti-corruption journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.
The election result became known early on Sunday with Abela winning 58% of the votes of some 17,500 members of the party. He was up against Chris Fearne, 56, the deputy prime minister and minister of health, who had been the initial favorite to win.
Muscat announced his resignation on December 1, saying he would step down once a new Labor leader was elected.
Abela, 42, a lawyer specializing in industrial and labor law, was elected to parliament for the first time just over two years ago. Muscat appointed him a consultant, enabling him to attend Cabinet meetings.
""I am humbled"" he told supporters. ""I thank my friend Chris (Fearne) and look forward to working together for the good of the party and the country. There is only one winner today, the Labor Party.""
Abela has said he will place increased government focus on social issues and affordable housing. He also promised to give free medicines to all pensioners within five years. During the campaign, however, he avoided interviews with the independent press.
His father, George Abela, was deputy leader of the Labor Party until 1998 and had contested the party leadership election which saw Muscat become party leader in 2008. He later served as president of Malta.
Joseph Muscat in a tweet said he was proud to hand over to Abela. He said he would formally resign as prime minister on Monday.
He has said he will stay on in parliament and promote civil rights reform. He also intends working on a project to raise the level of Malta sports athletes."

Israel Katz, who doubles as intelligence minister, had been scheduled to attend mid-month meetings in the Gulf emirate ahead of its Expo 2020 Dubai but ""on the instruction of security officials"" would defer the visit, an Israeli diplomat said, without giving a new date.
Another diplomat, who also requested anonymity, said Israel was taking precautions lest its arch-foe Iran try to target Katz as part of retaliation against its U.S. ally. The diplomat did not cite evidence to indicate any specific threat.
Decades-old hostilities between Tehran and Washington have boiled over in recent weeks, with a U.S. strike killing a senior Iranian commander and Iran firing missiles at Iraqi airbases hosting U.S. forces in response.
Iran and Israel have been fierce regional enemies since the 1979 Iranian revolution. Israel has in recent years built up ties with Sunni Gulf states that share its worries about Iran.
Though it does not enjoy formal relations with the United Arab Emirates, Israel will have a pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai, which opens in October - participation that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described as part of ""normalization with the Arab states""."
1014,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 12, 2020 05:02AM ET</span>",China says will not change position on Taiwan after landslide election,"By Ben Blanchard and Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - China will not change its position that Taiwan belongs to it, Beijing said on Sunday, after President Tsai Ing-wen won re-election and said she would not submit to China's threats, as state media warned she was courting disaster.
The election campaign was dominated by China's efforts to get the democratic island to accept Beijing's rule under a ""one country, two systems"" model, as well as by anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.
""No matter what changes there are to the internal situation in Taiwan, the basic fact that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China will not change,"" China's Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
While China says Taiwan is its territory, Taiwan maintains it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.
Tsai, who has firmly rejected China's ""one country, two systems"" model, won another four-year term by a landslide on Saturday, and her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) secured a majority in parliament.
""Taiwan's people once again use the vote in their hands to show the world the value of democracy,"" Tsai said on Sunday when meeting the head of the United States' de facto embassy in Taipei, Brent Christensen.
""Democracy and freedom are indeed Taiwan's most valuable asset and the foundation of the long-term Taiwan-U.S. partnership,"" Tsai said, vowing to deepen cooperation with the United States on issues from defense to economy.
On Saturday, Tsai called for talks to resume with China, but said she hoped Beijing understood Taiwan and its people would not submit to intimidation.
However, China will not change its stance on the ""one China"" principle and opposing Taiwan independence, the Chinese foreign ministry said.
""The universal consensus of the international community adhering to the 'one China' principle will not change either.""
China hoped the world would support the ""just cause"" of Chinese people to oppose secessionist activities and ""realize national reunification"", it added.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said China should respect the election result and stop putting pressure on the island.
""Our government will firmly defend the sovereignty of the Republic of China and Taiwan's democracy and freedom,"" it said.
'POLICY TOOLBOX'
China's official Xinhua news agency said Tsai won by deploying dirty tricks, hyping the China threat and colluding with Western forces.
""Whether it is to curb Taiwan independence secessionist activities or to benefit Taiwan compatriots, the mainland has a full 'policy toolbox',"" it said.
""Tsai and the DPP must be aware that they should not act wilfully because of a fluke.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo congratulated Tsai and lauded her for seeking stability with China ""in the face of unrelenting pressure"".
Japan's Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi also sent congratulations, referring to Taiwan as a ""precious friend"".
China's Taiwan Affairs Office said on Saturday it would continue promoting the ""one country, two systems"" model for Taiwan, which Beijing uses to run Hong Kong with a high degree of autonomy.
Many in the former British colony fear promises made under the system are not being kept.
On China's internet, there was unusual criticism for the Taiwan Affairs Office's failure to win over the island, especially as Tsai's win followed a landslide for pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong's local elections in November.
""What have you been doing?"" wrote one user on China's Twitter-like Weibo. ""All the money you have spent and all you have done is give succor to hypocrites and traitors.""
The criticism follows a denunciation of the Taiwan office on Friday by the Chinese Communist Party's anti-corruption watchdog for not following the party line enthusiastically and being too bureaucratic."
1015,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 12, 2020 01:29AM ET</span>","Iran Admits Downing Jetliner, Sparking Global Anger and Protests","(Bloomberg) -- Iran said it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner it mistook for a cruise missile, a dramatic reversal that triggered international condemnation and protests in the streets of Tehran.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said he was “outraged” and “furious.” At least 57 Canadians were among the 176 people killed in the downing of Ukrainian International Airlines Flight PS752.
“What Iran has admitted to is very serious. Shooting down a civilian aircraft is horrific. Iran must take full responsibility,” Trudeau said Saturday at a press briefing in Ottawa. He earlier declared the incident a national tragedy.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a televised address that he wants a full admission of guilt by Iran for what authorities there called a “disastrous mistake.”
Black Boxes
Ukraine and Iran will work jointly to decode the black boxes of the doomed Ukrainian Boeing (NYSE:BA) jet, Zelenskiy said. The Ukrainian government will make payments to the families of each of those who died in the cash, he said.
Trudeau and his British counterpart Boris Johnson earlier called for justice for the victims, and signaled that the disaster reinforced the need for a de-escalation of hostilities in the Gulf region.
A senior Trump administration official, who declined to be identified, said the tragedy showed Iran’s “reckless actions have again had devastating consequences.”
Truth Will Out
“The morning was not good today but it brought the truth,” Zelenskiy said after Iran’s announcement. He urged Iran to take action against those responsible, and pay compensation. “We hope further investigations will be done without artificial delays and obstacles,” he said.
The government’s admission that Iran’s security forces hold ultimate responsibility for the downing of the plane -- albeit at a time of conflict with their chief foe -- is a further blow for the country’s ruling clerics at a time when the economy has been devastated by U.S. sanctions.
“Even in a moment of heightened tension this should never have happened,” Trudeau said. “Canada will not rest until we get the accountability, justice, and closure that the families deserve.”
The admission could dent the sense of national unity that built after the Jan. 3 killing by the U.S. of Iran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani -- a hero to many Iranians for his work in Iraq and Syria helping to defeat Islamic State.
The three-year-old  Boeing Co . 737-800 was shot down about two minutes after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday. The tragedy occurred hours after Iran started launching rockets against Iraqi bases where U.S. forces are stationed, in retaliation for Soleimani’s targeted killing.
Nearly half the victims were Iranians, while many of the other passengers, including citizens of Canada, Sweden and the U.K., were of Iranian descent, a reflection of the ambition that pushes thousands to leave Iran each year to work and study in the West.
Student Protests
A large crowd of students assembled outside Amir Kabir University in downtown Tehran late Saturday for a candlelight vigil, according to witnesses, before starting chants of “death to the dictator” and “resignation is not enough, a trial is needed!” Security forces intervened.
Others used social media to vent their anger, contrasting the plane deaths with reports that the attack on the Iraqi bases was specifically designed not to injure Americans.
“You feared hitting Americans, but you’re hitting students and ordinary people. In front of the world you turned to mice before a nation of lions. You’re liars who lack everything,” said one Twitter user.
While the breadth of the protests was unclear, U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a tweet that the demonstrations showed “the voice of the Iranian people is clear.”
Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, offered his condolences to the victims of the doomed flight, while President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic Republic “deeply regrets the disastrous mistake” and vowed compensation for the families of victims.
The commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps‘s aerospace force, Amir Ali Hajizadeh, blamed the tragedy on a communications failure. The operative who first mistakenly identified the plane as an incoming missile failed to get a second opinion due to a “disturbance” and had only 10 seconds to make a decision, he said. The army had previously said that “culprits” would be turned over to judicial authorities.
“When I was certain that this incident had occurred, I truly wished death upon myself, because I’d rather have died than witness such an incident,” Hajizadeh said in a briefing Saturday in Tehran.
How U.S.-Iran Enmity Grew for Decades, Burst in Days: QuickTake
So far, U.S. President Donald Trump hasn’t sought to leverage the loss of the plane to further his campaign against Iran. On Wednesday, he pointed to a “mistake” being the likely cause for shooting down as the jet flew through a “rough neighborhood.”
American sanctions, particularly those aimed at stopping Iran’s critical oil sales, have pushed the Iranian economy into a slump, prompting Rouhani to accuse the U.S. of waging “economic war” against his country. The U.S. added new penalties on Friday following the attack on the Iraqi bases.
As recently as Friday, Iran denied that it had fired a missile at the plane and accused western governments of “psychological warfare.”
The plane appeared to fly on a normal path to the northwest of the airport on the same heading as the runway from which it departed, according to the flight-tracking service FlightRadar24. There are no obvious military sites visible on satellite photos of the plane’s flight path.
The U.S. and Iran have stepped back from the brink of further military conflict following the killing of Soleimani and Tehran’s retaliation, but Iran’s leaders have so far shown no sign of interest in Trump’s call for talks.
European nations have vowed to stand by the nuclear agreement under assault by Trump’s administration, but they have so far failed to deliver meaningful ways of allowing trade and crucially oil sales."
1016,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 11, 2020 04:51AM ET</span>","Iran Admits It Shot Down Boeing Jet, Reversing Days of Denials","(Bloomberg) -- Iran admitted it accidentally shot down a Ukrainian jetliner that it mistook for a threat during hostilities with the U.S., marking a dramatic reversal after repeatedly denying such a scenario and accusing Western governments of spreading lies.
Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 was flying close to a sensitive Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps military site when it was downed because of “human error,” the army said after conducting its own investigation. The “culprits” would be identified and referred to judicial authorities, it said.
The three-year-old Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co. 737-800 abruptly stopped transmitting its position and plunged to the ground about two minutes after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 aboard. The crash occurred hours after the Islamic Republic started launching rockets against Iraqi bases where U.S. forces are stationed, in retaliation for the killing of Iran’s top general, Qassem Soleimani.
“Iran’s armed forces went on high alert following U.S. threats to target Iranian sites,” the army said in the statement. “Under such highly sensitive and critical circumstances, the Boeing Flight 752 flew close to a sensitive IRGC military site at an altitude and angle that made it appear as a hostile target. The plane was hit due to human error and unintentionally.”
How U.S.-Iran Enmity Grew for Decades, Burst in Days: QuickTake
Iran will send the black boxes of the crashed jet to France as it lacks the technology to decode them, the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency reported. Military officials will elaborate on the crash on state media on Saturday.
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif blamed “human error at time of crisis caused by US adventurism” for the disaster, according to a post on Twitter. President Hassan Rouhani said the Islamic Republic “deeply regrets the disastrous mistake,” adding further investigations will be carried out into the incident and families of victims would be compensated.
Iran’s actions could threaten to further isolate the country. U.S. sanctions, particularly those aimed at stopping oil sales, have pushed the Iranian economy into recession, prompting Rouhani to accuse the U.S. of waging “economic war” against his country.
As recently as Friday, Iran denied that it had fired a missile at the plane and accused western governments of “psychological warfare.” Officials in multiple western countries have said they believe it was shot down accidentally. A U.S. spy satellite detected the firing of two SA-15 surface-to-air missiles, a person familiar with the intelligence said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy urged Iran to conduct a “complete and open investigation,” take action on those responsible, and pay compensation.
“The morning was not good today but it brought the truth,” Zelenskiy said on Saturday. “We hope further investigation will be done without artificial delays and obstacles.”
The White House didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment late Friday night.
There are no obvious military sites visible on satellite photos of the plane’s flight path. A power plant and an industrial park are in the area where the Ukrainian jet stopped transmitting its position, as well as large areas of undeveloped land, according to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
The plane appeared to fly on a normal path to the northwest of the airport on the same heading as the runway from which it departed, according to the flight-tracking service FlightRadar24.
It flew straight for just over two minutes after takeoff, according to the company. At that point, it made a slight turn to the right and continued for another 42 seconds. It disappeared at an altitude of about 7,900 feet, apparently after the radio transmitting its location lost power following the missile attack.
Iran Airports & Air Navigation Co. never received an order to cancel flights, and wasn’t ever made aware of any security issues, the company’s head Siavash Amir-Mokri told the Iranian Labor News Agency.
Accidental Downings
The disaster adds to a list of accidental shootings of civilian aircraft.
In 1988, a U.S. Navy missile cruiser, the U.S.S. Vincennes, downed an Iran Air Airbus A300 over the Persian Gulf, killing 290 passengers and crew. The U.S. military said it mistook the airliner for an Iranian fighter jet, an account disputed by Iran.
In July 2014, a Malaysian Airlines plane carrying 298 people was shot down by a Russian-made Buk surface-to-air missile fired from rebel-controlled territory in eastern Ukraine. The region was the site of a conflict between pro-Russia separatists and Ukrainian military forces, and two military aircraft had been downed just days earlier, an international team concluded.
This week’s tragedy strikes during a deeply challenging period for Boeing, gripped by one of the worst crises in its 103-year history after two deadly crashes involving the 737 Max led to its global idling in March. Iran’s admission of the missile strike relieves concerns of a mechanical failure that could affect other Boeing planes.
A CBS News crew earlier found the impact site unguarded and unsecured, with virtually all pieces of the plane cleared away and scavengers picking through the remaining debris.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Tehran said on Friday it wanted to download black box recordings itself from a Ukrainian airliner crash that killed all 176 people aboard, amid Western suspicions the plane was brought down by an Iranian missile, probably by mistake.
The crash has heightened international pressure on Iran after months of friction with the United States and tit-for-tat military strikes. Washington killed an Iranian general last week in Iraq, prompting Tehran to fire at U.S. targets.
Iran, which denies the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 was downed by a missile, showed the voice and flight data recorders on state TV on Friday but said it could take a month or two to extract data.
Tehran said it may ask Russia, Canada, France or Ukraine for help in a probe that could take one or two years to complete.
""We prefer to download the black boxes in Iran. But if we see that we can't do that because the boxes are damaged, then we will seek help,"" Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organization, told a news conference in Tehran.
The Ukraine International Airlines flight to Kiev from Tehran crashed on Wednesday, when Iran was on alert for a U.S. military response hours after it fired at U.S. targets in Iraq. https://tmsnrt.rs/39MLwwx
Most of the victims were Iranian or Iranian-Canadian.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has blamed an Iranian surface-to-air missile for downing the plane with 63 Canadians on board, though he said it may have been unintentional.
""We do believe that it's likely that that plane was shot down by an Iranian missile,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said at a briefing on additional U.S. sanctions against Iran.
""We're going to let the investigation play out before we make a final determination,"" he added as Washington also announced sanction waivers for crash investigators.
Iran called those accusations ""psychological warfare"".
Ukraine and Canada have agreed to push for an objective investigation into the crash, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said after speaking with Trudeau.
""There should not be speculation about the tragedy; Ukraine and Canada will use all possible means to advocate for an objective and comprehensive investigation,"" Zelenskiy wrote on Twitter.
GRIEF AND CONFUSION
Grief-stricken Iranians and others posted images related to the crash. One showed a child's red shoe in the dirt. Another was a selfie of a mother and daughter in their seats, sent to a loved one before takeoff.
""Why were any civilian airlines flying out of Tehran airport in those conditions,"" one user named Shiva Balaghi wrote on Twitter.
Ukraine is looking at various possible causes of the crash, including an attack by a Russian-made missile, a collision, an engine explosion or terrorism.
Kiev said on Friday that Iran was cooperating with an investigation and it did not want to jump to conclusions. But Foreign Minister Vadym Prystaiko added Ukraine would like the analysis of the black boxes to happen in Kiev.
Some on social media expressed worries over images, which could not be independently verified, circulating online that suggested the crash site had been cleared by bulldozers.
Iran's ambassador to Britain denied that.
Russia's deputy foreign minister said Moscow saw no grounds to blame Iran for the crash, TASS news agency reported.
France's BEA air accident agency said it would be involved in the investigation. BEA helped analyze data from the flight recorder of a Boeing that crashed in Ethiopia last year.
EXPLOSION?
A U.S. official, citing satellite data, said Washington had concluded with a high degree of certainty that anti-aircraft missiles brought down the plane in error.
The official said the data showed the plane airborne for two minutes after departing Tehran when heat signatures from two missiles were detected. There was an explosion in the vicinity and heat data showed the plane on fire as it fell.
U.S., Canadian and French representatives were to travel to Tehran to attend meetings for the investigation, Iranian state media reported. Washington and Ottawa do not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.
Iran's civil aviation organization said in an initial report less than 24 hours after the incident that the three-year-old airliner, which had its last scheduled maintenance on Monday, encountered a technical problem after takeoff and was heading to a nearby airport before it crashed.
""All those countries whose citizens were aboard the plane can send representatives and we urge Boeing to send its representative to join the process of investigating the black box,"" Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei said.
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it was making arrangements to tour the site after an Iranian invitation.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it had designated a representative to join the probe.
Boeing said it would support the NTSB. The company is reeling from two deadly crashes of 737 MAX planes, including the one in Ethiopia, that led to the model's grounding last year.
The crash plane was built in 2016 and is the prior 737 generation before the MAX."
1018,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 02:25PM ET</span>",No more 'teary eyes' from Trudeau: Iranian-Canadians demand action on crash,"(Reuters) - Friends and families of some of the 63 Canadians killed in a Ukrainian plane crash in Iran are calling on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to take a tougher stance after Ottawa accused Iran of having downed the plane, albeit probably by mistake.
But while Trudeau faces pressure at home to respond strongly, his options are few. Iran has said it will allow Canadian, U.S. and other international officials to participate in the investigation into Wednesday's crash.
Trudeau said on Thursday that the airliner was likely brought down by an Iranian missile, a view echoed by the United States and Britain. Iran denied that the airliner had been hit by a missile, and asked Canada to supply proof.
The prime minister ""completely misses the point"" when he does not condemn the Iranian government, said Ali Ashtari, 39, a data scientist from Toronto who lost a friend in the crash.
Ashtari said Canada should designate the entire Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as a terrorist organization and impose sanctions on them.
""This is the minimum that we want from the government,"" Ashtari said at a vigil in Toronto. ""Otherwise it's just giving speech with teary eyes, it gives nothing.""
Trudeau said that Ottawa had demanded Canadian access to Iran to provide consular services, identify victims and participate in the crash investigation. Shooting down the plane may have been unintentional, he said, adding that he was ""standing with"" mourners.
The crash, which killed all 176 people on board, occurred as Iran was on alert for possible reprisals after it launched missiles to attack U.S. troops in Iraq.
""We would just urge him (Trudeau) to use all his power to find out what really happened and hold the responsible accountable,"" Amir Arsalani, who lost his sister Evin Arsalani, her husband Hiva Molani and their one-year-old daughter Kurdia Molani in the crash, told Reuters.
Canada broke off diplomatic ties with Iran in 2012, and trade is already limited by sanctions related to Iran's nuclear program. The government lists the Revolutionary Guards' overseas arm, the Quds Force, as a terrorist group and has imposed sanctions on senior individuals and specific entities connected to the broader organization.
This means Trudeau has few ways to punish Iran in the short term.
""This cannot go without consequence,"" said Edmonton engineering student Ali Azimi, 21, whose professor was killed. ""If it is determined and proven that this was related to a missile launch, we need to make the government of Iran pay.""
Trudeau was asked this week whether the United States should be held at least partially responsible for the crash, given that tensions in the region ignited after a U.S. drone killed Qassem Soleimani, the former leader of the Quds Force.
""It is too soon to be drawing conclusions or assigning blame or responsibility in whatever proportions,"" he told reporters.
Asked whether he supported the U.S. government assertion that killing Soleimani prevented an imminent attack, he replied: ""The Americans made a decision based on their threat assessment.""
Relations between Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump are formal at best, with Trudeau last month caught on camera joking about the U.S. president, and Trump calling him ""two-faced"".
There was no benefit to the government ""to make a big public statement"" about the United States, further souring relations, said Stephanie Carvin, a former national security analyst and international relations professor at Carleton University in Ottawa.
""Canadians however are increasingly concerned that we are collateral damage in several campaigns by the United States in achieving its political objectives without any consultations whatsoever,"" she said. ""(This) is probably top of mind and that is not good for our long-term relationship.""
Canadian government officials including the prime minister's office were not immediately available for comment.
Iran said on Friday it wanted to download black box recordings itself, and that a probe into the crash could take up to two years.
""I don't know how much justice we can expect,"" said Mana Yeganeh, 28, a student at York University in Toronto who knew several people killed."
1019,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 02:07PM ET</span>",Explainer: Reading 'black boxes' of Ukrainian jet that crashed in Iran,"PARIS (Reuters) - Iran is examining 'black boxes' from a Ukrainian jet that crashed on Wednesday in a fireball shortly after taking off from Tehran, sparking an international hunt for clues amid Western claims that the jet had been brought down accidentally by Iranian missiles.
WHAT ARE BLACK BOXES?
They are not actually black, but high-visibility orange. Experts disagree about how the nickname originated but it has become synonymous with the public’s quest for answers after crashes.
Many historians attribute their invention to Australian scientist David Warren in the 1950s.
There are two recorders: a Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) for pilot voices or cockpit sounds and a Flight Data Recorder (FDR).
HOW BIG ARE THEY?
They weigh about 10 pounds (4.5 kg) and contain four main elements:
* a metal chassis designed to hold the recorder and facilitate recording and playback
* an underwater locator beacon
* the core housing or 'Crash Survivable Memory Unit', made of stainless steel or titanium, and designed to withstand equivalent to 3,400 times that of gravity
* inside that housing, circuit boards holding fingernail-sized recording chips.
HOW ARE THE RECORDERS HANDLED?
Technicians peel away protective material and carefully clean connections to make sure they do not accidentally erase data. The audio or data file must be downloaded and copied.
Iranian and Western experts say Iran has the equipment to extract the data if the recorders are in good order, but not if they are damaged, which requires special equipment and protocols only available in major Western or Russian agencies.
The data itself means nothing at first. It must be decoded from raw files before being turned into graphs.
Western agencies sometimes use ""spectral analysis"" - a way of examining sounds that allows scientists to pick out barely audible alarms or the first fleeting crack of an explosion.
It is this fragment of the audio recording that could be vital in proving or disproving claims by Canada and others that the plane was accidentally shot down by Iranian missiles, a senior Western investigator said. Iran denies the claims.
""If a missile hit the engine, for example, the data recording might briefly show an engine problem but not the cause. The CVR and the wreckage field are the main areas of interest in the scenario of a missile. You are looking for unusual frequencies or shock waves,"" the investigator said.
HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE?
It depends on the make and model of recorder.
The chip on the flight data recorder of a different model of a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 that crashed in October 2018 contained 1,790 parameters, spread over 19 flights.
The CVR contains two hours of recordings, more than enough to cover the brief Ukraine International Airlines flight. It has four separate channels, for voices and ambient noise.
WHO GETS ACCESS TO THE DATA?
The lead investigator, in this case Iran, decides who has access to the data. Iran has said it will work closely with Ukraine, which said on Friday that Tehran was co-operating with it. The United States has called for an independent investigation, however.
In most jurisdictions, only the senior investigator and a handful of people actually hear the voice recordings, which are transcribed, and translated if necessary, then sealed.
HOW LONG WILL THE RESULTS TAKE?
Investigators prefer to work methodically, but political and media pressure will be intense. Depending on any damage to the boxes and the type of accident, some investigators say they can get a very basic picture in days or even hours. But they stress this is not always the case, and rarely tells the whole story.
Deeper investigations take a year or more to complete. An Iranian official has said the probe may take two years."
1020,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 01:56PM ET</span>","As Virginia governor vows new gun control push, capitol braces for protests","By Brad Brooks
(Reuters) - Backed by Virginia's first Democratic-controlled legislature in over 20 years, Governor Ralph Northam vowed this week to push through new gun-control laws, angering gun-rights advocates who plan to respond with a rally of thousands of armed citizens.
It is unclear how many people will attend the Jan. 20 rally in Richmond. State police are already making security plans, aiming to avoid a repeat of the chaos seen in Charlottesville in 2017, when a march by white nationalists erupted in violence that led to the death of a counter-protester.
The legislative bills that Northam's administration is backing include universal background checks on gun sales, a ban on assault-style rifles, and passing ""red flag"" laws that would allow courts and local law enforcement to remove guns from people deemed a risk to communities.
It is not Northam's first effort at tightening the state's gun laws. He called a special legislative session last summer after the massacre of 12 people in Virginia Beach, but the Republicans who then controlled it refused to vote on his proposals.
""The measures I proposed did not receive a hearing,"" Northam said in an address when newly elected lawmakers first convened on Wednesday. ""Virginians watched. They saw what happened, and they were appalled. So they changed the legislature.""
The change in legislative control has made Virginia a key target for people on both sides of the gun-rights debate, one of America's most polarizing issues.
The Virginia Citizens Defense League, which is organizing the rally, hopes that a large turnout by gun-rights proponents, most of whom will be openly carrying weapons as allowed by state law, will persuade lawmakers not to back the measures, according to materials posted online by the group.
Its representatives did not respond to multiple requests for comment this week.
Since the election, some officials in nearly all of Virginia's 95 counties have declared they would not enforce new gun laws, calling themselves ""sanctuary cities"" for gun rights - adopting a term first used by localities opposed to harsh treatment of illegal immigrants.
The idea has quickly spread across the United States, with at least 200 local governments in 16 states passing such measures.
However, Pew Research polling finds that 60% of Americans favor stricter gun laws overall. Some measures, including background checks for private gun sales and laws preventing people with mental illnesses from buying guns, are overwhelmingly favored by most Americans, regardless of their political stripe.
Joe Macenka, a spokesman for the Virginia Capitol police, said the force has had several meetings with rally organizers.
""They are very interested in having a positive outcome for the rally,"" Macenka said. ""They understand that if you want to have success in influencing legislation inside the general assembly, it would behoove you to have a positive situation outside.""
State police earlier this month spent two hours briefing Northam on preparations.
Macenka acknowledged that the ""great unknown"" was how many people and groups not connected to the organizers would attend.
Several known militias and organizations labeled as white nationalist hate groups by critics have indicated online that they will turn up in Richmond in force.
Northam addressed some unfounded claims the groups have spread online ahead of the expected rally.
""No one is calling out the National Guard. No one is cutting off your electricity, or turning off the Internet. No one is going door-to-door to confiscate guns,"" Northam said. ""These laws are intended to keep Virginians safe. Period. It's time to act."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States imposed more sanctions on Iran on Friday in retaliation for its missile attack on U.S. forces in Iraq this week and vowed to tighten the economic screws if Tehran continued ""terrorist"" acts or pursued a nuclear bomb.
The targets of the sanctions included Iran's manufacturing, mining and textile sectors as well as senior Iranian officials who Washington said were involved in the Jan. 8 attack on military bases housing U.S. troops.
Fears that the United States and Iran were heading for war flared over the past week after a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani, spurring Iran's retaliatory strike on facilities in Iraq hosting U.S. forces.
No one was harmed in the Iranian ballistic missile attacks and the two sides seem to have stepped back from the brink of all-out conflict. President Donald Trump vowed on Wednesday to impose the additional sanctions, the most concrete U.S. response yet to the attacks.
The measures target eight senior Iranian officials who U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said are responsible for both the government's violence abroad and crackdown on protesters at home.
""We're striking at the heart of the Islamic Republic's inner security apparatus. These sanctions targets include the secretary of the Supreme National Council and the commander of the Basij forces,"" Pompeo said.
A commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards who was one of those sanctioned on Friday brushed of the new U.S. move as ""symbolic.""
""Imposing sanctions is symbolic for America and for me because this measure will have no economic impact and will not compensate for (Iran's) missile barrage and will not bring respect for Washington,"" tweeted Mohsen Rezaie.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have spiked since Trump unilaterally withdrew in 2018 from the Iran nuclear deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama and began reimposing sanctions that had been eased under the accord.
Those U.S. sanctions have driven down Iranian crude sales, the Islamic Republic's main source of revenues, but so far have not brought Iran back to the negotiating table to discuss a new nuclear pact as sought by Trump.
The United States has also sanctioned Iran's purchase of U.S. dollars, its trade in gold and precious metals and its dealings with metals, coal and industrial-related software.
Richard Nephew, a former White House and State Department expert on Iran sanctions during the Obama administration, played down the latest measures, saying much of the metals industry was already under sanction as were most of the individuals cited.
""This is a joke. These designations target an industry that is supposed to be off limits anyway and senior officials most of which were already designated,"" said Nephew, now a senior research scholar and adjunct professor at Columbia University.
Friday's sanctions freeze all properties or interests in properties that those targeted by the measures have under U.S. jurisdiction. People or foreign financial institutions engaging in certain transactions with those designated could also be exposed to sanctions themselves.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin speaking alongside Pompeo at a White House news conference, said Washington would impose further sanctions if needed.
""We will continue to apply economic sanctions until Iran stops its terrorist activities and commits that it will never have nuclear weapons,"" he said.
Iran denies that its nuclear program is aimed at building an atomic weapon,
Mnuchin said waivers from sanctions would be issued for anybody that could aid the investigation of the Ukraine International Airlines passenger jet that crashed shortly after take-off from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 aboard.
The United States has said the plane was downed by an Iranian missile, probably by mistake. Reuters and other media reported on Thursday that U.S. officials had reached that assessment based on a review of satellite data.
Iran has denied the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 was brought down by a missile."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday upheld a lower court decision to dismiss nationwide litigation over the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 in which victims' families sought to hold the carrier, its insurer Allianz (DE:ALVG) SE and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co liable for the still-unexplained disaster.
A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington affirmed a November 2018 ruling from U.S. Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson that found 40 wrongful death and product liability lawsuits ""do not belong in the United States.""
Judge Neomi Rao, writing for the unanimous panel, said that while the court ""has great sympathy for the victims of this tragedy and their families"" she found no reason to reverse the decision. ""We conclude that the district court did not clearly abuse its discretion in dismissing appellants’ lawsuits,"" she wrote.
Jackson said the case belonged in Malaysia, which has an ""overwhelming interest"" in and ""substantial nexus"" to the March 8, 2014 disappearance of Flight MH370, a Boeing 777 heading to Beijing from Kuala Lumpur with 239 people on board.
The decision is a new setback for plaintiffs from the United States, Australia, China, India and Malaysia who represented more than 100 Flight MH370 passengers, including from Japan.
The plane is believed to have crashed in the south Indian Ocean after veering far off course, but no remains or large pieces of wreckage have been found.
Flight MH370's disappearance remains one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries. A Malaysian report concluded that its investigative team was “unable to determine the real cause for the disappearance of MH370,” human interference or error were more likely the cause of the plane’s disappearance than aircraft or system malfunction.
The plaintiffs sued under the Montreal Convention, an international treaty governing air transportation incidents, and various U.S. state laws.

1023,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 01:07PM ET</span>",Venezuela opposition calls on U.S. to step up pressure on Maduro ally Russia,"By Matt Spetalnick
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Venezuela's opposition is calling on the United States and other countries to step up pressure on Russia over its support for socialist Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the opposition's envoy to Washington said on Friday.
Carlos Vecchio, opposition leader Juan Guaido's representative to the United States, said Russia's role backing Maduro economically, diplomatically and militarily was of growing concern as OPEC member Venezuela's political crisis has dragged on.
""I request to the international community to hold accountable Russia for what they are doing in Venezuela,"" Vecchio told reporters in Washington. The pressure campaign, he said, should also extend to Russian oil giant Rosneft, which has helped Venezuela market its crude since Washington imposed sanctions on the South American country's state oil company PDVSA last January.
Since early last year, the United States and dozens of other countries have recognized Guaido, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, as Venezuela's legitimate interim president.
But Maduro remains in power, backed by the military as well as Russia, China and Cuba. A senior White House administration official told Reuters in October that President Donald Trump's frustration over the lack of results had spurred aides to ready further actions.
Vecchio's focus on Russia echoes comments by Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration's envoy on Venezuela, who told reporters earlier this week that ""as the regime has become more and more desperate... they have relied more and more on Russia.""
Abrams told Reuters in October that the administration was taking a ""closer look"" at Russia's role in helping Maduro remain in power. But since then the United States has not taken any major action against Moscow over its Venezuela ties.
Vecchio said new steps against Russia, including sanctions, should be also be taken by the European Union and the rest of the international community.
Moscow has acted as a lender of last resort for Venezuela, with the government and Rosneft providing at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006.
Guaido invoked the constitution last January to assume a rival presidency, arguing that Maduro's 2018 re-election was a sham. Maduro has accused Guaido of leading a U.S.-orchestrated coup attempt."
1024,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 12:49PM ET</span>",Northern Ireland to get devolved government back after three-year gap,"By Ian Graham
BELFAST (Reuters) - The main Irish nationalist and pro-British unionist parties in Northern Ireland agreed to return to a power-sharing government on Friday after a three-year hiatus, ending a standoff that had threatened a key part of the province's 1998 peace settlement.
Sinn Fein, the largest nationalist party, followed its rival, the Democratic Unionist Party, in backing a draft deal brokered by the Irish and British governments to end the devolved assembly's suspension.
London had taken on greater administrative responsibility for the British province as the two parties blamed each other for the failure of successive attempts to break the deadlock. They had faced the threat of fresh elections if a deadline on Monday passed.
""We now have a basis for power sharing and we're up for that,"" Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald said, almost three years to the day after her party walked out saying the DUP was not treating it as an equal.
""There is absolutely no doubt that there are serious challenges ahead but the most significant challenge will be ensuring we have genuine power-sharing, based on equality."" 
The importance of the devolved administration has increased because a provision in Britain's European Union withdrawal deal will give the assembly the right every four years to consider whether to maintain alignment with EU market rules.
The tortuous Brexit process had complicated talks in Belfast, with Irish nationalists wanting to remain in or close to the EU and unionists fearing such alignment could undermine the province its place in the United Kingdom and pave the way to a united island of Ireland.
LAND BORDER WITH EU
Northern Ireland, which suffered through three decades of sectarian violence before the 1998 Good Friday Agreement, is the only part of the UK to have a land border with an EU nation, and the divorce deal ensures its border with Ireland remains open.
The DUP propped up a minority British government for more than two years until last month's snap election, another stumbling block in the talks with Sinn Fein that Prime Minister Boris Johnson's emphatic victory removed.
The two big Northern Irish parties' share of the vote fell in those elections while budget issues in the health service, culminating in a strike by local nurses this week, also raised pressure on them to cut a deal.
Sinn Fein had been seeking increased rights for Irish speakers and a reform of the system of governance to prevent the DUP, the largest party, from blocking legislation using a clause from the 1998 peace deal to protect minority rights.
The draft deal offers a new cultural framework to ""protect and enhance"" the Irish language as well as the related Ulster Scots language, while meaningful reform of the so-called 'petition of concern' mechanism would mean it would no longer constitute a veto for one party.

The influential Orange Order, a pro-British society that holds large annual parades and counts DUP politicians among its members, said it opposed the deal due to the ""far reaching"" Irish language provisions.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Tehran said on Friday it wanted to download black box recordings itself from a Ukrainian airliner crash that killed all 176 people aboard, after Canada and others said the plane was brought down by an Iranian missile, probably by mistake.
Iran, which denies the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800 was downed by a missile, said it could take one or two months to extract information from the voice and flight data recorders. 
It said it may ask Russia, Canada, France or Ukraine for help in a probe that could take one or two years to complete.
The Ukraine International Airlines flight to Kiev from Tehran crashed on Wednesday, when Iran was on alert for a U.S. military response hours after firing missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq. https://tmsnrt.rs/39MLwwx
Most of the victims were Iranian or Iranian-Canadian.
The crash has heightened international pressure on Iran after months of friction with the United States and tit-for-tat military strikes. Washington killed an Iranian general last week in a drone attack in Iraq, prompting Tehran's missile launches.
""We do believe that it's likely that plane was shut down by an Iranian missile,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said of the Ukrainian jet crash at a briefing on additional U.S. sanctions against Iran. 
""We're going to let the investigation play out before we make a final determination,"" he added as Washington also announced sanction waivers for crash investigators.
In an outpouring of grief, Iranians and others shared images from the crash site on social media. 
One showed a single child's red shoe in the dirt.
Another on Twitter showed a selfie of a mother and daughter in their seats, sent to a loved one before takeoff. 
""Why were any civilian airlines flying out of Tehran airport in those conditions,"" a user named Shiva Balaghi tweeted.
Ukraine is looking at various possible causes of the crash, including a possible attack by a Russian-made missile, a collision, an engine explosion or terrorism.
'UNINTENTIONAL'
On social media, many Iranians expressed anger that the plane was allowed to take off and voiced worries as images, which could not be independently verified, circulated on Twitter suggesting the crash site had been cleared by bulldozers.
Iran's ambassador to Britain denied that.
""We prefer to download the black boxes in Iran. But if we see that we can't do that because the boxes are damaged, then we will seek help,"" Ali Abedzadeh, head of Iran's Civil Aviation Organisation, told a news conference in Tehran.
State television earlier showed the battered black boxes, saying their information could be downloaded and analyzed.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, citing intelligence from Canada and other sources, blamed an Iranian surface-to-air missile for bringing down the plane that had 63 Canadians on board, although he said it ""may well have been unintentional"". 
Ukraine's general prosecutor has asked Canada to provide any information that may facilitate a criminal investigation.
Russia's deputy foreign minister said Moscow saw no grounds to blame Iran for the crash, TASS news agency reported.
France's BEA air accident agency said it would be involved in the investigation. BEA helped analyze data from the flight recorder of a Boeing that crashed in Ethiopia last year.
A U.S. official, citing satellite data, said Washington had concluded with a high degree of certainty that anti-aircraft missiles brought down the plane in error.
The official said the data showed the plane airborne for two minutes after departing Tehran when heat signatures of two missiles were detected. There was an explosion in the vicinity and heat data showed the plane on fire as it fell. 
'PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE'
U.S. President Donald Trump said he believed ""somebody could have made a mistake"".
But Iran denounced ""psychological warfare"" against it.
""All those countries whose citizens were aboard the plane can send representatives and we urge Boeing to send its representative to join the process of investigating the black box,"" government spokesman Ali Rabiei said.
U.S., Canadian and French representatives were to travel to Tehran to attend meetings for the investigation, Iranian state media reported. Washington and Ottawa do not have diplomatic relations with Tehran.
Iran's civil aviation organization said in an initial report less than 24 hours after the incident that the three-year-old airliner, which had its last scheduled maintenance on Monday, encountered a technical problem after takeoff and was heading to a nearby airport before it crashed.
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it was making arrangements to tour the site after an Iranian invitation.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said it had designated a representative to join the probe.
Boeing said it would support the NTSB. The company is reeling from two deadly crashes of 737 MAX planes, including the one in Ethiopia, that led to the model's grounding last year.

The crash plane was built in 2016 and is the prior 737 generation before the MAX.

""There are no 200 tunnels at risk,"" AISCAT said in a statement, adding that delays in some work required by the European Union on fire safety rules for the passages did not create structural risks.
Autostrade said in a separate statement it was working on or had already completed work on 90% of the tunnels in its network to make them comply with recently introduced fire safety rules.
This work has nothing to do with the structural safety of the passages, the company said.
Autostrade and the government are locked in a dispute over the possible revocation of the group's motorway concession, following the deadly collapse of a motorway bridge in Genoa in 2018 that killed 43 people and exposed the dire state of much of Italy's roadway infrastructure.
On Dec. 30 of last year, a block of concrete fell from the ceiling of a highway tunnel operated by Autostrade in northwestern Italy, without harming any vehicle.
After the incident, prosecutors in Genoa opened a new line of investigation into the safety controls on Autostrade's highway tunnels, one source with knowledge of the probe told Reuters on Friday. Autostrade was not immediately available to comment.
This is the fourth line of investigation involving the company, in addition to a probe over the collapse of the Genoa bridge, another one over alleged falsified safety reports on several motorway bridges and yet another one into motorway safety barriers."

Police said an improvised explosive device had been planted at the mosque inside a seminary in the city, the capital of Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan and Iran. 
It exploded during evening prayers on Friday, the second bombing in Quetta this week. 
""So far, 13 bodies and 20 injured have been brought here,"" Dr Wasim Baig, spokesman for a local hospital told Reuters, adding that many of the injured were in serious condition.
A senior police officer, Haji Amanullah was among the dead. His son was killed by unknown persons last month.

Mineral- and gas-rich Balochistan is at the center of the $60 billion China Pakistan Economic Corridor, which is part of China’s Belt and Road infrastructure project.
Violence in Balochistan has fueled concerns about the security of projects such as a planned energy link from western China to Pakistan's southern port of Gwadar.

The police force said it did not have sufficient funds to renew its entire fleet of several thousand vehicles and had already warned the authorities of the risk.
A spokeswoman declined to say how many vehicles now failed to meet the stricter rules. Some exceptions have been made for certain cars clearly marked as for police use, such as those equipped with a blue flashing light and a siren, she added.
Other vehicles have been shifted to duties outside the major cities. Belgium also has local police forces, such as six covering the capital Brussels.
The European Union introduced rules in 1992 to tighten emissions from new cars, with an initial set of standards known as Euro 1.
Brussels, Antwerp and Ghent already had bans in place on the most polluting vehicles, but from the start of this year also barred the ""Euro 3"" standard, which covered vehicles registered from 2001 to 2005.
The standards relate to the emission of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and particulates."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's first coalition government since the return to democracy began to take shape on Friday, designed to pacify markets nervous over a slowing economy, global trade tensions and the Socialists' reliance on the far left. 
After a cliffhanger vote on Tuesday that saw Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez chosen to form a new government, a steady trickle of announcements have sketched out one of Spain's largest cabinets in recent decades. It is tasked with forging consensus among a shaky patchwork of alliances to pass laws.
The new government's emphasis will be on the economy, Socialist sources told Reuters, as forecasts suggest growth will slow from 2.1% in 2019 to 1.8% this year.
Sanchez's government will include four deputy prime ministers - a first in modern Spanish history - three of whom are women.
Nadia Calvino, in charge of the economy ministry since 2018 and last year floated as a candidate to replace Christine Lagarde in running the International Monetary Fund, will coordinate economic affairs and digital transformation. 
Teresa Ribera will focus on the environment and rural depopulation, while Carmen Calvo will be responsible for parliamentary relations and recognizing victims of the civil war and Francisco Franco's dictatorship. 
The fourth deputy prime minister will be Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Unidas Podemos, who will handle social rights and sustainable development. The far-left party will also take four ministries, ranging from higher education to consumer affairs.
ECONOMY DOMINATES 
A senior Podemos official told Reuters the party was caught off guard by the addition of a fourth deputy prime minister, which he saw as a bid by the Socialists to limit Iglesias' influence.
""We want to make it clear that the area of economics will be key in this legislature,"" a source close to Sanchez told Reuters. ""And that the Socialists hold the reins of the economy."" 
The government's desire to prioritize the economy colored several of its choices. Arancha Gonzalez Laya, currently assistant secretary-general of the United Nations and a former World Trade Organization official, will replace Josep Borrell as foreign minister.
Jose Luis Escriva, head of Spain's budget watchdog and former chief economist at Spanish bank BBVA (MC:BBVA), will lead the ministry responsible for social security - charged with carrying out the long-awaited pension reform - as well as migration. 
In an analysis, JP Morgan bank said it saw ""no significant systemic risk implications"" in the blend of ministers. 
""We don't expect a left-wing government to behave anything like we saw in Italy, where two different breeds of populism, both with euro-sceptic components, drove policy making to extremes, severely undermining growth and fuelling major financial markets tensions,"" it said. 
Ratings agency Fitch, however, suggested the political uncertainty behind four elections in as many years and which forced the Socialists to court Catalan separatists in their bid to form government would remain the Achilles heel.

""The government only narrowly secured parliamentary backing, and the Catalan regional government's policy of pursuing independence remains a potential source of political volatility,"" it said in a note.

1034,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 09:23AM ET</span>","Fearing nuclear proliferation, Europe scrambles to calm Iran tensions","By John Irish and Robin Emmott
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe will look on Friday for ways to guide the United States and Iran away from open conflict, knowing that a miscalculation from either side could leave the bloc facing a war and a serious nuclear proliferation crisis at its doorstep.
In a rare emergency meeting, EU foreign ministers, to be joined by NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, may avoid any tough diplomatic response for now after Washington and Tehran backed off from an outright conflagration following the U.S. killing of an Iranian general in Iraq and retaliatory missile strikes by Iran that avoided military casualties.
""Iran's desire to prevent the crisis from escalating has bought us some time, it has the effect of cooling this down just a little,"" a senior EU diplomat told Reuters.
But French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian warned before the afternoon meeting that Iran could have a nuclear weapon in one to two years if the country fully breaks with a nuclear containment accord it reached with world powers in 2015.
""If they continue with unraveling the Vienna agreement, then yes, within a fairly short period of time, between one and two years, they could have access to a nuclear weapon, which is not an option,"" Le Drian said on RTL radio.
Iran has been gradually discarding the deal's limitations on its enrichment of uranium for nuclear fuel since President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the accord in 2018, demanding tougher curbs on Iran. 
Iran said its steps away from the deal are reversible if Washington returns to it and lifts crippling sanctions that have throttled much of Tehran's lifeblood oil trade. 
The simmering tensions have highlighted Europe's struggles to influence either side and play a mediating role with European powers Britain, France and Germany desperately trying to pressure Iran to stick to the nuclear pact. 
They also want to convince Trump, who on Wednesday called on them to join him in withdrawing from the nuclear deal, that they are tough-minded allies who will not be deceived by Tehran.
Late on Thursday, the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell spoke by telephone with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.
""We need to coordinate and maximize the effect everybody has in trying to de-escalate what the Iranians do, but it's the same for the Americans. What's most worrying is a miscalculation,"" said a French diplomatic source. 
NUCLEAR VIOLATIONS
Iran's decision on Monday to scrap all enrichment curbs has also left the European powers in an awkward position. 
Iran has repeatedly denied its nuclear program has military rather than civilian ends. But it has already breached many of the deal's restrictions meant to increase the amount of time Tehran would need to accumulate enough fissile material for an atomic bomb from two to three months to about a year.
The latest announcements could start reducing that time and the three European powers - who along with Russia and China have attempted to salvage the deal since Trump's withdrawal - are keen to send a firm message that the breaches are unacceptable.
They have agreed to begin a dispute resolution process under the 2015 deal that could lead to renewed U.N. sanctions on Tehran, but have hesitated on the timing fearing Iran may react badly, given its current confrontation with Washington.
Despite its moves, Iran has said the United Nations nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, can continue its on-site inspections at its atomic sites, leaving some wiggle room for diplomacy.
""Iran has not set any targets or deadlines when it comes to uranium enrichment targets, so that gives us time,"" a second EU diplomat said. A third EU diplomat said the decision to launch the process had been made, but that Friday was unlikely.

""There is a concern that it could trigger an Iranian escalation,"" said a European diplomat.

""The people we lost in the plane truly represented the smartest young researchers in the entire world,"" Maghbouleh said.
Many of the dead were highly qualified Iranian-Canadians, some of whom had studied together at Tehran's Sharif University. The number of Iranian international students in Canada more than doubled between 2016 and 2018, according to Canada's immigration department.
Many Iranians pursued graduate studies in Canada after the United States' policy toward Iran hardened in 2017.
The Ukrainian Airlines plane, which was headed to Toronto via Kiev, crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. The U.S. government believes Iran accidentally shot down the airliner, U.S. officials said on Thursday.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said 138 passengers of the 176 on board the doomed flight were traveling to Canada, of whom 63 were Canadian citizens.
Edmonton's University of Alberta lost 10 faculty, postgraduate students and alumni, the school's president said. Other victims were linked to universities in Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and British Columbia.
Canada has become a prime destination for Iran's top engineering undergraduate students partly because it offers a path to citizenship for international students, said Concordia University engineering professor Ali Dolatabadi. He was the graduate supervisor for one of the victims, Siavash Ghafouri Azar.
""I was the graduate program director in our department for seven years and I can easily say about half of our grad students are from Iran,"" Dolatabadi said from Montreal.
Among the dead were mentors and leaders in their fields, students and school administrators said. University of Alberta professor Mojgan Daneshmand was a Canada Research Chair in radio frequency microsystems. Others were researchers on hybrid electric vehicles, mechanical and computer engineering, and indigenous studies.
Newlyweds Arash Pourzarabi, 26, and Pouneh Gorji, 25, were graduate students in computer science at the University of Alberta, and had gone to Iran for their wedding.
Pourzarabi was a silver medalist in the National Olympiad in Informatics and the pair had been undergraduates in the prestigious Sharif University engineering program.
""There's an overwhelming sense of sadness on campuses right across the country from coast to coast,"" said Paul Davidson, president of Universities Canada, an association representing 95 universities, in Ottawa. ""There will be empty chairs."""

The court has reiterated its request to Belgian authorities to arrest and hand over Puigdemont and Comin to Spain and maintained their European arrest warrants, it said a statement.
Puigdemont and Comin were elected to the European Parliament in May 2019, and last month, the European Union's top court ruled that both men were entitled to immunity as elected MEPs.
They fled to Belgium in 2017 in the wake of Catalonia's failed bid for secession. Spain's Supreme Court has sentenced various other Catalan leaders to jail terms for their role in the attempt to hold an unauthorized independence referendum."
1037,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 08:47AM ET</span>",Iraq’s Premier Pushes U.S. to Discuss Exit of American Troops,"(Bloomberg) -- Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi asked U.S. Secretary of State Michael Pompeo to send officials to Iraq to work out a mechanism for the withdrawal of American troops, according to his office, as the fallout from the U.S. assassination of a top Iranian general in Baghdad roils ties.
The statement on Friday, citing a phone call the previous day between the two men, suggests that Abdul Mahdi is standing by demands from Iraqi lawmakers for American troops to leave following a killing which threatened to turn Iraqi territory into a proxy battleground.
The Jan. 3 targeting of General Qassem Soleimani, who oversaw Iran’s foreign military operations, outraged Shiite politicians in Iraq, many of whom have close ties to Tehran.
Their majority in parliament was enough to win a vote on expelling U.S. forces, though Sunni Arab and Kurdish legislators boycotted.
Iran’s military then fired salvos of retaliatory missiles as bases in Iraq where U.S. troops are stationed. A Pentagon analysis of the attack suggested the missiles were aimed at unpopulated parts of the bases.
Both sides have since backed away from military action, with President Donald Trump appealing for Iranian leaders to negotiate a peace.
Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Twitter that the missile attack “concluded” Iran’s retaliation for Soleimani’s killing. Even if Tehran refrains from further direct attacks, though, it might still seek reprisals through more covert means, such as attacks by proxy militias or in cyberspace.
It’s unclear how the U.S. will react to Abdul Mahdi’s demand. President Donald Trump responded angrily to the parliament vote, threatening to sanction Iraq and demanding reimbursement for investments made in the country over the past two decades if the government insists on U.S. forces leaving.
Pentagon chief Mark Esper said later that he believes the Iraqi people and lawmakers still want the U.S. to maintain a presence in the country, 17 years after it invaded to oust Saddam Hussein.
Trump escalated tensions with Iran in 2018 by withdrawing from the nuclear accord negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and reimposing sanctions that have crushed the Iranian economy.
Iran has responded by withdrawing from the atomic deal in phases, while its proxy forces in Yemen, Iraq and Syria are widely seen as having been behind attacks on a range of targets including critical oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia, a key U.S. ally in the region.
Trump ordered Soleimani killed after a Dec. 27 rocket attack on a joint U.S.-Iraqi base near Kirkuk resulted in the death of an American contractor. The U.S. blamed the attack on an Iran-backed militia and killed its leader in the strike on Soleimani.
The assassinations are the latest test for a nation that has seen almost non-stop upheaval since the U.S. invasion.
Iraqis fed up with corruption and the slow pace of recovery from the wreckage left by the war with Islamic State took to the streets in October for protests that also targeted Iran’s dominance of the country’s politics.
Iraq’s top Shiite cleric on Friday denounced the “repeated violations” of the country’s sovereignty and the government’s inability to deter attacks.
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said that no outside power should decide Iraq’s fate.
“The latest dangerous aggressive acts, which are repeated violations of Iraqi sovereignty, are a part of the deteriorating situation” in the region, he said, according to his representative Ahmed Al-Safi."

Mahdi made the request in a telephone call with Pompeo on Thursday, the Post said. The move followed a vote by Iraq's parliament to expel the 5,000 U.S. troops in the country after a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani last week.
Iran retaliated Tuesday night with air strikes on two bases in Iraq that house U.S. troops. There were no casualties and both Iran and the United States have since moved to de-escalate tensions.
The State Department did not immediately return a request for comment on the report.
In the phone call, Mahdi asked Pompeo ""to send representatives to Iraq to put in place a mechanism for implementing the parliament’s decision for the safe withdrawal of forces from Iraq,"" the Post said.
Mahdi also objected to U.S. forces entering Iraq and planes flying over Iraqi airspace, according to a statement cited by the Post."

A prison officer sustained injuries to his head and neck during the incident on Thursday morning which took place at Whitemoor prison in eastern England.
Two prisoners were detained by other staff and are thought to have used ""improvised bladed weapons"", according to London's Metropolitan Police.
Both attackers were also wearing belts with various items crudely attached, they added.
The BBC reported that one of the two inmates was serving a sentence for terrorism offences.
""The matter is being treated as a terrorist attack and the investigation continues at pace,"" police said in a statement.
Five staff members were hospitalized in the aftermath of the incident but have since been released.

LONDON (Reuters) - Angolan billionaire and former first daughter Isabel Dos Santos decried a New Year's Eve court order to freeze her vast assets as a ""witch hunt"" engineered to weaken her father's influence and distract from economic failures.
Dos Santos, named Africa's richest woman by Forbes with a fortune estimated at over $2 billion, is a highly divisive figure in Angola, where she is nicknamed ""the Princess"". Supporters see an inspirational entrepreneur while detractors say she embodies the kind of nepotism and corruption that has hamstrung the continent.
Since President Joao Lourenco succeeded dos Santos's father José Eduardo in 2017, after a nearly four-decade grip on power, he has cracked down on the role of his predecessor's children in state enterprises. He fired dos Santos from her job chairing oil firm Sonangol and her brother from the sovereign wealth fund.
In the latest step of what Angolan authorities say is one of Africa's most successful anti-corruption drives, dos Santos's assets were frozen on Dec. 31, threatening to turn a titan of African business into a pariah.
In an interview with Reuters, the 46-year-old rejected the corruption allegations leveled at her.
""This is a political trial, you have a persecuting state and servile and partisan magistrates. Then you have a woman who has been chosen to set an example as a scapegoat. That's me."" Dos Santos told Reuters in an interview in London.
""In an attempt to mask and distract people from the real economic challenges, (Lourenco) is praising this very selective witch hunt that he is portraying as a fight against corruption.""
The Angolan government and the state prosecutor's office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Court documents allege dos Santos and her husband steered payments of more than $1 billion from Sonangol and official diamond trading group Sodiam to companies in which they held stakes.
Dos Santos said she and her colleagues were not contacted about any investigation or asked to provide any defense, and she learned of the court action via journalists over WhatsApp.
Prosecutors pushed the case forward based on ""lies, false testimony and also false documents"", she said.
PRIVATISING SONANGOL?
Angola's government is considering privatising key state firms including Sonangol, which has struggled with output declines as power blackouts have repeatedly hit the capital.
But Dos Santos said Lourenco ""might have no choice"" but to privatize Sonangol due to its poor performance.
She also said efforts to split a joint stake she shared with Sonangol in a Portuguese oil company,  Galp Energia  (LS:GALP), had been scuppered by the asset freeze.
Sonangol did not respond to a request for comment.
Buoyed by high oil prices in the last decade, Angolan businesses bought up sizeable assets in former colonial master Portugal, with dos Santos acquiring stakes in Portuguese firms, including Eurobic bank, telecoms company NOS (LS:NOS) and engineering company Efacec.
The Bank of Portugal told Reuters it was evaluating dos Santos' suitability as a shareholder of Portuguese banks, but she said she did not fear for her financial interests abroad because, unlike Angola, they have ""a state of law"".
RICHEST, POOREST
Dos Santos says her mission is to encourage entrepreneurship and galvanize the private sector to drive growth in Angola, Africa's second-biggest oil exporter, a major diamond producer and sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest economy.
But her critics say her vast fortune amassed by the businesswoman and her family is offensive in one of the world's poorest countries, where the World Bank has estimated two-thirds of the population live on less than $2 a day.
Her jet-setting across the international lecture circuit, which she advertises to her large Instagram following, rankles with many of her detractors.
While she declined to elaborate on her personal wealth, Dos Santos said investments in her Angolan companies run into the billions of dollars, ranging from telecoms firm Unitel to Banco de Fomento Angola, a new brewery and bottling plant, a TV satellite operator and stores.
The asset freeze endangered tens of thousands of employees in her firms, she said, and threatened to lock billions of dollars in private and commercial bank accounts underpinning mortgages and imports of basic foodstuffs.
Dos Santos said the moves by Angolan authorities against her were an attempt to erase her father's influence within the ruling MPLA party, as internal elections loom in 2021 for the party leadership.
The MPLA triumphed in a 1975-2002 civil war with help from Cuba and the Soviet Union over groups backed by the United States and apartheid-era South Africa.
Isabel, born in Soviet Azerbaijan while the future president and his Russian wife were petroleum engineering students, recalls taking her first steps in an MPLA camp deep in the Angolan bush among guerrilla ""freedom fighters"".
""What's happening now is a move to neutralize anyone who could influence a change of course within the MPLA,"" she said."

Pernik, a town of more than 70,000, has been subject to severe water restrictions for about two months, a matter that has been under investigation by several institutions.
Many have blamed Dimov for failing to take measures to avoid a critical draining of the dam that provides drinking water to Pernik. The government has sacked the head of the local water facility over poor management and water waste of over 70% of its outdated water pipes.
Prosecutors have also seized documents connected to permits for waste imports, mainly from Italy, as part of an operation against illegal storage and treatment of waste.
Prime Minister Boyko Borissov has accepted Dimov's resignation, a government statement said. Prosecutors were expected later to make a statement about their investigations into the environment ministry and the water crisis.
Dimov was kept in custody for 24 hours on Thursday, following raids by police and prosecutor on the environmental ministry as well as in the regional administration of city of Pernik and its water facility.
Opposition Socialists plan to file a no-confidence motion against the government on Jan 20, accusing it of failing to prevent the water crisis in Pernik and poor management of waste imports, whose burning it says pollutes air in many Bulgarian cities.

The European Union state is currently expected to hold local and parliamentary polls in June and late 2020, respectively, with no more elections scheduled after that until 2024. Previous election years have shown policymaking all but stops until lawmakers are sworn in.
Orban's minority government came to power in early November after the previous Social Democrat (PSD) cabinet was toppled in a no-confidence vote after three years in power. His Liberal Party currently leads in opinion polls.
The Social Democrats' expansionary fiscal and wage policies have increased Romania's budget and current account deficits, while changes to judicial legislation seen by Brussels as endangering the rule of law have dented investors’ appetite.
The PSD remains the country's largest party, with the most parliamentary seats.
A snap election can be triggered only if parliament rejects two successive prime minister proposals within sixty days. Analysts have said such a feat would be extremely difficult with fragmented and polarized parliamentary groupings.
""Let me be clear, President Klaus Iohannis and I have decided early elections are what is best for Romania,"" Orban told reporters after meeting the president.
He said last year's European and presidential elections have shown Romanians no longer wanted the Social Democrats in power.
""Parliament is currently dominated by the PSD, which acts as a brake on the government, and it is necessary that citizens elect their representatives to be a mirror image of their wishes,"" said Orban, who declined to comment on how he would trigger snap polls.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's government defied trade unions on Friday by including a contested clause on raising the retirement age by two years in its draft legislation, amid signs that weeks of street protests and strikes may be losing momentum.
President Emmanuel Macron's proposed reform to streamline France's byzantine pension schemes is the biggest overhaul of the system since World War Two and is central to his ambition to make the labor force more flexible and competitive globally.
But it has infuriated trade unions who argue the reform will erode hard-earned benefits and leave pensioners worse off.
The bill, which will be sent to France's pension administrators on Friday for their consideration, says the retirement age for a full pension will be progressively raised to reach 64 ""for the 1965 generation who will retire from 2027"".
Under the proposal, the legal retirement age will remain 62 but workers who leave at that point will not receive their maximum pension.
""We could not have a text that is silent on the age (for a balanced pension budget),"" Laurent Pietraszewski, secretary of state for pensions, told Reuters. ""It is at the heart of the reform."" 
DEADLOCK
If Macron emerges the winner from the weeks-long showdown, he will have gone further than any other French postwar leader in shaking up the pension system.
However, negotiations continue on Friday between the unions and Prime Minister Edouard Philippe. It is still possible the plans will be watered down as the government seeks to break the deadlock.
Hard-left unions are calling for the government to abandon the bill. The reform-minded CFDT union, France's largest, is open to the planned universal ""points"" system, but says an increase of the retirement age ""crosses a red line"".
Unions brought hundreds of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets in cities across France on Thursday but turnout was down on past protests and their momentum is faltering. Participation in strikes now in their 37th day has waned and public support fallen, according to opinion polls.
Philippe has agreed to seek a way of balancing the pension budget other than by raising the retirement age while the bill is being scrutinized in parliament. His government has promised to include any alternative solutions as amendments.
But that has so far been rejected by the unions.
""A compromise will only be found once the sword of Damocles that is the retirement age is no longer hanging over us,"" Laurent Escure, leader of the UNSA union said after his meeting with Philippe. 

Parliament is due to debate the bill from mid-February.

The draft law, already approved by the lower house of parliament, would allow judges who question planned reforms to be disciplined.
The ruling nationalist Law and Justice party (PiS) says it will make the judiciary more efficient. But the commissioner for human rights at the Council of Europe criticized the plans in a letter published on Friday.
""I am particularly concerned that the provisions of the new bill are designed to further silence dissent among critical judges and prosecutors and curtail their independence,"" Commissioner Dunja Mijatovic said in the letter to Senate speaker Tomasz Grodzki, published by Poland's foreign ministry.
The Senate, the upper house of parliament where the opposition has a majority, could redraft or reject the draft legislation when it debates it next week, but the PiS-controled lower house would still have the power to overturn any changes.
Mijatovic also said Poland's government had done little to implement her earlier recommendations on protecting judicial independence, published in a report in June.
Poland's Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Szymon Szynkowski vel Sek told a news conference on Friday that Mijatovic's letter constituted unacceptable meddling in Poland's internal affairs.
The European Union has already said the draft legislation would imperil the rule of law. It has launched legal action in what it says is defense of Polish courts' independence.
On Thursday the Council of Europe's Venice Commission, a body of legal experts, came to Warsaw for consultations on the judicial reforms.
Brussels has asked Poland to hold off adopting the draft law until it consults the Venice Commission, which is due to release an opinion next week.
On Saturday judges in Poland, supported by colleagues from other countries, will stage a protest against the latest changes in the justice system."

Thursday's attack near the Malian border followed a raid by Islamic State insurgents on another military outpost last month that killed 71 soldiers, the deadliest strike against Nigerien forces for years.
Despite the presence of French and American troops, attacks in Niger have risen four-fold over the past year, killing nearly 400 people, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a non-profit research organization.
""The strategy has to change,"" Defense Minister Issoufou Katambe told Reuters. ""We are not going to stay on the defensive. We will go on the offensive.""
Katambe did not provide details. Niger has struggled to effectively respond to the violence near the western border with Mali, where four U.S. soldiers were killed in an Islamic State ambush in 2017.
It was not clear who was responsible for Thursday's attack in Chinagodrar, which is about 130 miles (210 km) north of the capital Niamey.
The assailants approached the military post on motorcycles and other vehicles, the government said. Sixty-three assailants were killed in the ensuing firefight, it said.
Security has deteriorated in the past year across West Africa's Sahel region, a semi-arid swathe of land beneath the Sahara. Jihadist attacks by affiliates of Islamic State and al Qaeda have been compounded by deadly ethnic reprisals between rival farming and herding communities.
“The region has experienced a devastating surge in terrorist attacks against civilian and military targets,” Mohamed Ibn Chambas, the U.N. secretary-general's representative in West Africa, told the Security Council this week.
The crisis began in 2012 when ethnic Tuareg rebels and loosely aligned jihadists seized northern Mali. France intervened to help beat them back, but the jihadists have regrouped and expanded their operations into neighboring countries."

1048,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 06:13AM ET</span>",Tunisian parliament set to reject new government in Friday vote,"TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia's parliament looked poised to reject a proposed new government on Friday after only one party said it would support it in a vote of confidence, meaning a complex coalition-building process may need to start again.
Designated prime minister Habib Jemli urged parliament to support his proposed cabinet as the debate began on Friday morning, before a vote expected later in the day.
However, the only party in the deeply fragmented parliament to say it will back his government is the moderate Islamist Ennahda, which nominated Jemli as prime minister after coming first in the Oct. 6 election with 53 of the 217 seats.
The parties that have already said they will vote against it have a combined 120 seats, so Jemli would need to peel off some of their MPs as well as winning over all independents to secure the 109 seats needed for majority support.
If Jemli loses the confidence vote, President Kais Saied, who was also elected in October, can ask somebody else to try to build a coalition able to command a majority in parliament.
Even if he manages to win the confidence vote, however, it would likely be by so small a margin that his government would be very fragile, with little chance of passing painful economic reforms that analysts say are needed.
Youssef Chahed, who has served as prime minister since 201‮‮6‬‬, and was a losing candidate in the presidential election, will continue as acting premier until a new government is appointed.
If Saied's own candidate for prime minister was also unable to form a government that could win a confidence vote, he would call another election.
Friday's vote looked likely to be the first since Tunisia's 2011 democratic revolution in which a parliament has rejected a new government, and would also represent a setback for Ennahda.
The party has been the most consistently powerful force in Tunisian politics since the revolution, playing a major part in successive governments and coming first in several elections.
However, while it emerged as the biggest party in the October election, its vote share and number of seats declined, and its efforts to bring together political rivals behind Jemli now also appear doomed."

LONDON (Reuters) - Meghan, the wife of Prince Harry, has gone back to Canada to be with their son after the couple provoked a rift with Britain's royal family by unexpectedly announcing they would be stepping back from their roles to spend more time in North America.
Queen Elizabeth and other senior British royals were trying to calm the crisis by thrashing out a plan for Harry and Meghan after the couple blindsided the family by going public with their announcement without consultation.
The couple spent six weeks in Canada at the end of last year before returning to Britain and their first official engagement of 2020 was to visit Canada House to say thank you for what they said had been an ""unbelievable"" welcome.
Their baby son, Archie, remained in Canada as Harry and Meghan returned to announce that they would step back from royal duties and build a more ""progressive"" role for themselves.
Meghan has now returned to Canada to be with her son, a spokeswoman said.
The couple - formally the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - said they had been reflecting for months before making the decision, which would see them divide their time between Britain and North America to allow them and Archie the space they needed.
They also said they intended to become financially independent.
The couple, who spoke of their struggles dealing with the intense media attention in a TV interview last October, revealed their decision to step back from royal duties on Instagram, leaving senior royals hurt and disappointed. 
Discussions over the future had only been at a preliminary stage and neither the queen nor Prince Charles - Harry's father and heir to the throne - were consulted on the release of their statement or its contents, a royal source said.
As the crisis engulfed the Windsors, aides who work for the queen, Charles, and Harry's elder brother William were trying to find a solution.
The royal source said it was hoped a successful outcome would take ""days not weeks"".
""CRISIS TALKS""
""Queen fights to save monarchy,"" the Daily Mirror said on its front page while the Sun tabloid spoke of ""Crisis talks after couple defied Queen"".
While other members of the royal family have had paying jobs, it was not immediately clear how Harry, 35 and sixth in line to the throne, and Meghan, 38, could become what royal biographers said was effectively ""half-royal"" - and who would pay for their transatlantic lifestyles.
At the moment, nearly all of their income is provided by Charles's Duchy of Cornwall estate, although the cost of their security - estimated by newspapers to be hundreds of thousands of pounds a year - is currently met by the government.
The Times newspaper said Charles might cut off their funding if they moved away from royal duties altogether, although public relations experts said they could use their global fame to make large sums through public speaking, endorsements or their own TV production company.
Six months ago Harry and Meghan applied to the UK Intellectual Property Office to trademark the phrases Sussex Royal and Sussex Royal Foundation for items ranging from books and charity campaigns to pyjamas and socks.
""The monarchy needs to be asked serious questions about what they're up to, it's not good enough to be told to wait for clarification or to be left reading the tea leaves to work out what their intentions are,"" said Graham Smith, from campaign group Republic, which wants to abolish the royals.

A YouGov poll of 1,327 Britons found that 45% supported the couple's decision to step away from royal life but 63% believed their Duchy of Cornwall funding should end.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey plans to sign by February a preliminary $2.7 billion compensation deal for work carried out in Libya before the 2011 civil war, a sector official said, seeking to revive stalled Turkish business operations in the conflict-ridden country.
Turkish businesses have long been active in Libya but their projects were disrupted by turmoil when rebels overthrew Muammar Gaddafi nine years ago, and have been hit again by ongoing fighting there.
A significant hurdle to reinvigorating investment has been uncertainty regarding unpaid debts. Muzaffer Aksoy, chairman of the Turkish-Libyan Business Council, said the two countries were close to signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU).
""Work on the MoU regarding the old contracts is reaching an end. The problem of unpaid debts, damages and a letter of guarantee will be solved,"" Aksoy told Reuters in an interview.
Set to be signed later this month or in February, the deal will encompass a $1 billion letter of guarantee, $500 million in damage to machinery and equipment and unpaid debts of $1.2 billion, he said.
With current projects in Libya on hold due to fighting, the backlog of Turkish contract work in Libya amounts to $16 billion, including $400-500 million for projects which have not yet begun, Aksoy added.
Turkey and Russia have become increasingly involved in the conflict, with Ankara backing the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, while Moscow has largely backed forces in East Libya led by Khalifa Haftar.
Haftar's forces said on Thursday they would not let up in their military campaign against rival factions in Tripoli, appearing to reject a call by Russia and Turkey for a ceasefire.
Despite the disruption, Libyan-Turkish trade remains buoyant, with Turkish exports reaching $2 billion annually and imports at $350 million, Aksoy said.
However, Turkish contractors with projects in Libya had not been able to travel to the country since April due to fighting.
""New contracts had been signed: projects like power stations, housing, business centers. Signatures have been signed for letters of credit for some of these. However, since April they have not been able to go for security reasons,"" Aksoy said."

Chung said on arriving back in South Korea that Trump had remembered the day they met was Kim Jong Un's birthday and had sent him birthday greetings.
""President Trump asked President Moon to deliver his message to Chairman Kim,"" said Chung, without elaborating whether it was a written message or whether it included anything beyond the greeting.
Kim's birthday is believed to be Jan. 8, though his secretive regime has never confirmed the date. The U.S. government lists Kim's birth year as 1984, making him 36 years old this year.
On Wednesday, Chung also met the U.S. special envoy for North Korea, Stephen Biegun, and ""reaffirmed close U.S.-ROK coordination on North Korea,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said, using the initials for South Korea's official name the Republic of Korea.
The two also discussed recent events in the Middle East and their coordination on global security issues.
South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha will meet U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in California next week, along with their Japanese counterpart, Toshimitsu Motegi, and North Korea and South Korea-Japan relations will be on the top of the agenda.

South Korean President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday there is an urgent need for practical ways to improve ties with North Korea, adding that he was ready to meet its reclusive leader in North Korea.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia urged nearly a quarter of a million people to evacuate their homes on Friday and prepared military backup as authorities said the next few hours could be ""very, very challenging"" even as rain poured down in some parts.
Defense personnel stood ready to move to bushfire grounds if conditions became extreme, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters, as soaring temperatures and erratic winds create dangerous conditions.
""Even with rain in Melbourne, even with forecast better conditions next week, there is a long way to go in what has been an unprecedented fire event...and, of course, we know that we have many weeks of the fire season to run,"" Daniel Andrews, the premier of Victoria, told a televised briefing.
""The next few hours are going to be very, very challenging.""
While the winds are expected to move through by Saturday morning, Andrews urged residents to stay on high alert and leave the community ""if you are told to"".
Authorities sent emergency texts to 240,000 people in Victoria, telling them to leave. People in high-risk regions in New South Wales and South Australia were also urged to think about leaving, but officials did not say how many. 
GRAPHIC: Sizing up Australia’s bushfires - https://graphics.reuters.com/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES-SCALE/0100B4VK2PN/index.html 
Since October, 27 people have been killed and thousands subjected to repeat evacuations as huge and unpredictable fires scorched more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres) of land, an area roughly the size of South Korea.
In the coastal town of Eden in New South Wales, where the alert status was upgraded to 'watch and act' on Friday evening, smoke filled the horizon as winds blew smoke and ash.
Shereen and Kim Green, who live on a farm with three houses and 50 cattle just outside Eden, were racing to fill two 1,000-litre tanks of water.
""This is to put out the spot fires and we'll be staying up all night to defend our property,"" said Shereen, as the wind shook her utility vehicle. ""We're taking the opportunity while we can.""
Sitting under the town's watchtower, another resident Robyn Malcolm said: ""If it all goes wrong, we'll dash down to the wharf and get on a tugboat.""
Here are key events in the crisis:
* Of 160 fires ablaze across New South Wales (NSW), about 46 were uncontained. Two were burning at an 'emergency level', eight blazes were in the ""watch and act"" category, with the rest at the ""advice"" level, the lowest alert rating.
* Neighboring Victoria had 36 fires, with more than 1.3 million hectares burned. Nine fires were at an emergency level.
* In the alpine region on the border of the southeastern states of Victoria and New South Wales, two fires were poised to merge and create a blaze over almost 600,000 hectares (1.5 million acres).
* Victoria emergency services minister Lisa Neville said some communities had been provided with large containers of satellite phones, baby formula, food, nappies, and torches in case they are cut off.
* Campaigners protested in Sydney and Melbourne on Friday as part of a wave of demonstrations planned in major world cities, to spotlight concerns about Australia's climate change policies.
* Westpac estimated total bushfire losses to date at about A$5 billion ($3.4 billion), higher than the 2009 bushfires in Victoria but smaller than the Queensland floods in 2010/11. It forecast a hit of 0.2% to 0.5% on gross domestic product.
* Australia's alpine resorts have dusted off winter snowmaking machines to blast ice-cold water onto dry ski slopes as fires threaten the Snowy Mountains region.
* The Insurance Council of Australia increased its estimate of damages claims from the fires to more than A$900 million, with claims expected to jump further.
* Health officials in New South Wales urged extra precautions to avoid heat-related illnesses.
* Australia's wildfires have dwarfed other catastrophic blazes, with its burned terrain more than twice the extent of that ravaged this year by fires in Brazil, California and Indonesia combined.
* Of nine fires in the state of South Australia, one was categorized as an emergency.
* Climate protests were also planned on Friday in cities such as Canberra, targeting the government's handling of the crisis and its position on climate change.
* Prime Minister Morrison said he was considering holding a wide-ranging national inquiry into the bushfires after the immediate crisis passed.
* Just shy of 2,000 homes have been destroyed in New South Wales, state authorities said, half during the past 10 days.
* The Commonwealth Bank of Australia is to donate cricketer Shane Warne's prized ""baggy green"" cap to a museum after paying more than A$1 million for it at an auction for bushfire relief.
* Authorities have warned that the huge fires, spurred by high temperatures, wind and a three-year drought, will persist until there is substantial rainfall. The weather agency said there was no sign of that for months.
* Ecologists at the University of Sydney have estimated 1 billion animals have been killed or injured in the bushfires, potentially destroying ecosystems.
* Morrison has pledged A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) to a newly created National Bushfire Recovery Agency.
* About 100 firefighters from the United States and Canada are helping, with another 140 expected in coming weeks.
* The fires have emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide and produced harmful pollutants, the European Union's Copernicus monitoring program said.
* Smoke has drifted across the Pacific, affecting cities in South America, and may have reached the Antarctic, the U.N.'s World Meteorological Organization said.

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Days after Anas Hussain was killed in his hometown of Nehtaur in northern India during an anti-government protest last month, an online crowdfunding campaign raised 1 million rupees (nearly $14,000) to help his family.
As protests against a new citizenship law snowball across the country, several crowdfunding and grassroots campaigns have sprung up to help sustain the movement and provide legal aid and compensation to the families of victims of the violence.
Protest organizers say they are maintaining lists of lawyers, doctors and others to call on if required.
Crowdfunding for social causes has been used previously exists in India, but lawyers and campaigners say the coordinated effort to keep protests going and to help victims is happening for the first time in the sprawling nation.
""These are campaigns to save democracy in India,"" said Bilal Zaidi, founder of the Our Democracy platform, which has hosted many such online initiatives, including one to provide aid to Hussain's family.
""The idea was to bring more transparency in our democratic lives,"" said Zaidi, who previously worked in the United States on Democrat Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign, which raised millions of dollars via crowdfunding.
Relatives of Hussain say the young waiter was gunned down by police in Uttar Pradesh state while out to buy milk for his infant daughter. Police deny the allegation and say the 22-year-old was one of many people rioting during protests against the citizenship law pushed through by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government last month.
Police say they suspect he died during firing from armed protesters and say investigations are ongoing.
At least 25 people have been killed in violence related to protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, which critics say is loaded against the country's minority Muslims and erodes India's secular foundations.
It is the strongest challenge to Modi's rule since he swept to power in 2014. Modi has said the law will not affect anyone who is currently a citizen.
At least 21 of the victims were killed in Uttar Pradesh. Authorities in the state have also issued notices to the families of suspected rioters seeking to attach their property to pay for damage caused. All the dead and most of the accused are Muslims.
Lawyers say such a move is a first in India, and many call it illegal since the suspects had not been found guilty of any crime. The government says it is the right thing to do.
""The action that the government is taking against rioters has become an example for the whole country,"" said a tweet last month from the office of Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu priest who is the top elected official in Uttar Pradesh.
""Every single person responsible for this violence...we will seize their property and will take revenge for their actions,"" Adityanath said in a video statement later. ""We will seize their assets and auction them to pay for this damage.""
Adityanath was not available for comment on this story.
""WANTED TO DO SOMETHING""
His top adviser Mrityunjan Kumar said the state government was not aware of the crowdfunding campaigns to help victims. He said the government was ""doing its best to take action only against the people who have been found guilty and no one else.""
People involved in the crowdfunding include Hindus, Muslims and people of other faiths, said Zaidi. Some said they became involved because of the heavy-handed crackdown.
""The government is not interested in listening to its people. They are painting this agitation as anti-national,"" said Deepak Gupta, a Hindu businessman from New Delhi who began the campaign for to help Hussain's kin. ""With all these protests, I'm very emotional right now, and wanted to do something.""
Many lawyers are offering their services free of charge - pro bono - to have detained protesters released and help the families of victims.
Shanu Khan, a 15-year-old in Uttar Pradesh's Sambhal town, was detained by police while he was returning home from tuitions on Dec. 19, his father Afzal Khan said.
""For four days we didn't know his whereabouts,"" said Khan, who has since learned that his son is lodged in jail in another city accused of involvement in violence that had broken out in the area that day.
Khan's family, and those of four other young men, have since received a notice demanding 245,000 rupees ($3,430) for alleged damage to public property.
""Where will we get the money? We're barely scraping by,"" said Afzal Khan, a day laborer.
M.A. Farooqui, who along with other lawyers in the area has been working pro bono to help some of the detainees, including Shanu Khan, calls the property seizure notices ""illegal.""
""There's no provision in the law that allows the government to claim damages from people whose crimes have not been proven,"" said Farooqui.
Anas Tanvir, a Supreme Court lawyer who has been working with other lawyers and law students to provide legal aid to victims and detainees, said he had never before seen ""such a need for immediate legal intervention"".
""Organizations like ours only succeed if the state fails,"" he said.
Elsewhere, students have coalesced to form networks of support groups and lists of useful contacts to help protesters with everything from trauma to mental distress.
""All students in cities that have been actively dissenting have a list of lawyers, doctors, counselors and media that they are keeping handy,"" said Teresa Braggs, a communication studies student in Bengaluru. ""These small things are helpful."""
1055,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 05:13AM ET</span>",British woman faces jail for posing as a boy to lure girls into sex,"WINCHESTER, England (Reuters) - A young British woman who posed as a teenage boy to deceive potentially dozens of young girls into having sexual contact with her will be sentenced on Friday and may face a jail term.
Gemma Watts, 21, created an online persona as Jake Waton, a 16-year-old boy, and used social media to strike up relationships with girls as young as 14. Police described her male alter ego as very believable.
Watts pleaded guilty in November to seven charges relating to four victims aged 14 and 15, although police believe she was a prolific predator and that there are likely to be many other unidentified victims.
The charges included sexual assault and meeting a child following sexual grooming. Watts, who is on bail, is due to be sentenced at Winchester Crown Court in southern England.
She would start her grooming by liking girls' profiles on Snapchat or Instagram, then sending them complimentary messages. Soon she would be calling them ""Babe"" or other pet names.
Her own profile as Jake Waton featured posts about skateboarding and photographs of herself, dressed in baggy sportswear, with her long hair tied up in a bun and hidden under a cap or hood.
Having persuaded her victims to meet her, Watts traveled by train to their homes in various parts of England. The girls believed they were in genuine relationships with a teenage boy. In several cases, there were multiple encounters over a period of months.
She met the parents of some of her victims and had conversations with them. They too were taken in.
Phillipa Kenwright, one of the detectives involved in the case, said the victims were unaware they had been deceived until they were contacted by police, and it had been devastating for them to learn the truth.
""It's been life-changing for all of the victims involved,"" Kenwright told reporters in a briefing ahead of sentencing. ""For some of these girls it's one of their first relationships.""
The case has not previously been made public, and Kenwright said she expected that once the details were in the media, more victims would come forward. She said her personal estimate was that there might be between 20 and 50 unidentified victims.
Watts, who left school at 16 and lives with her mother in north London, first came to the attention of the police in April 2018. Despite knowing she was under investigation, she continued her activities as Jake for many more months.

Kenwright said Watts had expressed no remorse and given no explanation for her actions.

1056,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 05:13AM ET</span>",Killings in eastern Congo may amount to crimes against humanity: U.N.,"GENEVA (Reuters) - Killings, rapes and other violence committed by an ethnic armed group in northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo against a rival group may amount to crimes against humanity and possibly even genocide, the United Nations said on Friday.
The attacks in mineral-rich Ituri province have mostly targeted Hema herders, who have long been in conflict with Lendu farmers over grazing rights and political representation.
Since September 2018, Lendu armed groups have increasingly become more organized in carrying out attacks against the Hema and members of other ethnic groups such as the Alur, the U.N. human rights office said in a report on its investigation.
Army and police forces have failed to stop the violence, it said, calling on Congolese authorities to address the root causes of the conflict.
""The barbarity that characterizes these attacks – including the beheading of women and children with machetes, the dismemberment and removal of body parts of the victims as trophies of war – reflects the desire of the attackers to inflict lasting trauma to the Hema communities and to force them to flee and not return to their villages,"" the report said.
""The violence documented … could contain some elements of crimes against humanity through murder, torture, rape and other forms of sexual violence, pillage and persecution,"" it said.
""Certain elements constituting genocide"" - a rare designation under international law - may be present, it said.
At least 701 people have been killed and 168 injured during inter-ethnic violence between the Hema and Lendu communities in Djugu and Mahagi territories from December 2017 to Sept 2019, the report said. At least 142 people have suffered acts of sexual violence, it added.
Most victims are from the Hema community, but the U.N. investigators said they had also documented acts of reprisals by some members of the Hema communities, including the burning of villages.
The International Criminal Court (ICC) sentenced former Congolese military leader Bosco Ntaganda last November to 30 years in prison for atrocities including murder, rape and conscripting child soldiers.
The crimes were committed while he was military chief of the Union of Congolese Patriots (UPC) militia in eastern Congo in 2002-2003, which targeted Lendu people for expulsion. Hundreds were also killed."
1057,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 04:31AM ET</span>",Israel frees two as 'goodwill' for return of soldier's remains from Syria,"By Rami Ayyub
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel on Friday released two more prisoners, including one jailed for spying for Syria, in what it called a goodwill gesture for the Russian-assisted repatriation last year of the body of a long-missing Israeli soldier. 
Russia, a key ally of Syria, in April handed Israel the remains and personal effects of Zachary Baumel, who was declared missing in action along with two other Israeli soldiers after a 1982 tank battle with Syrian forces in Lebanon.
The Israeli prime minister's office said the two men freed were from Majdal Shams, a Druze village in Golan Heights territory Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally. 
Sidqi al-Maqt was jailed in 2015 ""for treason and espionage, support for terrorism and contact with a hostile organization"", and Amal Abu Saleh the same year ""for killing a Syrian civilian"", Israel's Prisons Service said in a statement.
Maqt, 53, had been sentenced to 11 years in prison in part for spying for the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, a Prisons Service spokeswoman said. 
Abu Salah, 26, was serving a seven-year sentence after attacking an Israeli military ambulance carrying Syrian casualties from that country's civil war, killing one of them, Israeli media reported. 
Both men were freed ""before the end of their imprisonment"" in coordination with the Israeli military, the Prisons Service said. They were expected to return to Majdal Shams.
In April last year, Israel freed two Syrian prisoners back to Syria in an initial goodwill gesture for the return of Baumel's body after it was discovered by Russian special forces in Syria.
Speaking to reporters outside Ketziot prison in southern Israel, Maqt said his release ""is thanks to the efforts of President Bashar al-Assad"".
""The will of the Syrian people won and the will of (Assad) won when the Israeli enemy and the Israeli occupation were forced to release us without any conditions or restrictions,"" Maqt said.
The Syrian state news agency SANA quoted Maqt as saying that he ""looks forward to the liberation of all Syrians"". 
The roughly 20,000 Druze residents of the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights largely consider themselves Syrian and do not recognize Israel's sovereignty there. 
There was no immediate comment on Friday's release from Russia, whose president Vladimir Putin made a rare visit to Syria this week, only his second since intervening in that country's civil war in 2015.

The Southeast Asian city-state said last year it planned to buy an initial four F-35s from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT), with an option for eight more, as it looks to replace its aging F-16 fleet.
""The State Department has made a determination approving a possible foreign military sale to Singapore of up to twelve F-35B ... aircraft and related equipment for an estimated cost of $2.750 billion,"" the DSCA said in a statement, adding it had notified Congress of a possible sale.
The DSCA said the sale would involve equipment from Lockheed and engine maker Pratt and Whitney. The F-35B variant of the jet can handle short takeoffs and vertical landings, attributes seen as benefiting land-scarce Singapore.
Singapore's defense ministry said formal terms of the purchase would be negotiated after approval from Congress. 
The Pentagon in October announced F-35 jet prices for the next three years which lowered the cost of the jet by 13%, a move seen as encouraging other countries to buy the aircraft.
The jet makes up about 25% of Lockheed's annual revenue.
With Southeast Asia's largest defense budget, wealthy Singapore is a key prize for global arms companies as it looks to invest in new technology and upgrade its equipment.

Singapore, which is expected to hold an election within months, set aside about 30% of its total expenditure on defense, security and diplomacy efforts in its 2019 annual budget.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's Supreme Court said on Friday that an indefinite shutdown of the internet in Kashmir was illegal, rebuking the government for the communications lockdown imposed after it withdrew the Muslim majority region's autonomy in August.
Indefinite suspension of the internet violated India's telecoms rules, the court said, ordering authorities to review all curbs in Kashmir in a week.
""Freedom of Internet access is a fundamental right,"" Supreme Court justice N. V. Ramana said.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu-nationalist government has frequently used internet shutdowns as a tool to quell dissent in troubled parts of the country.
Last month, authorities imposed an internet clampdown in parts of the capital and in areas of the eastern state of Assam and Uttar Pradesh in the north as protests raged against a new citizenship law that Muslims see as discriminatory.
The shutdown in Kashmir, which has been on for more than 150 days, is the longest such outage in any democracy, according to digital rights group Access Now.
The government has argued that the blackout in Kashmir, a Himalayan region claimed by neighboring Pakistan and plagued by separatist militants, was essential to maintain calm.
The Supreme Court's decision, which also asks authorities to make public all orders on internet shutdowns, should enable more scrutiny of suspensions, internet freedom activists said.
""This sheds light on the rationale behind internet shutdowns which then can be challenged as being constitutional or proportionate or not,"" said Nikhil Pahwa, digital rights activist and editor of MediaNama, a Delhi-based publication. 
""So if the state is forced to be transparent, they will be more accountable.""
In 2019, India's documented internet blackouts lasted for more than 4,000 hours, costing Asia's third-biggest economy $1.3 billion, according to a report by website Top10VPN.
An uneasy calm prevails in Kashmir. The internet was restored in hospitals last week and some mobile phone connections are working. 
The blackout has severely disrupted the lives of millions and had an impact on everything from college admissions to businesses filing tax returns. 
""The court also said the freedom of press is impacted by the shutdown,"" said Vrinda Grover, an advocate representing petitioners, who include journalists and civil society members. 

""It is an abuse of power.""

(Reuters) - As newly liberated royals, Britain's Prince Harry and his wife Meghan have the world at their feet with the potential to make money in areas ranging from fashion and speaking engagements to forming their own production company.
But the couple, formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, should move wisely to make themselves financially independent in a world where social media influencers like Kim Kardashian reign and where their visibility will be magnified rather than reduced, branding experts and Hollywood observers say.
""Brand Sussex is a global brand and could end up making an absolute fortune, from public speaking to Meghan reinventing her lifestyle blog, to merchandising or brand endorsements,"" said Nick Bullen, editor-in-chief of True Royalty TV.
Harry and Meghan shocked Queen Elizabeth when they announced on Wednesday they wanted to lead a more independent life, and finance it themselves.
Meghan's background as an actress on the U.S. television show ""Suits"" immediately prompted speculation she could return to acting.
But the range of options open to them is far wider. It could include establishing an independent production company to make television shows, documentaries, podcasts or movies along the lines of the Higher Ground company formed by ex-President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle.
Harry already has teamed up with Oprah Winfrey to produce a forthcoming documentary focusing on mental health for Apple's new streaming service. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) declined to respond to queries about further collaborations with the prince.
""The Obamas are a great model for how to make money and keep it classy. They could find projects that are moving and sometimes Meghan could be in them. If it's a documentary, maybe Harry could narrate it,"" said veteran Hollywood public relations strategist Howard Bragman.
Bragman said the pair should be judicious about their choices because ""the level of scrutiny they are going to get is going to be ridiculous, and not always fair.""
The booming public speaking circuit in North America could prove to be a lucrative source of income.
""Big name speakers get well into six figures to make an appearance or give a speech at an event. If they choose to pursue that avenue, they would be considered in the top echelon of speakers,"" said Jeff Jacobson, co-founder of Canada-based Talent Bureau.
ECLIPSED ON INSTAGRAM
Meghan has considerable clout in the fashion world. Global fashion search platform Lyst in November named her the world's most powerful dresser of 2019 and last year she launched a clothing collection in Britain to benefit an organization that helps underprivileged women secure employment.
Britain's Sun newspaper reported on Friday that the duchess was discussing a project with French fashion house Givenchy, which made her wedding dress in 2018. Reuters could not confirm the report.
The ""half-royal"" duo will also face stiff competition from established celebrities and YouTubers, who can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars from a single endorsement on social media.
""Harry and Meghan have a combined Instagram following of 10 million, which is eclipsed by the likes of (soccer player) Cristiano Ronaldo with nearly 200 million,"" said Los Angeles branding expert Jeetendr Sehdev, author of ""The Kim Kardashian Principle.""
Building a social media following means being candid, fearless and transparent. ""That is a challenge for the royal family because they have always tried to be the most neutral people,"" he said.
""The Meghan and Harry brand is like a start-up. There is lots of potential but no proven value yet,"" Sehdev added.
Bragman however said that the mixed race couple ""are very representative of what brands are looking for today.""
""If Harry and Meghan call you up and say, 'Hey, we'd like to have a meeting to talk about a project', who's not going to go to that meeting?,"" he said."

Widodo made the request for Japan to consider economic opportunities in the Natuna islands during a visit to Jakarta by Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi, the president's office said in a statement.
""I want to invite Japan to invest in Natuna,"" he told Motegi, adding that Japan was one of Indonesia's major economic partners.
Widodo visited Natuna on Wednesday to assert Indonesia's sovereignty over the cluster of islands and the waters around them, after reports Chinese coastguard and fishing vessels had entered Indonesia's exclusive economic zone several times since last month.
China has not claimed the Natuna islands themselves but says it has nearby fishing rights within a self-proclaimed Nine-Dash Line - a line on Chinese maps that it says shows its territory and waters.
The line loops far south from China and includes most of the South China Sea, but it is a claim that is not recognized internationally. Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan have rival claims in the South China Sea.
Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi told reporters Widodo had asked Japan to invest in fisheries, energy and tourism in Natuna.
""We also agreed to strengthen coastguard coordination,"" he said.
Indonesia had stepped up air and sea patrols in the area and summoned China's ambassador over the appearance of the ships. An Indonesian military spokesman said the vessels left the area after Widodo's trip.
China says it is in contact with Indonesia through diplomatic channels to resolve differences and uphold stability in the region.
Motegi, speaking through a translator after a meeting with Marsudi, did not refer to China but said Japan was wary about the situation in the South China.
""We shared a serious concern regarding efforts to change with force the status quo unilaterally and we confirmed continuing close collaboration,"" he said.
Japan last year gave Indonesia 100 billion rupiah ($7.26 million) to build a fish market in Natuna, which will be named Tsukiji after the famous Tokyo market, media reported.
Construction of the market in Natuna, and markets on other Indonesian islands, will begin this year, Motegi said."

By Giulia Paravicini and Dawit Endeshaw
ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan remained deadlocked after two days of talks in their disputes over a giant hydropower dam on the Nile though Cairo said it hoped the issues would be resolved by Jan. 15 in line with a deadline agreed with Washington.
""We did not reach an agreement today but we achieved clarity at least on all issues including the filling. We hope to reach a deal next week in Washington,"" Egyptian Water Minister Mohamed Abdel Aty told Reuters late on Thursday after two days of meetings in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.
The countries are due to convene on Jan. 13 in Washington with the aim of resolving their disagreements by Jan. 15 over the filling and operation of the $4 billion hydroelectric dam that Ethiopia is building on the Nile.
They agreed to the timeline after a meeting in Washington with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and World Bank President David Malpass in November.
After the meetings in the Ethiopian capital ended with no progress, Ethiopian Water Minister Sileshi Bekele accused Egypt of coming to the talks with no intention of reaching a deal.
""We didn't agree on the filling of the dam as Egypt presented a new proposal requesting the filling to be carried out in 12-21 years. This is not acceptable. We will start the filling of the dam by July,"" Sileshi told a news conference.
The dispute over the filling and operation of the massive dam has sparked a diplomatic crisis between Egypt and Ethiopia, who both see existential threats in each other's positions on the project.
Cairo fears the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) will restrict supplies of already scarce Nile waters on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent.
Addis Ababa denies the dam will undermine Egypt’s access to water and says the project is crucial to its economic development, as it aims to become Africa’s biggest power exporter with a projected capacity of more than 6000 megawatts.
One diplomat close to the talks said Ethiopia did not offer sufficient guarantees on water reserves.
""Ethiopia is not willing to commit to any meaningful mitigation safeguards including during extended drought, therefore there was no prospect for an agreement. Next step is going to (Washington),"" he said.
If the dispute is not resolved by Jan. 15 the nations will have several options to resolve the dispute, from using an international mediator to involving the heads of states, under the deal the countries reached in Washington."
1065,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 01:48AM ET</span>","Explainer: Missile system suspected of bringing down airliner: short range, fast and deadly","By Gerry Doyle
(Reuters) - Canada said on Thursday that a surface-to-air missile brought down a Ukrainian airliner in Tehran, while the Ukrainian government said it was investigating reports of debris from a Russian-made Tor-M1 missile.
The Tor, also called the SA-15 Gauntlet by NATO, is a short-range ""point defense"" system that integrates the missile launcher and radar into a single tracked vehicle.
It is designed to be mobile and lethal against targets at altitudes up to 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) and at ranges of 12 km (7.5 miles), according to the Federation of American Scientists, which researches and analyses ""catastrophic threats to national and international security"".
Military aircraft and cruise missiles - which the Tor system is designed to destroy - typically plot their courses to avoid being spotted on radar. They are equipped with systems such as chaff, which confuses radar, and flares, which act as decoys for heat-seeking missiles.
The jet that crashed on Wednesday, Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752, a Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800, would have filed a flight plan and had no defensive features. 
It was unlikely the flight crew had time to react to any missile, said Michael Duitsman, a research associate at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies.
""They probably wouldn't have even seen it coming,"" Duitsman said. ""Right after takeoff, the pilots were probably preoccupied with other things.""
To attack a target, the Tor operator must identify it on the radar screen and direct the missile to launch.
Commercial air flights have transponders - radio transmitters that broadcast their identity, speed and altitude at an internationally agreed frequency. There were several other civilian aircraft nearby when Flight 752 crashed just a few kilometers from the airport.
All of those aircraft would have been visible on the radar screen of the Tor battery as well as civilian radar at the airport.
IDENTIFYING THE FRIENDLIES
A former European air defense officer, who now works on missile defense technology, said that ideally, flight plans and transponder codes of all scheduled civilian flights would be shared with military units stationed near an airport.
That allows the missile battery operator to correlate each object on radar with a flight plan and transponder code.
""Shooting down a hostile aircraft is easy,"" said the officer, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
""It's identifying the aircraft and not shooting down friendlies that are the challenges.""
Tor missiles are guided by radar and fly at almost three times the speed of sound. That means that if launched at a target 5 km (3 miles) away, they will arrive within about five seconds.
They have a small warhead - about 15 kg (33 lb) of high explosive - but are designed to spray fragments of shredded metal, like bullets, into a target upon detonation.
The Tor is among the most modern air defense systems Iran has, Duitsman said, and can attack two targets at once with up to two missiles each. When Iran purchased them from Russia in the mid-2000s, ""the capability was such that at the time the U.S. was concerned about the sale"", he added.
Iran fields ""small numbers"" of Tor systems, the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report last year. 
A U.S. official told Reuters that data showed the plane was airborne for two minutes when the heat signatures of two surface-to-air missiles were detected.
That was quickly followed by an explosion in the vicinity of the plane, the official said. At least one video circulating from the night of the crash shows a burning aircraft crashing into the ground near Tehran.
The New York Times published what it said was a verified video that appeared to show an Iranian missile hitting a plane near Tehran airport.
Iran denied that the airliner had been hit by a missile.
Riki Ellison, a defense expert and founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said it would have been impossible to divert the missiles after launch, even if the ground operators realized their error.

""Once you shoot those things, it's over,"" Ellison said.

1066,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 10, 2020 01:37AM ET</span>","World is watching our democracy, Taiwan president says on election eve","By Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - The world is watching what choice Taiwan makes as the only Chinese-speaking democracy, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday, the eve of elections in which Tsai said a vote for her would be a vote for freedom.
Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary polls on Saturday in the shadow of both a ramped up effort by China to get the democratic island to accept Beijing's rule, and anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.
""To choose Tsai Ing-wen and Enoch Wu is to choose to stand together with democracy and freedom,"" Tsai told reporters at a campaign event. Wu is an up-and-coming member of Tsai's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), a former banker who is standing for parliament.
""More importantly, it shows our determination to defend our country and sovereignty,"" added Tsai, who is seeking a second term.
Tsai said Taiwan is the ""only democratic country in all Chinese-speaking societies in the world"". 
""The whole world is watching how we make our choice.""
Tsai toured the streets of the capital, Taipei, early on Friday on the back of a truck, with colorful flags and boisterous supporters making their way through busy traffic. 
China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be taken under Beijing's control by force if needed. Taiwan says it is an independent country, called the Republic of China, its official name.
Tsai is being challenged by Han Kuo-yu of the main opposition Kuomintang party. He favors close ties with Beijing and says this is the only way to ensure Taiwan's security and prosperity.
""Please come out to support Han Kuo-yu, whose vision for the country is 'Taiwan safe, people get rich' and 'cross-strait peace',"" Han campaign secretary general Tseng Yung-chuan told a news conference.
The issue of China is front and center in the campaign, especially after President Xi Jinping warned last year China could attack Taiwan, though adding he would prefer a peaceful ""one country, two systems"" formula for the island.
SYMPATHY
The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula aimed at ensuring a high degree of autonomy.
But that model has never been popular in Taiwan and it is even less so now after months of anti-government protests in Hong Kong, largely triggered by fears that Beijing is slowly eroding the city's freedoms. Beijing denies that.
The Hong Kong protesters have widespread public sympathy in Taiwan, and both the DPP and Kuomintang have pledged to help any Hong Kong people who flee to the island.
Both Tsai and Han have rejected ""one country, two systems"". The DPP has painted a vote for the Kuomintang as effectively a vote for the model, something Han has angrily denied.
Tsai and Han will both hold mass rallies on Friday evening - Tsai in Taipei and Han in the southern port city of Kaohsiung, where he is mayor.
Taiwan's noisy, colorful elections are a marked contrast to China, where the Communist Party brooks no challenge to its rule and where ordinary people have no say in who governs them, something that can be a shock to Chinese visitors.
""I didn't expect to see singers on stage. For a while I felt like I was in a concert,"" Yin Weiguo, a 27-year-old Chinese engineer on a business trip to Taiwan, who attended a Han rally in Taipei on Thursday.
""I just wanted to see what people did at a rally. There were so many people,"" Yin told Reuters while visiting Taipei's Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, a major tourist site.

Voting begins at 8 a.m (0000 GMT) on Saturday and the polls close at 4 p.m. (0800 GMT).

1067,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 11:14PM ET</span>",Canadians light candles to mourn victims of Iran plane crash,"By Moira Warburton and Rod Nickel
TORONTO/EDMONTON, Alberta (Reuters) - Canadians held candlelight vigils in several cities on Thursday to remember 63 citizens killed in a plane crash in Iran, in what Canada's prime minister called a ""tragedy that shocked the world.""
Canada has been in mourning since Wednesday's crash of the Ukraine International Airlines flight bound for Kiev from Tehran that killed all 176 people aboard. It was the largest loss of life among Canadians since an Air India flight blew up in 1985 over the Atlantic Ocean, killing 268 people from Canada.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, citing intelligence sources, said on Thursday the Ukraine airlines plane was likely brought down by an Iranian missile. He added the airliner's destruction ""may well have been unintentional."" Iran denied reports the plane was hit by a missile.
The crash occurred hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at two military bases in Iraq hosting U.S. troops, and when Iranians were on high alert for a U.S. military response.
""What happened yesterday was a tragedy, a tragedy that shocked not only Canada, but the world,"" Trudeau told a news conference. He has said 138 people on the plane were connecting to a flight to Canada.
The flight was a popular transit route for Canadians traveling to Iran, in the absence of direct flights, and carried many students and academics heading home from the holidays.
In Toronto, where a crowd of more than 100 attended a vigil, some two dozen people with connections to Canada's largest city died in the crash. They included a young couple and their toddler daughter, along with teachers and students.
""It was unbelievable to me at first,"" said Vahid Golshaeian, 41, a construction contractor attending the vigil. ""Almost all of us had a friend or knew somebody. Innocent people.""
People ranging in age from children to the elderly lit candles and shared figs stuffed with walnuts.
On Parliament Hill in Ottawa, mourners arranged candles on the ground in the shape of a heart. Braving chilly weather, they set photos of loved ones in front of the site's Centennial Flame monument.
Mourners also gathered in Montreal, the home of two newlyweds who were among those from Quebec killed in the crash.
In the western Canadian city of Edmonton, a memorial was planned for Sunday in a sports facility. Thirty people from the Alberta capital died, accounting for nearly half of Canada's death toll.
The University of Alberta alone lost 10 people with connections to the institution. Grief counselors visited the campus on Thursday and mourners left flowers at the office door of a professor who died.
Two married professors, two students and a recent graduate - all from the university's engineering department - died in the crash.
""We are very tight-knit and everyone has been very affected by this,"" said Steven Heipel, an assistant dean of engineering."
1068,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 10:55PM ET</span>",Explainer: What is at stake in Taiwan's election,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan votes in presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday, which will set the course for the democratic island's ties with its giant and autocratic neighbor China, which claims Taiwan as its territory.
Here is what is at stake in the election, and its potential global impact.
WHY IS TAIWAN IMPORTANT?
Aside from its key role in the global supply chain as a high-tech manufacturer, mostly notably as an Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) supplier, Taiwan is in a strategic location just off the coast of China and on the edge of the Pacific.
It is a potential military flashpoint between China and the United States, which sells arms and provides other assistance to Taiwan.
The self-ruled island lies on major shipping lanes between Southeast Asia and U.S. allies Japan and South Korea, and on the disputed South China Sea, where China has built artificial islands and air bases.
Taiwan is also close to a major U.S. military base on the southern Japanese island of Okinawa.
WHO ARE THE CANDIDATES AND WHAT ARE THEIR POSITIONS?
President Tsai Ing-wen is seeking a second term in office. Her Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) favors the island's formal independence. Tsai has said repeatedly in the campaign that Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Tsai says it is up to Taiwan, not China, to decide the island's future, and has warned of the Chinese threat to democracy and liberty.
Her main opponent is Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang party, which ruled China until 1949 when forced to flee to Taiwan after losing a civil war with the Communists.
Han favors close ties with China as the only way to ensure Taiwan's security and prosperity, though says he will defend the island's freedoms and democracy.
WHAT DOES CHINA THINK OF THE ELECTION?
China says it is not seeking to interfere in the vote, which it considers merely a local election in one of its provinces. State media often refers to Tsai as ""provincial governor"" and regularly denounces her.
But China will be closely watching.
For Beijing, the best outcome would be a Han victory.
If Tsai wins, China will probably further ratchet up pressure on Taiwan, perhaps even by conducting military drills close to the island.
However, it could also realize it must resume talks, as any conflict would be hugely damaging for China as well as Taiwan.
The real danger would come if Taipei ever tries declare a formally independent Republic of Taiwan. China passed a law in 2005 that authorizes the use of force against Taiwan if China judges it to have seceded.
WHAT DOES THE UNITED STATES THINK OF THE ELECTION?Although Washington has no formal diplomatic ties with Taiwan, it is bound by law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.
It has taken no position on who should win, but has expressed concern at Chinese efforts at intimidation and influence.
Taiwan enjoys strong bipartisan support in Washington, and the Trump administration has approved billions in new arms sales.
Geopolitically, Washington has watched with alarm as China has taken Taiwan's allies in Central America and the Pacific, traditionally strong areas of U.S. influence.
The Pacific is a big concern for Washington, and it has lobbied Taiwan's remaining allies there to stick with Taipei and not give Beijing a further foothold."
1069,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 09:58PM ET</span>","Iran likely downed Ukraine airliner with missiles, Canada's Trudeau says, citing intelligence","By Steve Scherer and David Shepardson
OTTAWA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Ukrainian airliner that crashed in Iran, killing all 176 people aboard, was likely brought down by an Iranian missile, Canada's prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said on Thursday, citing intelligence from Canadian and other sources.
The destruction of the airliner, which carried 63 Canadians, ""may well have been unintentional,"" Trudeau told a news conference in Ottawa.
""We have intelligence from multiple sources, including our allies and our own intelligence. The evidence indicates that the plane was shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile,"" he said.
The Ukraine International Airlines flight to Kiev from Tehran crashed on Wednesday hours after Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. targets in Iraq, and Iranians were on high alert for a U.S. military response. 
GRAPHIC: Iranian missile capability - https://graphics.reuters.com/IRAN-MISSILES/0100B4W02QP/IRAN-MISSILES.jpg
Trudeau said his government would not rest until it had obtained closure, transparency, accountability and justice.
Earlier on Thursday, a U.S. official, citing an extensive review of satellite data, said Washington had concluded with a high degree of certainty that anti-aircraft missiles brought down the plane. The official said the Boeing 737-800 (N:BA) had been tracked by Iranian radar. 
The U.S. government believes Iran shot down the plane by mistake, three U.S. officials told Reuters.
The data showed the plane was airborne for two minutes after departing Tehran when the heat signatures of two surface-to-air missiles were detected, one of the officials said.
That was quickly followed by an explosion in the vicinity of the plane, the official said. Heat signature data then showed it on fire as it went down. Heat signatures are infrared emissions detected by U.S. military satellites.
The New York Times said it had obtained and verified a video that appeared to show an Iranian missile hitting a plane near Tehran airport.
'PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE'
Iran denied that the airliner had been hit by a missile. 
""All these reports are a psychological warfare against Iran ... all those countries whose citizens were aboard the plane can send representatives and we urge Boeing to send its representative to join the process of investigating the black box,"" government spokesman Ali Rabiei said in a statement. 
An initial report issued by Iran's civil aviation organization on Thursday said the 3-year-old airliner, which had its last scheduled maintenance on Monday, encountered a technical problem shortly after takeoff and started to head toward a nearby airport before it crashed.
Speaking to reporters at the White House, U.S. President Donald Trump said he did not believe the crash of the airliner was due to a mechanical issue.
""It's a tragic thing. But somebody could have made a mistake - on the other side,"" Trump said.
Riki Ellison, a defense expert and founder of the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, said the radar signature of a Boeing airliner would have been quite similar to a large U.S. military transport plane.
""They (the Iranians) were on full alert to shoot down anything that resembled a U.S. aircraft. Somebody made a mistake by identifying it as a warplane,"" Ellison said.
Once the missiles were fired, it would have been impossible to divert them, even if the ground operators realized their error, he said. ""Once you shoot those things, it's over.""
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have risen since Trump ordered the U.S. drone killing of a top Iranian general on Friday. Trump has refrained from ordering more military action and Iran's foreign minister said the strikes on Iraqi bases that house U.S. forces had ""concluded"" Tehran's response.
TECHNICAL PROBLEM
Investigations into airliner crashes require regulators, experts and companies across several international jurisdictions to work together. It can take months to fully determine the cause and issuing an initial report within 24 hours is rare. 
The Ukrainian airliner took off at 6:12 a.m. and was given permission to climb to 26,000 feet (7,925 m), Iran's report said. It crashed six minutes later near the town of Sabashahr.
There was no radio communication from the pilot and the aircraft disappeared from radar at 8,000 feet (2,440 m), the report said. 
Bodies and body parts recovered from the site of the crash were taken to the coroner's office for identification, it said.
Smoldering debris, including shoes and clothes, was strewn across a field where the plane crashed. Rescue workers in face masks laid out scores of body bags. 
Ukraine had outlined four potential scenarios to explain the crash, including a missile strike and terrorism. Kiev said its investigators wanted to search the crash site for possible debris of a Russian-made missile used by Iran's military. 
The Transportation Safety Board of Canada said it had been invited by Iran to the accident site and was making travel arrangements.
Iran has formally invited the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) to take part in its investigation and the agency has agreed to assign an investigator, an Iranian official told Reuters.
The NTSB said it had designated an accredited representative to the investigation. ""The NTSB continues to monitor the situation surrounding the crash and evaluate its level of participation in the investigation,"" it said in a statement.
 Boeing Co  said it would support the NTSB in the investigation. The company is still reeling from two deadly crashes of 737 MAX planes in five months that led to the plane's grounding in March 2019. The 737-800 that crashed was built in 2016 and is the prior generation of the 737 before the MAX. Boeing has built about 5,000 of those planes, which have a good safety record.
The FAA had banned U.S. carriers from operating in the airspace over Iraq, Iran, the Gulf of Oman and the waters between Iran and Saudi Arabia in the hours after Iran's attack on U.S.-led forces in Iraq. Several other airlines also diverted flights.
OPSGROUP, which advises airlines on safety matters, said that after the comments from Trudeau and U.S. officials pointing to a missile downing, some flights inbound to Tehran were turned around and diverted. The group advised operators not to fly to airports in Iraq or Iran and said traffic flow over the countries had greatly declined in the past 48 hours.

1070,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 07:45PM ET</span>",Tear gas and water cannons: Hong Kong students brave the front lines to livestream the protests,"By Mari Saito
HONG KONG (Reuters) - It was holiday time at Hong Kong's sprawling Harbour City shopping mall, and shoppers posed for selfies next to giant presents wrapped in golden foil, while toddlers jumped into a ball pit filled with fake marshmallows. College students Oscar Tsoi and Joanna Ho raced past candy-colored Christmas trees, on the tail of riot police and protesters.
Tsoi, a skinny 19-year-old who looks even younger, was wearing a fluorescent yellow safety vest over his signature white hoodie. Ho, 20, had on combat-style boots and a corduroy skirt with her safety vest. They were both wearing helmets with the word PRESS stamped across them.
""I think it's bulletproof,"" Tsoi said with a weak smile, pointing to his khaki-green helmet.
For months, Tsoi and Ho have been on the ground at nearly every protest and rally across Hong Kong, joining a tight-knit band of student reporters who tweet, livestream and send updates from the front lines of the historic pro-democracy demonstrations.
Although they haven't even graduated from college, the student journalists often jostle for position next to veteran photographers and newspaper reporters and have captured some of the most striking scenes of the protests, including a video of a police officer shooting a teenage demonstrator in October.
Tsoi, a sophomore at the University of Hong Kong, didn't plan to spend his nights and weekends prowling shopping malls and streets filled with tear gas and pepper spray. He was studying Chinese and philosophy and working for an academic society in his college when the protests erupted last June over now-scrapped extradition legislation.
When the unrest flared, Ho was a linguistics major minoring in media studies, hoping to one day break into broadcast journalism. When she heard her classmates complaining that the campus publication didn't have enough reporters to cover the protests, she volunteered.
Tsoi and Ho both work for the Undergrad, a student union publication with 70 years of history at their university. Ho mainly films protests with her iPhone, while Tsoi takes pictures of arrests using his heavy Canon camera. When they're not running between demonstrations or sending a steady stream of images for the publication's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) feed, they're glued to their phones, where they monitor dozens of Telegram channels for news of protesters clashing with police.
Once widely respected, police have been criticized for their handling of the protests.
""The police call us 'black journalists' because we're around the same age as the protesters and they think we can't be neutral,"" Tsoi said. ""They call us kids and tell us to go home.""
Tsoi admitted it can be hard not to get emotionally involved in the story when he sees students his age arrested or tear-gassed.
""Actually, I have several friends arrested during this protest, and it's really hard not to step into their shoes since they could be me and I could be them,"" he said. ""I think the only thing we can do is to push our own emotions down and when we're reporting … you have to switch your brain to a different mode.""
Covering the protests can quickly become dangerous for the students. Ho said she was shot in the leg with a rubber bullet fired by police to disperse protesters who threw Molotov cocktails and started a fire in November. It was one of the very first events she covered as a reporter.
Bruce Lui, a senior lecturer at Hong Kong Baptist University's journalism school, estimated that around 100 student reporters now routinely cover the protests.
Lui, who previously reported as a correspondent in mainland China and Hong Kong for 14 years, counsels his students to prepare to be harassed while covering the often-volatile protests.
""I tell them, 'You have to treat yourself like you're working in China,'"" he said. Lui said that even though students have less training than those with decades in the field, they're getting practical experience on the ground and bring an important perspective to the coverage of the protests. 
Two of his students were arrested last year, and Lui posted bail for them both and found them lawyers. He also accompanied them home so he could calm their parents.
Hong Kong's police say they respect the freedom of the press and the right of the media to report and record police operations. In an emailed response to questions, the police's public relations branch answered that on numerous occasions, people dressed as journalists attacked their officers and that they had seized counterfeit press badges.
""Members of the media are strongly advised to take care of their personal safety and avoid exposing themselves to danger by placing themselves directly between Police and those they are engaged with,"" it said, adding that anyone who believes they have been ""unreasonably treated"" should file an official complaint.
The Hong Kong Journalists Association has filed more than 30 complaints to the Independent Police Complaints Council over police officers' actions toward reporters. The association hasn't been able to compile a full list of injured and arrested journalists because it happens so frequently, said Chris Yeung, the chairman of the association.
Police distrust of student reporters may come as no surprise to some, given that university campuses in Hong Kong have been the sites for some of the most dramatic clashes between young protesters and riot officers. As of December 19, police had arrested 6,127 people in connection with the protests, and nearly half of them were university and secondary school students.
Tsoi said his parents are supportive and have long given up trying to get their son to pursue other interests. When he left home to travel more than an hour by bus and train to cover yet another protest on Christmas Day, he just told them he wouldn't be home in time for dinner.
""They know not to ask,"" he said.
Though he appears shy at first glance, Tsoi's smile disappears in the field.
On another day during the busy Christmas season, plainclothes police entered one of Hong Kong's big shopping arcades; protesters spotted them at once. The cops try their best to blend in by wearing Adidas (DE:ADSGN) and black masks, but their earpieces and matching buzzcuts quickly give them away.
When Tsoi saw the squad scuffling with protesters and pulling some teenagers aside to make arrests, he walked up to one of the officers, an intimidating man wearing dark sunglasses and mask. Nearby, a couple sat on velvet chairs, shopping bags from luxury retailers pooled at their feet. They peered through plastic shutters the store clerk lowers when trouble is near.
""Where's your police ID?"" Tsoi demanded even as the police officer jabbed his finger in the young man's narrow chest. ""Show me your ID,"" Tsoi persisted, inches away from the officer's face.
He returned without the officer's name or badge number but quickly transmitted a message to his colleagues about the apparent arrest.
Taking a break between protests, Tsoi shoveled rice and tofu into his mouth and thought aloud about what he might do after university. He could try and get a master's in journalism, something he never considered before because jobs in the industry are notorious for bad pay.
Whether he chooses to pursue journalism or not depends on whether freedoms of the press will be upheld in Hong Kong in the years to come, he said.
Like many of his peers, Tsoi has a grim outlook of the future, worrying that the territory will come under increased Beijing control when its ""one country, two systems"" arrangement runs its course and Hong Kong loses its designation as a special autonomous region.
""I'm not sure if the Hong Kong of our future needs journalists,"" he said. Even so, Tsoi is running for editor-in-chief of the Undergrad next year.
""We have grown up in such a chaotic time,"" he said, halting between sentences to find the right words in English. ""But we have been chosen by the time and we need to be fearless and just to do what we think is right…. That's the mission of our generation.""
Ho also said she'd like to continue working as a journalist after finishing university, even though being on the front lines has taken its toll.
""I can't sleep well at night,"" she said, her dreams haunted by riot police.
A few days later, on New Year's Eve, Tsoi was out again after hearing about a standoff between protesters and police in a busy shopping area. Water cannon trucks arrived. The wobbly video shot on Tsoi's iPhone shows police pelting the street with a jet of water, then pivoting to aim directly at him. His phone drenched, Tsoi staggers to the left, only to be hit again.

For a moment, Tsoi goes silent. A few other reporters in yellow vests rush toward him, but he waves them away. He then gets back to work, narrating the scene for his viewers.

1071,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 07:19PM ET</span>",Hong Kong workers flock to labor unions as new protest tactic,"By Sarah Wu
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Before the Hong Kong protests began in June, Chris Ngai spent most of his free time playing World of Warcraft and finding new cocktail recipes. Now the bespectacled 24-year-old junior engineer is launching a trade union.
His aim is to ramp up pressure on Hong Kong's government, which has so far made no political concessions to protesters' demands for greater democracy in the Chinese-ruled city, despite millions of people marching in the street.
""The ongoing pro-democracy movement has fundamentally changed people's lives,"" Ngai told Reuters, the day before he set up a booth along the route of a Jan. 1 march, to sign up new members. ""It has forced many who were ignorant about society to stand up.""
As violent clashes with police become more common, the pro-democracy movement has reached a point of ""anger and hopelessness,"" said Ngai, and needs new tactics.
Ngai said he and his team persuaded about 90 engineers, architects and construction workers to join his Hong Kong Construction and Engineering Employees General Union in the past month.
His booth was only one of dozens along the 4 km (2.5 mile) route of the New Year's Day march, each with a distinct flag and logo, attracting queues of hundreds of people to join new unions for civil servants, hotel staff, theater professionals and others.
Ngai and his fellow organizers are spearheading the biggest push to unionize the laissez-faire, ultra-capitalist finance mecca - where collective bargaining rights are not even recognized - since Britain handed the city back to China in 1997.
They are also at the forefront of the ever-experimenting Hong Kong pro-democracy movement as it looks for more effective forms of protest.
""The movement has been thriving on its ad-hoc character,"" said Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""Now more people think the movement may be a long haul, so they need a more organized base to sustain it.""
About 40 pro-democracy unions, including Ngai's, have formed in recent months or are in the process of registering with the government, with dozens more starting to organize, according to the Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions (HKCTU).
The confederation, which last month started running crash courses on establishing unions, said about 2,000 people have already joined unions this year and thousands more joined in late 2019. The city has a population of about 7.4 million.
Labor Department records show that 25 new unions registered last year, compared to 13 in 2018. Of those, 18 formed in the second half of the year, as protests escalated.
Like many new protest tactics, the call to unionize first spread via the encrypted messaging app Telegram, where a channel promoting labor organization has grown to more than 74,000 subscribers in less than three months.
'TIME TO STRIKE'
Traditional unions in Hong Kong are seen by citizens primarily as clubs for hobby classes, banquets and retail discounts. The new unions are motivated more by protecting workers from being punished by employers for expressing their views.
About two months after protests began in June over a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions of suspected criminals to China, protesters got a wake-up call on Beijing's powers of coercion. The mainland's aviation regulator demanded Hong Kong's flag carrier Cathay Pacific suspend staff involved in or supporting demonstrations.
Many new unionists say the problem is widespread, especially where bosses are keen to avoid conflict with China for fear of damaging business.
A 26-year-old woman who identified herself as Cynthia told Reuters she heard of an auditing firm that hastily organized a lunch for all employees at the same time as a large protest which many of her fellow professionals wanted to attend during their break. She described that as ""oppression"" and said it was one of the reasons she is helping to establish the Accounting Bro'Sis Labor Union.
Some employees have been reprimanded for expressing political views on their personal Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) accounts, said Gary Chan, secretary of the Hong Kong Financial Industry Employees General Union, which he said has recruited 160 members since late September.
Programer Alex Tang said his newly formed, 280-member Hong Kong Information Technology Workers' Union was developing a database of employers who would not threaten or dismiss staff for supporting protests.
Many believe unions will provide safety in numbers.
""If we strike as individuals, we may be suppressed by companies,"" said a 23-year-old assistant architect surnamed Lam, who was lining up at Ngai's booth, wearing a black face mask, on Jan. 1.
The drive to unionize comes as Hong Kong is grappling with a recession as tourist numbers and retail sales decline in the face of violent protests.
While the new unions cannot promise much in terms of immediate economic benefits, they may in time be able to organize more effective strikes and address the city's deep inequalities, said Eli Friedman, an associate professor at Cornell University who studies labor in China.
""It’s too soon to tell if they will get the union density to exercise that kind of power,"" said Friedman.
Many new union leaders say they recognize that gaining members and changing cultural attitudes to unions will take time. But they are committed to improving workers' rights, with a long-term goal of organizing mass strikes to increase pressure on the government to allow everyone the right to vote for the city's leader.
""It’s a numbers game,"" said Lee Cheuk-yan, general secretary of HKCTU and a former pro-democracy politician.
""We have to stay organized in the long run and consolidate the consciousness of the people of Hong Kong that has arisen over the past half-year,"" Lee said. ""All of the unions will decide together when it is time to strike."""

YUNLIN/HSINCHU, Taiwan (Reuters) - Dotted around Taiwan lie the remains of abandoned bunkers originally built to repel an invasion from China, during a period in the island's history when it was under martial law and fear of a Chinese attack was a part of daily life.
The threat from China, which claims democratic Taiwan as its own to be brought under Beijing's rule by force if needed, has not gone away but the ageing bunkers are no longer needed for defense purposes.
Today, farmers use the retired bunkers as storage rooms for tools, while some have become part of the parks and others along the coast are sought-after spots for photo opportunities by Instagramers seeking ""likes"" for their sunset views. 
""I find it very bizarre - across Taiwan there are numerous bunkers, a mark of war, but if you ask residents what is it, when was it built and for what purpose, no one knows now,"" said Chen Kuo-ming, 49, a military site enthusiast who has been searching and mapping the old bunkers since 2002.
Some of the bunkers actually date back to when Taiwan was a Japanese colony, before and during World War Two, and were upgraded when the Kuomintang government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing a civil war with the Communists, Chen said. 
Clam farmer Ding Long-kai, who would not reveal his age other than to say he was in his mid-60s, remembers as a child the pillboxes along the beaches of Yunlin on Taiwan's western coast, which lies on the Taiwan Strait facing China. 
""It was restricted to go to the beach and get close to the pillboxes,"" Ding said.
But as the coastline has changed and maintenance lapsed, many of the old pillboxes are merging back into the sand or being encircled by clam farms. 
""I remember seeing slogans such as 'kill the communists' and 'reclaim the mainland' on the pillboxes. But this is the only one left; the rest have been removed by other farmers,"" Ding added, pointing to the one remaining in his clam farm.
Up the coast from Yunlin in Hsinchu, local official Lin Zi-xing, 72, is trying to protect the bunkers that remain near his home.
Recalling how he used to try and sneak into the bunkers as a child to play, Lin said it would be a shame to lose this part of Taiwan's history.
He has turned one of the bunkers into a climbing frame for children, and another into an exhibition hall for tourists to learn about the history of the area.
""I got into a lot of trouble with the residents because of this, partly because of land issues but also because it reminds the older generation of war which no one wants to talk about,"" Lin said.
Military enthusiast Chen said the bunkers also serve as a reminder that tensions between China and Taiwan still exist.
""Let's not forget, Taiwan and China are still in a hostile state,"" he said.

The region's largest pro-British party, the Democratic Unionist Party, said it believed the draft deal published by the British and Irish governments on Thursday provided a basis upon which the regional assembly can be re-established.

Suspected drug cartel gunmen in early November shot dead the nine victims, three women and six children, in a daytime attack as they were traveling by car in the northern state of Sonora.
The massacre sparked outrage in the United States and Mexico and prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to call for both countries to ""wage war"" against Mexico's brutal drug cartels.
Adrian LeBaron, the father of one of the murdered women, told reporters that the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, Christopher Landau, had revealed the detentions during a meeting in Mexico City.
""He told us they had made two arrests in the United States, that they're investigating and that this is going forward,"" said LeBaron, who also lost four grandchildren in the attack.
An official with the U.S. Embassy's press office declined to comment on LeBaron's remarks, referring the matter to the FBI, which is assisting Mexico in the investigation. The FBI's Washington, D.C., office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Mexico has arrested seven suspects over the massacre, which investigators believe may have been linked to a dispute between two rival drug gangs that operate in the area.
Separately, Adrian's cousin Julian LeBaron said the family aimed to hold a march later this month aimed at drawing attention to lawlessness and missing persons in Mexico.
Earlier this week, Julian LeBaron said officials believed around 40 people were involved in the attack in November.
Cartel violence in Mexico has been blamed for the deaths of more than 200,000 people in the past dozen years."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Thursday vowed his government would not rest until it had all the answers about the destruction of a Ukrainian airliner which he said was hit by an Iranian missile.
All 176 people on board, including 63 Canadians, were killed on Wednesday shortly after it took off from Tehran on a flight to Kiev. Iran denies its forces brought down the plane.
The crash is one of the most deadly disasters in recent Canadian history.
Trudeau said Canada had intelligence from multiple sources indicating the plane had been shot down by an Iranian surface-to-air missile, quite possibly by accident.
""The families of the victims and all Canadians want answers. I want answers,"" he told a news conference.
""That means closure, transparency, accountability and justice. This government will not rest until we get that,"" he continued, reiterating demands for a full inquiry that he stressed should involve Canadian investigators.
Canada has not had diplomatic relations with Iran since 2012, making its participation in the investigation a challenge. 
Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne held a rare telephone call with his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif early on Thursday.
""The response by the Iranian government, the Iranian foreign minister, was open, was encouraging,"" Champagne told reporters in Montreal, expressing optimism that consular officials would soon receive visas to go to Iran. 
Trudeau said he spoke earlier to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, who told him that Iran would allow investigators from Kiev access to the plane's black boxes, which Tehran has said would not be allowed out of the country.
Trudeau was pressed by journalists about whether the United States should be held at least partially responsible for the tragedy, given that tensions in the region ignited after a U.S. drone attack killed a top Iranian general.
""It is too soon to be drawing conclusions or assigning blame or responsibility in whatever proportions,"" Trudeau said.
The plane came down within hours of Iran launching missile attack on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. forces in response for the killing of the general.
Asked how Ottawa might react once the facts were known, Trudeau replied, ""Anything in the range of responses would need to start from a clear understanding and a credible confirmation of what actually happened.""

Officials at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Manhattan ""inadvertently preserved video from the wrong tier"" of the jail, and footage from outside Epstein's cell from July 22 and 23, 2019 ""no longer exists,"" prosecutors said.
Corrections officers responded at about 1:27 a.m. on July 23 to Epstein's cell, prosecutors said, when the accused sex offender was believed to have first attempted suicide.
The missing video was disclosed in a Manhattan federal court filing, in a case involving Epstein's cell mate at the time.
Epstein died on Aug. 10, 2019 at age 66, in what was ruled a suicide. An autopsy found that he hanged himself.
The death prompted a shakeup at the federal Bureau of Prisons, including the removal of its acting chief and the warden at MCC.
Two MCC jail officers were charged in November with falsifying records to cover up their alleged failure to check on Epstein in his final hours.
Epstein died five weeks after his arrest on federal charges he trafficked dozens of underage girls from at least 2002 to 2005.
Some accusers have said Epstein engaged in sexual misconduct dating back to the mid-1980s.
Epstein had pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors could still file charges against his alleged accomplices."

It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the attack on the post at Chinagodrar, about 130 miles (209 km) north of the capital Niamey, in which 63 assailants were also killed. 
But the attack coincides with a campaign by Islamist groups connected to al Qaeda and Islamic State to force the Nigerien army back from its western frontier with Mali where government control of the rural center and north has all but evaporated because of the rise of jihadists. 
Despite efforts by international forces to stop them, attacks have risen fourfold this year in Niger, killing nearly 400 people, according to data from the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project, a non-profit research organization.
This included a raid last month that killed 71 soldiers at another military outpost about 150 km to the west of Chinagodrar, the biggest on the Niger military in living memory.
Security has deteriorated this year across the Sahel, a semi-arid strip of land beneath the Sahara, amid jihadist attacks and deadly ethnic reprisals between rival farming and herding communities.
The region has been in crisis since 2012 when ethnic Tuareg rebels and loosely-aligned jihadists seized the northern two-thirds of Mali, forcing France to intervene the following year to beat them back. The jihadists have since regrouped and expanded their range of influence.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A six-year-long United Nations operation delivering aid across the Syrian border to millions of civilians will expire at midnight on Friday if a deadlocked U.N. Security Council cannot reach a last-minute deal to extend its authorization.
Since 2014 the United Nations and aid groups have crossed into Syria from Turkey, Iraq and Jordan at four places annually authorized by the council. Its approval is needed because the Syrian government did not consent to cross-border deliveries.
""To put it very simply, there is no alternative to reaching the people we need to reach in the northwest and northeast (of Syria) without the cross-border"" operation, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters on Thursday.
More than 3 million Syrian civilians are completely dependant on cross-border aid, the United Nations said.
Russia wants to halve the number of border crossing points to two - both from Turkey - and cut the length of the authorization for the operation to six months from one year.
In a compromise bid, Western powers said they could agree to three crossing points approved for six months, and the 15-member Security Council is set to vote on that proposal on Friday, diplomats said.
But it was unclear whether Russia will accept the third crossing - from Iraq - and Moscow rejected a request to renew the current cross-border aid operation for another two weeks to allow for further negotiations among Security Council members, diplomats said.
To pass, a resolution needs a minimum of nine votes in favor and no vetoes by permanent council members Russia, China, the United States, Britain or France.
Russia and China vetoed a resolution last month that would have allowed deliveries for a further 12 months from two points in Turkey and one in Iraq. It was Russia's 14th veto on action related to Syria since the country's conflict started in 2011.
The remaining 13 council members voted in favor.
The council also voted last month on a rival Russian draft resolution that would have approved the two Turkish crossing points for six months, but it failed with only five votes in favor, six against and four abstentions.
It was not immediately clear whether Russia would put its proposal to a vote again on Friday. Five council members were replaced on Jan. 1, and some diplomats said Russia could now have more support.
In a Dec. 16 report to the council, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged it to extend authorization of the cross-border deliveries."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Denying he was biased, the judge in Harvey Weinstein's rape trial on Thursday refused to remove himself from the high-profile case, rejecting an accusation by the former film producers' lawyers.
""I have in no way prejudged this case,"" Justice James Burke told Weinstein's lawyers. ""I am going to great lengths to afford your client a fair trial.""
Sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein by dozens of women helped fuel the #MeToo movement, which encouraged women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men. 
In the New York case, Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assaulting two women, and faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault. His trial began on Monday and could last up to two months.
Since 2017, more than 80 women, including many famous actresses, have accused him of sexual misconduct dating back decades. Weinstein has denied all the allegations, saying any sexual encounters he had were consensual.
One of his lawyers, Arthur Aidala, filed a motion on Wednesday urging Burke to recuse himself.
As evidence of judicial bias, Aidala cited a comment Burke made Tuesday when he threatened to revoke Weinstein's bail after catching him using his cellphone in court.
""Is this really the way you want to end up in jail for the rest of your life, by texting and violating a court order?"" the judge said at the time.
Burke on Thursday said that even if the comments were ""hyperbolic,"" they were not evidence of prejudice.
""I certainly never actually meant that I was going to put your client in jail for life, nor did I mean, because I have not, that I have prejudged whether he is guilty or innocent of the charges,"" the judge said.
Burke also denied Aidala's request to delay the trial for a ""cooling-off period.""
""There is no time like the present to go forward,"" the judge said. ""All sides are ready.""
Thursday was the third day of jury selection in the case, with 120 potential jurors called in for pre-screening. A murmur went through the courtroom when Burke announced the name of the defendant before delivering instructions about jury service.
Burke cut the proceedings short before noon because the lead prosecutor, Assistant District Attorney Joan Illuzzi, had a medical issue. The 120 potential jurors are expected to return on Friday morning.

Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most powerful producers, made his mark with critically acclaimed films such as ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love.""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government believes Iran accidentally shot down a Ukraine airliner that crashed in Iran, killing all 176 people aboard, three U.S. officials told Reuters on Thursday.
Citing an extensive review of satellite data, one official said the U.S. government had concluded with a high degree of certainty that Iranian anti-aircraft missiles brought down the plane.
The officials said the plane had been tracked by Iranian radar before the missiles were fired.
The data showed the Ukrainian International Airlines Boeing 737-800 (N:BA) bound for Kiev was airborne for two minutes after departing Tehran when the heat signatures of two surface-to-air missiles were detected, one of the officials said.
That was quickly followed by an explosion in the vicinity of the plane, this official said. Heat signature data then showed the plane on fire as it went down. 
Iran's head of civil aviation was quoted by ISNA News Agency as saying that it was ""impossible that a missile hit the Ukrainian plane.""
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday the deadly crash could have been a mistake and he did not believe it was a mechanical issue.
The three officials said Washington believed the downing of the plane was an accident. It occurred shortly after Iran had fired missiles at two U.S. military bases in Iraq and Iranians were on high alert for a U.S. military response.
An Iranian report on Thursday cited witnesses on the ground and in a passing aircraft flying at a high altitude as saying the plane was on fire while in the air.
Boeing and the Federal Aviation Administration declined to comment on Thursday, as did the Pentagon. Ukrainian officials had no immediate comment.
Boeing is still reeling from two deadly crashes of 737 MAX planes in five months that led to the plane's grounding in March 2019. The 737-800 that crashed was built in 2016 and is the prior generation of the 737 before the MAX. Boeing has built about 5,000 of those planes, which has a good safety record.

Boeing shares rose 1.7% on Thursday.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido on Thursday urged the European Union to officially label as ""blood gold"" the precious metal informally mined in the country's southern jungles as he seeks to increase pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro.
Maduro's government since 2016 has supported artisanal mining in the Venezuelan Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to bring in revenue amid an economic crisis, an effort that expanded as Washington increased sanctions meant to force the ruling Socialist Party from power.
The initiative has been criticized by environmental activists and rights groups for contaminating watersheds with mercury and fueling massacres as gangs battle for territory.
In an interview with Reuters, Guaido said the EU should use a label to limit the trade of Venezuelan gold, the way the ""blood diamond"" campaign of the 1990s targeted diamond sales that financed armed conflict in Africa.
""I think Europe can take steps in this direction by not allowing the trade of (Venezuelan) gold in Europe... and to clearly label it 'blood gold,'"" Guaido said.
""What is it used for in Venezuela? To finance irregular (armed) groups,"" he said, referring to Colombian guerrillas that are increasingly present near gold mining operations.
The United States, along with the EU and more than 50 other countries, recognizes Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president. In 2019, Washington broadened its sanctions program against Maduro in the hopes of pushing his government from power.
But Maduro has hung on, skirting sanctions on the OPEC nation's oil industry with the help of allied Russia and through the sale of gold produced by the artisanal miners, who are often linked to organized crime.
Trump administration sanctions already prohibit U.S individuals and companies from trading Venezuelan gold, some of which has been sold to Turkey - another Maduro ally.
A Guaido representative in September said Maduro's government was selling gold in Europe to bypass sanctions.
The EU has imposed sanctions on top Venezuelan officials and blocked sales of weapons to Maduro's government but has not specifically prohibited the trade of gold.
The press office for the European External Action Service did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The Reuters interview was Guaido's first with foreign media since Maduro's security forces tried unsuccessfully to prevent him from getting re-elected as the head of the opposition earlier this week.
On Sunday, Maduro's allies tried to install a rival opposition head and group of legislators after security forces moved to block Guaido and his supporters from entering parliament.
""We will do everything possible to continue doing our jobs,"" Guaido said in reference to parliament.
ELECTRICITY LOAN CALLED OFF
Guaido also said legislators were abandoning efforts to finance electricity infrastructure through a loan from regional development bank CAF, with lawmakers now seeking different mechanisms to ease the country's chronic power outages.
The proposal had involved CAF providing $350 million in funds that would be overseen by the United Nations. The plan was broadly criticized as expensive and impractical, and generated concerns that Maduro's government would ultimately have influence over the use of the funds.
""There are alternative mechanisms that don't involve adding to the country's debt, and at a lower cost,"" said Guaido.
CAF and the UN office in Venezuela did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The blackouts have undermined the functioning of everything from routine commerce to hospital emergency rooms. Especially hard hit has been the western state of Zulia, where citizens routinely go 12 hours without power."
1086,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 02:55PM ET</span>",U.S. senators back bill to provide $3.3 billion for Israel,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators introduced legislation on Thursday to provide $3.3 billion in annual aid to Israel, seeking to put into law an aid agreement between the two countries reached in 2016 amid concern over rising Middle East tensions.
Republican Senator Marco Rubio and Democratic Senator Chris Coons co-sponsored the bill, a standalone provision of a broader measure that stalled a year ago, according to a text of the bill seen by Reuters.
The measure that stalled last year included some provisions broadly supported by members of both parties, including the aid, but it also included a plank that would have let state and local governments punish Americans for boycotting Israel. Opponents, including many Democrats, saw that provision as an impingement of free speech.
Rubio and Coons introduced the bill amid increased tensions in the Middle East after President Donald Trump ordered a drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani and Tehran retaliated with a missile attack on an Iraqi base housing U.S. soldiers.
On Thursday, the region remained on edge as Iran spurned Trump's call for a new nuclear pact and its commanders threatened more attacks. [L8N29E5D7]
The bill would put into law a ""Memorandum of Understanding"" reached between Israel and the Obama administration from four years ago that was the biggest pledge of U.S. military assistance made to any country.
In statements emailed to Reuters, Rubio said Israel faces ""unprecedented threats"" and Coons said: ""The events of the past few days are a stark reminder of the importance of U.S. assistance to Israel's security."""
1087,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 02:45PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Informants in Iraq, Syria helped U.S. kill Iran's Soleimani - sources","By Reuters staff
(Reuters) - Iranian General Qassem Soleimani arrived at the Damascus airport in a vehicle with dark-tinted glass. Four soldiers from Iran’s Revolutionary Guards rode with him. They parked near a staircase leading to a Cham Wings Airbus A320, destined for Baghdad. 
Neither Soleimani nor the soldiers were registered on the passenger manifesto, according to a Cham Wings airline employee who described the scene of their departure from the Syrian capital to Reuters. Soleimani avoided using his private plane because of rising concerns about his own security, said an Iraqi security source with knowledge of Soleimani's security arrangements.
The passenger flight would be Soleimani’s last. Rockets fired from a U.S. drone killed him as he left the Baghdad airport in a convoy of two armored vehicles. Also killed was the man who met him at the airport: Abu Mahdi Muhandis, deputy head of Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), the Iraqi government's umbrella group for the country's militias.
The Iraqi investigation into the strikes that killed the two men on Jan. 3 started minutes after the U.S. strike, two Iraqi security officials told Reuters. National Security agents sealed off the airport and prevented dozens of security staff from leaving, including police, passport officers and intelligence agents. 
Investigators have focused on how suspected informants inside the Damascus and Baghdad airports collaborated with the U.S. military to help track and pinpoint Soleimani’s position, according to Reuters interviews with two security officials with direct knowledge of Iraq’s investigation, two Baghdad airport employees, two police officials and two employees of Syria’s Cham Wings Airlines, a private commercial airline headquartered in Damascus.
The probe is being led by Falih al-Fayadh, who serves as Iraq’s National Security Adviser and the head of the PMF, the body that coordinates with Iraq's mostly Shi'ite militias, many of which are backed by Iran and had close ties to Soleimani. 
The National Security agency’s investigators have “strong indications that a network of spies inside Baghdad Airport were involved in leaking sensitive security details” on Soleimani’s arrival to the United States, one of the Iraqi security officials told Reuters. 
The suspects include two security staffers at the Baghdad airport and two Cham Wings employees - “a spy at the Damascus airport and another one working on board the airplane,” the source said. The National Security agency’s investigators believe the four suspects, who have not been arrested, worked as part of a wider group of people feeding information to the U.S. military, the official said.
The two employees of Cham Wings are under investigation by Syrian intelligence, the two Iraqi security officials said. The Syrian General Intelligence Directorate did not respond to a request for comment. In Baghdad, National Security agents are investigating the two airport security workers, who are part of the nation’s Facility Protection Service, one of the Iraqi security officials said. 
""Initial findings of the Baghdad investigation team suggest that the first tip on Soleimani came from Damascus airport,” the official said. “The job of the Baghdad airport cell was to confirm the arrival of the target and details of his convoy.”
The media office of Iraq’s National Security agency did not respond to requests for comment. The Iraq mission to the United Nations in New York did not respond to a request for comment. 
The U.S. Department of Defense declined to comment on whether informants in Iraq and Syria played a role in the attacks. U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters the United States had been closely tracking Soleimani’s movements for days prior to the strike but declined to say how the military pinpointed his location the night of the attack.
A Cham Wings manager in Damascus said airline employees were prohibited from commenting on the attack or investigation. A spokesman for Iraq’s Civil Aviation Authority, which operates the nation’s airports, declined to comment on the investigation but called it routine after “such incidents which include high-profile officials.”
Soleimani's plane landed at the Baghdad airport at about 12:30 a.m. on Jan. 3, according to two airport officials, citing footage from its security cameras. The general and his guards exited the plane on a staircase directly to the tarmac, bypassing customs. Muhandis met him outside the plane, and the two men stepped into a waiting armored vehicle. The soldiers guarding the general piled into another armored SUV, the airport officials said.
As airport security officers looked on, the two vehicles headed down the main road leading out of the airport, the officials said. The first two U.S. rockets struck the vehicle carrying Soleimani and Muhandis at 12:55 a.m. The SUV carrying his security was hit seconds later.
As commander of the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds force, Soleimani ran clandestine operations in foreign countries and was a key figure in Iran's long-standing campaign to drive U.S. forces out of Iraq. He spent years running covert operations and cultivating militia leaders in Iraq to extend Iran’s influence and fight the interests of the United States. Reuters reported on Saturday that, starting in October, Soleimani had secretly launched stepped-up attacks on U.S. forces stationed in Iraq and equipped Iraqi militias with sophisticated weaponry to carry them out.
The attack on the general sparked widespread outrage and vows of revenge in Iran, which responded on Wednesday with a missile attack on two Iraq military bases that house U.S. troops. No Americans or Iraqis were killed or injured in the strike.
In the hours after the attack, investigators pored over all incoming calls and text messages by the airport night-shift staff in search of who might have tipped off the United States to Soleimani’s movements, the Iraqi security officials said. National Security agents conducted hours-long interrogations with employees of airport security and Cham Wings, the sources said. One security worker said agents questioned him for 24 hours before releasing him.
For hours, they grilled him about who he had spoken or text with before Soleimani's plane landed - including any ""weird requests"" related to the Damascus flight - and confiscated his mobile phone. 

“They asked me a million questions,” he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron stood his ground as trade unions on Thursday brought tens of thousands of demonstrators onto the streets in a make-or-break push to force him to abandon his planned pension reform.
Teargas swirled in Paris where riot police charged at demonstrators who hurled projectiles and lobbed insults in cat-and-mouse skirmishes as darkness fell. 
Some protesters dressed in black and hiding their faces daubed anarchist slogans on buildings and the windows of several properties, including a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) cafe, were smashed.
The country's hard-left unions rallied supporters hoping to regain momentum at a time when participation in a 36-day long public sector strike has waned and opinion polls show public backing for the industrial action has dropped. But turnout was down sharply from the previous nationwide protest marches. 
""The ball is in the government's camp. Either they listen, or they govern against the people's will,"" hard-line CGT union boss Philippe Martinez told reporters. 
Macron wants to streamline France's unwieldy pension system and provide incentives for people to stay in work longer to pay for some of the most generous retirement benefits in the industrialized world.
The proposed reform would be the biggest overhaul of the system since World War Two and is central to the president's drive to make the labor force more flexible and more competitive globally.
While the CGT and other hard-left unions are demanding the reform be scrapped altogether, France's largest union, the reform-minded CFDT is open to Macron's planned single ""points"" system that treats contributions from all workers equally.
But it refuses to accept the proposal that French workers work two years longer, until the age of 64, to receive a full pension. CFDT boss Laurent Berger said this crossed a red line.
Macron's prime minister, Edouard Philippe, has agreed to a CFDT-proposed ""financing conference"" aimed at finding alternative ways of balancing the pension budget. 
But in the strongest signal yet that the government has not dropped the increased retirement age from the draft bill, which has not yet been made public, Budget Minister Gerald Darmanin said such a move was ""fair and efficient"".
""What is certain is that we must work longer,"" Darmanin told Le Figaro newspaper.
PROTESTER NUMBERS FALL
Macron, a former investment banker, says the myriad special benefits handed out to different types of workers in France's existing pension system deter mobility within the job market.
If he succeeds in defeating the unions - he has already succeeded in reforming state-run SNCF railways and in easing labor laws - he will strengthen his hand to embark on further pro-business reforms as he eyes re-election in 2022.
The interior ministry said 452,000 people nationwide answered the union leaders’ protest call, a significant decline since the first big day of action on Dec. 5, which brought 806,000 onto the street.
Rail services were disrupted, schools shut and power generation by EDF (PA:EDF) was cut by about 10%. 
Rail workers and teachers, lawyers and nurses railed against a president they accuse of turning a deaf ear to popular feeling. 
While the strikes are the longest-running in decades, they have failed to paralyze France in the way achieved by a wave of industrial action in 1995 that forced a government U-turn from which the prime minister of the day never recovered.
Hard-left unions argue Macron's reform amounts to an attack on hard-earned benefits that help compensate for salaries below those in the private sector and will ruin public services.

""If there are no retirement perks, there's no reason to stay in the public sector,"" said teacher Antoine Rouilly in the southwestern city of Toulouse.

Local media said he had been shot to death.
Mexico registered 10 killings of journalists in 2019, the same number as the year before and in line with Syria, according to Reporters Without Borders, making Mexico one of the world's most dangerous places for media workers.
The body of Fidel Avila, of the ""Ke Buena"" station in the western state of Michoacan's Huetamo municipality, was found on a highway earlier this week, 40 days after he was last seen at a cultural event in neighboring Guerrero state, Mexico's National Commission of Human Rights said.   
""Our condolences to the family and friends of Fidel Avila Gomez, journalist in Michoacan. We deeply lament his murder,"" presidential spokesman Jesus Ramirez wrote in a post on Twitter.
Michoacan and Guerrero are two of Mexico’s most violent and lawless states, where rival drug gangs have battled to control smuggling routes.
The president of the Michoacan Association of Journalists, Alvaro Garcia, told local television that criminal activity in the area was at a peak.
""There is always a persistent risk,"" he said."

""I think that NATO should be expanded and we should include the Middle East, absolutely,"" Trump told reporters at the White House.
Trump proposed increased NATO involvement in the Middle East on Wednesday when he addressed the Iranian strikes against U.S. troops in Iraq, carried out in retaliation for a U.S. drone strike that killed a top Iranian military commander. The military leader, Qassem Soleimani, played a major role in the fight against Islamic State militants in the region.
Trump said Islamic State presented an international problem that other countries should help address. ""We can come home, largely come home and use NATO,"" Trump said. ""We caught ISIS, we did Europe a big favor.""
Trump has been a critic of NATO, demanding that Europe pay more for its collective defense and make concessions to U.S. interests on trade.
Trump joked that the organization could be called NATO-ME, or NATO plus the Middle East. He said he floated the possible name to NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in a call on Wednesday.
The White House said Trump ""emphasized the value of NATO increasing its role in preventing conflict and preserving peace in the Middle East"" in the call.
The U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Kay Bailey Hutchison, said on Thursday the fight against Islamic State is important to both the United States and its NATO allies.
""I think what the president is looking for is more of our allies working with us in Iraq,"" she told CNBC. ""And that is something that our NATO Council will have to discuss and decide that we would do more."""

The Andean country has come under repeated pressure from the United States, an important destination for cocaine shipments, to reduce coca cultivation, especially as crop figures shot up in recent years.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has praised Duque's stepped-up eradication efforts. The Colombian government set out to eradicate 80,000 hectares last year.
""From now on we will without a doubt face the challenge of re-planting, but Colombia has clear its goal to reduce by 50% the area that is planted with illegal crops by the end of 2022 or 2023,"" Duque said in a televised statement, adding the 100,000-hectare figure was a record and that army manual eradication units had ripped up 94,000 hectares of the crop. ""We always have to be speeding up our steps.""
More than 434 tonnes of cocaine were confiscated last year, Duque said, adding that his government has increased the number of eradication units from 23 to more than 150 during his 17 months in office.
Duque is pushing to restart aerial fumigation of coca - which is more efficient than manual eradication.
The practice was banned by the Constitutional Court in 2015 until the government could met certain safety conditions, but Duque has said a restart within the court's parameters could be possible this year."

Dimov, who has not been charged, told reporters he was cooperating before getting into a police van. He had been questioned by Special Prosecutor’s Office staff and Interior Ministry officers at his office.
Pernik, a town with population of more than 70,000, has been subject to severe and continuing water restrictions for about two months, a matter that has been under investigation by several institutions.
Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said Dimov's job was a matter for discussion with the ruling coalition partners. In the third Borissov government, formed in May 2017, Dimov was nominated to the post by the minority partner in the coalition, the nationalist United Patriots.
The Prosecutor’s Office said in a statement that Chief Prosecutor Ivan Geshev visited Pernik on Thursday to co-ordinate actions in the investigation connected to pre-trial proceedings regarding the water crisis in the town, which lies about 25 km (16 miles) west of the capital Sofia.
""Evidence is being collected of crimes committed by officials that led to water supply problems in Pernik,"" the office said in a statement.
The Socialist Party - the largest opposition party - said it would file a no-confidence motion against Borissov's government, accusing it of failing to ensure proper water and clean air policies, resulting in the water restrictions in Pernik, and serious air pollution in many Bulgarian cities.
The motion is unlikely to pass, as the government enjoys the support of a small populist party and can secure parliamentary majority.
Prosecutors have focused their investigation on possible mismanagement - whether local officials from the supply company and the municipal administration have taken appropriate steps to ensure the water supply to Pernik and several nearby towns."

They voted 330 to 231 in favor of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill, which implements an exit deal agreed with the EU last year.
That allows Prime Minister Boris Johnson to turn the page on one of Britain's deepest political crises in decades, putting an end to the fears of an immediate disorderly exit which had cast a shadow over the economy and fueled divisions over the 2016 referendum decision to leave the EU.
""It is time to get Brexit done. This bill does so,"" Brexit minister Stephen Barclay told lawmakers, summing up hours of debate in parliament.
The legislation now heads to parliament's upper chamber and is expected to become law in the coming weeks, leaving enough time to allow Britain to leave at the end of the month with a deal to minimize economic disruption. 
In recent years, financial markets have been mesmerized by the twists and turns of Britain's Brexit drama, with its acrimonious negotiations in Brussels, knife-edge votes in parliament and heavy defeats for unstable governments. 
But after Johnson called a snap election late last year and then won a large majority by promising to deliver Brexit at the end of January, the uncertainty over when and how Britain will leave the EU has largely abated.
The focus has instead turned to upcoming talks on long-term arrangements with the EU that will kick in when a transition period - during which Britain remains subject to EU rules - ends on Dec. 31.
Johnson is adamant that the free-trade deal he wants can be negotiated in time, but his EU counterparts are less convinced. 
On Wednesday, Johnson met European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in London hours after she had made a speech saying it would be ""basically impossible"" to agree everything by the end of the year.
Johnson's opponents, many of whom argued to stop Brexit or give the public another vote, say his approach risks creating another 'no-deal' cliff-edge at the end of the year when the transition period ends. 

However, Von der Leyen has indicated that even if a whole deal cannot be negotiated in time, the most important and potentially disruptive parts can be prioritized.

Kauda, 90km (56 miles) east of South Kordofan state capital Kadugli, is the base of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement North (SPLM-N), the main group fighting the government in the southern provinces of Blue Nile and South Kordofan.
Abdelaziz Al-Hilu, leader of a wing of the SPLM-N, invited Hamdok to Kauda during peace talks with other rebel militias in the South Sudanese capital of Juba in September.
""This is a superb opportunity to assure our people in Kauda and all Sudanese in every corner of our beloved country that your transitional government seeks to achieve a comprehensive and just peace,"" a statement from the prime minister's office quoted Hamdok as saying.
""This was particularly the case for war-torn regions that had been marginalized for decades,"" Hamdok told a crowd of people who had gathered to meet him on his arrival in Kauda.
Hamdok, a former U.N. diplomat, took office in August under an agreement between the military and civilian parties in Sudan after months of demonstrations against generals who seized power after toppling long-serving autocrat Omar al-Bashir.
Vicious clashes between the SPLM-N and the Sudanese government broke out in 2011, just before South Sudan seceded from the north. South Kordofan and Blue Nile states remained within Sudanese territory.
Sustained bombing by Sudanese warplanes causing tens of thousands of civilians to flee into the hills, residents said at the time.
President Omar al-Bashir, ousted last year after popular protests, had vowed to crush the SPLM-N and say Friday prayers in Kauda, but the militia blocked his attempts.
Bashir's government had been fighting insurgencies in Kordofan, Darfur and Blue Nile states for decades. The SPLM-N is one of Sudan's biggest militias.
The Nuba Mountains contain a jigsaw of communities that mix Muslims, Christians and others practising traditional African beliefs."
1099,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 12:02PM ET</span>",Angry and hurt: British royals disappointed as Harry and Meghan quit,"By Michael Holden and Guy Faulconbridge
LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's royal family is hurt and disappointed by Prince Harry and his wife Meghan's surprise announcement that they will step back from their senior roles and spend more time in North America, a royal source said.
Harry and Meghan's decision to step away from royal duties sent shock waves through the royal family as neither Queen Elizabeth nor Prince Charles, heir to the British throne, had been consulted on the announcement, made on Instagram.
Elizabeth, who has devoted her life to the public duty of monarchy since she became queen in 1952, and other senior members of the family felt hurt and disappointed by the move, a royal source said.
""We have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,"" Harry and Meghan said in their statement. 
""We intend to step back as ‘senior’ members of the Royal Family, and work to become financially independent.""
They said the decision was taken after months of reflection and discussion, and that they would split their time between the United Kingdom and North America to allow their family the space it needs.
Cast by the couple as an exciting next step, it was not immediately clear how the couple will become what royal biographers said was akin to being a ""half royal"" - and who will pay for their transatlantic lifestyles.
No senior royal has yet commented on the decision. British tabloids said the announcement had left senior royals such as Prince Charles and Harry's brother, Prince William, incandescent with rage.
Buckingham Palace said discussions with Harry and Meghan were at an early stage and that such complicated issues took time to work out. 
""What really annoys me is that you can't really have your cake and eat it, you can't - one minute be in America or Canada next minute, be in London,"" said Arthur Edwards, veteran photographer for the Sun tabloid which ran the front page headline ""MEGXIT"".
""You know, you are either a member of the royal family or you're not,"" he told Reuters.
The Daily Mirror's royal editor Russell Myers said there could see a complete breakdown of relations between Harry and Meghan and all other royals. ""There will be certain repercussions I imagine for everyone involved,"" he said.
SMALLER MONARCHY?
While the manner in which Harry and Meghan have tried to exit the spotlight cast on the world's most famous family drew criticism, Prince Charles has long sought a slimmer and leaner royal family.
The haste of their decision, though, raises questions for a family which had in Elizabeth's words a ""quite bumpy"" year that included her son Prince Andrew's decision to step down due to his relationship with disgraced U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein.
Royal commentators drew parallels with the abdication crisis of Edward VIII who gave up the throne in 1936 to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson and lived out his life in France.
Opponents of the monarchy were scathing and even supporters questioned how one could be a part-time royal. 
""Taxpayers will rightly ask who will be funding their overseas lifestyle, their extra security and trips back and forth between here and North America,"" said Graham Smith, head of Republic which wants to abolish the monarchy.
Meghan, known for her role in the TV legal drama “Suits”, could return to acting in the United States though it is unclear how that would be viewed by the Palace.
""Perhaps she'd have to be careful about what roles she'd do because she is a member of the royal family, so she couldn't do too many racy sex scenes for instance,"" said Royal biographer Penny Junor.
WHEN HARRY MET MEGHAN
Harry and Meghan, an American divorcee, met on a blind date but fell in love in Botswana. They married in May 2018 in a lavish ceremony in Windsor Castle that was heralded at the time as a sign of a more modern monarchy.
Yet their relationship with the media turned sour as they struggled to deal with the intense scrutiny it brought.
Educated at the exclusive Eton College, Harry's teenage years were overshadowed by negative headlines. 
Harry, who has never hidden his discomfort with his royal role, and his brother dislike the press because of the way it hounded their mother, Princess Diana, who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi.
There have been negative stories criticizing Harry and Meghan's use of private jets while promoting environmental causes and the 2.4 million pound ($3.08 million) taxpayer-funded renovation of their new home.
The couple, whose titles are the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, began legal action against some tabloid newspapers in October over historic phone-hacking and invasion of privacy.

Harry described the treatment of his wife as ""bullying"", and likened it to that of his mother before her death.

1100,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 09, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>",One woman reports a rape every 15 minutes in India,"By Sudarshan Varadhan
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - One woman reported a rape every 15 minutes on average in India in 2018, according to government data released on Thursday, underlining its dismal reputation as one of the worst places in the world to be female. 
The highly publicized gang rape and murder of a woman in a bus in New Delhi in 2012 brought tens of thousands onto the streets across India and spurred demands for action from film stars and politicians, leading to harsher punishments and new fast-track courts. But the violence has continued unabated.
Women reported almost 34,000 rapes in 2018, barely changed from the year before. Just over 85% led to charges, and 27% to convictions, according to the annual crime report released by the Ministry of Home Affairs.
Women's rights groups say crimes against women are often taken less seriously, and investigated by police lacking in sensitivity.
""The country is still run by men, one (female prime minister) Indira Gandhi is not going to change things. Most judges are still men,"" said Lalitha Kumaramangalam, former chief of the National Commission for Women.
""There are very few forensic labs in the country, and fast-track courts have very few judges,"" said Kumaramangalam, a member of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
The rape of a teenager in 2017 by former BJP state legislator Kuldeep Singh Sengar gained national attention when the accuser tried to kill herself the following year, accusing the police of inaction.
Five months before Sengar was convicted last December, the accuser's family had to be provided with security after a truck crashed into the car she was in, injuring her and killing two of her relatives.
A 2015 study by the Centre for Law & Policy Research in Bengaluru found that fast-track courts were indeed quicker, but did not handle a high volume of cases.
And a study in 2016 by Partners for Law in Development in New Delhi found that they still took an average of 8.5 months per case - more than four times the recommended period.

The government statistics understate the number of rapes as it is still considered a taboo to report rape in some parts of India, and because rapes that end in murder are counted purely as murders.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy scrambled to salvage diplomatic credibility on Thursday after its bid to play a central role in resolving Libya's long-running conflict came off the rails, revealing failures at the heart of the government.
Libya has been in a state of violent flux since a NATO air campaign in 2011 led to the downfall of its strongarm leader Muammar Gaddafi. Italy was most directly impacted by the resulting chaos, which triggered a wave of migration to its shores, and has sought to lead subsequent stabilization efforts.
But in an embarrassing snub for Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Libya's internationally recognized leader Fayez al-Serraj refused to see him on Wednesday after discovering that his great rival General Khalifa Haftar had also been invited to Rome.
At the same time, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio found himself isolated at a meeting of counterparts from France, Egypt, Greece and Cyprus, refusing to sign a final communique on Libya because he felt it was biased in favor of Haftar.
The twin developments left the Italian coalition government looking both forsaken on the international stage and divided internally, dealing a potentially fatal blow to diplomatic efforts by Rome to impose peace on a largely lawless Libya.
""What happened yesterday was frankly embarrassing,"" said Arturo Varvelli, director of the Rome office of the European Council on Foreign Relations think tank.
""Our politicians don't pay enough attention to foreign policy and they are paying the price for it.""
Conte and Di Maio, neither of whom had any diplomatic experience when they first entered government in 2018, met on Thursday to try to plot a way forward.
But foreign policy experts said Rome had lost the initiative to more pro-active countries, such as France, Turkey and Russia, while opposition parties accused the government of ineptitude.
""Conte really is dangerous and incompetent,"" said far-right League leader Matteo Salvini, accusing the prime minister of making a simple error of protocol by receiving Haftar before first meeting Serraj. ""We have amateurs on the loose,"" he said.
LOSING STANDING
In July 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump gave Conte the nod to oversee efforts to stabilize Libya, saying he recognized ""Italy's leadership role"".
But even with this clear backing, Rome failed to secure universal support for its favorite Serraj, as France, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates instead backed Haftar in a proxy conflict driven by divergent economic and strategic interests.
Italy subsequently sought to build its own ties with Haftar, hoping to safeguard its energy concerns in Libya should he win out in the end. But Conte was blindsided when Turkey unexpectedly announced last month it would send military advisers and possibly troops to bolster Serraj in Tripoli.
""The process by which Turkey and Russia are taking the diplomatic space is ruthless and largely irreversible. Italy is improvising alone and it is failing miserably,"" said Jalel Harchaoui, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute, an independent, Dutch think tank.
Conte denied on Thursday any government inconsistency over Libya, while Di Maio acknowledged in a letter to la Repubblica daily that politicians had not always known how to harness the expertise of their diplomats and intelligence agency.
Speaking off the record because of the sensitivity of the issue, officials expressed frustration over the political line they had been asked to follow in recent months.
""The order was to maintain contact with everyone, but in an open conflict you need to position yourself clearly,"" said one intelligence source, complaining that Rome had tried to be friends with everyone, and had lost influence as a result.
Diplomats fear Rome is losing influence beyond just Libya.
That was noticeable last week when U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called officials worldwide after the U.S. killing of Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad, but did not get in touch with Rome, despite the fact that Italy has the largest Western troop presence in Iraq after the U.S..
Varvelli said Italy was suffering the consequences of inconsistent policy-making and poor political preparation.
""Our political leaders are making blunders on the international stage,"" he said, adding that Rome would have to stop trying to lead the way on Libya and instead seek European consensus. ""We don't have any more cards to play."""

Ramil Shamsutdinov opened fire on servicemen at a military facility in the far eastern region of Zabaikalsk on Oct. 25. He was detained shortly after the incident, has admitted his guilt and could face life in prison if convicted.
The case is embarrassing for the military, which has been revamped in recent years at great cost, projects an image of might and says it has stamped out the Soviet-era problem of hazing - the bullying of conscripts by older soldiers.
Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, who some tip as a possible successor to President Vladimir Putin, told Russian media last year that extensive army reform had prevented hazing altogether.
""I regret I couldn't restrain myself and that I resorted to this extreme step, but I had no other way out. I couldn't take any more mistreatment,"" Shamsutdinov wrote in an open letter circulated by his lawyer Ruslan Nagiyev on social media.
""I didn't expect to end up in such hell. There was nowhere to run and complain,"" he wrote, without providing details.
Some Russian media have quoted Shamsutdinov as saying that he had been threatened with rape and that officers were beating up conscripts and taking their money.
Russian men aged 18-27 are legally required to serve one year in the army. Some Russians go to lengths to dodge the draft in part because of fears of hazing despite the government's drive to overhaul the military.
Shamsutdinov said he had wanted to serve as a conscript and then join the army as a career. He apologized to the families of his victims.
Lawyer Nagiyev said last month police were investigating whether Shamsutdinov and several other soldiers had been subjected to hazing and had opened a separate criminal case."

LONDON (Reuters) - Love them or loathe them, the British royals are peerless purveyors of news stories and there was no shortage of opinions in London on Thursday about Prince Harry and his wife Meghan's shock plans to strike out on their own.
Media headlines in Britain were mostly negative but members of the public in central London appeared more sympathetic to the couple's desire to step back from their roles as senior royals.
""After the time they've had with the British press, I think it's a good move for them,"" said Bobby Locke, the manager of a bar in central London, alluding to the pair's complaints of unfair and inaccurate coverage.
Locke said Harry's attempt to find a path for himself outside tightly controlled royal protocol was understandable, given his ill-defined status as younger sibling to a future monarch.
""Historically, it's usually the sibling of the future king that's the runaway one - Princess Margaret, Prince Edward, they all want to have their own lives because they're born into something they can't be,"" he said.
Since his elder brother Prince William had three children with his wife Kate, Harry has been pushed down to sixth in line to the throne.
But while the chance of a significant constitutional role for him has receded, his popularity has remained high, helped by his image as a creatable, emotionally articulate man.
""I like Harry. Harry's a good guy, he's more of an open guy than Will,"" said Zach Nur, a guide working on tourist buses.
He was supportive of the couple's decision to relinquish some of their royal duties and become financially independent, but less keen on their plan to spend more time in North America.
""I suggest to them, 'stay here rather than leaving the UK,'"" he said. ""Hopefully, they do stay here.""
JOHN AND YOKO
Others were less interested in Harry and Meghan's wellbeing, but pleased that they would contribute to slimming down the monarchy, an institution regarded by some as costly and bloated.
""Personally speaking, the monarchy, I'd have the queen and the next in line, but the rest of them? Make a living for yourself!"" said Tom Flannigan, a recruitment consultant from Scotland on a business trip to London.
His wife Helen, however, took a more negative view, blaming Meghan for disrupting Harry's life and especially his relationship with his brother - a take on the Windsor family saga favored by some newspapers.
""I think Harry's getting led. I think he'll regret it later in life,"" she said, bemoaning that the close bond between the brothers, cemented by the loss of their mother Princess Diana, appeared to have frayed.
Such comments received short shrift from American visitors, who took a more positive view of their compatriot Meghan.
Candice Fleming, from Chicago, accused the British media of scapegoating the former TV actress.
""There's a divorced American woman, making problems for the monarchy, here we go again,"" she said, alluding to the abdication crisis of 1936, when King Edward VIII renounced the throne to marry American divorcee Wallis Simpson.
""As an American I go, 'well, it's their life so that's good for them, what they think is best for them, for their family,'"" said Fleming, adding that in her view Harry was more popular in the United States, ""more beloved"" than his relatives.
Eric Rohmann, also visiting from Chicago, drew a comparison with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, recalling how xenophobia drove much negative coverage of the Beatle's relationship with the Japanese artist.
""Why blame Meghan?"" he said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will move forward with its own legislative agenda next week, unless it receives articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday.
""There's real business for the American people that the United States Senate needs to complete. If the speaker continues to refuse to take her own accusations to trial, the Senate will move forward next week with the business of our people,"" McConnell said on the Senate floor.
Pelosi has effectively delayed Trump's trial by refusing to send the Senate the two articles of impeachment approved by the House last month, as Democrats have pressed McConnell to guarantee that the trial will include testimony from top Trump administration officials. McConnell has resisted that effort.
The House charged Trump with abusing his power for personal gain in connection with his effort to pressure Ukraine to announce a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, a leading contender for the Democratic nomination to face Trump in November's presidential election.
It also charged the Republican president with obstructing Congress by directing administration officials and agencies not to cooperate with the impeachment inquiry.

Politicians in the British province have until Monday to end a three-year hiatus or risk fresh elections that London has said will be called if no agreement is reached.
Sinn Fein, the largest nationalist party, withdrew from the power-sharing government exactly three years ago saying it was not being treated equally.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Europe's top judge issued a veiled warning to Poland on Thursday over its overhaul of the judiciary, saying there is no place in the European Union for countries that do not have independent courts.
Koen Lenaerts, President of the European Court of Justice (ECJ), made his comments in Warsaw, weeks after Poland's lower house of parliament approved a draft law that would allow judges who question planned reforms to be disciplined.
The European Commission has said the legislation would imperil the rule of law, deepening a standoff with the governing Law and Justice party in which the EU executive launched legal action in 2019 to try to preserve Polish courts' independence.
""You can't be a member of the European Union if you don't have independent, impartial courts operating in accordance with fair trial rule, upholding union law,"" Lenaerts said during a debate at Warsaw University.
""Mutual trust is not blind trust, mutual trust is a trust which must be deserved, which must be earned day after day by all the member states, also by Belgium, by the Netherlands, by Luxemburg, by Portugal, but also by Poland, Hungary, the Balkan states and so on.""
The ECJ, the EU's top court, has in recent years brought multiple cases against Poland over its overhaul of the judiciary, and on other issues such as environmental protection. Brussels has said it could cut funds for a member state that undermines the rule of law.
The nationalist PiS says the reforms are necessary to make the judiciary more efficient and effective.
LEGAL EXPERTS VISIT
Lenaerts, who was in Poland for a ceremony honoring an ECJ judge who is Polish, arrived on the same day that the Council of Europe's Venice Commission, a body of legal experts, came to Warsaw for consultations on the reforms of the judiciary.
Brussels has asked Poland to hold off adopting the draft law until it consults the Venice Commission, which is due to release an opinion next week.
Poland's Senate, where the opposition has a majority, could redraft or reject the latest draft legislation when it debates it next week, but the PiS-controlled lower house would still have the power to overturn any changes."

A few hundred people gathered outside the building in the city of Sukhumi, the pro-Russian region's capital, before breaking down the door and smashing windows to get inside, pictures and footage circulated by Russian state media showed.
The isolated region of Abkhazia broke away from Georgia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Most countries consider it a part of Georgia, but Russia recognized its independence and that of the region of South Ossetia after winning a short war against Georgia in 2008. Russia has troops based in Abkhazia.
Thursday's unrest came as the authorities were set to review a call by opposition leader Alkhas Kvitsinia to void the results of his runoff against incumbent president Raul Khajimba in September.
Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has called the elections in Abkhazia illegitimate and a ""sham process"" that violates the country's sovereignty.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah is working to remove obstacles to a deal on a new government which must be formed as soon as possible to avoid collapse, one of its top officials said on Thursday.
Lebanon has been without a functioning government since Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister in October after protests against the political elite over corruption, leaving the country without a rescue plan as financial and economic crises deepen.
The worst economic crisis since the 1975-90 civil war has led the Lebanese pound to slump amid a dollar shortage and banks to tightly control access to cash and block transfers abroad.
Spiraling regional tensions since the killing of Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, a close ally of Shi'ite Hezbollah, by the United States last week have added to the risks facing the heavily indebted state. Hezbollah has said Iran's allies in the region should help avenge the killing.
But referring to the regional conflict, senior Hezbollah official Ibrahim Amin al-Sayyed said nobody including Hezbollah wanted ""a government of confrontation"" in Lebanon but one that could save the country.
""We are carrying a very important and exhausting role to reach an agreement as soon as possible to prevent this collapse,"" Sayyed said.
""We have taken the initiative and continue to do so to remove all obstacles and complications to reach a government.""
Speaking after a meeting with Maronite Patriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, Sayyid also noted that the regional situation was ""another incentive"" for concessions.
Hezbollah, which is sanctioned as a terrorist group by the United States, has exercised more sway over Lebanese state affairs since it won a parliamentary majority together with its political allies in 2018.
Along with allies including President Michel Aoun, Hezbollah last month nominated former government minister Hassan Diab to form the next government after the failure of efforts to make a deal with Hariri, an ally of the West and Gulf Arab states.
Shi'ite Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally, said the government formation was facing complications and the situation in Lebanon was going from bad to worse.
The pound has weakened again in recent days on the parallel market: dollars were being offered at 2,400 pounds on Thursday - some 60% weaker than its official peg of 1,507.5 pounds, a dealer said.
In a rebuke to politicians, Jan Kubis, the senior U.N. official in Lebanon, on Wednesday said it was ""increasingly irresponsible"" to keep Lebanon without a government."

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Paulin Bolumbu thought his family lived a safe distance from the Congo River, but in November the water overran its banks by more than half a kilometer, inundating his corrugated iron house.
""The river often bursts its banks but it never came up to this level,"" said Bolumbu, clambering across wooden planks he had installed to create a makeshift floor above the floodwater for the family's beds and clothing.
A television and radio were stacked higher still atop a wooden cabinet.
Democratic Republic of Congo is one of several central African countries to be hit by severe flooding in recent months, which researchers have attributed to increasingly intense and unpredictable weather linked to global warming.
Flooding in November in the capital Kinshasa led to landslides that killed 39 people.
The rains can be deadly in other ways, too.
Henry Bofason said two of his children died of typhoid on Dec. 29 and Jan. 2 because of unsanitary conditions in the church where they and more than 700 others had taken shelter.
""The children are always sick here because the environment is not healthy,"" Bofason told Reuters while seated next to his son's coffin alongside his wife and his remaining five children.
In the Manzenze and Ngewele neighborhoods, residents say the flooding is the worst in at least 15 years, keeping dozens of city blocks underwater for the last two months.
Hundreds of residents have abandoned their homes altogether. Paulin, a motorcycle taxi driver who didn't give his last name, now ferries clients by canoe around canals choked with leaves and plastic bottles.
John Waku, the operations manger for Congo's national meteorology agency, said the floods were the result of climate change coupled with poor drainage and other infrastructure in Kinshasa, a city of more than 12 million people.
Heavy rainfall in Congo's northern rainforest swelled the Ubangi River, a tributary of the Congo, in October and November, sending unusually high volumes of water rushing toward Kinshasa.
""Climate change can manifest itself in an increase in the frequency or the intensity of meteorological phenomena. There are those two elements here,"" Waku said.
Several of Congo's neighbors have also seen flooding. Torrential rains in Central African Republic in October destroyed 10,000 houses and forced 100,000 people from their homes, the United Nations said.
South Sudan declared a national emergency in October after 420,000 people fled from floods. Researchers tied the heavy rains to warmer-than-usual waters in the western Indian Ocean that caused increased evaporation.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The ""depth of the devastation"" inflicted on Hong Kong's economy by more than six months of anti-government protests will be seen in the coming weeks, the chief of the city's stock exchange operator said on Thursday.
The warning came as Hong Kong-based companies are expected to show the scars of the sometimes violent protests that forced businesses to shut and scared away visitors over the next few weeks when they report their annual results.
""I think local listed companies with local exposure are going to take a very big hit. They already are taking a big hit,"" Charles Li, CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Ltd (HKEX) (HK:0388), told a Reuters Breakingviews event.
HKEX itself posted its steepest profit slide in nearly three years in the third quarter, as investor sentiment was hit by months of unrest that pushed the city into recession for the first time in a decade.
The protests have evolved over the months into a broad pro-democracy campaign, with demands for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into complaints of police brutality.
Many people are angered by what they see as Beijing's ever-tightening grip on the city that was promised a high degree of autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" formula under which it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing denies interference in the former British colony and blames the West for fomenting the unrest.
Li said what made Hong Kong great was ""one country, two systems"", and that he believed China would fundamentally come to the judgement that the two systems worked for the world's second-largest economy, even in the worst case scenario.
HKEX earnings for 2019 are expected to be bolstered by a pick-up in share sales in the fourth quarter, with Chinese e-commerce giant  Alibaba  (N:BABA) raising almost $13 billion from its secondary listing in Hong Kong.
Referring to Alibaba, which in 2013 dropped plans for a primary listing in Hong Kong and turned instead to New York due to rigid listing rules, Li said the exchange needed to eliminate barriers for companies to return.
HKEX launched a surprise $39 billion approach for the  London Stock Exchange  Group (L:LSE) in September, but withdrew it after failing to convince LSE management and investors to back the move.

On potential acquisitions, Li said all options were on the table.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand has asked Malaysia to help find a group of Rohingya Muslim trafficking victims who absconded from a detention center in the south of the country, Thai police said on Thursday.
Nineteen Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar escaped from the detention center in Thailand's southern Songkhla province, around 5 km (3 miles) from the Thai-Malaysian border, early on Wednesday, using a piece of cloth to climb down from a third floor window, police said.
They were part of some 40 Rohingya Muslims, identified as victims of human traffickers, who were intercepted by Thai authorities on their way to Malaysia and had been detained at the center to await repatriation to Myanmar, police said. Two were found later on Wednesday, police said.
""We've coordinated with Malaysian authorities to help find the remaining 17 who might have escaped into the border areas,"" Pairat Pookcharoen, deputy commander of an immigration police unit in the south, told Reuters.
Thailand has long been a destination and transit country for men, women and children smuggled and trafficked from poorer, neighboring countries, including Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The United States and rights groups have criticized Thai authorities for not doing enough to protect victims of trafficking.
Myanmar regards the Rohingya as illegal migrants, though many trace their roots in the country back for generations, and has confined tens of thousands to sprawling camps in Rakhine state in the west, segregated from the Buddhist Rakhine population since violence swept the area in 2012.
The unrest prompted tens of thousands of Rohingya to flee Myanmar by sea, an exodus that peaked in 2015 when an estimated 25,000 people crossed the Andaman Sea for Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia, many drowning in unsafe and overloaded boats.
More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled to Bangladesh since a 2017 crackdown by the Myanmar army, according to U.N. agencies. U.N. investigators concluded the crackdown was conducted with ""genocidal intent"", an accusation that Myanmar rejects.
Although Myanmar authorities say they are ready to receive any who Rohingya who return, refugees have refused to go back for fear of further violence."

""If the European People's Party is unable to change course, then a new initiative will be needed in European politics, a new direction,"" Orban told a news conference.
""If we cannot achieve this change within the People's Party, then we will present a new initiative in European party life, because we need to create a counterweight to the rise of (French President Emmanuel) Macron's movement,"" Orban said.
The EPP suspended membership of Orban's Fidesz party last year over concern about Orban's populist anti-immigration campaigns and erosion of the rule of law, freedom of the press and minority rights under his tenure.
Orban said the question was whether his ruling Fidesz would be able to have an impact on the EPP's future direction and in the coming weeks this will become clearer.
Orban, a staunch opponent of mass immigration to Europe from the Middle East, Asia and North Africa, said the EPP should return to its conservative roots on issues of immigration, the traditional family model and the supremacy of national culture.
He declined comment on whether this meant he would try to forge a new conservative group within the European Parliament, however, he noted that he had met with his Polish ally, ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski this week.
The EPP has said it would send a group of “wise men” to investigate conditions in Hungary and decide whether to keep Fidesz among its ranks, a process that new EPP Chairman Donald Tusk expects to close by the end of January.

Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed's government said last April that it had seized 21 machine guns, more than 33,000 handguns, 275 rifles and 300,000 bullets in different parts of the Horn of Africa country over the previous year. 
In October security forces confiscated a further 2,221 handguns and 71 Kalashnikov assault rifles in Gonder in the Amhara region, one of the areas particularly affected by ethnic strife, domestic media said. The rifles had been smuggled into the country in oil trucks from Sudan, they said.
The spread of small arms has been partly blamed for hundreds of killings in various ethnic conflicts over the past two years that have displaced more than 2.7 million people.
""There is a significant number of guns in our society since the previous government and the law will help us to formalize ownership,"" lawmaker Tesfaye Daba told parliament during the passage of the bill.
Abiy, who came to power in 2018, has implemented sweeping liberal reforms which have won him international praise but also lifted the lid on long-repressed tensions between the country's many ethnic groups.
The new law provides for each region to stipulate a legal age for gun ownership, Tesfaye said, while limiting the number of firearms an individual can own to one. Violations could bring up to three years in prison, according to the new legislation.
It will also ban private trade in weaponry and allow only allowing certain government institutions to import guns.
Those found to have involved themselves in arms trafficking would face prison terms of eight to 20 years.
More Ethiopians have resorted to arming themselves due to the volatile political situation and a ""perception of weakening law enforcement"", according to William Davidson, an analyst at the Brussels-based International Crisis Group think tank.
""The proliferation of illegal arms risks fuelling further turmoil,"" he said.
With the iron grip of the past administration loosened, the federal government has struggled to assert its authority and enforce laws throughout the sprawling country, analysts say."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday urged the United States and Iran to avoid escalation and pursue ""dialogue and self-restraint"" to avert a wider conflict in the Middle East.
The pope made his appeal, his first direct comment on the current crisis, in a yearly speech that has come to be known as his ""State of the World"" address to ambassadors accredited to the Vatican.
Speaking for nearly 50 minutes in the Vatican's frescoed Sala Regia, the 83-year-old Roman Catholic leader offered a mostly grim overview of 2019, speaking of wars, global warming, xenophobia toward migrants and the danger of nuclear weapons.
""Particularly troubling are the signals coming from the entire region following the heightening of tensions between Iran and the United States,"" Francis told the diplomats from more than 180 states.
He said the tensions risked ""compromising the gradual process of rebuilding in Iraq, as well as setting the groundwork for a vaster conflict that all of us would want to avert"".
""I therefore renew my appeal that all the interested parties avoid an escalation of the conflict and keep alive the flame of dialogue and self-restraint, in full respect of international law,"" he said.
U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested Iran was ""standing down"" after it fired missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq on Wednesday, itself an act of retaliation for the Jan. 3 U.S. strike that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani.
""Our human family is scarred and wounded by a succession of increasingly destructive wars that especially affect the poor and those most vulnerable,"" Francis said.
""Sadly, the New Year does not seem to be marked by
encouraging signs, as much as by heightened tensions and acts of violence,"" he said.
Recent tensions could likely make it impossible for Francis to visit Iraq, which he has said he would like to do this year.
Wars and conflicts have led to an exodus of Christians from Iraq and some other countries in the Middle East.
Iraq's small Christian population of several hundred thousand suffered particular hardships when Islamic State controlled large parts of the country, but have recovered freedoms since the jihadists were pushed out.
Iraq is home to many different eastern rite churches, both Catholic and Orthodox.
Francis said he still hoped to make a visit this year to mostly Christian South Sudan, which is emerging from civil war.
The pope wove his speech around the foreign trips he made in 2019, which included a visit to Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. There, he became the first pontiff to set foot on the Arabian peninsula, home to Islam's holiest sites.
Speaking of climate change, he said it was sad that the urgency to tackle it ""seems not to have been grasped by international politics"".
He said last December's U.N. conference in Spain raised ""serious concern about the will of the international community to confront"" the issue."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Beijing should not see Taiwan's elections as representing a win or loss for China, Taiwan's foreign minister said on Thursday, days ahead of a vote overshadowed by Chinese efforts to get the island to accept its rule.
Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary elections on Saturday. Its elections are always closely watched by China, which claims the island as its territory. 
Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name, and the government has warned of Beijing's efforts to sway the vote in favor of the opposition.
""I just don't think China should read Taiwan's election as its own victory or defeat,"" Foreign Minister Joseph Wu told reporters in Taipei. 
""If China reads too much into our election ... there might be a likely scenario that China will engage in military intimidation or diplomatic isolation or using economic measures as punishment against Taiwan."" 
President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election, has repeatedly warned Taiwan's people to be wary of Chinese attempts to sway the election through disinformation or military intimidation, an accusation China denies. 
Wu drew attention to China's sailing of its new aircraft carrier into the sensitive Taiwan Strait late last year, calling the voyage ""clear"" evidence of Beijing's attempts to intimidate voters.
""This is our own election. This is not China's election. It is Taiwanese people who go to the voting booth to make a judgment on which candidate or political party is better for them,"" Wu said. 
""If China wants to play with democracies in other countries so much, maybe they can try with their own elections at some point.""
The issue of China has taken center stage in the campaign, especially after its president, Xi Jinping, warned last year it could attack Taiwan, though said he'd prefer a peaceful ""one country, two systems"" formula to rule the island.
Taiwan-China ties have soured since Tsai took office in 2016, with China cutting off formal dialogue, flying bomber patrols around Taiwan, and whittling away at its diplomatic allies.
China suspects Tsai of pushing for the island's formal independence, a red line for Beijing. Tsai says she will maintain the status quo but will defend Taiwan's democracy and way of life.
'EVERY BALLOT HAS POWER'
In a front-page election advertisement in the mass circulation Liberty Times on Thursday, Tsai appealed directly for people to cast their vote against China.
""In the face of China, every ballot has power,"" the advertisement read, next to a picture of Tsai wearing a camouflaged military helmet and flak jacket.
Tsai's main opponent is Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang party, which ruled China until 1949, when it was forced to flee to Taiwan after loosing a civil war with the Communists. 
Han says he would reset ties with Beijing to boost Taiwan's economy, but not compromise on the island's security or democratic way of life.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post later on Thursday, Tsai wrote that China would be happiest if the Kuomintang got back into power.
""The elections should make Taiwan's people happy, not the Chinese government,"" she added.
But Kuomintang Chairman Wu Den-yih said Tsai was the real threat, pointing to an anti-infiltration law she championed and passed late last year to tackle Chinese influence. The Kuomintang says the law seeks to effectively outlaw all contacts with China.
""Don't let Tsai Ing-wen destroy the Republic of China's democracy, liberty and rule of law; just take down Tsai Ing-wen,"" the party cited Wu Den-yih as saying, referring to Taiwan by its official name.

Overshadowing the elections have been allegations in Australian media from a self-professed Chinese spy about China's efforts to influence Taiwan's politics and support Han, who, along with Beijing, has denounced the accusations as lies.

Anwar rejected the charges that he said were politically motivated and came after he had fallen out with Mahathir in the late 1990s.
The latest scandal had deepened rifts within the ruling coalition as Azmin, a senior cabinet member, has been regarded as a possible challenger for the premiership promised to Anwar.
Attorney General Tommy Thomas said in a statement the videos had been reviewed for authenticity and facial recognition by Malaysia's cybersecurity agency, U.S. forensic experts and a private analyst.
The reviews concluded that the footage was real, but the people could not be identified due to the poor resolution and quality of the recordings, Thomas said. He did not refer to Azmin.
""My deputy public prosecutors unanimously recommended to me that no charges be proffered in connection with the videos,"" Thomas said.
Azmin said the attorney-general's decision vindicated him.
""As I have consistently maintained from the beginning, this 'fitnah' video is nothing but a nefarious plot to destroy my political career but whilst those intent on this vile scheme may plot and conspire, I had no doubt that justice will be done,"" he said using the Malay word for ""slanderous""."

Iran said on Sunday that it was stepping back from its commitments under the deal, known as the JCPOA.

MERIMBULA, Australia/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian authorities urged another mass evacuation across the heavily populated southeast on Thursday as a return of hot weather fanned huge bushfires threatening several towns and communities.
Victoria state Premier Daniel Andrews urged communities to be on alert ahead of the extreme conditions.
""If you receive instructions to leave, then you must leave,"" Andrews said in a televised briefing. ""That is the only way to guarantee your safety.""
Parts of Kangaroo Island, a wildlife-rich tourist spot off the southeast coast where Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Wednesday made a plea for foreign tourists not to be deterred by the fires, were again evacuated on Thursday. 
""I urge everyone to heed warnings, follow advice, and to head to the east part of the island, which is deemed safe at this point,"" South Australia Fire Chief Mark Jones said in a separate briefing in Adelaide.
A third of the island has been destroyed. 
Twenty-seven people have been killed this fire season, according to the federal government, as the monster fires have scorched through more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres) of land, an area the size of South Korea. 
Thousands have been made homeless and thousands have had to evacuate repeatedly because of the volatility of the fires.
Residents of the coastal town of Mallacoota, where thousands of people were stranded on a beach for days until a military evacuation that only ended on Wednesday, were among those again advised to flee.
""If we evacuate, where do we go?"" said Mark Tregellas, who spent New Year's Eve on a boat ramp as fire destroyed much of his town, and one of about 1,000 people who decided to stay.
""The electricity is slowly coming back but everyone is reliant on generators, and fuel for those is very limited,"" he told Reuters by telephone from his house. 
""People have now run out of petrol so most in the town are now riding on bicycles.""
Following are some highlights of what is happening in the bushfire crisis:
* A water bombing helicopter ditched in a dam on New South Wales South Coast on Thursday. The pilot was safe.
* Authorities have warned that the huge fires, spurred by high temperatures, wind and a three-year drought, will persist until there is substantial rainfall. The weather agency said there was no sign of that for months.
""It takes a huge amount of rain to put out bushfires of this intensity and of this scale. That's not forecast,"" South Australia Fire Chief Jones told reporters.
* Weather officials in South Australia issued a severe weather warning for some parts of the state's north.
* New South Wales fire officials warned of ""extreme fire danger"" in the state's alpine region.
* Victoria state extended its disaster alert level for another two days. 
* The Australian Bureau of Meteorology reported only 6% of typical annual rainfall last year, while daytime temperatures were more than 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above normal: ""Australia's getting warmer, the fire season's getting longer and the severity of the fire weather during that season is getting more frequent and severe.""
* New South Wales announced new funding of A$1 billion ($686 million) to rebuild.
* Mining magnate Andrew Forrest pledged A$70 million to a recovery package, including a force of more than 1,000 volunteers from the mining and agriculture sectors to help with rebuilding.
* 1,870 homes have been destroyed on the badly hit New South Wales coast.
* Moody's Analytics said the cost of the fires could easily surpass that of deadly 2009 Black Saturday fires that destroyed 450,000 hectares of land, which cost an estimated A$4.4 billion.
* The prime minister has pledged A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) to a newly created National Bushfire Recovery Agency.
* About 100 firefighters from the United States and Canada are helping with another 140 expected in coming weeks.
* Malaysia has approved a plan to send 65 fire and rescue personnel to help. The deployment is awaiting Australian approval.
* Ecologists at the University of Sydney have estimated 1 billion animals have been killed or injured.
* The fires have emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide and produced harmful pollutants, the EU's Copernicus monitoring program said.

* Smoke has drifted across the Pacific, affecting cities in South America, and may have reached the Antarctic, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said.

MADRID (Reuters) - The Unidas Podemos alliance of hard-left parties is set to take a deputy premiership and four ministries in Spain's first coalition government in decades led by the Socialists of Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, according to sources.
Sanchez is expected next week to announce the cabinet line-up of around 20 posts, up from 17 previously.
Following are snapshots of the likely ministers from Unidas Podemos (Together We Can), including Pablo Iglesias who is set to become one of three deputy prime ministers.
PABLO IGLESIAS - a deputy prime minister
Political scientist and lecturer Iglesias, 40, founded Podemos in 2014 with colleagues from the Complutense University, building up on the anti-austerity protest movement in Spain.
Podemos quickly emerged as one of the main political forces that effectively overturned Spain's decades-old two-party system, but its support has ebbed after internal disputes divided its leadership. Several left-wing parties joined Podemos to run on a single Unidas Podemos ticket last year.
After failing to agree with Sanchez on forming a coalition government last year amid mutual accusations of betraying each other's trust, Iglesias and Sanchez smoothed out their differences after a repeat parliamentary election in November.
IRENE MONTERO - minister for equality
Lawmaker since 2016, Unidas Podemos' spokesperson Montero, 31, is a trained psychologist and a prominent feminist, who has actively advocated women's rights in parliament.
Montero has three children with her partner, Podemos leader Iglesias.
ALBERTO GARZON - consumer affairs minister
Economist and politician Garzon, 34, has been a lawmaker for United Left since 2011. His party joined forces with Podemos ahead of last April's election.
Garzon is a card-carrying member of the Spanish Communist Party - one of his books published in 2017 is titled ""Why I am a Communist"" - and his appointment marks the first time in eight decades that a Communist has become a cabinet member.
The newly created ministry will deal with consumer rights and one of its main tasks will be to regulate gambling.
YOLANDA DIAZ - labor minister
The 48-year-old trained lawyer is set to take over a diminished Labour Ministry that should no longer be in charge of social security and migration issues.
MANUEL CASTELLS - minister of higher education
Sociologist and economist Manuel Castells, 77, is an independent whose name was proposed by the mayor of Barcelona and Podemos ally in Catalonia Ada Colau to lead the new Ministry of Higher Education.
The prominent scholar, who taught for 24 years at the University of California, was one of the signatories of a manifesto in favor of a referendum on Catalonia's right to self-determination."

SRINAGAR/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Foreign diplomats visited India-ruled Kashmir on Thursday for the first time since New Delhi stripped the region of special status in August, although some European nations and others declined the invite after being refused permission to travel independently.
India's portion of the Muslim-majority Himalayan region, also claimed by arch-foe Pakistan, has been under severe restrictions, including one of the world's longest internet shutdowns, after India revoked decades-old laws granting Kashmir autonomy and statehood, leading to widespread unrest.
A spokesman for India's foreign ministry said diplomats of fifteen countries, including the United States, were on a two-day trip to the region, adding it would release a full statement on the visit later on Thursday.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has been keen to blunt international criticism of its moves in Kashmir and said the situation was fast returning to normal.
The trip will include meetings with the army, as well as some politicians, civil society groups and journalists selected by the security services, two officials familiar with the plans said.
No foreign journalists have been given permission to go to Kashmir since August.
The diplomats will not be given access to Omar Abdullah or Mehbooba Mufti, the leaders of the two political parties that have historically dominated Kashmir. Both were among hundreds of political and civil society leaders detained during the August crackdown and remain in custody.
Some countries, including European Union nations, declined a visit due to the restrictive nature of the trip, according to the officials and two foreign diplomats in New Delhi.
One European diplomat said any future decision on whether to visit Kashmir will be a collective one made by the EU. The EU delegation in New Delhi did not respond to a request for comment.
India maintains its actions in Kashmir are necessary to combat a three-decade-long armed insurgency against its rule there, that it accuses Pakistan of fomenting. Islamabad denies this.
But the August crackdown has drawn international criticism, including from German leader Angela Merkel, who said in a November visit to India the situation in Kashmir was ""not sustainable"".
Diplomats from several other countries said they have privately raised concerns about human rights in Kashmir with counterparts in the foreign ministry.
Access to the region for foreign observers, including diplomats, rights groups and journalists, is tightly controlled.
Foreign envoys are provided with police escorts, ostensibly for their own security, a diplomat who frequently visited the region before August said, and rarely granted permission to travel outside of Kashmir's main city of Srinagar.
Foreign journalists are required to submit detailed itineraries and to seek approval to visit Kashmir as much as eight weeks in advance - permissions New Delhi has not granted since August."

The protesters attacked the troops with hand grenades, petrol bombs and knives in the village of Dong Tam, near the capital, Hanoi, the ministry said in a statement on its website.
Three policemen and one of the protesters were killed, while one protester was injured, the ministry said, but did not elaborate on the protesters' objections.
It was not immediately clear how the policemen came to be killed, and Reuters could not independently verify the number of those killed in the clash.
In a statement, New York-based Human Rights Watch said the dispute was about land rights, and urged the authorities to launch an ""impartial and transparent"" investigation. 
""Vietnam government officials need to recognize the importance of carrying out dialogues and negotiations with farmers to solve land disputes like Dong Tam in a peaceful manner rather than using violence,"" said Phil Robertson, the group's deputy director for Asia. 
""The authorities have launched an investigation into the case and have arrested the lawbreakers,"" the ministry said.
Disputes over land do occur in Vietnam, although the incident was the first time in years that policemen were killed in a such a dispute.

Devotees clad in yellow and maroon thronged the life-sized statue known as the ""Black Nazarene"" as it was paraded through the streets of Manila aboard a rope-pulled carriage, in one of the main annual festivals in Asia's largest Catholic nation.
""I joined the procession to wish for good fortune for my family, good health and for my future plans,"" Ian Lanaria, 24, told Reuters.
Participating for the first time, Lanaria said he had decided to join after previously watching the mass ritual on television and hearing about the miracles from his friends.
People were seen jostling through the crowd of police to be near the statue as it crawled through the capital, believing that a slight touch would bless them, heal their illnesses and those of their relatives.
Thursday's procession is expected to last for hours, and organizers expected it to draw 6 million people as the crowds swell over the day.
An early morning estimate by police put the crowd at around 400,000 people, excluding those waiting further along the procession's six-kilometer (3.7 miles) route.
Having had his prayers answered when he was in need of money in the past, Bonny Morales, 65, was among the early worshippers.
“After making a vow to the Black Nazarene my loan immediately got approved, which is why I truly believe in its miraculous powers, especially for those who have strong faith in the Black Nazarene,” Morales said."

The man, who has not been identified, tried to enter the United States at the Pharr–Reynosa International Bridge between the Mexican border city of Reynosa and Pharr, Texas.
The officials, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said around 5 p.m. local time, the man drew a knife and cut his throat when denied access to the United States. Both officials said the man was seeking asylum.
""He committed suicide,"" one of the officials said. The man killed himself on the Mexican side of the bridge, just meters away from the international dividing line, the other source said.
A short, grainy video shared by one of the security sources showed the man, dressed in a blue shirt, approaching U.S. officials on the bridge and raising a hand to his neck.
Photos shared by the source showed the man's body lying in a pool of blood with his throat cut.
The officials said the man was in his 30s.
Reuters could not vouch for the authenticity of the video or photographs. It was unclear why the man had killed himself.
The U.S. Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
The attorney general's office for the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where Reynosa lies, said it was investigating the man's death.
Many Mexicans who seek refuge in the United States say their lives are at risk at home from violent criminal gangs, which have made parts of the country increasingly perilous. Homicides have reached record levels in Mexico during the last two years.

U.S. President Donald Trump has made tightening border security and reducing illegal immigration at the U.S.-Mexico frontier a priority of his administration.

KAOHSIUNG, Taiwan (Reuters) - In balmy southern Taiwan, with its rural hamlets, industrial belts and slower-paced cities, a rising tide of residents are pushing back against opposition presidential hopeful Han Kuo-yu, fearing he'll sell out core Taiwan interests to China.
Han, the mayor of the south's biggest city of Kaohsiung, had been expected to build his support base over the past year since winning office on a promise to help citizens ""make a big fortune"" by forging better economic ties with China.
Instead, as he prepares for the election on Saturday against incumbent president Tsai Ing-wen and her independence-minded Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), he has seen his fortunes wane, hammered by criticism over controversial public remarks and failing to deliver on campaign promises, including oil exploration in the South China Sea.
Last month, a coalition of groups called ""Wecare Kaohsiung"" held a mass anti-Han rally that drew tens of thousands, some holding signs with the words ""Dismiss pro-Communist mayor"".
""Every Taiwan leader needs to find a balance between the U.S. and China, but with Han, he has completely shifted toward China,"" said Aaron Yin, one of the leaders of the movement.
Taiwan's vote for a new president and parliament comes at a delicate moment for its giant neighbor, and sentiment in southern Taiwan has become a key factor for the election, which could set the democratic island's future course with autocratic China.
In March last year, Han, whose Kuomintang Party favors close ties with China, paid a high-profile visit to Hong Kong and China, where he met with senior Chinese officials and reiterated his commitment to ""one China"" as a core of cross-strait relations.
Han's red-carpet treatment raised alarm bells, as many Taiwanese harbor a deep mistrust of China, especially after Chinese President Xi Jinping threatened Taiwan with force.
""The main aim of this election is to reject any rapprochement with China,"" Yin told Reuters in a small office stacked with anti-Han pamphlets and those pledging solidarity with the pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong.
POLITICAL MAVERICK
Han, 62, has proven a divisive figure since reappearing in politics in 2017 to make a failed bid for the chairmanship of the Kuomintang. Known for fiery rhetoric, his ability to electrify crowds helped him clinch the mayorship of Kaohsiung in late 2018.
Although Han has said ""one country, two systems"" isn't an acceptable model for Taiwan, he has promised to restart dialogue with China if elected president and called for an agreement between China's Communists and the Kuomintang that both sides belong to ""one China"", with each having their own interpretation of what that means.
Han has described Taiwan's formal independence as scarier than syphilis and warned that Tsai's re-election could lead to a ""volcano eruption"" of tensions with China.
Wang Lin Chiao, a Kuomintang politician seeking a parliamentary seat in the southern township of Meinong, said that stability is paramount, and that continued engagement with China is the only way forward.
""The 21st century belongs to China,"" Wang said as she campaigned on a quiet street with a three-person support team, struggling to find people to speak to.
""Taiwan needs a good future, so we don't want to meddle in sensitive political issues and change things. People only care about money here, and having a safe life,"" she said, noting a decline in Chinese tourists and exports of agricultural produce to China after curbs by Beijing last year.
But some, such as Chiu Yi-ying, a DPP lawmaker competing against Wang for the 222,700-voter constituency, say Taiwan must further deepen its ""New Southbound Policy"" of economic engagement with 18 countries in South-east Asia, rather than rely on China.
Chiu peppers her lobbying with Hong Kong references, telling older voters that an influx of Chinese immigrants and tourists into Hong Kong since the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997 had substantially lengthened queues at public hospitals and depleted supplies of essentials like milk-powder.
""That's when they really understand that Hong Kong today is Taiwan's tomorrow,"" she told Reuters in her campaign office, where massive billboards feature her smiling beside Tsai.
'IN A CAGE?'
Some farmers and pigeon breeders in the south's rural patchwork of ponds and fields say they've been scarred by past decades of conflicts with China and want to avoid that. But they can't ignore the realities of Hong Kong and the dangers faced by a more aggressive China under Xi.
""One country, two systems is not good,"" said Chen Jin-Wen, a pigeon breeder in the north of the historic port city of Tainan as he exercised his birds along a stretch of coastline overlooking the Taiwan Strait, referring to the model by which China has been ruling Hong Kong.
""You see what's happening in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong people are used to freedom, like Taiwan people,"" he said, as his racing birds pecked about in a wooden cage before bolting skywards.
""But mainland China is taking it away from them now,"" he said. ""It's like my birds, they can fly free for a while but they always end up back in a cage."""

Many young people in Syria, where Moscow intervened in 2015 to help President Bashir al-Assad win back territory, are eager to study Russian in order to travel to Russia or work in Russian companies they expect to appear in Syria in the future.
""At first we didn't understand anything and when we first heard the words we started to laugh...it was hard,"" said Tawil. ""The teachers are helping us to love this language.""
Radwan Rahhal, Coordinator of Russian language in the Syrian Education Ministry, said demand for the classes outstrips supply.
""We have more than 24,000 students who are learning Russian and the number is increasing. But we cannot expand more than this in the meantime unless we have more teachers.""
The Syrian Education Ministry added Russian as an optional second foreign language in schools after English or French in 2014. Graduates in Russian literature willing to teach it attend special courses supervised by experts from Moscow.
Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Syria on Tuesday for the second time since Moscow's decisive intervention, and met Assad in Damascus.
Russian and Iranian support has helped Assad win back nearly all the territory lost to rebels who tried to overthrow him in a civil war that grew out of a crackdown on opposition protests nearly nine years ago."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada expects to play a big role in Iran's probe of an airliner crash that killed 63 Canadians even though the two nations do not have diplomatic ties, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Wednesday.
Trudeau said 138 of the 176 people on board the Ukraine International Airlines Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 from Tehran to Kiev had onward connections to Canada. All aboard died when the plane crashed shortly after takeoff.
Canada broke off diplomatic relations with Iran in 2012. Trudeau said Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne would call his Iranian counterpart Mohammad Javad Zarif later on Wednesday to underline the need for a proper probe of the crash.
""Canada is one of a handful of countries with a high degree of expertise when it comes to these sorts of accidents and therefore we have much to contribute,"" Trudeau said.
""I am confident that in our engagement both through our allies and directly, we are going to make sure that we are a substantive contributor to this investigation,"" he told a news conference in Ottawa.
Italy normally acts as a proxy for communication between Canada and Iran, and the Ukrainian ambassador told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp that his government was willing to help.
The disaster marked one of the greatest losses of Canadian life in a single day in recent years. Trudeau would not comment on possible causes for the tragedy.
""Obviously we are very, very early days on the investigation. It's dangerous to speculate on possible causes,"" he said.
Most of the victims came from Canada's Iranian community. Among the dead were a newlywed couple that had traveled to Iran to get married as well as two professors at the University of Alberta.
""Your loss is indescribable and this is a heartbreaking tragedy. While no words will erase your pain, I want you to know that an entire country is with you. We share your grief,"" Trudeau said to those affected by the crash.
Trudeau said he had spoken to a number of world leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump, who expressed his condolences."

WASHINGTON/BAGHDAD/DUBAI (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday tempered days of angry rhetoric and suggested Iran was ""standing down"" after it fired missiles at U.S. forces in Iraq overnight, as both sides looked to defuse a crisis over the U.S. killing of an Iranian general
Trump said the United States did not necessarily have to hit back at Iran's attack on military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq, itself an act of retaliation for the Jan. 3 U.S. strike that killed Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani. 
Trump said no Americans were hurt in the overnight attacks. The Pentagon said Iran had launched 16 short-range ballistic missiles, at least 11 of which hit Iraq's al-Asad air base and one that hit a facility in Erbil but caused no major damage.
""The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have to use it. We do not want to use it. American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent,"" Trump said. 
""Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,"" he said.
Trump did not directly threaten military action but said the United States ""will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime"" in response to what he called ""Iranian aggression."" He offered no specifics. 
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, addressing a gathering of Iranians chanting: ""Death to America,"" said the missile attacks were a ""slap on the face"" of the United States and said U.S. troops should leave the region.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif had said the strikes ""concluded"" Tehran's response to the killing of Soleimani, who built up Iran's network of proxy armies across the Middle East. He was buried in his hometown, Kerman, after days of national mourning.
""We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression,"" Zarif wrote on Twitter.
Influential Iraqi Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who casts himself as a nationalist rejecting both U.S. and Iranian interference in Iraq, also said the crisis Iraq was experiencing was over and he urged militia groups not to carry out attacks.
""I call on the Iraqi factions to be deliberate, patient, and not to start military actions,,"" said Sadr, whom Washington has long regarded as an Iranian ally.
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told CBS News in an interview that the United States was receiving ""encouraging intelligence that Iran is sending messages"" to its allied militias not to attack U.S. targets.
But Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he and others in the military ""fully expect"" Shi'ite militia groups in Iraq, backed by Iran, to carry out attacks against U.S. and U.S.-led forces in Iraq and Syria.
Two rockets fell on Wednesday in Baghdad's heavily fortified Green Zone, causing no casualties, the Iraqi military said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
U.S. Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans said administration officials had not provided evidence in classified briefings to back up Trump's assertion that Soleimani had posed an ""imminent"" threat to the United States. 
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the Democratic-led chamber would vote on a resolution intended to limit his military actions against Iran. 
NUCLEAR DEAL 
Trump's address contrasted with his recent harsh rhetoric. The Republican, who was impeached in December and faces an election in November, had vowed to respond ""disproportionately"" if Iran retaliated strongly against Soleimani's killing. 
Trump said on Saturday the United States had targeted 52 Iranian sites, including ones important to the country's culture. He was criticized for that even by U.S. political allies and later backtracked, saying the United States would obey international law on the issue. 
On Wednesday, Trump again vowed he would not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon and urged world powers to quit a 2015 nuclear accord with Iran that Washington abandoned in 2018 and work for a new deal, an issue at the heart of rising tensions between Washington and Tehran. Iran has rejected new talks. 
There was no immediate reaction from Iranian officials to Trump's comments. The semi-official Fars news agency described the U.S. president's remarks as a ""big retreat from threats.""
Soon after Wednesday's attacks, Trump had said on Twitter that ""All is well!"" and Washington was assessing damage.
That tweet and the comment by Iran's foreign minister eased some concerns about a wider war and calmed jittery financial markets. U.S. stock prices hit record highs before paring their gains, while world oil prices, after an early spike, fell about four percent.
U.S. and European government sources said they believed Iran had deliberately sought to avoid U.S. military casualties in its missile strikes to prevent an escalation. 
But an Iranian army spokesman denied ""foreign media reports"" suggesting there was some kind of coordination between Iran and the United States before the attack to evacuate bases.
Iranian state television said Iran had fired 15 ballistic missiles from its territory at U.S. targets in Iraq.
Iranian television reported an official in the supreme leader's office as saying the attacks were the ""weakest"" of several retaliation scenarios. It quoted another source saying Iran had lined up 100 other potential targets.
Analysts said Iran wanted to avoid any conventional military conflict with superior U.S. forces.
Milley said he believed Iran's strikes ""intended to cause structural damage, destroy vehicles and equipment and aircraft and to kill personnel. That's my own personal assessment.""
After the Iranian missile attack, Iranian state television showed footage of the Soleimani burial, with hundreds of people chanting: ""God is greatest"" when the strikes were announced over loudspeakers. ""His revenge was taken and now he can rest in peace,"" Iranian television said.

Hours after the Iranian missile strike, a Ukrainian airliner crashed shortly after takeoff from Tehran on Wednesday, killing all 176 people on board. A Canadian security source said Western intelligence agencies' initial assessment was that the plane was not brought down by a missile.

The prosecutor said on Wednesday it had sought information on why Spanish officials, on a December visit to the embassy in Bolivia, were accompanied by Spanish tactical police. The incident sparked a diplomatic stand-off and Bolivia expelled Mexico's ambassador and several Spanish officials. Spain responded with a similar measure.
The affair has tested Bolivia's caretaker government, which took power after Morales resigned under pressure in November after widespread protests, evidence of electoral fraud and waning support from military and police.
The government of interim President Jeanine Anez claims that Spanish security forces had tried to hide their identity to gain access to the Mexican embassy, which granted asylum to Morales' backers including former senior aide Juan Ramon Quintana.
Bolivia's government claims some of those in the embassy are wanted for crimes of sedition and armed uprising.
The attorney general said it had passed the case to the prosecutor's office in La Paz to take the necessary steps to get responses from those involved and clarification about the role of the members of Spain's GEO special operations group.
""(We want to know) why they were transferred to Bolivian territory, the task entrusted to this specialized group and the authority that requested their intervention,"" Attorney General Juan Lanchipa said.
Bolivia's government previously requested that the attorney general look into the matter and the alleged involvement of Spanish politicians including Pablo Iglesias, the leader of far-left Unidas Podemos that is part of the new ruling coalition."

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his wife Meghan will step back from senior roles in Britain's royal family and spend more time in North America, they said on Wednesday, an announcement that appears to have taken his grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, by surprise.
After a turbulent year which saw a widening rift with the media and a falling out with elder brother Prince William, Harry said the couple hoped to become financially independent and set up a new charity, while continuing some royal duties.
""After many months of reflection and internal discussions, we have chosen to make a transition this year in starting to carve out a progressive new role within this institution,"" said Harry, sixth in line to the throne, and former actress Meghan in a statement.
""We now plan to balance our time between the United Kingdom and North America, continuing to honor our duty to the Queen, the Commonwealth and our patronages.""
The couple said they would share full details of ""this exciting next step"" soon as they discussed the move with the queen, Harry's father Prince Charles and William.
But the timing of the announcement appeared to have wrongfooted family members, including the queen, a senior royal source told Reuters.
""Other members of the family were not consulted on the content,"" the source added.
Buckingham Palace said discussions with Harry and Meghan were at an early stage.
""We understand their desire to take a different approach but these are complicated issues that will take time to work through,"" it said.
RELATIONSHIP WITH MEDIA SOURS
Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, a divorcee whose mother is African-American and father is white, married in May 2018 in a lavish ceremony in Windsor Castle, and at the time it was heralded as a sign of a more modern monarchy.
Last year Meghan gave birth to their first child, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor.
But their relationship with the press turned sour as they struggled to deal with the intense scrutiny it put them under.
There have been negative stories about them, criticizing their use of private jets while promoting environmental causes and the 2.4 million pound ($3.08 million) taxpayer-funded renovation of their new home.
Eventually the couple, whose titles are the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, began legal action against some tabloid newspapers in October over phone-hacking and invasion of privacy.
Harry described the treatment of his wife as ""bullying"", and likened it to that of his mother Princess Diana before her death in a Paris car accident in 1997 when her limousine crashed as it sped away from chasing paparazzi.
""I never thought that this would be easy, but I thought it would be fair, and that is the part that is really hard to reconcile,"" a tearful Meghan said in a TV interview as she described the difficulty of being a new mother and dealing with incessant scrutiny.
Harry also admitted to disagreements with William, who is second-in-line to the throne.
THE FUTURE
Harry and Meghan did not spell out what they were planning or where in North America they might live.
Last year it was reported that Harry would be executive producer of a documentary on mental health with U.S. television mogul Oprah Winfrey for Apple's video streaming service.
They said splitting time between Britain and North America ""would enable us to raise our son with an appreciation for the royal tradition into which he was born, while also providing our family with the space to focus on the next chapter.""
Harry and William received more than 5 million pounds from their father, Prince Charles, last year and it was not immediately clear how Harry and Meghan would achieve financial independence.
Royal biographer Penny Junor said it was possible Meghan, who starred in TV legal drama ""Suits"", might revive her acting career given the demand and fees she could command.
""Perhaps she'd have to be careful about what roles she'd do because she is a member of the royal family,"" Junor said.

Last year was one of the hardest of Elizabeth's record-breaking 67-year reign, culminating in her second son Andrew stepping down from royal duties over his association with the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's ruling Socialist Party hopes legislators it recently declared to be in charge of congress will approve changes to ownership of some crucial state oil assets, five opposition lawmakers said on Wednesday.
Pro-government legislators on Sunday declared little-known politician Luis Parra as the head of congress after troops blocked opposition lawmakers from backing Juan Guaido for a second term. The defiant legislators responded by proclaiming the session null and re-elected him anyway.
Maduro wants the Socialist-backed legislators to make legal new investments by oil companies from allied countries, such as Russia, who have seen the opposition-run congress as a liability to cutting new deals.
The shift would allow for a scheme in which investors holding Venezuela's defaulted bonds would be able to swap them for ownership stakes in the fields and recoup the debt they are owed by producing oil, said Angel Alvarado, who sits on the opposition-held National Assembly's finance commission.
Bondholders who participate in such a swap could risk running afoul of U.S. sanctions, which broadly prohibit financial deals with the Venezuelan government.
Venezuelan law requires that the National Assembly must approve any changes to the ownership structure of the OPEC nation's joint ventures with private companies. The opposition, which holds a majority, opposes economic reforms that could help President Nicolas Maduro hold onto power.
""Parra was put there to try to approve these oil deals,"" said Jose Guerra, who also sits on the finance commission.
Russia is the only county that has backed Parra. The United States, European Union, and most Latin American countries still recognize Guaido as head of parliament.
That has led lawmakers to believe Russia, whose state oil company Rosneft is among the largest investors in Venezuela's oil sector, could benefit from the new deals.
""These deals need National Assembly approval, and that's why Russia's move is suspicious,"" Alvarado told reporters.
""Russia could increase its stakes in the fields,"" he added, without providing evidence for the claim.
A spokesman for Parra did not respond to a request for comment.
None of the lawmakers specified which joint ventures could change ownership. Luis Stefanelli of the energy commission said Maduro was seeking new investors for fields producing well below capacity as crude production plummets due to a brain drain, underinvestment, and U.S. sanctions.
A fifth opposition lawmaker said Maduro's main motivation was to get approval to hold early parliamentary elections and win back congress for the socialists. A financial industry source said it was unlikely major bondholders would participate in such a scheme.
Neither Venezuela's information ministry nor PDVSA responded to requests for comment."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dozens of potential jurors were excused on Wednesday from serving in the rape trial of Harvey Weinstein, including two women who said they had been assaulted in the past and one who said a close friend had an encounter with the movie producer.
In all, 50 of 120 potential jurors called on the second day of jury selection were dismissed by noon, most after saying they could not be impartial in the case.
""I read every article and it's gonna be very hard (to be impartial) for someone who's been assaulted multiple times,"" one woman said.
""I was assaulted in my past, so I don’t think I can be a fair juror,"" another said. 
A third woman said she had ""a very close friend who had an encounter with the defendant.""
Many other jurors simply said they could not be fair, without giving a reason.
Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assaulting two women in New York. He faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault.
Trial began on Monday and could last as long as two months.
Earlier on Wednesday, Weinstein's lawyers asked to bar high-profile lawyer Gloria Allred from attending the trial, saying they might call her as a witness, but Justice James Burke denied the request. Allred represents three of the women who are expected to testify against Weinstein.
""Harvey Weinstein's defense appeared to want to interfere with my ability to represent my three clients who will be witnesses in his trial,"" Allred told reporters outside the courthouse.
Since 2017, more than 80 women, including many famous actresses, have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct dating back decades. 
The Weinstein allegations helped fuel the #MeToo movement which encouraged women to go public with misconduct allegations against powerful men. 
Weinstein has denied the allegations, saying any sexual encounters he had were consensual.
The former film producer made his mark with critically acclaimed films such as ""The English Patient"" and ""Shakespeare in Love."" 
Burke has denied requests by Weinstein's legal team to move the trial out of the media glare of Manhattan or to delay the start given the challenges of finding impartial jurors. 
On Monday, Los Angeles District Attorney Jackie Lacey announced charges against Weinstein of sexual assault of two unidentified women in 2013. 
Burke said the jury would be instructed that the charges in California are not evidence of guilt.
Prosecutors need 12 jurors to back a conviction, while Weinstein needs just one holdout for a hung jury.

1150,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 02:37PM ET</span>",U.S.-Iran distrust looms over Tehran air crash investigation,"By Tim Hepher
PARIS (Reuters) - The crash of a U.S.-built airliner in Iran with the loss of 176 lives looks set to strain fragile international protocols on co-operation in air disaster investigations at a time when the United States and Iran are mired in confrontation.
The relatively new Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737-800NG jet flown by Ukraine International Airlines burst into flames shortly after take-off from Tehran and crashed on Wednesday.
The results of an investigation and even the way it is set up and coordinated could inflame political differences as mystery surrounds the jet's sudden nosedive, analysts said.
Iran and the United States are co-signatories of the basic global agreement on modern aviation 75 years ago and sit together at the United Nations' aviation agency, widely seen as an effective watchdog while serving in the past as a back-channel for Cold War adversaries. https://reut.rs/2s4FFSc
The 1944 Chicago Convention gave rise to strict rules about how air accidents should be investigated, marking a blueprint for co-operation that has largely stood the test of time even as member countries shunned other types of diplomatic cooperation.
Under those rules, Iran's AAIB air accident board automatically leads what could be a year-long probe into flight 572, designed to help avoid future accidents.
As the country where the jet was designed and built, the United States has a right to be accredited to the investigation and would normally appoint Boeing as its own technical adviser.
But the crash, coming shortly after Iran retaliated against a deadly U.S. drone strike against once of its top officials last Friday, immediately triggered fresh signs of distrust.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States was prepared to offer Ukraine assistance and called for complete cooperation with ""any investigation"" into cause of the crash. He did not mention any role for Iran.
Iran said earlier it would not send black boxes from the crashed jet to Boeing - a step that would in any case be unusual, according to former investigators, but which appeared intended to snub any U.S. involvement.
""Iranians will wonder if involving the United States means they get fair result,"" said Paul Hayes, safety director at aviation consultancy Ascend by Cirium.
The United States will on the other hand not want the probe to be hijacked by what it sees as political aims, others said.
Aviation experts say Iran, hardened by a high accident rate that the country's leadership blames on years of sanctions, has the technical capability to read the two flight recorders.
But it may need foreign help if the finger nail-sized circuit boards containing pilot voice recordings and up to 2,000 parameters of data are badly damaged inside their ""crash survivable"" steel or titanium casings. https://reut.rs/2R1Kx2U
""Iran has decent investigative capabilities. They produce solid accident investigative reports,"" Hayes said.
COOPERATION
Black boxes from crashed jets are sometimes sent directly to Boeing's suppliers - U.S.-based Honeywell (NYSE:HON) or L3 - whenever they are too damaged to be examined properly. That would normally be carried out in coordination with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board.
Iran could ask another country, possibly France or Russia, to help analyze the data if needed, Hayes said. With 62 of its nationals on board the crashed jet, Canada, which has advanced technical capabilities, could also play a key role, he added.
Previous Iranian accident reports, some of which are critical of domestic operators, have shown evidence of technical cooperation between Iran and the U.S. But there has been little if any contact since Washington exited a nuclear deal in 2018.
In 2015, Iran's AAIB asked the NTSB to produce a report on what it regarded as the harmful impact of sanctions on Iran's air safety. The NTSB responded this was beyond its mission.
It is not the first time countries have squabbled over sensitive investigations as economic influence in aviation shifts steadily eastwards, where travel demand is strongest.
In March last year, Ethiopia and the NTSB clashed over the crash of a different type of Boeing 737, the MAX, which remains grounded. https://reut.rs/2tI6mMU. France's BEA has aired differences in the past with Egypt over Airbus accidents.
The latest standoff comes at a time when the U.N. protocols - nicknamed Annex 13 - are struggling to adapt to the demands of social media and the increasing tendency of parties to give their own conclusions in public.
Boeing itself has been criticized for veiled criticism of Indonesian pilots in an earlier 737 MAX crash in 2018.
Ukraine's embassy in Tehran blamed engine failure for Wednesday's crash in Iran, only to retract quickly. Engine maker CFM urged restraint, calling such speculation ""premature""."
1151,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 02:13PM ET</span>","Airlines face higher fuel bills as they avoid Iran, Iraq amid tensions","(Reuters) - Airlines are facing higher fuel bills as they reroute flights to avoid airspace over Iran and Iraq due to recent heightened tension between Washington and Tehran, adding further financial pressure to an industry already contending with the prolonged grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX jets.
Germany's Lufthansa AG (DE:LHAG), Air France-KLM SA (PA:AIRF), Singapore Airlines Ltd (SI:SIAL) and Malaysia Airlines have redirected flights from airspace in the region after Iranian forces fired missiles at military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq. A Ukraine jetliner also crashed in Tehran, although the cause is not yet known. 
""Avoiding Iraqi/Iranian air space is a double headache for airlines,” independent aviation consultant John Strickland said by email, noting longer journey times that would throw off schedules and add to operating costs.
Mark Zee, founder of OPSGROUP, which monitors global aerospace for risks that it shares with industry members, said rerouting to avoid Iranian and Iraqi airspace could add around 40 minutes to trips from Europe to Asia.
Australia's Qantas Airways (AX:QAN) said such a detour would add 50 minutes to its Perth to London flight time, forcing it to reduce passenger numbers – and therefore revenue – in order to carry more jet fuel.
Virgin Atlantic also said its flight times to and from Mumbai would be “slightly longer than expected.”
Based on data from Flightradar24 and feedback from airline members, Zee said carriers are largely redirecting flights over parts of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has barred U.S. carriers from airspace over Iran, the Gulf of Oman and the waters between Iran and Saudi Arabia, citing “heightened military activities and increased political tensions in the Middle East."" 
Tensions in the region surged after a U.S. drone strike killed a top Iranian military commander in Iraq last week, compounding industry challenges at a time when carriers are already reeling from stiff competition, increased regulations and fallout from the 737 MAX fleet's global grounding. 
In a piece of good news for the industry, oil futures fell nearly 4% on Wednesday, retreating from an earlier four-month high, on a de-escalation of rhetoric from Washington and Tehran, and a realization that Iran's rocket attack did not damage oil facilities.
In December, global airlines reduced their forecast for industry-wide profits in 2019 under the weight of trade tensions, but were expecting a rebound in 2020. 

Etihad Airlines, Qatar Airways and Emirates Airline [EMIRA.UL] are still using the airspace, which remains open. ""The Gulf carriers in total will have a headache, as they need to pass Iran to get to Europe,"" Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said, adding that airlines flying from India to Europe would also suffer.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 08, 2020 02:01PM ET</span>",Explainer: Stripping Italy's Atlantia of motorway concession may not be easy,"MILAN (Reuters) - Leading members of Italy's ruling 5-Star Movement have called for Atlantia's motorways unit to be stripped of its concession following the deadly 2018 collapse of a bridge it operated in the northern city of Genoa.
The collapse of the Morandi bridge, which killed 43 people and laid bare the dire state of Italy's crumbling infrastructure, drew accusations of deliberate cover-ups by Atlantia, which is controlled by the Benettons, one of Italy's richest families.
The anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, has accused the Benettons of putting profits before safety and pushed for measures to make it easier and cheaper for the government to terminate the contract.
But removing the concession will not be straightforward and 5 Star's demands have caused strains with its coalition partners, the center-left Democratic Party (PD) and the smaller centrist Italia Viva group.
They warn that cancelling the concession operated by Atlantia's Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI) would cost billions of euros in compensation and undermine Italy's credibility with international investors.
COMPENSATION
ASPI is Italy's largest motorway operator, managing around 3,000 km of highway. Any move to cancel its concession could trigger a prolonged legal battle, with the company arguing that changing the contract retroactively would be unconstitutional.
The government recently passed measures that would cut the likely compensation in the event of a contract revocation from 15-20 billion euros ($16.7-22.3 billion) to some 8 billion euros. But even the reduced figure would pressure Italy's badly strained public finances.
ASPI, which accounts for a third of Atlantia's core earnings and employs 7,000 workers in Italy, says it could also face bankruptcy, forcing the government to take over the concession and potentially billions of euros in debt.
ASPI has around 9.5 billion euros of debt that it would be unable to repay without the concession. The debt is partly guaranteed by Atlantia, which has 5.7 billion euros of its own debt that could also be threatened if ASPI went under.
A part of ASPI's outstanding bonds worth around 4 billion euros, according to analysts' calculations, is also covered with a put option that would allow bondholders to seek early repayment in case of revocation of the motorway concession.
Bondholders include the European Investment Bank, Italy's state-owned Cassa Depositi e Prestiti and the country's two biggest banks UniCredit and  Intesa Sanpaolo  (MI:ISP).
EXPOSURE
Appia Investments Srl -- an investment vehicle owned by Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG), France's EDF (PA:EDF) Invest and fund management company DIF Capital Partners -- holds a stake of around 7% in ASPI. China's Silk Road Fund, which has 5%, would also be hit.
In addition, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC holds 8% of Atlantia."

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Puerto Rico's power grid crept back to service on Wednesday after it was shut down entirely as a safety measure on Tuesday amid a storm of earthquakes including the most powerful to strike the Caribbean island in 102 years.
The temblors including one of magnitude 6.4 killed at least one person and flattened homes across the southern coast, provoking a state of emergency on the island of 3 million people and the activation of the National Guard.
Nearly 500,000 of the island's 1.5 million customers had service on Wednesday morning, up from 100,000 the night before, and the island was generating about 542 megawatts of electricity, the power authority AEE said, still short of the demand of some 2,000 megawatts.
The large Costa Sur plant suffered severe damage and remained out of service, though Governor Wanda Vazquez said on Tuesday power should be restored to most of the island within 48 hours provided there were no more earthquakes.
Puerto Ricans endured lengthy power outages in 2017 following devastating Hurricane Maria, one of a series of natural and man-made disasters to afflict the U.S. territory in recent years. The island is also going through bankruptcy and its former governor resigned amid a political scandal and massive street protests last year.
Vazquez ordered schools and other public offices closed while emergency responders searched crumpled buildings for possible victims and engineers inspected others for safety.
Some Puerto Ricans in the hard-hit south of the island moved beds outside on Tuesday night and slept outdoors, fearful their homes would crumble if another earthquake hit, Vazquez said.
Hundreds of quakes have touched the island, including 10 of magnitude 4 or greater, since Dec. 28, the U.S. Geological Survey said. 
Around 750 people spent the night in shelters in southern towns hit hardest, the government reported. 
Bottled water, batteries and flashlights ran low at supermarkets in the capital San Juan and long lines formed outside gas stations. Backup generators kept the city's international airport functioning. 
Puerto Ricans are used to dealing with hurricanes but powerful quakes are rare. 
""There's a lot of uncertainty, this is the first time this has happened to us,"" said Patricia Alonso, 48, who lost power and water at her home and headed to her mother's apartment building with her 13-year-old son as it had a generator.

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) said on Tuesday that aid had been made available for earthquake response efforts.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday imposed sanctions on South Sudanese First Vice President Taban Deng Gai, the U.S. Treasury Department said in a statement, in Washington's latest move to pressure the country's politicians to form a unity government.
The Treasury Department said Gai arranged and directed the alleged killings of opposition politician Aggrey Idri Ezibon and human rights lawyer Dong Samuel Luak in a move to solidify his position in the government and intimidate members of the opposition.
South Sudan's presidential spokesman Ateny Wek Ateny, told Reuters after the sanctions were announced that Washington's move will worsen the situation in the country. 
Gai ""is very helpful in the implementation of the peace and...he should be encouraged,"" the spokesman said, adding that there was no evidence that any government officials were involved in the killings cited by Treasury.
Gai, former governor of an oil-rich region in South Sudan, has long been a powerful government figure in the country with close ties to President Salva Kiir.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a statement calling on the government and opposition leaders to create distance from those who spoil the peace process. He said Gai, on behalf of Kiir, acted to ""divide and sow distrust, extend the conflict in South Sudan, and impede the reconciliation and peace process."" 
Gai could not immediately be reached for comment.
He is the latest South Sudanese official to be sanctioned by Washington. Last month, the United States blacklisted two South Sudanese cabinet ministers, days after slapping sanctions on five lower level officials it says are responsible for the likely murder of the two human rights activists in 2017.
The sanctions, implemented under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act that targets perpetrators of serious human rights abuses and corruption, freeze any of Gai's U.S. assets and generally prohibit Americans from doing business with him.
""Taban Deng Gai's attempt to silence the opposition party is derailing the country's ability to implement a peace agreement,"" said Treasury Deputy Secretary Justin Muzinich in the statement.
Kiir and opposition leader Riek Machar signed a peace deal in 2018 to form the unity government by Nov. 12. But days before the deadline, the two leaders gave themselves an extension of 100 days to implement the agreement, a move criticized by Washington.
In November, the United States recalled its ambassador from South Sudan and said it was re-evaluating its relationship with the African country's government.

Civil war broke out in oil-producing South Sudan in 2013, less than two years after the country gained independence from Sudan following decades of war. The conflict has killed an estimated 400,000 people and forced millions from their homes.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United States did not necessarily have to use its military power against Iran, in an apparent attempt to defuse a crisis over the American killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.
In an address from the White House, Trump said no Americans were harmed in Iranian missile attacks on military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq and suggested Washington might not carry out immediate retaliation.

""Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world,"" he said.
Trump stopped short of making any direct threat of military action against Iran but said the United States ""will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime"" in response to what he called ""Iranian aggression.""
He offered no specific measures.
Iranian forces fired missiles at military bases housing U.S. troops in Iraq on Wednesday in retaliation for the killing of Iranian general Soleimani, raising the stakes in its conflict with Washington amid concern about a wider war in the Middle East.
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, addressing a gathering of Iranians chanting ""Death to America"", said the attacks were a ""slap on the face"" of the United States and said U.S. troops should leave the region.
Iran's foreign minister said Tehran took ""proportionate measures"" in self-defense and did not seek to escalate the confrontation.
Trump again vowed that he would not allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon and urged world powers including Russia and China to abandon the 2015 nuclear accord with Iran and work toward a new agreement.
""We must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer and more peaceful place,"" he said."

The National Congress Party's (NCP) assets were seized under a law that was passed in November and ordered the party's dissolution.
The law's implementation is widely seen as a test of how far Sudan's transitional authorities are willing or able to go to dismantle the system built up by Bashir, who was ousted in April after nearly three decades in power.
The assets of four private television channels and newspapers have been frozen but they have the right to appeal, said Mohamed al-Faki, a sovereign council member who is also deputy head of a legal committee assessing the NCP's assets.
""These institutions were financed by state funds and we want to return the money to the Sudanese people,"" he told a news conference late on Tuesday.
The editor of Al-Sudani newspaper, one of the media outlets that had its assets frozen, denied the accusations
""We didn't receive funds from anybody. They are targeting the newspaper and press freedom,"" the editor, Diaeldin Belal, said.
The ministry of finance has also taken over the al-Quran al-Kareem Society, a religious charity organization which Taha Othman, a member of the sovereign council legal committee, said had links to Bashir's former government.

Rwanda, from where more than 2 million people were displaced amid genocide in 1994, signed a deal with the United Nations in September that is meant to help resettle people detained in Libya while trying to reach Europe.
The migrants evacuated to Rwanda have been given asylum-seeker status there while the U.N refugee agency determines whether they are refugees.
“Norway accepted to receive close to 500 people and Sweden took in seven last month. Others are still waiting,” Foreign Minister Vincent Biruta told a news conference in the capital Kigali.
The Norwegian foreign ministry referred queries to the justice ministry, which was not immediately able to comment.
European authorities have been trying to close the route across the Mediterranean that has seen thousands of people die at sea while trying to reach Europe in recent years.
Last year, before the deal was signed, the United Nations estimated that around 4,700 people seeking refuge were estimated to be in Libyan detention centers, some of them run by militias and under siege amid civil war.
People smugglers have exploited the turmoil in Libya since 2011 to send hundreds of thousands of migrants on dangerous journeys across the central Mediterranean, though the number of crossings dropped sharply from 2017 amid an EU-backed push to block departures."

The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said on Wednesday the Iranians were thought to have targeted the attacks to miss U.S. forces to prevent the crisis from escalating out of control while still signaling Iranian resolve in response to the U.S. killing of Iranian commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq last week.
A source in Washington said overnight that early indications were that there were no U.S. casualties following the strikes on the al-Asad air base and another facility in Erbil. Other U.S. officials declined comment.
Iran was believed to have tried to hit certain parts of the bases to minimize casualties and especially to avoid U.S. fatalities, three sources said. This assessment included some intelligence from inside Iran confirming the nature of the attack plan, they said.
“They wanted to respond but almost certainly not to escalate,” one of the U.S. sources said.
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said Tehran took ""proportionate measures"" in self-defense and did not seek war with the United States.

ISTANBUL/BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Turkey and Russia urged Libya's warring parties on Wednesday to declare a Jan. 12 ceasefire as eastern forces carried out air strikes on the government in a conflict drawing increasing foreign involvement and concern.
Turkey backs Fayez al-Serraj's Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) and has said it will send troops as requested, while Russia has sent forces to back General Khalifa Haftar's eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA).
However, after talks between their presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin in Istanbul, Turkey and Russia issued a joint statement calling for the end of hostilities, normalization of life in Tripoli and other cities, and U.N.-sponsored peace talks.
The conflict is undermining regional security and ""triggering irregular migration, further spread of weapons, terrorism and other criminal activities including illicit trafficking,"" the statement said.
Haftar's LNA took control of Sirte, a strategically important city in the centre of Libya's Mediterranean coastline, in a rapid advance on Monday and is seeking to consolidate gains.
Since April, the LNA has also been waging a campaign to take the capital, Tripoli, about 370 km (230 miles) northwest of Sirte, where it is battling forces aligned with the GNA.
GNA forces said they withdrew from Sirte to avoid bloodshed.
Those forces are mainly from the port of Misrata, 190 km east of Tripoli, and had controlled Sirte since driving Islamic State militants from the city in late 2016.
On Tuesday afternoon, clashes broke out around al-Washka, on the road between Sirte and Misrata, where LNA sources said nine of their men were killed in an evening drone strike.
On Wednesday, the LNA responded with strikes near the Abu Grein checkpoint, close to al-Washka, where clashes were continuing, LNA military officials said. 
Libya has been divided since 2014 into rival camps based in Tripoli and the east, each with its own set of institutions, and Haftar's offensive against Tripoli upended U.N. efforts to broker a political settlement. 
The upheaval in Libya, where strongman Muammar Gaddafi's long rule was toppled in 2011, has in recent years disrupted the OPEC member's oil production, fueled migrant smuggling to Europe, and given space to Islamist extremists. 
Regional powers have stepped up intervention, with the LNA also receiving support from the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Egypt. 
The European Union's top diplomat and the foreign ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy this week condemned Turkey's plans to send military experts and trainers to Libya, saying interference was exacerbating instability. 

Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte held talks with Haftar in Rome on Wednesday and was due to see Serraj later in the day, an Italian government source said.

Tebboune was elected last month to replace veteran leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was forced to step down in April amid massive protests that have persisted since then, demanding a total change of the power structure.
The protesters opposed the election, arguing that any vote held while the old elite still held power was illegitimate, and tens of thousands still demonstrating each week have rejected his offer of dialogue.
Tebboune's office said in a statement that the 17 people on the new constitutional committee would have three months to submit proposals for discussion which could then be sent to parliament and finally put to voters in a referendum.
The panel is led by Ahmed Laraba, a member of the United Nations International Law Commission. It has a mandate to look at all aspects of state organization and reconsider the role of parliament and the judiciary to promote the rights of citizens.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. congressional study released on Wednesday called for sanctions against China over human rights abuses, and for U.S. officials to keep rights concerns in mind in dealings with Beijing, including trade negotiations.
The annual human rights report from the Congressional-Executive Commission on China said that human rights and rule of law conditions worsened in China from August 2018 to August 2019, the period covered by the report.
The report focused extensively on treatment of minority Muslim Uighur population in Xinjiang, ""where the Commission believes Chinese authorities may be committing crimes against humanity,"" the report said.
""In addition, the Administration should develop talking points for U.S. Government officials - including those engaged in trade negotiations - that consistently link freedoms of press, speech, and association to U.S. and Chinese interests,"" the report said.
The Commission is led by Democratic Representative Jim McGovern and Republican Senator Marco Rubio.
The report was only the latest salvo from Washington over China's human rights record, particularly the treatment of Uighur Muslims in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, where at least a million people have been detained in what is seen as a grave abuse of human rights and religious freedom. China rejects the charges.
Legislation to address the situation has stalled in Congress, amid Trump administration trade talks with China.
In Xinjiang, the report said, the Chinese government also has used facial recognition cameras and mobile telephone monitoring systems to create what has been called an ""open-air prison.""
""U.S. foreign policy must prioritize the promotion of universal human rights and the rule of law in China, not only to respect and protect the basic dignity of the people of China, but to better promote security and prosperity for all of humanity,"" the report said.
To address abuses, the report recommended a range of actions, including tightening access to U.S. capital markets for Chinese companies that have provided support or technical capabilities to repression in Xinjiang.
It also recommends imposing human rights sanctions against Chinese businesses and officials involved in the mass internment and surveillance of Uighurs.
And it recommended controlling sales of facial recognition systems, machine learning and biometric technology by placing Xinjiang government and security agencies on the U.S. Department of Commerce's ""Entity List"", which would prevent them from buying from U.S. suppliers.
It recommended that Congress pass legislation putting export controls and limits on U.S. government purchasing from China, to allow a ""more robust"" reaction to Beijing's actions in Xinjiang."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis, who last month angrily slapped the hand of a woman who yanked him toward her, gave a light-hearted reaction more typical of his papacy on Wednesday when a nun asked him for a kiss. He said yes, although only after she promised not to bite him.
The good-natured exchange took place at the start of Francis' weekly general audience. As he was walking into the large hall where thousands of people were waiting, an excited nun asked if he would kiss her, shouting in Italian ""Bacio, Papa!"" (A kiss, pope!)
Francis responded: ""Oh, (but) you bite!"", prompting laughter from the people near them.
Then Francis joked: ""Stay calm! I will give you a kiss but you stay calm. Don't bite!""
The diminutive nun promised, saying ""Si"" (Yes). He then kissed her on the right cheek, leaving her even more ecstatic than before. She jumped up and down shouted ""Grazie, Papa"". (Thank you, Pope).
On New Year's Eve, Francis, 83, angrily slapped a woman’s hand after she hold of him and forcefully yanked him toward her in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ).
The video of that incident went viral on social media and the next day Francis apologized, saying he had set a “bad example”.
Francis, unlike some of his predecessors, is usually very informal with well wishers at such non-religious events, stopping to kiss babies, bless the handicapped, and allowing hundreds of people to touch his hand.
But he frowns on allowing people to kiss his hand at large events, saying he does not want that gesture of reverence to spread germs.
Last month's slapping incident was an exceptional one. It was similar to another several years ago when Francis chastised an over-exuberant woman who had pulled him so hard he nearly fell onto a person in a wheelchair."

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that Washington's backing for Israel's settlements in the occupied West Bank will advance Israeli-Palestinian peace, angering Palestinian leaders who seek the territory for a state.
In a reversal of four decades of U.S. policy, Pompeo in November announced that the United States no longer viewed Israel's settlements on West Bank land it captured in the 1967 Middle East war as ""inconsistent with international law"".
Palestinians and the international community view the transfer of any country's civilians to occupied land as illegal under the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 and U.N. Security Council resolutions. Many countries condemned the announcement.
But the move delighted Israel and provides important U.S. support amid a potential International Criminal Court (ICC) inquiry into alleged war crimes in Palestinian areas, including the West Bank.
Speaking by video link at a Jerusalem policy forum dubbed ""The Pompeo Doctrine"", Pompeo, in a pre-recorded statement, said the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump returned to a ""balanced and sober"" approach to Middle East peace by changing its position.
""It's important that we speak the truth when the facts lead us to it. And we are recognizing that these settlements don't inherently violate international law,"" Pompeo said.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that the Trump administration's backing was a ""proper answer to the decision by the ICC in the Hague to investigate Israel's actions in Judea and Samaria"", referring to the West Bank.
Last month, the ICC's chief prosecutor said she would launch a full investigation in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip as soon as the Hague-based body's jurisdiction had been established.
The prosecutor's announcement opened the possibility of charges being filed against Israelis and Palestinians.
""The 'Pompeo doctrine' regarding the status of the settlements simply states that we are not foreigners in our homeland,"" Netanyahu told the conference, hosted by the Kohelet Policy Forum, a Jerusalem think-tank.
The conference sought to build upon the new U.S. stance by laying out legal arguments in defense of Israel's settlements and debating critics' defense.
Around 430,000 settlers live amongst some 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, where the Palestinians seek to set up a state along with the Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem.
""Israeli colonial settlements are illegal under international law ... ignoring facts (doesn't) mean they don't exist,"" chief Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said.
Erekat added that U.S. policy was pushing ""the region further toward bloodshed and violence"".
The Palestinians have boycotted the Trump administration and its peace efforts, including its long-delayed peace plan, accusing Washington of pro-Israel bias since it recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017 and later moved its embassy there."

The confrontation began in mid-December when a Chinese coast guard vessel and fishing boats, entered waters in Indonesia's exclusive economic zone, off the coast of the northern Natuna islands, prompting Jakarta to summon Beijing's ambassador.
Widodo told reporters on Natuna Besar island that the disputed waters belong solely to Indonesia.
""We have a district here, a regent, and a governor here,"" he said. ""There are no more debates. De facto, de jure, Natuna is Indonesia.""
Widodo also met with fishermen on the island. Earlier this week, Indonesia deployed more ships and fighter jets to patrol the surrounding waters. Nursyawal Embun, the director of sea operations at the Maritime Security Agency, said as of Wednesday morning that two Chinese coast guard vessels remained, while 10 Indonesian ships were on patrol.
China has not claimed the Natuna islands themselves, but says it has nearby fishing rights within a self-proclaimed Nine-Dash Line that includes most of the South China Sea - a claim that is not recognized internationally.
In 2017, Indonesia renamed the northern reaches of its exclusive economic zone in the South China Sea as the North Natuna Sea, as part of a push back against China's maritime territorial ambitions.
The dispute has soured Indonesia's generally friendly relationship with China, its biggest trading partner and a major investor in Southeast Asia's largest country.
In an interview with Reuters on Wednesday, Luhut Pandjaitan, coordinating minister for maritime resources and investment, said that both Beijing and Jakarta will forge ahead with diplomatic discussions.
""What's the point of war? Nothing. Wars are the last step to a failing diplomatic process,"" Pandjaitan said.
China claims most of the South China Sea, a global trade route with rich fishing grounds and energy reserves, based on what it says is its historic activity. But Southeast Asian countries, supported by the United States and much of the rest of the world, say such claims have no legal basis.
On Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing and Jakarta are in contact through diplomatic channels. ""We wish to, with Indonesia, continue to appropriately deal with differences and uphold peace and stability in bilateral relations and the region,"" Geng said.
The last peak in tensions between Indonesia and China over the South China Sea was in 2016. At the time, Widodo held a meeting with several of his ministers on board a naval ship in a show of support.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - When protesters took over the campus of Hong Kong Polytechnic University in November, many felt compelled to make a statement. Sometimes it was personal. I felt it, too.
As I sat on a bridge overlooking campus, I sent a WhatsApp message to my closest friend. I had already told her I was on the campus reporting. This time I typed out another message, saying that as a Hong Konger born and raised, I felt reporting was the only thing I could do for my city.
The campus was encircled by thousands of police, blocking off escape routes. Inside, hundreds of protesters were preparing to fight with improvised weapons, including arrows and petrol bombs.
I stayed put. A police crackdown seemed imminent.
I followed a group of protesters as they attempted to block one of the back routes to the campus to prevent police from storming in. As I ran after the black-clad protesters carrying metal pipes and umbrellas, I passed a library with black graffiti sprayed across its bulletin board.
“Why have universities become battlegrounds?” it read.
I had aspirations of becoming a war correspondent one day, but I never imagined that my hometown would become a conflict zone.
I had already spent almost half a year covering near daily protests and sometimes violent clashes between police and pro-democracy demonstrators for Reuters. I had seen and felt the anger, desperation and fear of the protesters of my generation, people in college, people graduating to an uncertain future.
Not knowing how long the siege would last, Reuters reporters and others converted an empty classroom into a makeshift newsroom. We projected live feeds on a whiteboard to monitor attempts by protesters outside to rescue the students and the encroaching police circling the campus.
As it became clear they were trapped and police would wait them out, protesters tried different ways to flee. Everyone understood they could face prosecution and prison if arrested.
Some abseiled down a bridge, jumping down to getaway motorcycles on the highway. The police began firing tear gas toward the bridge and arrested some escapees.
THROUGH THE SEWERS
There was Ethan, who, like many others, asked to be only identified by his first name. Ethan studied blueprints of the Hong Kong sewer system he found online to engineer an escape for his friends trapped inside campus. He went down the sewers from outside, and waded through raw sludge for half an hour to lead his friends back out the way he had come.
There was Bowie, who had tried to escape on her own through the sewers, crawling for an hour in the dark labyrinth under campus, cutting and bruising herself. She finally found an exit, only to realize that she was still trapped inside. She was carried away in an ambulance.
As the protesters argued about whether they should leave, a teenage protester walked up to me and asked me for a pen and paper.
“I want to write down that I don’t have any severe injuries before leaving the campus,” he said, voicing a fear common among protesters that they could be injured during arrest and detention.
I gave him my pen. I apologized I had no paper with me.
On the morning of Nov 19, after two days inside the campus, I was taking a walk when I came across a rainbow formed when the morning light hit water dripping from a hydrant opened by protesters. It was a rare moment of grace, near the bridge where protesters had earlier fled by night.
Soon, the campus began to feel deserted. The stench of rotting food was everywhere.  Conversations became terse and infrequent. Fears of undercover cops spread. Some protesters isolated themselves.
After five days and four nights, I left, swapping out places through the police lines with another Reuters reporter. The siege continued for another week.
Afterwards, the police said they had arrested 1,377 people, 318 of them under 18.
Police fired 1,458 tear gas rounds, 1,391 rubber bullets, 325 bean bag rounds and 265 sponge rounds.
Nearly 4,000 petrol bombs, 1,338 explosives, 601 corrosive liquids and 573 weapons were seized.
The campus will resume classes on January 13, officials said."

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - Islamist militant group al Shabaab said it was responsible for a bomb blast on Wednesday near the presidential palace and other government buildings in Somalia's capital Mogadishu that city authorities said had killed three people. 
The attack appeared to be part of an intensified campaign over the past two weeks by the al Qaeda ally in Somalia and neighboring Kenya, which have porous borders and often ad hoc methods for sharing intelligence. 
Three people were killed in Wednesday's blast, Saleh Hassan Omar, spokesman for the city's mayor, said in a statement. The bombing hit Sayidka junction, a security checkpoint near the palace, the interior ministry and parliament.
Aamin ambulance service head Abdikadir Abdirahman told Reuters that 11 people were wounded, including three women.
Al Shabaab issued a statement claiming responsibility for the bombing and saying the attack showed that the government has not fully secured ""Mogadishu's major arteries"". 
On Sunday, three Americans -- one U.S. military service member and two contractors -- were killed by Al Shabaab during an attack on a military base in Kenya near the Somali border. The base is used by both U.S. and Kenyan forces. 
On Dec. 28, a truck bombing claimed by al Shabaab at a busy checkpoint in Mogadishu killed at least 90 people, in the deadliest such attack in the country in more than two years.
The group regularly carries out attacks aimed at undermining Somalia's government, which it has been fighting to overthrow for more than a decade. 
Last year, 21 people died during an al Shabaab assault on a hotel complex in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, which in 2011 sent troops into Somalia after a spate of cross-border attacks and kidnappings.
Security analysts say that a spate of recent attacks in Mogadishu have hit unusually sensitive locations, showing the group's continued ability to mount sophisticated attacks. 
In September, it also targeted a base where U.S. special forces train Somali commandos, though no one was killed.
The group has also launched three deadly attacks in Kenya in the last week, in different areas near the border with Somalia. The latest was on Tuesday, when four Kenyan school children were killed in a gunfight between militants and police.

Lebanon has been without a functioning government since Saad al-Hariri quit as prime minister in October, prompted by protests against the political elite over rampant state corruption, and is mired in a deep economic crisis.
Tensions in the Middle East have escalated dramatically since a U.S. drone strike last week killed Iranian Major General Qassem Soleimani, the architect of Iran's military strategy in the region, where Tehran's allies include the powerful Lebanese group Hezbollah. 
""Given the situation and developments in the country and the region it is increasingly irresponsible to keep Lebanon without an effective and credible government,"" U.N. Special Coordinator for Lebanon Jan Kubis said in a Twitter post. 
""I urge the leaders to move without any further delay.""
After weeks of squabbling, Hassan Diab, a former minister, was designated prime minister last month with the support of Hezbollah and its political allies including the Free Patriotic Movement founded by President Michel Aoun.
But he did not win the support of Hariri, who is aligned with Western and Gulf Arab states. Diab met Aoun on Tuesday evening and made no public statement after the meeting. 
Lebanon's deep financial and economic crisis has meanwhile raised concerns about its stability as a shortage of hard currency has led the Lebanese pound to slump and banks to impose tight controls on access to deposits and transfers abroad.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's launching of more than a dozen missiles at American-led forces in Iraq on Wednesday came after years of preparing for a confrontation with its superpower foe, whose forces are vastly larger and more advanced.
The Gulf country has more than 500,000 active-duty personnel, including 125,000 members of its elite Revolutionary Guards, according to a report last year by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. But international sanctions and restrictions on arms imports have made it hard for Iran to develop or buy more sophisticated weaponry.
To compensate for the imbalance, Iran has developed ""asymmetrical"" responses - ballistic missiles, deadly drones and a web of militia allies in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen, among other things - with the aim of being able to inflict pain while avoiding the traditional battlefield.
""From a conventional military perspective they would get absolutely hammered,"" said a British former military commander who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the matter. ""Their conventional military is very, very sparse and quite old and quite out of date. They've spent all their money on asymmetric attack capabilities. In that regard they're very well prepared.""
Until Wednesday, the strategy had deterred a direct conflict with the U.S. as tensions spiked since Washington quit a multi-lateral nuclear deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions.
Gulf rival Saudi Arabia recently witnessed the damage that missile and drone assaults can cause, after a strike on its oil facilities last year briefly halved production and knocked out 5% of global crude supply. Riyadh and Washington blamed Iran for the attack, a charge Tehran denied.
Iran has built the largest stockpile of ballistic missiles in the Middle East. Some are based on the older, widely used ""Scud"" designs, with a range of at least 750km (466 miles). Others, based on the North Korean No Dong, can reach up to 2,000km, within reach of Israel or southeast Europe, according to a U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) report last year.
The Revolutionary Guards fields a fleet of missile-armed speedboats and midget submarines it can deploy against U.S. military ships or commercial tankers to disrupt the flow of oil in Gulf waters, where Washington says Tehran attacked six tankers last year.
""If you look at ships, tanks, jet fighters, Iran looks very weak. But if you're looking at anti-ship missiles, ballistic missiles, UAVs and things like that then it looks a lot more capable,"" said Jeremy Binnie, Middle East and Africa editor for Jane's Defense Weekly.
Iran's fleet of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be used for surveillance or armed with explosives, according to military experts.
""Iran in the Persian Gulf doesn't really need to have big ships, not necessarily frigates and destroyers. Speedboats, gun boats, missile boats can do the job,"" said Hossein Aryan, a military analyst who served 18 years in Iran's navy before and after the 1979 Islamic revolution.
Major-General Qassem Soleimani, whose killing in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad last week sparked the Iranian retaliation on Wednesday, was the head of the Revolutionary Guards Quds Force. The group handled clandestine operations outside Iran, working closely with allied military forces and militias in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.
Iran's leaders have promised harsh reprisals over the death of Soleimani, who was a national hero to many Iranians but considered a dangerous villain by Western governments.
He was buried in Iran on Tuesday after tens of thousands mourned him in a ceremony led by Iran's supreme leader.
U.S. officials have said Soleimani was killed because intelligence indicated forces under his command planned attacks on U.S. targets in the region, although they have provided no evidence.
Democrats in the U.S. Congress and some of the party's presidential contenders warned that the escalating conflict could spark a wider war in the Middle East.
Lebanon's Hezbollah, along with a handful of the Iraqi militias closely allied with Iran, have already pledged to take revenge against American forces for Soleimani's death.
More than 5,000 U.S. troops are in Iraq along with other foreign forces as part of a coalition that has trained and supported Iraqi security forces against the threat of Islamic State militants.
American troops are also stationed at bases in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, which hosts Al-Udeid air base, the largest U.S. military facility in the region. Bahrain is headquarters of the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet."

YOKOHAMA, Japan (Reuters) - A Japanese man accused of stabbing 19 disabled people to death pleaded not guilty on Wednesday in a dramatic trial session interrupted when he seemed to put something in his mouth, struggled with court officials and lay on the floor writhing. 
Satoshi Uematsu, 29, a former care home worker accused of killing 19 disabled people and wounding 26 in a care center in 2016 - one of post-war Japan's worst mass killings - was removed from the court and did not return when the trial resumed.
Before the interruption, Uematsu's lawyer said Uematsu acknowledged details of the indictment were true, but he has a psychiatric disorder that led to diminished capacity at the time of the incident.
""Mr Uematsu had a psychiatric disability and, as a result, he was not mentally competent,"" said the lawyer.
A calm-looking Uematsu, wearing a navy blue suit, white shirt and tie, and with his hair in a long pony tail, bowed slightly as he entered the courtroom, Japanese media said.
Soon after, Uematsu suddenly made motions as if to put something in his mouth, Japanese media said. A Reuters witness saw him struggling with uniformed court officials, writhing on the floor as three of them held him down, before the hearing was abruptly adjourned for about an hour.
Once resumed, without Uematsu in attendance, one of his lawyers said his abuse of marijuana led to mental illness, adding: ""This has turned him into a different person. As a result, this incident took place.""
But a prosecutor told the court any potential sentence would have to take into consideration the brutality and scale of the crime, noting that Uematsu had stabbed many victims in the neck. 
""(Uematsu) had the capacity to tell good from bad, and capacity to control his conduct as well,"" she added. ""We will prove he was completely responsible for what he did.""
Family members of the victims watched from a screened off area of the courtroom. 
The July 2016 killings at the facility in Sagamihara, southwest of Tokyo, where Uematsu had once worked, shocked the country, as violent crime is rare due to strict gun control. 
Interest in the trial was intense, with nearly 2,000 people lining up in cold rain for 26 viewing seats, and broadcast trucks lined the streets in front of the courthouse. 
The violence also sparked debate about the need for change in a society where people with disabilities can still suffer stigma and shame, a situation highlighted by the fact that the families of most of those killed have not revealed their names.
One woman on Wednesday told NHK national broadcaster that Uematsu's trial prompted her to change her mind about concealing the name of her daughter, 19 when she was killed.
Photos showed the young woman, who was autistic and unable to speak, smiling shyly in a photo taken by her mother soon after she entered the care home, just months before she was killed.
""She loved music, she lived as energetically as she could,"" her mother wrote in the statement carried by NHK, saying she last saw her daughter two days before her death.

""Her name was Miho. I want that public as proof that she existed. I want people to know who she was.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged foreign tourists not to be deterred by deadly wildfires that have razed large swathes of the country and sent smoke palls as far as South America, even as authorities warned of revitalized blazes.
Morrison made the plea for international visitor support on Wednesday as he visited Kangaroo Island, a usually wildlife-rich tourist drawcard off Australia's south coast that has been hit twice in recent weeks by fierce fires.
""Australia is open, Australia is still a wonderful place to come and bring your family and enjoy your holidays,"" Morrison told reporters after meeting local tourism operators and farmers.
""Even here on Kangaroo Island, where a third of the island has obviously been decimated, two-thirds of it is open and ready for business,"" he said. ""It's important to keep the local economies vibrant at these times.""
Australia-wide, the cost of the fires is mounting daily. Shortly after Morrison spoke, officials confirmed another firefighter had died in a vehicle crash last Friday while on duty, bringing the national death toll to 26. 
GRAPHIC: A devastated east coast - https://graphics.reuters.com/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES-MAP/0100B4TW2NK/index.html 
In Victoria state, authorities urged people in fire-risk areas to consider evacuating on Thursday, ahead of a temperature spike on Friday that is expected to bring renewed danger.
""These fires remain dangerous, they remain dynamic, remain volatile, and the conditions we are going to see can give significant life to these fires,"" Victoria Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said.
Thousands of people have already been left homeless by the fires that have scorched through more than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres) of land - an area the size of South Korea. In rural areas, many towns were without power and telecommunications and some were running low on drinking water supplies, while smoke has blanketed cities including Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.
The bushfires crisis follows a three-year drought that experts have linked to climate change and that has left much of the country's bushland tinder-dry and vulnerable to fires.

Following are some highlights of what is happening in the Australian bushfires crisis:
* Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced an A$11 million relief package while visiting Kangaroo Island.
* The three major cities in Australia's southeast, Sydney, Melbourne and the capital Canberra, were all blanketed in thick smoke, putting them among the most polluted cities in the world.
* Sixty-seven firefighters from the United States and Canada landed in Australia on Wednesday, joining 40 of their compatriots already on the ground. Australian authorities have requested another 140 personnel, who are expected to arrive in the next two weeks.
* Ecologists at the University of Sydney on Wednesday doubled their estimate of the number of animals killed or injured in the fires to 1 billion.
* Community leaders asked people to donate money instead of food and clothing because small communities are being overwhelmed by goods that they do not need. Authorities warned people to check the bona fides of people collecting donations amid a growing number of online scams.
* Smoke from wildfires has drifted across the Pacific and affected cities in South America, and may have reached the Antarctic, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said.
* The fires have already emitted 400 megatonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and produced harmful pollutants, the EU's Copernicus monitoring program said.
* Moody's Analytics said the cost of the fires could easily surpass that of the deadly 2009 Black Saturday fires that destroyed 450,000 hectares of land, which cost an estimated A$4.4 billion. 
* There are 128 fires ablaze across NSW, with around 50 uncontained. All the fires were at the ""advice"" level, the lowest alert rating. Victoria state had 40 fires with 13 ""watch and act"" alerts.
* Prime Minister Morrison has pledged A$2 billion ($1.37 billion) to a newly created National Bushfire Recovery Agency.
* More than 100 military personnel were being deployed to help with clean-up efforts across the state.
* Emergency services have dismissed claims the fires are caused by environmentalists stopping controlled burn-offs. Rural Fire Services Commissioner Fitzsimmons: ""Hazard reduction burning is really challenging and the single biggest impediment to completing hazard reduction burning is the weather."" 
* Prince Charles joined list of global figures to send a message of support, referring to the ""appalling horror unfolding in Australia"" in a video sent overnight.

1177,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 11:06PM ET</span>",Mexican migrants removed from border camp after family separation threat,"By Julio-Cesar Chavez
CIUDAD JUAREZ (Reuters) - Mexican authorities on Tuesday removed almost 100 Mexican migrants seeking asylum in the United States from a camp in downtown Ciudad Juarez, across the border from El Paso, Texas, according to a Reuters witness, after state police threatened to separate parents from their children.
Ciudad Juarez has been received growing numbers of Mexicans seeking to apply for asylum in the United States, leading to a backlog in the city as U.S. border officials limit the number of asylum cases they receive at the port of entry each day.
The operation came a day after news that the United States will deport some Mexican asylum seekers to Guatemala. 
Mexican authorities have for months tried to move the migrants from outdoor camps into shelters, citing cold weather, as temperatures dropped below freezing. The 93 Mexicans had so far declined the offer. 
In a video recorded Monday night by a Mexican migrant, a man identifies himself as part of the Chihuahua state police and accuses the migrants, who have been camping near the border crossing for months, of neglecting their children.
Reuters has seen the video but did not witness that incident. 
In the video, the man orders the migrants to leave the camp by Tuesday and move to a shelter. He then threatens to separate the parents from their children. 
""Tomorrow, we'll be here and if you don't obey, you'll be arrested and your children will be taken to family services,"" he said. ""Now, whatever family services does is up to them, whether they keep your children in Juarez or take them out of the state.""
A spokesman for the state prosecutor's office confirmed to Reuters that the man in the video was one of their officials but denied that the migrants were threatened.
""He at no moment threatened them - he forewarned them, which is different,"" the spokesman said. ""There were around 10 complaints from family services who had come to the prosecutor's office and said these people were being neglectful toward their children.""
The migrant from the Mexican state of Guerrero, who declined to give her name for security reasons, but recorded the incident on her cell phone, said two more state police officers arrived to support the first officer. 
The woman and her husband said they had been waiting four months to cross into the United States to apply for asylum, but with only a few days left before their turn for a hearing was due they wanted to stay put. The family of five eventually relocated to a shelter together with the other migrants.
Ciudad Juarez officials, including Rogelio Pinal, head of the city's human rights office, on Tuesday afternoon led the migrants onto shuttles to a single shelter and dismantled the tents. 
""It's better to take them willingly and not force them,"" Pinal said. 

Some migrants disagreed. ""It's not what we want to do, but we have to do it anyway,"" one migrant said.

Iran fired a series of rockets at two U.S.-Iraqi airbases early Wednesday morning Baghdad time, the Pentagon said, in the first Iranian response to the killing of General Qassem Soleimani by American forces last week.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps earlier claimed responsibility for the barrage, which the Pentagon said was launched from Iran. A total of 15 rockets were launched, 10 of which hit the Ayn al-Asad base in western Iraq and another facility in Erbil, according to two U.S. officials. Another struck the Taji air base near Baghdad while four fell out of the sky.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Twitter that the government took “proportionate measures in self-defense” after the Soleimani strike.
“We do not seek escalation or war, but will defend ourselves against any aggression,” Zarif wrote.
It wasn’t immediately clear whether there were fatalities or major damage from the attacks, but President Donald Trump tweeted “All is well!” and “So far, so good!” while adding that battle damage assessments continued. He added that he’ll make a statement Wednesday morning.
The attack roiled financial markets anew, sending futures on theS&P 500 Index down as much as 1.7% before paring losses. Gold initially advanced to the highest since 2013, though those gains were trimmed along with an advance in oil which at one point surged above $65 a barrel.
“A missile attack from Iran against U.S. forces is a serious escalation,” said Michael Singh of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former senior director for Middle East affairs under President George W. Bush. Such an attack “cannot be regarded as merely symbolic or face-saving regardless of its results,” he added.
The scope of the U.S. response could depend heavily on the damage and whether any Americans were killed or injured in the strikes. Trump has shown restraint in previous attacks in the region blamed on Iran that didn’t kill any U.S. citizens, but Iran’s quick claim of responsibility for the strike and the targeting of U.S. military outposts make some sort of retaliation more likely.
How U.S.-Iran Tensions Heated Up, Then Boiled Over: QuickTake
“The next question is, does the U.S. react or overreact to this,” said Jarrett Blanc, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former State Department coordinator for Iran nuclear implementation.
The Defense Department said the bases had already been on high alert given soaring tensions over the past two weeks. Iran is believed to have the region’s largest stockpile of short-range ballistic missiles and a large number of American military and diplomatic facilities in the region were seen as potential targets for reprisals.
“As we evaluate the situation and our response, we will take all necessary measures to protect and defend U.S. personnel, partners, and allies in the region,” according to a Pentagon statement.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was in a closed-door meeting with fellow Democrats when she was handed a note about the attack as the lawmakers were discussing Trump’s impeachment. She left the room after telling her colleagues to “pray,” Representative Debbie Dingell said.
The Ayn al-Asad base is a key U.S. facility in the country. Vice President Mike Pence had visited it late last year and Trump was there in December 2018.
The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said that further responses will be on the way in response to the Soleimani strike last week. It called the attack the start of its “Martyr Soleimani” operation, in honor of a leader many Iranians considered a national hero for his exploits in conflicts from Syria to Yemen.
“The IRGC announces to the great Satan the U.S. that any responses will be met with much more pain and destruction,” the IRGC said in a statement on its Sepah News website.
Iran’s government was under tremendous political pressure to respond to Soleimani’s death. At his funeral on Tuesday, Hossein Salami, the leader of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard, threatened to “set ablaze” places supported by the U.S., the Associated Press reported. The general’s burial was postponed after dozens of mourners died in a stampede.
Before the latest attack, Iran said it was assessing 13 scenarios for retaliation according to comments by Ali Shamkhani, head of Iran’s national security council, reported by the semi-official Fars news agency. “The entirety of the resistance forces will retaliate” for Soleimani’s killing, he said. The council later denied he had spoken to the media, Iran’s state news agency reported.
Iran “needed to do something quick,” said Kamran Bokhari, founding director of the Center for Global Policy in Washington. “This is a placeholder move and a low cost one.”
The U.S. had vowed a quick and overwhelming response to any Iranian attacks. Over the past week, the Pentagon deployed about 3,500 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne to Kuwait and another three Navy ships with about 2,200 Marines to the Persian Gulf region.
Iranian-only targets for the U.S. include Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps navy vessels in the Persian Gulf, nuclear facilities, military bases, ports and oil installations, according to a Tuesday report by the Congressional Research Service. Another option: Iranian proxies.
U.S. officials say they were justified in targeting Soleimani, who was accused of having helped Iraqi insurgents target American troops with improvised explosive devices following the U.S. invasion in 2003.
Drone Strike
Already-high tensions between the U.S. and Iran soared following a Dec. 27 rocket assault on an Iraqi base. It killed an American contractor and wounded several other U.S. personnel. The U.S. put the blame on Kataib Hezbollah, an Iraqi militia closely associated with Iran.
On Dec. 29, the U.S. conducted air strikes on five bases in Iraq and Syria used by Kataib Hezbollah. Two days later, dozens of Iraqi militiamen and their supporters stormed the U.S. embassy complex in Baghdad. The U.S. responded with the drone strike on Soleimani on Jan. 2.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Tuesday that attacks planned by Soleimani, who headed the Revolutionary Guard’s Quds Force, were “days away” when the U.S. struck.
“We got it right,” Secretary of State Michael Pompeo told reporters on Tuesday. “And the president had an entirely legal, appropriate, and a basis, as well as a decision that fit perfectly within our strategy and how to counter the threat of malign activity from Iran more broadly.”

1181,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 09:36PM ET</span>",'Everyone's scared' - Puerto Rico declares emergency after earthquakes,"By Luis Valentin Ortiz
SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (Reuters) - Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez declared a state of emergency on Tuesday after a series of earthquakes killed at least one person, toppled buildings and knocked out power to nearly the entire island of more than 3 million people. 
The largest of the quakes in the U.S. territory registered at magnitude 6.4, the most powerful to hit the Caribbean island in 102 years.
With two large power plants shut down, drinking water was cut off to at least 300,000 customers, Vazquez told a news conference. 
She said power should be restored to most of the island within 24 to 48 hours. Puerto Rico schools will remain closed and public employees, other than health workers and police, will stay home on Wednesday while checks are made on the structural safety of buildings, Vazquez said.
""There are people who have lost their lives, there are people who have lost all their property,"" She told reporters, without giving further details on the extent of damage and injuries.
Puerto Rico's electricity authority said it hoped to re-establish services during the night in the metropolitan area of San Juan, the capital, which is home to about 2.3 million people. 
At least 346 people were left homeless, officials said, after homes were flattened, mostly in the south of the island. Many damaged buildings sat next to piles of rubble.
Bottled water, batteries and flashlights ran low at San Juan supermarkets and ice was scarce as residents tried to keep food from rotting, said resident Luis Borri, 31.
""Water is running out, people are grabbing like 10 boxes,"" said Borri, who recharged his cellphone at San Juan's international airport where he works and where backup generators allowed normal services to continue. 
Puerto Rico's emergency declaration will facilitate federal financial aid. President Donald Trump has been briefed on the earthquakes, and administration officials were monitoring the impact in coordination with Puerto Rico officials. 
HURRICANES AND BANKRUPTCY
Puerto Rico has been rocked by hundreds of quakes since Dec. 28, including 10 of magnitude 4 or greater, the U.S. Geological Survey said.
Powerful quakes are rare in Puerto Rico. A 7.3 magnitude quake that occurred in 1918 triggered a tsunami and killed 116 people, according to the island's seismology office.
""Everyone's scared, it's the first time anything like this has happened,"" said San Juan resident Patricia Alonso, 48, who with her 13-year-old son was heading to her mother's apartment building, which had power from an emergency generator. 
Hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017 killed about 3,000 people and destroyed a significant amount of infrastructure. Puerto Rico is also working through a bankruptcy process to restructure about $120 billion of debt and pension obligations.
""We are a resilient people. We have responded to many difficult situations. Now this has been asked of us one more time,"" said Vazquez, who assumed office in August after Ricardo Rossello stepped down over a scandal involving offensive chat messages and government corruption. 
One of Tuesday's quakes triggered an automatic shutdown of electricity across the island as a safety measure and a later, more powerful quake damaged power plants in the southern part of the island, Vazquez said. 
A 73-year-old man died after a wall fell on him, and a power plant worker was hospitalized after he was hit by debris, the governor said. 
Tuesday's magnitude 6.4 quake struck at a depth of 6 miles (10 km) at 4:24 a.m. (0824 GMT) near Ponce on the island's southern coast, the U.S. Geological Survey said. 

Witnesses on social media described it as ""super strong"" and lasting up to 30 seconds. It was followed by a number of hefty aftershocks, including two measuring 5.6.

1182,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 09:03PM ET</span>",'Into the lion's den': Mexican asylum seekers fear deportation to Guatemala,"By Julio-Cesar Chavez and Lizbeth Diaz
CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexicans seeking refuge in the United States to escape violence and lawlessness in their homeland fear worse dangers if they are sent to Guatemala under a new Trump administration scheme to crack down on asylum seekers.
Under U.S. rules made public on Monday, Mexicans requesting protection at the U.S.-Mexican border can be flown to Guatemala to seek refuge there instead.
U.S. President Donald Trump last year reacted to a surge in Central Americans requesting asylum with a series of policies aimed at keeping them out of the United States. The latest rules apply to migrants from Mexico as well as Honduras and El Salvador, according to guidance documents, and will likely have the effect of suppressing Mexican access to U.S. asylum.
It was unclear when the United States would begin sending Mexicans to Guatemala. The Mexican government estimated that 900 Mexican asylum seekers could be affected from February, without giving a timeframe or explaining how it reached that number.
Mexicans who say their homes are unsafe due to drug gang extortion said the policy leaves them few options.
""I can't go home, they've already kidnapped my brother and son,"" said Carlos, a Mexican seeking to reach the United States via the border city of Tijuana. He said he had fled criminal gangs in the southwestern state of Guerrero. 
""They're after me. If I go back they're sure to kill me. If I'm not safe in Mexico, I'll be even less safe in Guatemala,"" he said, requesting his last name be withheld for security reasons. Reuters could not independently corroborate his story.
Since the end of Guatemala's civil war in 1996, the country has consistently had a higher homicide rate than Mexico, its more prosperous northern neighbor. 
In the last few years, the difference has narrowed as Mexico's murder tally, fueled by turf wars between drug gangs, rose to record levels and Guatemala's declined.
Guatemala, however, is poorer and dangerous, and Mexicans generally have fewer contacts there than in the United States.
Eugenio, 48, arrived in the border city of Ciudad Juarez with his family four months ago and has been on a waiting list for the chance to present his case to U.S. officials ever since. He estimated his turn will come up later this week and the prospect of being sent to Guatemala was high on his mind.
""Going to Guatemala is like walking straight into the lion's den,"" Eugenio said, explaining he feared that the criminals he said had threatened his family in central Mexico could track him down across the fluid southern border. If he failed to get asylum in the United States, he said, he would try Canada. 
At the end of December, after reports first emerged that Washington was considering sending Mexican asylum seekers to Guatemala, a group of Mexican migrants filed a complaint with Mexico's National Human Rights Commission (CNDH) requesting help blocking the plan, saying it would put them in danger.
Mexico's government on Monday said it ""rejected"" the new U.S. policy but acknowledged that the decision was up to U.S. authorities.
Sitting in a chilly camp in Ciudad Juarez, one woman from the state of Zacatecas, who declined to give her name, said she was trying to reach the United States because she had family there, and would be safe.
""I'm not going because of the American dream, I'm going and taking my kids because we need security, we need safety,"" she said in tears, describing how she had fled a job as a scientist in a laboratory after she starting being followed and receiving phone threats.
She described the new policy as pressure aimed at making people like her give up her asylum claim.

""They know we won't want to go to another country where we won't have family support,"" she said.

CULVER CITY, Calif. (Reuters) - The death of a top Iranian general in an American missile strike was long overdue, the leaders of a U.S.-based pro-democracy group said on Tuesday, and might ""open a window"" for dissidents to challenge a weakened government in Tehran.
General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite foreign paramilitary and espionage service, known as the Quds Force, was killed on Friday when missiles fired by a U.S. drone struck his vehicle as he left Baghdad airport.
The surprise attack on Soleimani, who built up Tehran's network of proxy armies across the Middle East and was a pivotal figure in orchestrating its campaign to drive U.S. forces out of Iraq, has plunged the region into a new crisis and raised fears of a wider war.
""This was long overdue,"" Nasser Sharif, president of the California Society for Democracy in Iran, told Reuters in an interview. Sharif said Soleimani had used repressive tactics against the Iranian people, spread fear via the Quds Force, and supported the government of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria.
""Soleimani was pushing an agenda of expanding terror across the Middle East. He is responsible for the death of thousands of people. When our community here heard this news it was thrilled,"" Sharif said.
Southern (NYSE:SO) California is home to the largest concentration of Iranians outside that country and hundreds of pro-democracy Iranian-Americans are set to meet on Saturday in a long-planned convention at which the death of Soleimani is likely to be a major topic of discussion, Sharif said.
Soleimani was a national hero to many Iranians, whether supporters of the clerical leadership or not, but viewed as a dangerous villain by Western governments opposed to Iran's arc of influence running across the Levant and into the Gulf region.
On Tuesday at least 56 people were killed in a stampede in Tehran as tens of thousands packed streets to mourn the military commander. Iran pledged revenge for his death and, hours after the funeral, it launched a missile attack on U.S.-led forces in Iraq.
OUT IN THE STREETS
Sharif said dissidents inside and outside Iran see the country's leadership as vulnerable, weakened financially, and exposed to the world as repressive, and believe the death of Soleimani comes at an opportune time for those seeking a democratic uprising.
""This might open a window for Iranian protesters to come out into the streets again,"" Sharif said. The general would be hard for Tehran to replace, he said.
""Our organization doesn't want war,"" Sharif added. ""It wants change by the Iranian people.""
In November, protests initially sparked by an abrupt hike in gasoline spread across Iran as demonstrators called for more political freedom. Reuters has reported that some 1,500 people were killed in the resulting crackdown ordered by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the bloodiest since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
Sharif said he had not heard of any heightened security concerns in the United States affecting Iranians. But the Washington DC-based National Iranian American Council expressed concern in a statement on Monday about ""alarming reports"" that over 60 Iranians and Iranian-Americans had been detained and questioned by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at Canada's border with Washington State.
Reuters has not verified those reports and the CBP has not responded to requests for comment.
Friction between Iran and the United States has risen since Trump withdrew in 2018 from a nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, slashing its vital oil exports.
U.S. officials have said Soleimani was killed because of solid intelligence indicating forces under his command planned attacks on U.S. targets in the region, although they have as yet provided no evidence."

JAKARTA/LONDON (Reuters) - As Indonesia celebrated its National Heroes' Day last year, official military social media accounts lavished praise on Corporal Yunanto Nugroho for the ""myriad awards he has won in the field of IT."" 
It was unusual acclaim for a low-ranking army computer operator. But Yunanto's work is not confined to the usual mundane tasks of an information technology specialist. 
Yunanto co-ordinates a network of websites facilitated and funded by the military that publishes pro-government propaganda under the guise of independent news, according to web registration records and Reuters interviews with website editors and a special forces intelligence officer. 
The sites publish content that supports the conduct of the military and police in quashing a separatist uprising in the Indonesian provinces in Papua, a fight that has long been led by the country's elite special forces, Kopassus. 
Colonel Muhammad Aidi, an intelligence adviser to a Kopassus commander who bestowed an award on Yunanto in November, told Reuters the army computer operator had helped create and sustain many news websites as part of ""military efforts"" in partnership with civilian volunteers that included youths and media veterans who had approached the military to help. 
Other armed forces personnel also helped the sites and the military financially supported the news portals, he added. 
""The official armed forces websites cannot publish everything we do, so there are several media outlets that have been supporting us by publishing positive news as well as countering negative or hoax websites,"" Aidi told Reuters in an interview. 
Indonesia, an emerging democracy of nearly 270 million people with one of the world's highest rates of internet use, is grappling with persistent covert online disinformation campaigns - both for the government and against it - that have disrupted elections and stoked sectarian tensions. 
President Joko Widodo has railed against ""hoaxes, false news and slander"" but his military is also engaging in disinformation tactics, an examination of the website network by Reuters shows. 
A spokesman for Widodo did not respond to requests for comment. Ali Mochtar Ngabalin, a presidential expert staff member, said the military was prohibited from working with non-state actors. ""I do not believe the military is involved in funding online media to spread hoaxes,"" he told Reuters. 
Using software from DomainTools, a platform used by cybersecurity researchers to review historical web records, Reuters identified 10 websites presenting themselves as independent news outlets that were registered to a mobile phone number that was listed on Yunanto's LinkedIn (NYSE:LNKD) profile. 
When Reuters contacted that number, Yunanto said it belonged to him and that he was in the military. After this short phone call and an exchange of text messages, Yunanto declined to respond to detailed questions sent to an email address he provided. 
The 10 websites, some of which have been operating since mid-2017, are in the Indonesian language and carry names such as berita-indonesia.co.id (News-Indonesia), koranprogresif.co.id (Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Newspaper) and viralreporter5.com. They do not disclose their links to the military, and in recent months most of them have made their domain information private. 
The websites publish uniformly positive coverage of government, military and police alongside articles that demonize government critics and human rights investigators. The subjects of some stories told Reuters the websites attributed invented quotes to them and published other falsehoods. 
Lieutenant Colonel Zulhardie, the head of the army's Jakarta-based information unit, of which Yunanto is a part, referred Reuters questions to the Indonesian military spokesman Sisriadi who did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. 
'OUR PAPUAN PEOPLE’S NEWS' 
With a name that translates as ""Our Papuan People's News"" and claiming 80,000 views per month, kitorangpapuanews.com is one of three of the military-sponsored websites that registered its address as the Media Center at Kodam Jayakarta, the army's regional command headquarters based in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta. 
Yunanto works for the Kodam Jayakarta information unit that runs the Media Center where military personnel push out press releases and manage military web pages and social media accounts, according to articles on the headquarters' website. 
Kitorangpapuanews.com is devoted to pro-government news about Papua, where many of the region's ethnic Melanesian population have agitated for independence for decades. Mass demonstrations have resulted in at least 40 deaths there this year. 
In response to the recent unrest, the government has periodically shut down the internet in Papua and forbidden foreign journalists and some diplomats from visiting the area. 
Papuan movie actor Benyamin Lagowan told Reuters he was falsely quoted in a 2017 kitorangpapuanews.com article that reported he made ""scathing"" remarks about Papuan journalist and advocate Victor Mambor. He never spoke to the news outlet and admired Mambor, he said. 
Theo Hesegem, a human rights investigator in Papua, was denounced by kitorangpapuanews.com in a 2017 article that was accompanied by a photomontage framing him alongside a devil with fiery eyes. The story accused him of fabricating a report for the human rights group Tapol that found five civilians were shot during clashes between the military and armed Papuan separatists. 
After the article appeared, Hesegem said he was approached by a police officer saying he was under investigation for producing fake news, a crime that carries a penalty of up to four years. 
""I interviewed the victims and saw their bullet wounds,"" he told Reuters in a telephone interview. The police investigation petered out after the rights investigator demanded police serve him with a formal summons, Hesegem said. 
Reuters could not independently verify Hesegem's account. A police spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. 
Kitorangpapuanews.com does not identify its editorial team. It did not respond to Reuters questions. Aidi said he did not know who was behind the site.
'THANK YOU' PAYMENTS 
As well as being promoted by popular military and government social media accounts with hundreds of thousands of followers, kitorangpapuanews.com material is heavily shared by a network of 20 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter accounts. The accounts retweet each other's posts and use profile photos or cartoons made to look like Papuan residents. 
Some accounts describe themselves as ""free Papua"" activists but criticize advocates for Papuan self-determination, including prominent lawyer Veronica Koman. 
The use of these social media accounts was a deliberate strategy to ""confuse Papuan people,"" said Koman. ""In fact, it's just propaganda.""
Top editors from two of the other sites in the network - Jesayas Simarmata from berita-indonesia.co.id and M. Ridhwan from koranprogressif.co.id - described how the military paid for advertising and for journalists to attend military events. Ridhwan said his website was paid by army bases across Indonesia.
The editors said further that Yunanto, who put their sites on a server and had access to them as the web administrator, uploaded articles to their sites, including content from kitorangpapuanews.com. One of those articles, which lambasted Koman, was published on nine other websites in November. 
Simarmata said kitorangpapuanews.com was operated by the army's Jakarta command headquarters.

Aidi from Kopassus said there was no need for the websites to disclose their ties to the armed forces. The military just gave money to the websites as informal ""thank you"" payments, he said.

The British leader is due to meet von der Leyen in London on Wednesday for the first time since the commission president, who will play a pivotal role in talks to thrash out new arrangements between Britain and the EU, took office in December.
Johnson won an election last month by promising to deliver Brexit on Jan. 31 and use an 11-month transition period to negotiate a deal that will define terms between the world's fifth-largest economy and its biggest trading partner.
A statement from Johnson's office ahead of the visit said he would ""stress the importance of agreeing a confident and positive future relationship by the end of December 2020.""
It added: ""The prime minister will likely underline that the upcoming negotiations will be based on an ambitious FTA (Free-Trade Agreement), not on alignment.""

1189,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 05:25PM ET</span>","Taiwan to vote in shadow of China pressure, Hong Kong protests","By Ben Blanchard and Yimou Lee
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan votes on Saturday in an election overshadowed by renewed Chinese efforts to get the island to accept their rule, and as Taiwan nervously watches Hong Kong protests, worried they may be next if China ever succeeds in bringing them under its control.
Taiwan has been a democratic success story since holding its first direct presidential election in 1996, the culmination of decades of struggle against authoritarian rule and martial law under the Kuomintang, which ruled China until forced to flee to Taiwan in 1949 after loosing a civil war with the Communists.
President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party is seeking a second term, and is being challenged by the Kuomintang's Han Kuo-yu, who favors close ties with Beijing and says this is the only way to ensure Taiwan's security and prosperity.
The issue of China has taken front and center in the campaign, especially after President Xi Jinping warned last year they could attack Taiwan, though said he'd prefer a peaceful ""one country, two systems"" formula to get control of the island.
Both Tsai and Han have rejected ""one country, two systems"", though the DPP has painted a vote for the Kuomintang as effectively a vote for that model. Han has angrily denied this.
On Monday, Tsai's team released a slick new campaign video comparing Taiwan's freedoms with the struggle in Hong Kong, interspersed with images of Xi and Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam.
""A few hundred miles from here, many young people are using their blood and tears to defend freedom,"" Tsai wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) in introducing the video.
The idea of imposing a ""one country, two systems"" model of a high degree of autonomy much like China offers the former British colony of Hong Kong has never been popular in Taiwan.
It is even less so now after months of anti-government protests in the former British colony. The protesters have widespread public sympathy in Taiwan, and both the DPP and Kuomintang have pledged to help those who flee to the island.
Han has complained of ""dirty tricks"" being used to smear him as a puppet for China, especially revelations in Australian media from a self-proclaimed Chinese spy who claimed China has supported Han. Han strongly rejects this.
""I beseech Taiwan's people, in the 2020 presidential and parliamentary election, open your eyes. I hope Taiwan's people see these wicked smears to paint me black, red and yellow and make a rational decision,"" Han said on Tuesday.
""SCARING TAIWAN""
In the run-up to the election, China has repeated its ""one country, two systems"" offer to Taiwan. 
Liu Jieyi, the urbane head of China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, wrote in the Communist Party's official People's Daily last week that people in Taiwan were ""positively exploring"" this model, though offered no evidence.
But one Chinese official, who meets regularly with senior members of the People's Liberation Army, told Reuters that the Hong Kong protests had ""increased the difficulty of getting Taiwan back"".
""What's happening there is scaring Taiwan,"" the official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, referring to conversations with military officers.
While China has denied seeking to interfere in Taiwan's elections, Taiwan's parliament on the final day of last year passed a new anti-infiltration law designed to stop Chinese influence on Taiwan's democracy. 
China's military is not idly sitting on the sidelines.
Its newest aircraft carrier, the Shandong, has twice sailed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait in the past two months, most recently in late December.
The United States, Taiwan's main arms supplier and strongest international backer even in the absence of official diplomatic ties, has said it is concerned at Chinese efforts to sway the election.
Zhou Bo, director of the Center for Security Cooperation of the Office for International Military Cooperation at China's Defense Ministry, said China ""of course"" wanted to resolve the ""Taiwan issue"" peacefully.
But China could not sit by while Taiwan continued attempts to distance itself from China, and the United States should heed that warning, he said.

""I don't know whether the United States is prepared to pay the price militarily for Taiwan.""

""We are not looking to start a war with Iran, but we are prepared to finish one,"" he said. ""What we'd like to see is the situation de-escalated.""
The U.S. drone strike on Friday that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani has sharply escalated tensions with Iran, raising fears of all-out conflict. Washington says it killed Soleimani in self-defense, aiming to disrupt his plans to attack U.S. personnel and interests.
Esper defended the intelligence signaling an ""imminent threat"" from Soleimani that he and other senior U.S. officials have cited to justify the strike, saying it was persuasive.
""The threat was being orchestrated by Soleimani,"" Esper said. ""I think it was only a matter of days, certainly no more than weeks"" before an attack.
Esper suggested on Monday that the U.S. military would not violate the laws of armed conflict by striking Iranian cultural sites, a move threatened by U.S. President Donald Trump.
Asked about the issue again on Tuesday, Esper said he was confident that Trump ""will only give us legal orders.""
""We do not violate the laws of armed conflict,"" Esper said.
Targeting cultural sites with military action is considered a war crime under international law, including a U.N. Security Council resolution supported by the Trump administration in 2017 and the 1954 Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property."

In September, it was old pictures of the Canadian prime minister in blackface that got him in trouble during the election campaign.
In January, it's Trudeau's facial hair that is trending online after a picture posted to Instagram by his personal photographer showed a pensive-looking Trudeau sporting a neatly trimmed salt-and-pepper beard.
The Instagram post, which offered few details, got dozens of comments along the lines of ""We need answers about the beard,"" and the hashtag #trudeaubeard trended on Twitter in Canada with thousands of posts.
Trudeau has sported facial hair in the past, including a mustache and goatee while in opposition. But as prime minister, he has thus far been clean-shaven.
His office did not immediately respond to queries on Tuesday about the beard's provenance or whether Trudeau, 48, plans to keep it.
Canadian pop culture commentator Shinan Govani said the beard was reminiscent of Trudeau's father, Pierre, who sported a similar, somewhat scruffier look while briefly in opposition in 1979.
""If any world leader can get away with that Brooklyn creative look, it is Justin, though,"" he wrote in an email.
Political style consultant and former New Democratic Party adviser Ian Capstick said he expects the post-vacation beard to be short-lived: ""It’s a risky play at this stage for him to be sort of seen taking up too much space on a beard when the world is burning down."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday accused Iran of working to thwart efforts to bring peace to Afghanistan, but he offered no specific details to support his allegation.
Pompeo leveled his charge amid an escalating crisis with Iran following a U.S. drone strike on Friday in Iraq that killed General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's elite foreign paramilitary and espionage service, the Quds Force.
""Iran has refused to join the regional and international consensus for peace and is, in fact, actively working to undermine the peace process by continuing its long global effort to support militant groups there,"" Pompeo said at a State Department news conference.
Pompeo named the Taliban as one of the militant groups he accused Iran of using to undermine Afghanistan peace efforts. He also referred to the ""Tora Bora and the Mullah Dadullah Group,"" little-known organizations whose strengths, relevance and contacts with Iran were not immediately clear.
""The Taliban's entanglement in Iran's dirty work will only harm the Afghanistan peace process,"" Pompeo said.
He provided no details to support his charge. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Last June, Pompeo accused Iran of instigating a May 31 suicide bombing in Kabul - claimed by the Taliban - that killed four passersby and slightly wounded four U.S. servicemen.
Iran and the United States share an interest in restoring peace to Afghanistan, experts say. Iranian officials attended a November 2018 meeting in Moscow between the Taliban and other Afghans on spurring peace efforts.
Western intermediaries last year unsuccessfully tried to persuade Washington and Tehran to cooperate on ensuring stability in Afghanistan should U.S. and Taliban negotiators conclude a U.S. troop withdrawal accord.
Tehran long has maintained high-level Taliban contacts. It has held consultations with Taliban officials on their ongoing negotiations with the United States on a U.S. troop withdrawal that would lead to intra-Afghan talks on a political accord to end decades of fighting.
Iran is a haven for some insurgent families and has supplied limited quantities of weapons to the insurgents to keep pressure on U.S. forces near its border with Afghanistan, according to Western officials.
But Tehran also maintains close ties with Kabul and regional experts cast its relationship with the Taliban as hedging its bets in case the militants return to power. Tehran also sees the Taliban as a counter force to Islamic State's Afghan affiliate."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering sanctions against some of the Venezuelan lawmakers who took part in a bid supported by President Nicolas Maduro to wrest control of the country's congress from U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido, according to two people familiar with the matter.
Deliberations over the possible sanctions targets, including Maduro-backed lawmaker Luis Parra and more than a dozen others, are in the early stages, and a final decision is not imminent, the sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
Venezuelan troops blocked Guaido from entering parliament on Sunday for what was expected to be his re-election as head of congress, allowing Maduro's socialist party to hand the post to Parra. Later in the day, opposition legislators quickly re-elected Guaido - recognized by dozens of nations as Venezuela's rightful interim leader - at the offices of a pro-opposition newspaper.
""We go after those who undermine the constitution,"" said one of the sources, a high-ranking U.S. government official who declined to be named because details of the deliberations have not been made public. ""This is no different.""
The White House declined comment. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The measures against the lawmakers could start with bans on their travel to the United States, a restriction that Washington has already slapped on dozens of Maduro allies, and might later involve financial sanctions against them, according to a person familiar with the matter.
Special envoy Elliott Abrams said the United States was looking at additional sanctions to step up pressure on the Venezuelan government on Monday, but did not specify potential targets. 
Last January, Washington recognized Guaido as the OPEC nation's legitimate interim president and began ratcheting up sanctions and diplomatic pressure in an effort to oust Maduro.

A year later, Maduro remains in power, backed by the military as well as Russia, China and Cuba. A senior administration official told Reuters in October that Trump's frustration over the lack of results had spurred aides to ready further actions.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - In a blow to Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, Argentina's government said on Tuesday it did not recognize him as his nation's interim president and had revoked the credentials of his representative in Buenos Aires.
The new administration of Argentina's center-left President Alberto Fernandez sent a letter to Elisa Trotta Gamus, who represented Guaido in Argentina, to notify her that her ""special mission"" in Argentina had been terminated.
In April, diplomatic credentials were delivered to Trotta by the Argentine Foreign Ministry under right-leaning former President Mauricio Macri. Argentina, which already had a diplomatic mission from the government of President Nicolas Maduro, recognized Guaido as Venezuela's interim president last year.
""She was under the special mission format that the previous administration had given her, not as a formal ambassador of Venezuela. We do not recognize Guaido as president, but as a leader of the opposition, and based on that, we consider that there is no special representation mission,"" a spokesman for the Argentine Foreign Ministry said.
Trotta, in a statement shared with Reuters, said she hoped Argentina would continue to denounce human rights violations in Venezuela.
""We respect the sovereign decisions of Argentina. We are open to all kinds of conversations and dialogues that may arise with the Argentine Government with the objective of contributing to the recovery of democracy in Venezuela,"" the statement said.
Guaido was elected head of the congress in January 2019 and invoked Venezuela's constitution to assume an interim presidency, denouncing Maduro as a usurper who had secured re-election in a 2018 vote widely considered fraudulent. The U.S.-backed opposition leader has been recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela’s legitimate leader but has struggled to maintain support as Maduro fends off his challenge.
Fernandez, who took office on Dec. 10, has been cautious with his stance over the Maduro government though he has emphasized ties with other leftist politicians in the region including Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, Bolivia's unseated leader, Evo Morales, and former Brazilian leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.
His vice president, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, was close with Maduro at the end of her 2007-2015 twin terms."
1195,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 04:18PM ET</span>",Turkish support for Tripoli could 'rebalance forces' in Libya,"By Aidan Lewis
CAIRO (Reuters) - The planned arrival of Turkish military advisers in Libya should bolster the internationally recognized government, but may not be enough to turn the tide of a conflict in which eastern-based forces have the upper hand thanks to foreign support.
Turkey's decision to send the advisers and technical experts responded to a request by Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA), which Ankara backs against forces allied to veteran commander Khalifa Haftar.
Turkey has already provided drones and armored vehicles for the defense of the capital, Tripoli, which helped quickly stall the offensive launched by Haftar's forces nine months ago. 
But Turkish backing has often been outweighed by air power from the United Arab Emirates in support of Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA), and by a technological and frontline edge provided by Russian military contractors since September, officials, diplomats and analysts say.
""The decision by the GNA to request military support from Turkey follows a dangerous escalation in the conflict from Haftar and his backers, including bringing in Russian mercenaries,"" GNA Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha said in a statement to Reuters.
On Monday, the LNA advanced into Sirte, a strategic city in the center of Libya's Mediterranean coastline, and fighting has increased around Tripoli in recent weeks.
This has heightened pressure on GNA forces, which two sources close to those forces said had been struggling against missile systems being used to bring down drones and laser-guided shells thought to have been introduced by Russian contractors.
The GNA's drone fleet has also been depleted by attacks on airports and air bases in Tripoli and the city of Misrata, northwest of Sirte.
Turkish officials have indicated that any deployment will not involve troops but that Turkey has been considering sending Syrian rebels. A source in the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army said some fighters had already signed up as guards.
""What this will bring above all is a rebalancing of forces,"" said Arnaud Delalande, an independent defense consultant and Libya expert. ""In particular it could bring air defense, which could be jamming systems, but also coordination of troops on the ground."" 
RUSSIAN AND TURKISH COOPERATION
Maneuvering in Libya by Russia and Turkey, whose presidents meet in Turkey on Wednesday, has overshadowed European efforts to revive a U.N.-led peace process.
Although Turkey and Russia have generally been on opposing sides in Syria's civil war, they have strengthened economic and military ties recently. They now cooperate in northeast Syria, where they mount joint patrols, and Ankara bought Russian missile defense systems last year despite opposition in Washington. 
Ankara and Moscow want to protect their strategic interests in Libya, where they lost lucrative contracts in 2011 after a NATO-backed uprising, and in the wider east Mediterranean region. [L8N28R455]
The two countries are unlikely to clash directly, with Ankara seeking leverage to negotiate over offshore gas drilling rights after signing military and maritime accords with the GNA in November.
""In Libya, Ankara's end game is not to help Tripoli win the conflict, which is not realistic. It is to create a stalemate and political negotiations that preserve its maritime demarcation deal,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who heads the Istanbul-based Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies think tank.
A senior Turkish official told Reuters: ""Turkey is in close contact with Russia to prevent conflict. This will continue.""
Russia could be eyeing a long-term goal of having a naval base in eastern Libya, said Jalel Harchaoui, a research fellow with the Clingendael Institute think tank in The Hague.
""Russia is presented with a golden opportunity to make its presence in eastern Libya more entrenched,"" he said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused the United States on Tuesday of violating its agreement with the United Nations by denying him a visa to speak at a Security Council meeting amid escalating tensions between Washington and Tehran.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters on Monday that Zarif would not be given a visa to attend Thursday's meeting. Zarif confirmed on Tuesday that he would not be given a U.S. visa.
""What we know is that the U.S. State Secretary (Mike Pompeo), in a call to the Secretary General of the United Nations (Antonio Guterres), said: 'We did not have time to issue a visa for Mohammad Javad Zarif and we will not issue a visa',"" said Zarif, according to Iran's semi-official ISNA news agency.
""The Secretary General responded by saying that it is Iran's right to take part in this session,"" Zarif said.
Zarif wanted to attend a meeting of the Security Council on the topic of upholding the U.N. Charter. The meeting and Zarif's travel had been planned before the latest flare-up in tensions between Washington and Tehran.
The Security Council meeting would have given Zarif a global spotlight to publicly criticize the United States for killing Iran's most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad on Friday.
""I don't think Secretary Pompeo thought this was the right time for Mr Zarif to come to the United States and whenever he comes to New York he spreads propaganda,"" White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien told Fox News on Tuesday.
""I think he'll be fine missing that meeting,"" he said, suggesting Zarif could participate by phone or video conference.
Zarif posted on Twitter earlier on Tuesday: ""What are they really afraid of? Truth?""
Pompeo and Guterres spoke by phone on Monday. U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said he was unaware of the exact status of Zarif's visa and declined to comment on the details of the phone call between Pompeo and Guterres.
Iranian diplomats spoke with a senior official in Guterres' office on Monday afternoon, Dujarric said.
Pompeo told reporters on Tuesday that he would not comment on visa matters ""so I can't add much more to this issue of Foreign Minister Zarif's travel to the United States.""
""I'll say only this - we will always comply with our obligations under the U.N. requirements and the headquarters agreement and we will do so in this particular instance and more broadly everyday,"" Pompeo said.
Under the 1947 U.N. ""headquarters agreement,"" the United States is generally required to allow access to the United Nations for foreign diplomats. But Washington says it can deny visas for ""security, terrorism and foreign policy"" reasons.
A possible caveat in the agreement reads: ""The United States retains full control and authority over the entry of persons or property into the territory of the United States and the conditions under which persons may remain or reside there."""

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo police arrested a woman on Tuesday accused of inciting terrorist acts for social media comments against the United States over the killing of Iranian Commander Qassem Soleimani.
Police said that Ikballe Berisha Huduti, the founder of a now defunct pro-Islamic organization called Kur'ani, was arrested following an order from the prosecution and she will remain in detention for 48 hours awaiting a court decision.
Police said she was detained on charges of “incitement to commit a terrorist offence.”
Huduti wrote comments on her private Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page criticizing Washington after the U.S. forces killed Soleimani on Friday.
""By killing the master of the house you have killed all members of the family, then revenge is obligatory but it has no border,"" Huduti wrote, according to Pristina media which had screenshots of her postings.
She deleted her messages and said on Facebook that her words were taken out of context by local media. She said in other postings she had praised U.S. democracy and U.S. support for Kosovo in 1999 when conflict erupted between ethnic Serbs and Albanians in the former Yugoslavia.
Showing a photo of her with the former hard-line leader of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, media in Kosovo have described Huduti as a strong supporter of the Iranian government. Her organization was closed by police in 2016. But she denied wrongdoing and there were never any charges against her.
Kosovo has been a strong supporter of the United States. When the Iranian general was killed, Kosovo Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj said: ""Kosovo stands firm in support of the U.S. in its right to self-defense."""

FORT BRAGG, N.C. (Reuters) - For many of the soldiers, it would be their first mission. They packed up ammunition and rifles, placed last-minute calls to loved ones, then turned in their cellphones. Some gave blood.
The 600 mostly young soldiers at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, were headed for the Middle East, part of a group of some 3,500 U.S. paratroopers ordered to the region. Kuwait is the first stop for many. Their final destinations are classified.
""We're going to war, bro,"" one cheered, holding two thumbs up and sporting a grin under close-shorn red hair. He stood among dozens of soldiers loading trucks outside a cinder-block building housing several auditoriums with long benches and tables.
Days after President Donald Trump ordered the drone killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, raising fears of fresh conflict in the Middle East, the men and women of the U.S. Army's storied 82nd Airborne Division are moving out in the largest ""fast deployment"" since the 2010 Haiti earthquake.
The 82nd's commander, U.S. Army Major General James Mingus, waded through the sea of camouflage-uniformed men and women as they prepared to leave the base near Fayetteville on Sunday. He shook hands with the troops, wishing them luck.
One soldier from Ashboro, Virginia, said he wasn't surprised when the order came.
""I was just watching the news, seeing how things were going over there,"" said the 27-year-old, one of several soldiers Reuters was allowed to interview on condition they not be named. ""Then I got a text message from my sergeant saying 'Don't go anywhere.' And that was it.""
While the killing of Soleimani has ratcheted up tensions between the United States and Iran, it remains to be seen whether they will escalate to full-out conflict.
Trump last week said he ordered the killing to stop a war, not to start one. And despite Tehran's strident rhetoric, analysts say Iran will want to avoid any conventional conflict with the United States and is likely to focus on asymmetric strikes, such as sabotage or other military action via proxies.
Risks seemed to be pushed to the back of the minds of the younger soldiers, though many packed the base chapel after a breakfast of eggs, waffles, oatmeal, sausages and 1,000 doughnuts.
One private took a strap tethered to a transport truck and tried to hitch it to the belt of an unwitting friend, a last prank before shipping out.
'THIS IS THE MISSION'
The older soldiers, in their 30s and 40s, were visibly more somber, having the experience of seeing comrades come home from past deployments learning to walk on one leg or in flag-draped coffins.
""This is the mission, man,"" said Brian Knight, a retired Army veteran who has been on five combat deployments to the Middle East. He is the current director of a chapter of the United Service Organizations military support charity.
""They're answering America's 911 call,"" Knight said. ""They're stoked to go. The president called for the 82nd.""
There was lots of wrestling holds as the troops tossed their 75-pound (34 kg) backpacks onto transport trucks. The packs hold everything from armor-plated vests, extra socks and underwear, to 210 rounds of ammunition for their M4 carbines.
A sergeant pushed through the crowd shouting for anyone with Type O blood, which can be transfused into any patient.
""The medics need you now. Move,"" he said, before a handful of troops walked off to give a little less than a pint each.
UNCERTAINTY PREVAILS
While members of the unit - considered the most mobile in the U.S. Army - are used to quick deployments, this was different, said Lieutenant Colonel Mike Burns, an Army spokesman.
""The guys are excited to go, but none of us know how long they'll be gone,"" Burns said. ""That's the toughest part.""
Soldiers were ordered not to bring cellphones, portable video games or any other devices that could be used to communicate with friends and family back home, out of concern that details of their movements could leak out.
""We're an infantry brigade,"" Burns said. ""Our primary mission is ground fighting. This is as real as it gets.""
A sergeant started rattling off last names, checking them off from a list after ""heres"" and ""yups"" and ""yos."" 
For every fighter, there were seven support crew members shipping out: cooks, aviators, mechanics, medics, chaplains, and transportation and supply managers. All but the chaplains would carry guns to fight.
A 34-year-old senior master sergeant said: ""The Army is an all-volunteer force. We want to do this. You pay your taxes and we get to do this.""
The reality of the deployment wouldn't sink in until the troops ""walk out that door,"" he said, pointing to the exit to the tarmac where C-5 and C-17 transport planes and two contract commercial jets waited.
His call came when he was on leave in his hometown of Daytona Beach, Florida, taking his two young daughters to visit relatives and maybe go to Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) World.
""We just got there and I got the call to turn right around and head back to base,"" he said. ""My wife knows the drill. I had to go. We drove right back."" 

On a single order, hundreds of soldiers jumped to their feet. They lined up single file and marched out carrying their guns and kits and helmets, past a volunteer honor guard holding aloft flags that flapped east in the January wind.

TORONTO (Reuters) - A former pastor from Toronto was sentenced to 15 years in prison on Tuesday after he was convicted in the drowning death of his 20-week pregnant wife.
Found guilty of manslaughter by a jury last year, Philip Grandine faces almost 12 years in prison with three years' credit for time spent in custody.
His lawyer, Amit Thakore, told Reuters he feels Grandine's sentence was higher than what the case law suggests, which he said is a range of five to seven years.
Karissa Grandine, 29, drowned in the couple's bathtub in October 2011.
Justice Faye McWatt found that Karissa Grandine was affected by the drug her husband Philip Grandine secretly administered to her, causing her to not protect herself from drowning when she got in the bathtub."

The four men were convicted in 2013 of the rape, torture and murder of the 23-year-old physiotherapy student in a case that triggered large protests in India.
The attack prompted India to enact tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases, but implementation has been poor and the attacks have shown no signs of let-up.
In 2017, India's Supreme Court had upheld death sentences against the four men. In the last two years, the top court has dismissed review pleas filed by the convicts, paving the way for the execution. 
The order to hang the four convicts on Jan. 22 came after the parents of the victim asked the court to seek death warrants against the four men.
""We have fought the legal battle with a lot of patience for more than seven years. Now, I finally get justice,"" the mother of the victim, who cannot be named under Indian law, told reporters after the order of the court.
Despite tough laws against sexual violence, a woman is raped every 20 minutes on average in India. 
Lengthy trials, often a result of fewer courts and judges, tend to delay convictions, leaving poor, disillusioned victims with little money and patience to pursue the case.

A 23-year-old rape victim, who was set on fire by a gang of men, which included her alleged rapists, died in a New Delhi hospital last month, prompting protests.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is not unquestioning in its support of the United States, defense minister Ben Wallace said on Tuesday, as he underlined the importance of trying to ""reboot"" the Iranian nuclear deal. 
Britain has sought to tread a careful diplomatic line since last week's killing of a top Iranian general by a U.S. drone strike, avoiding criticizing its close ally while also seeking to work with European partners towards a diplomatic solution.
Ministers have said General Qassem Soleimani was a threat but also called for an easing of tensions in the region.
Asked by an opposition Labour lawmaker in parliament about the risks of Britain's ""unquestioning"" support of President Donald Trump, Wallace said: ""Our support for the United States is not unquestioning at all.""
""We are friends and allies but we are also critical friends and allies when it matters.""
Trump's administration has said Soleimani was planning new attacks on U.S. interests.
Asked about the legality of the drone strike, Wallace said Britain defended a nation's right to take such action, and that from the intelligence he had seen ""there is a definite case to answer that there would be a cause for self-defence"".
He also said Britain would ""call out"" any attacks on cultural sites, threatened by Trump but prohibited under international law.
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Prime Minister Boris Johnson's desire to reach a post-Brexit trade deal with the United States was influencing the government's judgement.
""Isn’t the truth that he is scared to stand up to President Trump because he has hitched his wagon to the prospect of a toxic Trump trade deal?"" Corbyn said in parliament.
""Instead, at this highly dangerous moment, we find the government giving cover and even expressing sympathy for what is widely regarded as an illegal act, because they are in hock to Trump.""
Wallace said Britain was working with Germany and France to ""reboot"" the 2015 JCPOA Iran nuclear deal, from which Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States in 2018.
""We believe the JCPOA still has life in it ..,"" he said, adding that the JCPOA's dispute resolution mechanism was one route to that end.

""We have not yet gone to that but it is one of the areas you can seek to remedy if you are going to try and pull back Iran from potentially the path that may potentially break that JCPOA.""

Kurz returned to power on Tuesday as his coalition cabinet with the Greens was sworn in. Austria joins Sweden and Finland in having the Greens in government at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change.
In contrast to those fellow European Union member states, Austria's Greens are not governing with the center-left, making this an interesting test case. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives could opt for a similar coalition after an election due by next year.
But Germany's Greens were quick to take issue with the Austrian coalition deal.
""There will be no such thing in Germany,"" Greens leader Annalena Baerbock told the TAZ newspaper.
The deal includes raising the age until which girls are banned from wearing a headscarf in school to 14 from around 10, an extension of a policy introduced under Kurz's last coalition, which was with the far right.
It also includes reviving a disputed plan for preventive custody of potentially dangerous individuals, even if they have not committed a crime, which was put forward under the previous coalition after a fatal stabbing apparently committed by an asylum seeker in February.
""This agreement is not a blueprint for Germany,"" said German Greens lawmaker Luise Amtsberg, who specializes in immigration policy."

MONTREAL (Reuters) - An international aviation team has been activated to support ""effective coordination and communication"" between airlines and countries as tensions mount in the Middle East after a U.S. drone strike killed an Iranian military commander, global airlines body IATA said on Tuesday.
Airlines and the United Nations' aviation agency have started to monitor strategic airspace over Iran and Iraq. With some commercial carriers still serving those countries and others flying over their airspace, the International Air Transport Association also issued a statement reminding countries of their obligation to communicate potential risks to civil aviation.
""It is critical that states live up to this obligation as tensions in the Middle East rise,"" the group said, days after the killing of General Qassem Soleimani on Friday plunged the region into a new crisis.
On Monday, Germany published a new warning for Iraq, indicating areas of concern for overflying traffic, according to a report published by the site OPSGROUP.
The coordination team operated by IATA and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) was activated as a ""standard precautionary measure,"" in the event that contingency measures are required by airlines, IATA said in a statement to Reuters.
The team brings together airlines, regulators and air navigation service providers to ensure any potential risks to aviation are shared quickly, an industry source familiar with the group said.
""Everyone's urging restraint,"" said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.
Carriers are increasingly taking steps to uncover threats to their planes after Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 was shot down in 2014 by a missile over Ukraine, killing all 298 people on board.
Airspace controlled by Iran and Iraq are seen as strategic for commercial aviation in the Middle East. If there were the need to shut down the airspace, carriers would have to be rerouted which would lead to greater congestion and fuel costs, said the source."

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan security forces let U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido enter the legislative palace on Tuesday amid a showdown for control of parliament after the ruling socialist party installed its own rival congressional chief. 
Guaido, who was re-elected on Sunday to a second one-year term as head of the opposition-held congress, had pledged to preside over Tuesday's opening session after security forces blocked him from the building over the weekend to allow socialist legislators to swear in their own speaker. 
Local television images early Tuesday showed Guaido arguing for half an hour with troops wielding riot shields who again blocked the entrance to the legislative building, but eventually allowed him to push past them. 
""This is not a barracks. This is the house of laws,"" Guaido told the soldiers blocking his entrance. ""The military does not get to decide who can enter the house of laws.""
But inside, a brief session led by Luis Parra - who was sworn in by allies of President Nicolas Maduro as parliament chief Sunday - had already ended, according to Reuters witnesses.
Parra's swearing in on Sunday gave Maduro sway over the last major state institution that had remained outside his control and appeared to mark a setback to Washington's efforts to unseat him.
The gambit marked an escalation in Maduro's crackdown on the opposition, whose key international ally - the Trump administration - has so far been unsuccessful in its year-long attempt to oust Maduro through economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure. 
U.S. special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams on Monday said Washington was preparing new sanctions to step up pressure on Caracas. But Maduro's move suggests he does not expect major consequences from the United States, though the government has steered clear of actions - like arresting Guaido - that could provoke a harsher response.
""We once again handed imperialism a defeat,"" socialist party Vice President Diosdado Cabello said on his talk show Monday night.
Parra, who was elected to congress in 2015, had been expelled from the First Justice opposition party in late 2019 due to corruption allegations, which he has denied.
Dozens of countries, including the United States, denounced Parra's appointment as illegitimate, and said they continued to recognize Guaido as the parliament's head and as Venezuela's rightful president.
On Sunday, after soldiers prevented Guaido from entering parliament, he held a separate session elsewhere in which 100 lawmakers backed his bid despite the earlier swearing-in of Parra. The legislature has 167 seats. 
'THE PEOPLE ARE IN CHARGE'
Guaido had vowed to preside over Tuesday's legislative session despite what he called Parra's ""parliamentary coup."" Parra has rejected that description, while saying he wants to end confrontations with Maduro's government. ""We came to save parliament from destruction,"" he said on Twitter.
After security forces opened the gates to allow him to pass, Guaido stood in the leadership post and sang the Venezuelan national anthem with allies. Electricity swiftly went out in the chamber, and state television - which had broadcast footage of Parra's session - cut away from the congress. 
""In here, the people are in charge,"" lawmakers chanted as Guaido entered.
Guaido was elected head of the congress in January 2019 and invoked Venezuela's constitution to assume an interim presidency, denouncing Maduro as a usurper who had secured re-election in a 2018 vote widely considered fraudulent.
So far, Maduro has fended off Guaido's challenge, retaining control of the armed forces and tightening the noose around opposition lawmakers. More than 30 of Guaido's congressional allies are in hiding, in prison, or in exile.
Guaido has also been losing support as Venezuelans tired with Maduro lose patience with his floundering movement. It remains to be seen whether his defiant response to Maduro's move could galvanize his supporters, who turned out by the hundreds of thousands to protest Maduro early last year.
Parra's new policy agenda focuses on reducing conflict with the government. Maduro was quick to celebrate his swearing-in, highlighting a ""rebellion"" among opposition lawmakers.
Parra said Monday his priority was to set up a new electoral council to preside over free and fair elections.

His brief session included a debate over proposals to tackle widespread shortages of gasoline. The session began around 10 a.m. and ended in under an hour.

The European Commission, the EU executive, says the legislation would imperil the rule of law in Poland and has launched legal steps against Warsaw over earlier reforms of the judiciary to try to preserve the independence of courts.
The Sejm is controlled by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS), which says the reforms are necessary to make the judiciary more efficient and effective.
But the Senate is dominated by the opposition and could redraft or reject the draft law, though the Sejm would still have the power to overturn the Senate's decision.

Hanif said people claiming to be from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) ""barged into"" the office of his publisher in Pakistan's largest city, Karachi, and confiscated all copies of his books this week.
On Tuesday, they returned, seeking a list of distributors and sellers of the novel, Hanif told Reuters by telephone.
""They were polite ... but didn't show any identification or a search warrant,"" he said.
A spokesman for the military denied the allegations, adding the military had no interest in confiscating books and pointing out that Pakistan did not have a large readership for novels.
The military has ruled the nuclear-armed nation for nearly half its history and is considered to have a major influence over the government.
Critics including rights groups allege the military limits civil liberties, muzzles the media and pushes back against any form of criticism of the armed forces. The military denies such charges.
Hanif, who is also a regular columnist for The New York Times, has been critical of the military in the past.
His novel has won international acclaim since it was first published in English in 2008 and was last year translated into Urdu to reach a wider audience in Pakistan.
On Tuesday, a representative of a popular bookshop in Lahore, Fiction House, said a man who said he was associated with the military visited the shop and asked questions about the book, including how many copies had been sold.
The military's spokesman denied having sent anyone to the shop.
In the novel, Hanif caricatured Zia as a superstitious and insecure leader whom several people wanted to assassinate."

The 17-year-old, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had carried out extensive online searches for extreme race-hate and right-wing material, encouraging others to share the banned material he found.
He was arrested in March 2019 when police found a handwritten list of possible areas to attack and a list of ""firearms I would buy"" at his home in Durham, northern England.
In November, he was found guilty of six offences, including preparing to commit an act of terrorism, which the BBC said made him the youngest person to be convicted in Britain of plotting to carry out such an attack.
""Cases such as this highlight the dangers our young people face today online,"" said Detective Chief Superintendent Martin Snowden, head of Counter Terrorism Policing North East.
""The negative influence and powerful manipulation that takes place by those who seek to radicalize them cannot be underestimated.""
The teenage boy, who was sentenced to six years and eight months in jail at Manchester Crown Court, had researched details of recent mass killings in the United States and Europe, police said."

Iran has rejected France's call to the release 60-year-old anthropologist, who has been detained since June, saying the demand was an interference in Tehran's internal affairs because it does not recognize dual nationality.
""Her spying charge was dropped by the court. But she still faces two to five years in jail for acting against national security and three months to one year for propaganda against the establishment,"" lawyer Saeed Dehghan said by phone from Tehran.
Dehghan said prosecutor had rejected a request for Adelkhah to be freed on bail but said she had been transferred from a section run by the Revolutionary Guards to a women's section at Evin prison.
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals over recent years, mostly on espionage charges.
France has demanded Iran release Adelkhah and her colleague Ronald Marchal, a senior researcher at Science-Po university whose arrest was reported by Paris in mid-October.
The issue has complicated ties between the two countries during a period when French President Emmanuel Macron was seeking to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran.
""Marshal was never charged with spying. He faces the charge of acting against national security ... which means he can receive a two to five-year jail term,"" Dehghan said, adding that Marchal was still held in the Guards section.
Iran has stepped up detentions of foreign and dual nationals on spying and security charges during a protracted standoff with Western powers since the United States withdrew from an international agreement to curb Iranian nuclear activities.
Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting a number of dual nationals to try to win concessions from other countries - a charge that the Islamic Republic has regularly dismissed."

PARALIMNI, Cyprus (Reuters) - A British teenager will appeal against her conviction in Cyprus over a withdrawn allegation of gang rape, her lawyers said on Tuesday, as the British government said it had raised numerous concerns about her treatment with Cypriot authorities.
The 19-year-old was given a suspended sentence on Tuesday after being found guilty by a court in Cyprus on Dec. 30 of public mischief for having alleged that she had been raped by a group of Israeli youths in the holiday resort of Ayia Napa last July.
She says she was coerced by police into dropping the complaint. The case has caused outrage in Britain and sparked protests from activists who say the woman, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, did not get a fair trial.
Lawyers said she would appeal to clear her name.
""The fight for her innocence will go on regardless,"" said Lewis Power, who was assisting the woman's local defense team. ""We will maintain this young girl was stripped of her dignity and basic human rights.""
She had earlier been sentenced before a packed courtroom to four months in jail, suspended for three years.
Raising his voice over chants from supporters of the woman outside, Judge Michalis Papathanasiou told her the sentence took into account her age, clean criminal record and remorse, and that he was giving her a ""second chance"". 
""All mitigating factors were taken into account but it does not negate the seriousness of the offence,"" Papathanasiou said, noting that 12 individuals had been briefly detained on the basis of her accusation. 
The woman, whose lawyers say she is suffering from post-traumatic stress, stood in silence before him.
Police ordered window blinds in the courtroom to be pulled down to block the sight of about 150 protesters who shouted slogans like ""Blaming the victim is the second rape!"" and ""Cyprus justice, shame on you!"". 
""We are here to raise social awareness of rape,"" said Dana Salmon, one of almost 60 activists from Israel who had flown in to support the woman. ""There is no justice here."" 
NUMEROUS CONCERNS
The woman insists that a sexual assault took place and that she was pressured to withdraw her complaint during overnight questioning from police with no lawyer present. One defense witness, a former state forensic pathologist, said her injuries were consistent with rape.
Twelve Israeli youths were detained for questioning but swiftly released after the woman withdrew her accusation. They were not required to give any evidence at the woman's trial.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pleased the woman could return home after being barred from leaving the island, a spokesman said, adding that Britain would work with Cyprus and other countries to ensure such a case could not happen again.
""We have had numerous concerns about the judicial process in this case and the woman's right to a fair trial and we have made these clear to the Cypriot authorities,"" the spokesman said.
Foreign minister Dominic Raab earlier said there was no immediate plan to change the travel advice for Britons visiting Cyprus. The case has prompted calls for a boycott of the island, which is popular with British holidaymakers.
Cypriot newspapers have reported that President Nicos Anastasiades might pardon the woman, although a senior government source told Reuters that was premature. 

Lawyers for the woman say they would press ahead with an appeal anyway because a pardon would not expunge her criminal record.

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Thousands of Iraqis packed the streets of the southern city of Basra on Tuesday to mourn Iranian-backed militia leader Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, known by his nom de guerre Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was killed by a U.S. air strike last week.
His body arrived at his hometown of Basra following several funeral processions elsewhere in Iraq and Iran. It will be taken to the Shi'ite holy city of Najaf for burial following this final procession.
A U.S. drone strike on Friday at Baghdad airport killed Iranian general Qassem Soleimani, who oversaw Tehran's campaign to extend its influence across the region, and Muhandis in an attack that has raised concern of a wider conflict in the Middle East.
Muhandis was the top Iraqi adviser to Soleimani, commander of Iran's Qods Force which supports many Iraqi militia groups such as Kataib Hezbollah, which was founded by Muhandis in 2003 after the U.S.-led invasion.
He was also de facto leader of Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) umbrella body of paramilitary groups, giving him wide reaching influence over the country's many powerful Iran-backed Shi'ite militias.
His death means Iran will have a harder time controlling its militia allies in Iraq, analysts say. Both the near-mythical status he had among these groups and the close personal relationship he had with Soleimani will be hard to replace.
About 30,000 people thronged the streets of Basra waving Iraqi and militia flags and denouncing the United States. Chants of ""No, no America"" and ""No, no Israel"" rang out.
""We will avenge Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and Soleimani by forcing American troops to leave Iraq,"" said Shi'ite cleric Muhsin al-Hakeem who stood by the convoy carrying the commander's casket.
Muhandis fought for decades with Soleimani and other prominent Iraqi militia leaders such as Badr Organization chief Hadi al-Amiri, now the most likely candidate to succeed him.
Together they fought on Iran's side against Saddam Hussein in the Iraqi-Iran war in the 1980s. He also worked with Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) whilst in Kuwait, organizing attacks on embassies there of countries that supported Saddam during that war.
In a video will he left to be shared after his death, Muhandis called on his supporters to ""perpetuate jihad"".
""I pray I spend the afterlife with...those I fought with, from Kuwait, to Iran, to Iraq. The Badr youth, and later the resistance against the occupation, and now the PMF youth.""
He was a prime example of the regional network of Shi'ite militias Soleimani had been building over decades in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. 
""I command you to take care of the Shi'ites in the region and in the world,"" he told his followers. ""Obey the Imam of the Umma Sayyid Khamenei,"" he added, referring to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatolla Ali Khamenei. 
The U.S. air strike that killed him and Soleimani created a wider backlash among Iraqis and promoted parliament to pass a resolution on Sunday calling for an end to all foreign troop presence, reflecting the fears that the strike could engulf Iraq in another war between two bigger powers.

YANGON (Reuters) - Four Rohingya Muslim children were killed by a landmine explosion in Myanmar's western Rakhine state on Tuesday which the military and ethnic insurgents blamed on each other.
Five other children and their teacher were also wounded when the group stepped on the landmine as they went to collect firewood in the village of Kyauk Yan, military spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun said by phone.
The wounded were being treated at local hospitals and three were in a serious condition, he said.
He said the landmine was laid by fighters from the Arakan Army, an insurgent group that recruits mostly from Rakhine’s Buddhist majority. A spokesman for the rebels, who want more autonomy for Rakhine state, blamed the blast on the military.
""One child’s head was crushed. We could only retrieve his body. We brought the bodies to their families and buried them later in the evening,"" said a villager who asked not to be named for fear of retribution.
Last year, 143 children were killed or wounded in numerous civil wars being fought along Myanmar's porous borders, the United Nations Children's Fund said.
Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in Rakhine state since fighting broke out last December.
The region came to global attention in 2017 when more than 730,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh to escape an army crackdown which U.N investigators said was carried out with ""genocidal intent"".
Several hundred thousand remain in Myanmar. They live under apartheid-like conditions, confined to camps and villages and denied access to education and healthcare.
Myanmar is encouraging refugees to return from Bangladesh camps but most have refused, citing persecution and conflict.
The ethnic Rakhine insurgency, believed to include thousands of rebels, poses a threat to the government of Aung San Suu Kyi.
Rebels have kidnapped villagers, administrators and local officials and ordered a tax on businesses. A lawmaker from Suu Kyi's ruling party is still missing after being abducted in November, and another party official died after being kidnapped in December."

GENEVA (Reuters) - More than 3 million Syrian civilians are trapped in a war zone in the northwest of the country and utterly dependant on cross-border aid, the United Nations said on Tuesday, as it urged states to extend the mandate for that aid which expires in days.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that Russia and China had blood on their hands after the two countries blocked a U.N. Security Council resolution that would have allowed cross-border humanitarian deliveries for a further 12 months.
Since 2014, the United Nations has sent 30,000 trucks with life-saving food and medicines into Syria from Turkey, Iraq and Jordan at four places annually authorized by the Security Council, Jens Laerke of the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said.
The humanitarian situation has become more acute with at least 300,000 civilians now on the run in Idlib, following a sharp escalation in hostilities in December, he said.
More than 3 million civilians remains trapped in the war zone, the vast majority women and children, and ""they currently have nowhere to go"", Laerke said.
It is critical to renew the provisions of the Security Council resolution, which expires on Friday, he said.
""Across northern Syria 4 million people in need are supported by the U.N. cross-border humanitarian assistance mechanism in total. And that includes 2.7 million in the northwest who rely solely on the operation for their assistance.
""We have made our position very clear, there is no plan B.""
The latest mass displacement follows weeks of renewed bombardment by Russian and Syrian government forces.
""Air strikes and shelling are now taking place in many towns and villages on a near daily basis,"" Mark Cutts, U.N. deputy regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, said in a statement voicing alarm at the ""deteriorating humanitarian situation in Idlib"".
At least 13 health facilities in Idlib have been hit since December and forced to suspend their operations, he said.
Turkey already hosts some 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the largest refugee population in the world, and President Tayyip Erdogan said last week it was taking steps with some difficulty to prevent another wave from crossing its border."

ST PETERSBURG (Reuters) - A St. Petersburg clinic that is run and partly owned by people with ties to President Vladimir Putin has provided medical treatment to Russian mercenaries injured abroad, according to three people with knowledge of military contractors being treated, a clinic employee, a reporter’s witness account and company records.
The previously unreported medical treatment for private military contractors wounded in combat overseas, including in Libya and Syria, shows fighters have received indirect support from the country's elite even as the Kremlin denies they fight abroad on its behalf. 
Under Russian law, all medical organizations are obliged to report combat injuries to the police for investigation and it's illegal for a Russian citizen to participate in armed conflict as a mercenary.
The clinic is owned by large insurance company AO Sogaz, which counts among its senior officials and owners relatives of Putin and others linked to the president, according to the SPARK database, which aggregates data from business registries.
The clinic’s general director, Vladislav Baranov, also has a business relationship with Putin’s elder daughter, Maria. Reuters has no evidence of the daughter's involvement in the treatment of military contractors.
Reached by phone, Baranov told Reuters: “Forget about our clinics, that’s my advice for you.” In response to written questions, he said: “I don’t want to communicate with you.”
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: “We have no information on this at all.” The defense ministry, Sogaz and Putin’s daughter did not respond to requests for comment.
Russian private military contractors have clandestinely fought in support of Russian forces in Syria and Ukraine, Reuters and other media have previously reported. The contractors are recruited by a private military group known as Wagner Group whose members are mostly ex-service personnel.
Wagner fighters were also deployed in Libya to support eastern commander Khalifa Haftar, according to two former Wagner military contractors. Haftar is battling against the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.
The Russian state denies it uses mercenaries and has said those fighting in Ukraine and Syria are volunteers. Putin has said that Russian private military contractors were present in Syria, but that they provided security services and that they have nothing to do with the Russian state or its army and have the right to work in any country as long as they don't violate Russian law by taking part in combat. [nS8N1YP037]
Putin, when asked at his annual news conference on Dec. 19 about the presence of Russian mercenaries in Libya, said: “Do you believe what Western media report? Do you believe everything?” Russia, he added, was in contact with both Libya’s internationally recognized prime minister, Fayez al-Serraj, and Khalifa Haftar.
Wagner Group's founder, Dmitry Utkin, couldn’t be reached for comment.
WOUNDED COMMANDER
Smoking a cigarette in the clinic’s backyard in late October, Alexander Kuznetsov said he had been to Libya and that Russians there were ""fighting international terrorism to protect Moscow's interests."" He sported bandages and attached to his arm was a metal device that is an external metal fixation device of the type used to treat complex bone injuries. He declined to discuss his injuries.
A former Wagner fighter who was treated at the clinic and another private military contractor, when presented with a photograph of Kuznetsov, identified him as the commander of a Wagner Group assault unit who had been injured while fighting in Libya. Kuznetsov confirmed he was a private military commander, but didn't specify for which group.
The clinic, which opened in 2010, is one of a string of private medical facilities Sogaz has opened across Russia, according to the company’s website.
The Sogaz clinic has offered services to Wagner fighters since at least 2016, according to the former Wagner fighter who was treated at the clinic. He said he had been treated for an injury in recent years in the same clinic along with five or six other wounded mercenaries. He had sustained the injury in Syria, he said.
Another Wagner contractor had received medical treatment at the Sogaz clinic after also being severely wounded in Syria, his mother told Reuters.
In both cases, medical services were free of charge for the fighters, the contractor and the mother said. They said they did not know who covered the expenses.
The mother said that one of the medical services her son had received cost $10,000, something she learned from medical documents. Reuters didn’t review these documents and was unable to confirm this.
Asked who was paying for his treatment, Kuznetsov, the injured commander, also said he did not know.
Sogaz provides Russian army personnel and members of Russia's National Guard with life and health insurance, according to an official government database of state contracts.
TIES TO PUTIN
Putin’s elder daughter is co-founder and a board member of another business that the clinic’s general director Baranov is also general director of, a medical company called AO Nomeko, according to company records in the SPARK database and the company’s website. Nomeko lists the Sogaz unit that runs the clinic treating mercenaries as one of its “partners” on its website, without providing more specifics.
She has previously pursued a biomedical career specializing in the endocrine system and did so using a married name, Faassen, Reuters has reported.
Putin’s daughter now uses Vorontsova as her last name, according to references to her previously published research articles on the website of the medical research institute where she works.
Maria has not publicly confirmed being Putin's daughter and the Russian president says little about his family life.
A police department in charge of St. Petersburg did not respond to a request for comment about whether the clinic had reported treatment of fighters injured overseas.
Sogaz’s deputy chief executive is Mikhail Putin, who according to local media is a son of one of Putin’s cousins. The Kremlin has confirmed he is a distant relative of the president.
A son of another Putin cousin, Mikhail Shelomov, owns a 12.5% stake in Sogaz through a company called Accept, according to official company records.
Yuri Kovalchuk, whom Putin has publicly referred to as a friend, and his wife hold a stake in Sogaz indirectly, according to company records. The couple own nearly half of a company that controls 32.3% of Sogaz through another firm called OOO Akvila, the records show.
And, Gazprom (MCX:GAZP) chief executive Alexei Miller, who worked at the St. Petersburg mayor’s office in the 1990s with Putin before he became president, chairs Sogaz's board of directors, according to the company’s website and company records.
Mikhail Putin, Shelomov, the Kovalchuks, and Miller didn’t respond to requests for comment about the clinic treating private military contractors injured in combat overseas. Gazprom declined to comment in response to questions addressed to Miller and Mikhail Putin.

Akvila and the company the Kovalchuks indirectly hold their stake in Sogaz via couldn’t be reached for comment.

1226,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 07:13AM ET</span>",Little-known Venezuela legislator becomes Maduro's choice for opposition leader,"By Brian Ellsworth
CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan lawmaker Luis Parra for years denounced abuses by the security forces of President Nicolas Maduro, berating police for forcing a family from its home for their political beliefs and accusing intelligence agents of raiding his own house.
But Parra rose from obscurity on Sunday to claim the leadership of the national congress, with the backing of Maduro's ruling Socialist Party. In dramatic scenes, Maduro's security forces blocked opposition lawmakers - including their leader Juan Guaido - from entering the legislature, allowing Socialist lawmakers to swear in Parra as the new head.
Though Parra's discourse still echoes that of the opposition - he described the Socialist government as a ""regime"" on Monday and decried the woeful state of the economy - he has said he wants to reduce conflict with Maduro and played down talk of pushing him from office.
""Just because we're part of the opposition doesn't mean we agree with confrontation,"" Parra told a news conference on Monday in the legislature building. ""We're building a road to reduce the polarization in this country.""
That marks a sharp departure from the stance of Guaido, who won a groundswell of popular support last year by labeling Maduro as a usurper and calling on the military to help remove him from office to end Venezuela's hyperinflationary collapse.
The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, which has created a broad sanctions program against Maduro, has already dismissed Parra's election as a farce and reiterated support for Guaido.
Parra's rise reflects Maduro's frequent tactic of using state institutions to sideline adversaries and then designating politicians of ambiguous allegiance as true opposition leaders - a group Maduro's critics describe as ""pseudo-opposition.""
Many denounced the divide-and-conquer strategy in the 2018 presidential vote, when authorities blocked Venezuela's main opposition leaders from running but allowed the candidacy of Henri Falcon, who described himself as a Maduro adversary despite breaking the opposition's boycott of the vote.
Guaido's election as head of Congress last year - after more senior opposition leaders had been detained or fled the country - presented Maduro with a hardline opponent who swiftly won international backing.
Government critics say Maduro's persistent attempts to undermine the opposition often involve bribes and intimidation, both of which were widely denounced by opposition leaders in the run-up to Sunday's parliamentary session.
Socialist Party officials respond that opposition leaders' elitism and their refusal to listen to complaints within their own ranks are the true cause of defections.
Maduro was quick to celebrate Parra's rise.
""We could tell a change was coming in the National Assembly, a rebellion within the opposition legislators,"" Maduro said.
EMBROILED IN SCANDAL
Parra was elected to congress in 2015 to represent the northwestern state of Yaracuy, and in 2017 ran an unsuccessful campaign for governor of that state. Once in congress, he served on the natural resources subcommission.
He was a little-known figure until he became embroiled in a corruption scandal in December, along with eight other opposition lawmakers.
He and the others were kicked out of their parties after a local media report said they had used their positions in the legislature to burnish the reputation of a businessman linked to Maduro's government. Guaido said he suspected they had been bribed to do so.
Parra and the others have denied the accusations.
Parra's designation as congress chief followed a confused session, culminating in a state-television declaration that he had won the vote.
He initially said he had received 86 votes, but later cut this number down to 81. The legislature has 167 seats.
When asked by reporters for the full list of the legislators who voted for his leadership, Parra said the official tally - which is typically released the same day - was not available. He has declined to provide a time frame for when it will be released.
On Sunday evening, Guaido held a rival vote that was broadcast over the internet in which 100 legislators identified by name backed him for re-election."
1227,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 07, 2020 07:07AM ET</span>",Tripoli-aligned forces say they quit Libya's Sirte to avoid bloodshed,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Forces aligned with Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord said on Tuesday they had withdrawn from the strategic coastal city of Sirte to avoid bloodshed, after their eastern rivals rapidly entered it and took control.
Holding Sirte would be an important gain for eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar, who since April has waged a military offensive on the capital, Tripoli, home to the GNA, to try to extend his control across the vast, mainly desert country.
Sirte is just west of important oil export terminals, also controlled by Haftar, and is strategically positioned on supply routes between eastern, western and southern Libya.
The advance of Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) comes as Turkey prepares to send military advisors and experts to Libya to help shore up the GNA, part of rising international involvement in Libya's conflict.
""Our forces took a decision, after studying the situation, to withdraw outside Sirte, then await orders,"" the Sirte Protection Force, a GNA ally, said in a statement.
""Our forces still retain their full capabilities and our withdrawal from Sire is not the end,"" it added.
The LNA said on Monday it had taken Sirte in a swift advance preceded by air strikes.
Sirte lies in the center of Libya's Mediterranean coast, and has been controlled by GNA-aligned forces since they ejected Islamic State from the city with the help of U.S. air strikes in late 2016.
The Sirte Protection Force said it had withdrawn ""to save the blood of civilians and the youth of the forces"" in Sirte, adding that the LNA got help from ""sleeper cells"" in the city of 120,000.
Many of the Sirte Protection Force were from Misrata, a city to the northwest that led the campaign against Islamic State and is a key source of military power for the GNA.
On Tuesday, an LNA military source said LNA forces clashed with Misratan forces in Abu Grain area, between Sirte an Misrata.
The Sirte Protection Force accused LNA fighters of burning homes and committing theft and looting in Sirte after entering the city on Monday. Forces loyal to Haftar denied any violations.
""These are neither our actions or the Libyan army's actions. On the contrary, we were received with cheers,"" an LNA spokesman told Reuters.
Since launching a bitter campaign for Benghazi, Libya's second city, in 2014, Haftar has gradually expanded his territorial control across the north African country.
Haftar's LNA has received material and military support from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Egypt, according U.N. experts and diplomats."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's air force deployed four fighter jets to the South China Sea on Tuesday in a stand-off with Beijing after Jakarta protested over a Chinese violation of its exclusive economic zone.
The stand-off began in mid-December when a Chinese coast guard vessel, accompanying Chinese fishing boats, entered waters off the coast of Indonesia's northern Natuna islands, prompting Jakarta to summon Beijing's ambassador.
The issue has soured Indonesia's generally friendly relationship with China, its biggest trading partner and a major investor in Southeast Asia's largest country.
Fajar Adriyanto, the air force spokesman, said four F-16 jets had been conducting flights over the islands, though he also played down fears of any confrontation with Beijing.
""They're doing standard patrols to protect our sovereign area. It just so happened that they're patrolling Natuna,"" Adriyanto said. ""We don't have the order to start a war with China.""
The South China Sea is a global trade route with rich fishing grounds and energy reserves and China claims most of it based on what it says is its historic activity. But Southeast Asian countries, supported by the United States and much of the rest of the world, say such claims have no legal basis.
On Monday, Indonesia said it was mobilizing fishermen to the northern Natuna region and had deployed several naval ships.
JOINT RESPONSIBILITY
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Tuesday Beijing had ""opened diplomatic channels"" with Indonesia since the latest incident, and said ""both countries shoulder responsibility for maintaining regional peace and stability"".
There has been no negotiation with the Chinese vessels as of Tuesday, Nursyawal Embun, director of sea operations of Indonesia's Maritime Security Agency, told Reuters.
According to data from Maritime Traffic, a ship tracking website, at least two Chinese ships -- Zhongguohaijing and Haijing 35111 -- were in waters on the edge of Indonesia's exclusive economic zone on Tuesday, approximately 200km (124 miles) off Indonesia's Riau Islands.
The ships were within China's unilaterally-declared ""nine-dash line"", which marks a vast expanse of the South China Sea that it claims, including large swathes of Vietnam's continental shelf where it has awarded oil concessions.
The China Coast Guard ship Haijing 35111 is one of a handful of Chinese ships that was involved in a months-long standoff with Vietnamese ships last year near the offshore oil block in the disputed waters, which fall within Hanoi's exclusive economic zone.
Luhut Pandjaitan, the coordinating minister in Indonesia's cabinet overseeing resources and investment, told reporters on Tuesday that Indonesia's sovereignty was not negotiable, despite China's economic importance for his country.
""I would not sell our sovereignty for investment, never,"" he said. ""I'm not stupid.""

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservative Sebastian Kurz returned to power on Tuesday as his coalition cabinet with the Greens was sworn in almost eight months after his alliance with the far right collapsed in the wake of a video sting.
The about-face was a political necessity for the 33-year-old, who emerged relatively unscathed and even gained voters after the scandal in which far right leader Heinz-Christian Strache was shown offering to fix government contracts at a dinner party in Ibiza. 
With the far right in disarray after Strache's resignation, Kurz has formed an awkward alliance with the left-wing Greens, who long railed against his hard line on immigration and ""political Islam"". They have struck a coalition deal that twins many of those policies and tax cuts with environmental measures.
""After Ibiza ... and the parliamentary election in autumn, the circle is now closing,"" President Alexander Van der Bellen, a former Greens leader, said as he swore in the new cabinet, who did not give speeches. ""The carefully rebuilt (public) trust must now be strengthened."" 
Austria joins Sweden and Finland in having the Greens in government at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change.
In contrast to those fellow European Union member states, Austria's Greens are not governing with the center-left, making this an interesting test case. German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives could opt for a similar coalition after an election due by next year.
CAN IT LAST?
Whether the Austrian experiment can last five years until the next scheduled election is likely to depend on whether the Greens can show supporters they obtained enough concrete results from their alliance with an ideological adversary. 
Kurz's People's Party (OVP) and the Greens have carved up ministries roughly in proportion to their scores in the Sept. 29 parliamentary election, which the OVP won with 37.5% of votes. The Greens came fourth on 13.9%. The OVP will control ministries including finance, interior and defense.
The Greens are in government for the first time. 
Many Greens have, however, baulked at measures in the deal including extending a ban on headscarves in schools until the age of 14 and preventive custody for people deemed a threat to public order but who have yet to commit a crime. It also defers a tax overhaul to better price in carbon emissions until 2022.

Asked by ORF radio if that timeline was too slow given the wildfires in Australia, Kurz said: ""I do not think it is a good idea to turn Austrian politics on its head because of bush fires in Australia."" He has said tax cuts are his priority this year.

Since Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives won a large majority at a December election, Britain's EU exit at the end of January has become a certainty. Lawmakers will on Tuesday continue debating the legislation required to enact it.
A group of pro-Brexit members of parliament have put forward an amendment to that legislation, seeking to enshrine in law that Big Ben should be sounded at 2300 GMT on Jan. 31, the moment Brexit is officially due to take place.
The 13.7-tonne bell has been largely silent since 2017 while renovation works are carried out on the Elizabeth Tower which houses it, sounding only for important events such as New Year's Eve celebrations. 
The work on the tower, one of Britain's most photographed buildings, is not due to be completed until 2021.
""Regardless of allegiance to Leave or Remain, this will undoubtedly be an iconic moment in this country’s history,"" Conservative lawmaker Mark Francois, who put forward the amendment, wrote in an article for the ConservativeHome website.
""To mark this momentous occasion, I, along with 50 other Members of Parliament, am now campaigning to allow Big Ben to chime our freedom as well.""
The amendment has so far been signed by more than 40 lawmakers, mainly Conservatives. If selected by the speaker of the House of Commons, it could be put to a vote later on Tuesday.

It demands the occasion ""be marked by the sounding of the hourly chimes including eleven strikes of the principal bell (Big Ben) of the Great Clock in the Elizabeth Tower of the Houses of Parliament"".

The ministers had already been scheduled to meet with their Italian counterpart to discuss the crisis in Libya, but opted to hold separate discussions on Iran amid the crisis that erupted following the U.S. killing of an Iranian general.
Iran said on Sunday that it would scrap limits on enriching uranium, taking a further step back from the 2015 agreement with six major powers, which Washington abandoned in 2018 but the European countries are trying to salvage.
Britain's foreign office said the E3 - Britain, France and Germany, would meet to discuss ways to defuse tensions between the United States and Iran.
""The talks will also cover the nuclear deal following Iran’s latest announcement on Sunday that it is withdrawing from further commitments in the deal,"" a British foreign office spokesman said. A French diplomatic source confirmed the talks.
France's foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Monday the substance of the Iran nuclear deal was slowly disappearing and European powers would decide in coming days whether to launch a dispute resolution process over Iranian violations. Diplomats told Reuters on Monday that the European parties to the deal would launch the process this week.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's parliament on Tuesday approved extending the term of the army chief for another three years despite the objections of some parties, which accuse the military of heavy-handed tactics in its anti-militant operations along the Afghan border.
Pakistan has been ruled by the powerful military for about half its history and tension between civilian governments and the top generals often dominates politics. Any effort by a military chief to consolidate power is viewed with suspicion.
But critics of Prime Minister Imran Khan say his government enjoys the support of the military which is why the government approved the extension for Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa in August.
The government cited a worsening national security situation with old rival India as justification for the extension for Bajwa at the end of the usual three-year term.
But in a surprise ruling, the Supreme Court struck down the extension in November, ordering the government and army to produce legal provisions and arguments for the reappointment, pitting the judiciary against the government and powerful military.
The government responded by drafting legislation which the lower house of parliament approved on Tuesday, clearing the way for the extension. It must still be approved by the upper house, which is expected.
""All parties shunned their differences and stood united in the best national interest,"" Information Minister Firdous Ashiq Awan told reporters outside the parliament.
The two main opposition parties have a long history of clashing with the military but nevertheless backed the legislation, largely, analysts say, to avoid a damaging confrontation.
Two smaller parties and some members of parliament from troubled northwestern districts along Afghan border opposed it. They accuse the military of committing rights abuses during its anti-militant operations. The army rejects such accusations.
""This parliament's majority is fake, this prime minister is fake,"" said Asad Mahmood, parliamentary leader of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F) religious political party, which says it unfairly lost seats in the northwest to Khan's party.
""We will not support any such amendment in the law by a fake parliament.""
The military sets defense and security policy and also dominates foreign affairs. Recently, it has also had a role in framing economic policies.
Opposition activists and rights groups have also accused the military under Bajwa of meddling in politics, limiting civil liberties and muzzling the media.
The military denies interfering in politics or curbing freedoms."

About 2.3 million people from the Philippines are working in the Middle East as domestic helpers, construction workers, engineers and nurses. 
President Rodrigo Duterte has ordered the armed forces to prepare air and naval assets for the evacuation of Filipinos in Iraq, Iran and nearby Arab countries, his spokesman Salvador Panelo said on Tuesday. 
Saying he was deeply worried about the prospect of a ""protracted war"", Duterte told reporters he sent a special envoy to Tehran and Baghdad to get assurances that Filipinos would be provided safe passage in case of evacuation. 
""We have so many Filipinos working mainly in the Middle East. I am nervous. Iran seems to be hell-bent on a retaliation, which I think will come,"" Duterte said in a speech on Monday.
There are close to 7,000 Filipinos working and living in Iraq and more than 1,000 in Iran, according to government data. 
Defence Secretary Delfin Lorenzana, who heads a newly created committee to prepare the evacuation, said the government is readying aircraft to ferry Filipinos in Iraq and Iran who wish to come home or be evacuated to safer areas. 
""We can send transportation to fetch them,"" Lorenza told reporters, adding that hiring a cruise ship was among the things the government was considering to safely evacuate those who would wish to be repatriated.
Iran is considering 13 scenarios to avenge Friday's killing of Qassem Soleimani by a U.S. drone attack in Iraq, a senior Tehran official said on Tuesday as the general's body was brought to his hometown for burial.
Filipinos in the Middle East sent home $5.4 billion in remittances in January to October last year, accounting for a fifth of total remittances for that period, making the region a major source of foreign exchange inflows which help drive growth in the consumption-led Philippine economy.
In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia's Foreign Minister Saifuddin Abdullah advised Malaysians to defer nonessential travel to the region, ""in particular areas where the security situation is critical"", and for citizens in the region to register with their nearest foreign mission.

""The ministry advises all Malaysians residing, or currently traveling to the region to be more vigilant and take the necessary precautions to ensure their safety and security,” Saifuddin told at a press conference.

Officers killed two attackers and recovered two assault rifles and bomb-making materials, police spokesman Charles Owino said.
The United States has sent more troops to Kenya to reinforce security after al Shabaab killed three Americans on Sunday in an attack a military base in Kenya used by U.S. forces.
In the latest incident, police said militants fired at a mast belonging to Kenya's leading operator Safaricom and at police guarding the facility.
""Officers manning the mast and the base together with special forces were able to repulse them,"" police said.
The raid took place in northern Garissa county, which neighbors Somalia. The attackers did not damage the telecom network, police said. 
A teacher and a child were among the dead, Owino said.
Al Shabaab frequently carries out attacks in Kenya in retaliation for Kenya sending troops into Somalia in 2011 after a series of cross-border attacks and kidnappings. 
The Kenyans were later absorbed into an African Union peacekeeping force, now 21,000-strong, which supports the shaky, Western-backed Somali government. 
Al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab has waged an insurgency in Somalia since 2008, aiming to topple the government and impose its own strict interpretation of Sharia law.
On Sunday, al Shabaab destroyed six aircraft and killed three Americans during the attack on Camp Simba in coastal Lamu country. On Thursday, the insurgents killed three civilians on a bus in the same county.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian firefighters used a break from searing temperatures on Tuesday to strengthen containment lines around huge wildfires as the financial and environmental costs of the crisis mounted.
More than 10.3 million hectares (25.5 million acres) of land an area the size of South Korea - have been razed by bushfires across the country in recent weeks, according to the latest data, with the southeast particularly hard hit.
Imagery posted online from the Himawari 8 Japanese satellite and NASA's Earth Observatory showed plumes of smoke from the fires reaching as far as South America.
Firefighters on the ground were making the most of a few days of cooler temperatures in the southeast to prepare for the expected return of heat and wind later this week that is expected to fan existing blazes and spark new ones.
""We need to remain vigilant,"" Andrew Crisp, Victoria state's emergency management commissioner, told reporters.
""We talk about benign conditions, and the fire is suppressed, but it is still there. It is still tinder dry.""
Australia's bushfire season started earlier than normal this year following a three-year drought that has left much of the country's bushland vulnerable to fires.
Thousands of people have been left homeless, while many in rural towns have spent days without electricity, telecommunications and, in some cases, drinking water. Military-coordinated rescue and support efforts are going on.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the crisis would have a significant economic impact as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg met chief executives of insurers Insurance Australia Group, Suncorp Group and QBE Insurance Group, and local heads of Germany's Allianz (DE:ALVG) and Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Group, plus heads of Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Westpac Banking Group.
Morrison on Monday pledged A$2 billion ($1.39 billion) to a newly created National Bushfire Recovery Agency.
The Insurance Council of Australia increased its estimate for damage claims from the fires to more than A$700 million, with claims expected to jump when more fire-hit areas are accessible. 
Following are some highlights of what is happening in the Australian bushfires crisis:
* Two men reported missing in New South Wales have been found, police said. 
* Forty-eight U.S. firefighters are scheduled to arrive in Australia on Wednesday, officials said, joining 39 compatriots already on the ground. A further 18 incident management personnel from the United States and Canada will arrive on Wednesday.
* Prime Minister Morrison said he spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday, while British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has also offered support.
* Morrison attended the funeral of volunteer firefighter Andrew O’Dwyer, who was killed along with colleague Geoffrey Keaton on Dec. 19 after a burnt tree fell in the path of their firetruck, causing it to roll.
* Data showed the fires were beginning to have an effect on the economy. The ANZ gauge of consumer confidence fell last week to its lowest level in more than four years, while its job advertisement data recorded the biggest monthly drop in seven months in December. 
* The military was deployed to help bury an estimated 4,000 dead sheep and cattle.
* Authorities said the number of people calling for urgent medical care in Victoria jumped 51% on Monday as smoke covered the state.
* There were 132 fires ablaze across New South Wales state, but all were back at the ""advice"" level, the lowest alert rating.
* Victoria state had 39 fires with 13 ""watch and act"" alerts. 
* Almost 1,600 homes have been destroyed in NSW, Australia's most populous state, authorities said. In Victoria state, authorities believe 300 homes have been destroyed.
* Insurers have received 8,985 bushfire-related claims in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland since the Insurance Council declared a bushfire catastrophe on Nov. 8. The claims are estimated to have a loss value of A$700 million. The council recorded the destruction of 1,838 residential properties.
* A member of parliament from Morrison's party was criticized for an appearance on the ""Good Morning Britain""  ITV  (LON:ITV) program during which he said there was no link between climate change and the bushfire crisis. ""There is no link, the facts that cause the fires are the drought and the drying of the environment,"" lawmaker Craig Kelly said.

Maynilad Water Services Inc and Manila Water Co Inc serve a combined 16 million customers under 25-year concession deals signed in 1997, but President Rodrigo Duterte labeled the agreements ""onerous and disadvantageous"" for ratepayers.
The firebrand leader in December ordered criminal charges filed against the two companies, including their billionaire owners. Earlier that month, they had won arbitration cases in Singapore against the government.
""The chief executive is giving the water concessionaires the option of accepting the new contracts minus the onerous provisions without any guarantee of not being criminally prosecuted together with those who conspired to craft the very onerous contracts,"" Salvador Panelo, Duterte's spokesman, told a news conference.
""Should Maynilad and Manila Water refuse to accept the new agreements, the president will order the cancellation of their present water contracts, order the nationalization of water services in their respective areas of operation,"" Panelo said.
Manila Water and Maynilad did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The market cheered the news that the two firms would be allowed to continue to operate if they adhered to the government's conditions.
Manila Water, which fell as much as 73% and lost as much as $556 million in market value last month, rallied nearly 15% on Tuesday after the announcement, while parent firm Ayala Corp, which shed up to $875 million in market capitalization, gained 1.5%.
Maynilad owners Metro Pacific Investments Corp and DMCI Holdings Inc, rose 3.2% and 3.9%, respectively, on Tuesday. The two firms collectively lost as much as $1.45 billion in market value after Duterte's criticism.
Last month, the state water regulator canceled a 15-year extension of the water utilities' concession after pressure from Duterte. The existing concessions will expire in 2022.
The Permanent Court of Arbitration in Singapore last month ordered the Philippine government to pay Manila Water 7.4 billion pesos ($145.55 million) to recoup foregone revenues from rate increases that were rejected by regulators. Maynilad won a separate arbitration last year.
The companies had said they would forfeit any damage claims to avoid angering the president, who enjoys high public approval ratings."

The vote pits President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party against Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang party, which favors close ties with China.
Taiwan is decked out in campaign posters and flags, and as the candidates appeal for support from the backs of trucks, in markets and at temples, the atmosphere is ripe for artistic license.
Kuang Yi, who calls himself the ""mad artist"", fingerpaints next to a small lake in the artist village he built as a tourist attraction in the southern city of Tainan from hundred-year-old bricks. He said he tries not to take sides in his art.
""I have friends on both sides, they're all good friends,"" he says, referring to Taiwan's political camps that are divided first and foremost by their China policy.
On the other side of the island, in the northern city of Taoyuan, manga artist Wei Zong-cheng takes a less neutral approach.
While Tsai is colored green, the DPP's color, Han is shaded purple rather than the Kuomintang's blue.
Wei says that is because he has mixed in a little red to show Han's China-friendly stance, a reference to the color of China's ruling Communist Party.
Wei has also been drawing political cartoons for years for Taiwanese media.
But in Taiwan's fast-moving political scene, where new scandals and controversies emerge seemingly every day, the cartoons can have a short shelf life.
""When a big scandal comes out in the morning (after publishing) it will mean that we didn't get it right,"" he said."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Mexicans seeking asylum in the United States could be sent to Guatemala under a bilateral agreement signed by the Central American nation last year, according to documents sent to U.S. asylum officers in recent days and seen by Reuters.
In a Jan. 4 email, field office staff at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) were told Mexican nationals will be included in the populations ""amenable"" to the agreement with Guatemala. 
The agreement, brokered last July between the administration of Republican President Donald Trump and the outgoing Guatemalan government, allows U.S. immigration officials to send migrants requesting asylum at the U.S.-Mexican border to apply for protection in Guatemala instead.
Mexico objects to the plan, its foreign ministry said in a statement late on Monday, adding that it would be working with authorities to find ""better options"" for those that could be affected. 
Trump has made clamping down on unlawful migration a top priority of his presidency and a major theme of his 2020 re-election campaign. His administration penned similar deals with Honduras and El Salvador last year.
U.S. Democrats and pro-migrant groups have opposed the move and contend asylum seekers will face danger in Guatemala, where the murder rate is five times that of the United States, according to 2017 data compiled by the World Bank. The country's asylum office is tiny and thinly staffed and critics have argued it lacks the capacity to properly vet a significant increase in cases.
Guatemalan President-elect Alejandro Giammattei, who takes office this month, has said he will review the agreement.
Acting Deputy U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Ken Cuccinelli said in a tweet in December that Mexicans were being considered for inclusion under the agreement.
USCIS referred questions to DHS, which referred to Cuccinelli's tweet. Mexico's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for Guatemala's immigration institute, said that since the agreement was implemented in November, the United States has sent 52 migrants to the country. Only six have applied for asylum in Guatemala, Mena said.
On Monday, an additional 33 Central American migrants arrived on a flight to Guatemala City, she said. 
Unaccompanied minors cannot be sent to Guatemala under the agreement, which now applies only to migrants from Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico, according to the guidance documents. Exceptions are made if the migrants can establish that they are ""more likely than not"" to be persecuted or tortured in Guatemala based on their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.
Numbers of Central American migrants apprehended at the border fell sharply in the second part of 2019 after Mexico deployed National Guard troops to stem the flow, under pressure from Trump.
Overall, border arrests are expected to drop again in December for the seventh straight month, a Homeland Security official told Reuters last week, citing preliminary data. 
The U.S. government says another reason for the reduction in border crossings is a separate program, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols, that has forced more than 56,000 non-Mexican migrants to wait in Mexico for their U.S. immigration court hearings.

With fewer Central Americans at the border, U.S. attention has turned to Mexicans crossing illegally or requesting asylum. About 150,000 Mexican single adults were apprehended at the border in fiscal 2019, down sharply from previous decades but still enough to bother U.S. immigration hawks.

SEOUL (Reuters) - There is a ""desperate need"" for practical ways to improve ties with North Korea, the South's President Moon Jae-in said on Tuesday, adding that he was ready to meet with the reclusive leader in Pyongyang repeatedly if necessary.
Moon, sidelined from his leading role in the diplomatic effort with North Korea in 2018, said he regretted the past year's lack of progress in negotiations.
In an annual New Year's speech in Seoul, Moon called for new talks with Kim Jong Un, and vowed to keep up work to facilitate U.S.-North Korea communication.
""In a time of deadlock in U.S.-North Korea talks - and where we are even concerned about a step backward in inter-Korean relations - we are in desperate need of practical ways to improve inter-Korean cooperation,"" he said.
He also said he would continue to push for restarting the Kaesong Industrial Complex and tours to Mt. Kumgang, and mentioned border cooperation without elaborating. He added the joint 2032 Olympics bid would be a unifying event, as would completing the inter-Korean railroad.
""We want to make an era where separation is no longer a roadblock for peace and prosperity for South and North Korea,"" he said.
North Korea has been unresponsive to other recent overtures from Seoul, and cooperation projects between the neighbors have stalled in the face of international sanctions that bar most business with the North. 
Pyongyang has expressed frustration at what it calls Washington's lack of flexibility, while U.S. officials say it must take more concrete steps to dismantle its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs before sanctions are eased.
""The momentum for U.S.-North Korea talks must continue,"" Moon said. ""Provocations and threats are not helpful for anyone.""
Over the New Year, Kim said he planned to further develop nuclear programs and introduce a ""new strategic weapon"" in the near future, though he signaled there was still room for dialogue with the United States.
Security and prosperity on the Korean peninsula are dependent on resolving international tensions, but the two Koreas could achieve progress through cooperation, Moon said.

""I suggest South and North Korea put our heads together,"" he said.

The appointment of a new head of the Chinese government's most important office in Hong Kong, Luo Huining, was unexpectedly announced at the weekend in a sign of Beijing's frustration with the latter's handling of the crisis. 
The Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region reports to China's State Council or cabinet, and is the main platform for Beijing to project its influence in the city.
""I would work closely with director Luo in the coming future, committing to 'one country, two systems', and the Basic Law, for Hong Kong to ... return to the right path,"" Lam said in her first news conference of the year, referring to the city's mini-constitution and system of governance.
Luo on Monday, in his first remarks since taking office, used the same language, saying he hoped the city would return to the right path.
In November, Reuters reported exclusively that Beijing was considering replacing the former liaison office chief, Wang Zhimin, who had come under criticism for failing to anticipate public opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill.
Lam did not mention the protests in her opening remarks, which focused on health risks related an outbreak of a respiratory virus in the city of Wuhan in China. Authorities have identified 21 cases in Hong Kong, of which seven have been released from hospital.
Clashes between police and protesters have intensified over the year-end holiday following an early-December lull in violence after an overwhelming win by the pro-democracy camp in city district council elections yielded no government concessions.
Anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong have evolved over the months into a broad pro-democracy campaign with demands for universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into complaints of police brutality.
The police maintain they have acted with restraint.
Many people in Hong Kong are angered by what they see as Beijing ever-tightening grip on the city which was promised a high degree of autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" framework when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing denies interference and blames the West for fomenting the unrest.

The protest movement is supported by 59% of city residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute and 57% of them wanted Lam to resign.

Monday's comments by the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, came as tensions escalate between the two countries after the United States killed Iran's most prominent military commander, Qassem Soleimani, in Baghdad on Friday.
Under the 1947 U.N. ""headquarters agreement,"" the United States is generally required to allow access to the United Nations for foreign diplomats. But Washington says it can deny visas for ""security, terrorism and foreign policy"" reasons.
The U.S. State Department declined immediate comment. Iran's mission to the United Nations said: ""We have seen the media reports, but we have not received any official communication from either the U.S. or the U.N. regarding Foreign Minister Zarif's visa.""
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric declined to comment on the U.S. denial of a visa for Zarif.
Zarif wanted to attend a meeting of the Security Council on Thursday on the topic of upholding the U.N. Charter. The meeting and Zarif's travel had been planned before the latest flare-up in tensions between Washington and Tehran.
The Security Council meeting would have given Zarif a global spotlight to publicly criticize the United States for killing Soleimani.
Iran's U.N. envoy, Majid Takht Ravanchi, has described the killing of Soleimani as ""an obvious example of State terrorism and, as a criminal act, constitutes a gross violation of the fundamental principles of international law, including, in particular ... the Charter of the United Nations.""
Zarif last traveled to New York in September for the annual gathering of world leaders at the United Nations - after the United States sanctioned him for implementing ""the reckless agenda of Iran's Supreme Leader.""
The sanctions block any property or interests Zarif has in the United States, but he said he had none.
Zarif also attended U.N. meetings in April and July. During his July visit, Washington imposed tight travel restrictions on Zarif and diplomats at Iran's mission to the United Nations, confining them to a small section of New York City.
U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres spoke with U.S Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier on Monday. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement the pair discussed events in the Middle East and that Pompeo ""expressed his appreciation"" for Guterres' diplomatic efforts."

President Nicolas Maduro's government announced Sunday that Luis Parra, who was expelled from the First Justice opposition party in late 2019 due to corruption allegations that he has denied, was now parliament chief.
He was installed after troops with riot shields blocked opposition leader Juan Guaido from entering parliament for what was expected to be his re-election as head of congress.
Despite wielding little real power, the mostly ceremonial legislative body has been a thorn in the side of Maduro and what critics call his stranglehold on power in the crisis-torn country. Guaido is recognized by dozens of nations as Venezuela's rightful leader. 
Parra, who has said he is still an opponent of Maduro, told reporters the first step toward ending the South American country's ""politics of polarization"" was to appoint a new electoral council. The current council is made up of five main directors and three alternates, some of whom have been dismissed by opposition leaders as biased in Maduro's favor.
""We are working on achieving a political change in Venezuela with respect,"" Parra said from the parliament building. ""Our efforts are focused on holding clean, free elections immediately.""
He did not provide details about when the new electoral authorities could be named. He also did not provide details about how he planned to manage the first legislative session on Tuesday. Guaido has pledged to attend the session and said he will attempt to preside over the proceedings. 
""Risking our skin? Well, of course,"" Guaido told reporters on Monday, referring to possible confrontations at the upcoming session.
After Parra's swearing-in on Sunday, Guaido, who had been pursuing re-election to a second one-year term, held a separate session elsewhere in which 100 lawmakers, out of a total of 167, backed his bid. 
He has been backed by the United States, the European Union, and a dozen Latin American countries. U.S. special envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams said Washington was looking at additional sanctions to put pressure on Maduro after Sunday's events.
Russia, one of Maduro's key international backers, said the election of a new parliament leader in Venezuela was the result of democratic procedure.

Guaido said Moscow was ""interfering in our affairs.""

1250,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 09:12PM ET</span>","Between U.S. and Iran, EU powers try mediation and pressure to ease crisis","By Luke Baker, John Irish and Robin Emmott
LONDON/PARIS/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Germany, Britain and France are scrambling to keep talks with Iran over its 2015 nuclear agreement alive despite Tehran having all but torn up the deal after the United States killed its top military commander.
In its first formal response to the killing of Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike at Baghdad airport, Iran said on Sunday it would abandon limits on its enrichment of uranium, further breaching a central component of the deal it struck with six major powers.
Since Iran did not say how far it would take enrichment while reaffirming cooperation with U.N. inspectors monitoring its nuclear activity, European Union officials found positive elements in the statement and the potential for de-escalation.
At the same time, EU foreign ministers will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels on Friday to discuss ways to save the deal via pressure if necessary, a step that could lead to the reimposition of U.N. sanctions on Tehran.
""The deal is all but dead, but we will do everything to slow and limit the (nuclear) proliferation slope that has been taken and try to save what can be saved,"" a European diplomat said.
A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said the deal struck between Iran and the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany was not yet dead and two-way communication was ongoing. ""Our goal remains to save the agreement,"" the spokesman said. ""We are in talks on that.""
As has been the case since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018, Britain, France and Germany find themselves as mediators, trying to convince Iran to stick with the pact and the Americans that they are tough-minded allies who will not be deceived by Tehran.
In a joint statement issued after Iran's announcement on enrichment, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was an ""urgent need for de-escalation"".
""We specifically call on Iran to refrain from further violent action or proliferation, and urge Iran to reverse all measures inconsistent with the JCPOA,"" they said, referencing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, the deal's formal name.
In the wake of Soleimani's killing, which came in response to stepped-up attacks on U.S. assets by Iranian-backed militias in Iraq, tensions in the region have risen to their highest level in more than a decade, making mediation more difficult.
Compounding the frustration on the European side is the fact they were given no advanced warning of Trump's decision to kill Soleimani despite its potential to destabilize the region.
Nuclear experts interpreted Iran's statement as leaving the door open to talks. They said it was positive that Tehran had not threatened to enrich uranium to a fissile purity of 20% - a critical threshold attained before 2015 that moved it much closer to the 90% concentration required for bomb material - and that IAEA inspections would continue.
""This is softer than it could have been and leaves room for the possibility of negotiations,"" said Mark Fitzpatrick, an associate fellow and non-proliferation specialist at the International Institute for Strategic Studies.
""It is ominous that Iran is declaring all limits off. We have to see what it actually does, however.""
CARROT AND STICK
While European diplomats said the first priority was to halt further escalation toward armed conflict, they are concerned about the unpredictability of the Trump administration and aware that they have little to offer Iran to stick with the JCPOA.
France in the past talked about providing Tehran with credit lines to ease the pressure of U.S. sanctions, and Britain, France and Germany created a payment mechanism for humanitarian and food trade, but it is not yet working a year on.
Overall they have been unable to deliver on what Iran really wants for remaining in the deal - the end of sanctions and freedom to sell its oil. With Soleimani's death, the possibility of those steps looks even less likely.
If forced to choose, the Europeans may have little option but to side with the Trump administration.
In that vein, the joint German-British-French statement took a tough line with Iran over its ""negative role"" in the region and did not refer at all to the U.S. strike on Soleimani. That may satisfy Washington - but aggravate Tehran.
""If you look at how the E3 have reacted, they are edging closer and closer to the Americans. I can't see them changing that path, but they also have to keep dialogue open with Iran. It's a question of timing,"" said a Western diplomat.
As well as pushing to maintain talks, European officials are exploring what sticks they could use to corral Iran.
The JCPOA includes a dispute resolution mechanism that if activated would ratchet up the pressure on the Islamic Republic, bringing closer the possibility of reimposing United Nations sanctions that were rescinded under the 2015 deal.
Officials said such a step could be taken as early as this week, with EU foreign ministers set to discuss it on Friday. Yet it was unclear what reaction it might provoke from Iran, or whether the Trump administration would view it as sufficient."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish lawmakers are expected to vote by the narrowest of margins on Tuesday to confirm Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez as head of a left-wing coalition government.
In a parliamentary session scheduled for 12 p.m. (1100 GMT) - the second vote in three days - Sanchez looks set to win the support of just enough legislators to form a cabinet and so break the country's current political gridlock.
After two inconclusive general elections in 2019, Sanchez's Socialist party has allied with far-left Unidas Podemos, though the two parties' combined 155 seats are not enough for a majority in Spain's highly fragmented 350-seat parliament.
In his first attempt on Sunday, Sanchez fell short of the absolute majority required to confirm him as prime minister in a first vote in parliament. Spanish law lowers the bar to a simple majority in a second vote held at least 48 hours after the first.
With the conservative People's Party and far-right Vox - the second and third largest parties - refusing to back the coalition, victory for Sanchez hinges on the support of small regional parties that each control a handful of seats or, rather, their abstention.
On Sunday, Sanchez secured a majority of just one, with 166 ""yes"" votes against 165 ""no"", while 18 legislators abstained.
Podemos legislator Aina Vidal, who was not present on Sunday for health reasons, said via her twitter account that she would vote on Tuesday, strengthening marginally Sanchez's position.
To gain acquiescence from Catalonia's largest separatist party, Esquerra Republica de Catalunya (ERC), Sanchez last week agreed to hold a dialogue over the future of Catalonia if he is confirmed. He agreed to submit the dialogue's conclusions to Catalan voters.
Sanchez and Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias said they would push for tax increases on high-income earners and companies. The coalition also intends to roll back labor reforms passed by a previous conservative government.
Without a reliable majority in parliament, however, the coalition would likely struggle to pass legislation.
The previous minority government in Spain, also headed by Sanchez, was forced to throw in the towel after less than a year when Catalan separatists withdrew their support."

BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has no plans to pull its troops out of Iraq, Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Monday, following reports by Reuters and other media of an American military letter informing Iraq officials about the repositioning of troops in preparation to leave the country.
The developments came in the aftermath of Friday's drone strike in Baghdad ordered by U.S. President Donald Trump that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, widely seen as Iran's second most powerful figure behind Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Khamenei, 80, wept in grief with hundreds of thousands of mourners thronging the streets of Tehran at Soleimani's funeral on Monday.
Word of the letter came a day after Iran's demand for U.S. forces to withdraw from the region gained traction when Iraq's parliament passed a resolution calling for all foreign troops to leave the country.
To view a pdf of the letter, click https://static.reuters.com/resources/media/editorial/20200106/letter.pdf 
The letter said U.S.-led coalition forces would be using helicopters to evacuate. Several were heard flying over Baghdad on Monday night, although it was not immediately clear if that was a related development. 
""There's been no decision whatsoever to leave Iraq,"" Esper told Pentagon reporters when asked about the letter, adding there were no plans issued to prepare to leave.
""I don't know what that letter is ... We're trying to find out where that's coming from, what that is. But there's been no decision made to leave Iraq. Period.""
The letter caused confusion about the future of U.S. forces in Iraq. The United States has about 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq. 
The top U.S. military officer told reporters the letter was a poorly worded draft document meant only to underscore increased movement by U.S. forces.
""Poorly worded, implies withdrawal. That's not what's happening,"" said U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, stressing there was no withdrawal being planned.
The authenticity of the letter, which was addressed to the Iraqi Defense Ministry's Combined Joint Operations Baghdad and signed by a U.S. general, had been confirmed to Reuters by an Iraqi military source.
Esper added the United States was still committed to countering Islamic State in Iraq, alongside America's allies and partners.
""Sir, in deference to the sovereignty of the Republic of Iraq, and as requested by the Iraqi Parliament and the Prime Minister, CJTF-OIR will be repositioning forces over the course of the coming days and weeks to prepare for onward movement,"" the letter stated.
It was signed by U.S. Marine Corps Brigadier General William Seely III, commanding general of the U.S.-led military coalition against Islamic State.
CJTF-OIR stands for Combined Joint Task Force–Operation Inherent Resolve.
""We respect your sovereign decision to order our departure,"" the letter said.
Iraqi caretaker Prime Minister Abdel Abdul Mahdi told the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad on Monday that both nations needed to implement the Iraqi parliamentary resolution, the premier's office said in a statement. It did not give a timeline.
THRONGS IN TEHRAN
Khamenei led prayers at the funeral in the Iranian capital, pausing as his voice cracked with emotion. Soleimani, 62, was a national hero in Iran, even to many who do not consider themselves supporters of Iran's clerical rulers.
Aerial footage showed people, many clad in black, packing thoroughfares and side streets in Tehran, chanting: ""Death to America!"" - a show of national unity after anti-government protests in November in which many demonstrators were killed.
The crowd, which state media said numbered in the millions, recalled the masses of people that gathered in 1989 for the funeral of the Islamic Republic's founder, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
The killing of Soleimani has prompted concern around the world that a broader regional conflict could flare.
Trump vowed on Saturday to strike 52 Iranian targets, including cultural sites, if Iran retaliates with attacks on Americans or U.S. assets, and stood by his threat on Sunday, although American officials sought to downplay his reference to cultural targets. The 52 figure, Trump noted, matched the number of U.S. Embassy hostages held for 444 days after the 1979 Iranian Revolution.

Responding to Trump's vow, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani wrote on Twitter on Monday: ""Never threaten the Iranian nation."" Soleimani's successor vowed to expel U.S. forces from the Middle East in revenge. 
Rouhani, regarded as a moderate, responded to Trump on Twitter.
""Those who refer to the number 52 should also remember the number 290. #IR655,"" Rouhani wrote, referring to the 1988 shooting down of an Iranian airline by a U.S. warship in which 290 were killed.
Trump also took to Twitter to reiterate the White House stance that ""Iran will never have a nuclear weapon,"" but gave no other details.
Washington blamed Soleimani for attacks on U.S. forces and their allies.
General Esmail Ghaani, Soleimani's successor as commander of the Quds Force, the elite unit of Iran's Revolutionary Guards charged with overseas operations, promised to ""continue martyr Soleimani's cause as firmly as before with the help of God, and in return for his martyrdom we aim to rid the region of America.""
""God the Almighty has promised to take martyr Soleimani's revenge,"" he told state television. ""Certainly, actions will be taken."" 
Other political and military leaders have made similar, unspecific threats. Iran, which lies at the mouth of the key Gulf oil shipping route, has a range of proxy forces in the region through which it could act.
Iran stoked tensions on Sunday by dropping all limitations on its uranium enrichment, another step back from commitments under a landmark deal with major powers in 2015 to curtail its nuclear program that Trump abandoned in 2018.

France's foreign minister said the substance of the accord was slowly disappearing and European powers would decide in coming days whether to launch a dispute resolution process that could lead to a reinstatement of U.N. sanctions on Iran that were lifted under the deal.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - University entrance exams to be taken by 300,000 students around Chile were disrupted in some cities on Monday by fresh protests over inequality and elitism, with some students blocking access to test sites and burning exam papers.
The authorities suspended the university selection test - known locally as the PSU - in 64 of more than 700 exam centers around the country, citing in a statement the safety of students, staff and exam materials.
The test had been suspended twice since November amid widespread social unrest in Chile that has left more than 27 people dead, thousands injured and thousands more arrested.
With the unrest dwindling to a handful of smaller protests each week, the test had been rescheduled to this week, only to face calls for a boycott by student union groups that claim the admissions system privileges those who attend better schools, in better areas and have better resources to prepare for it.
""We will continue to fight against market education and for a country where poor and working-class children can study without competition or segregation,"" the Coordinating Assembly of Secondary Students (ACES) said in a statement on Twitter.
Students protested outside exam centers in cities around the country, including Santiago, the capital, the coastal city of Valparaiso and Calama to the north. Students carried banners calling for a more equitable education system.
In some cases, students blocked access to the sites, disrupted the exams, vandalized classroom furniture and burned exam papers. Eighty-one people were detained for damage and public disorder, the Interior Ministry said in a statement.
Education undersecretary Juan Vargas said those affected by the suspensions would be able to complete the test later.
""That group of young people who have been affected ... will have a solution, an alternative, to take the PSU,"" he told reporters in Santiago.
In recent years protests by Chilean students over the country's highly privatized education system have made global headlines and brought pledges of reform including making higher education free of charge, improving quality and widening access to more people.
Since October, Chile has been rocked by broader protests that started over a hike in public transport fares and broadened to include calls for better pensions, healthcare and education."

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Libyan forces loyal to eastern-based commander Khalifa Haftar said on Monday they had taken control of the strategic coastal city of Sirte in a rapid advance preceded by air strikes.
Holding Sirte would be an important gain for Haftar, who since April has been waging a military offensive on the capital, Tripoli, home to Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).
Sirte lies in the center of Libya's Mediterranean coast, and has been controlled by GNA-aligned forces since they ejected Islamic State from the city with the help of U.S. air strikes in late 2016.
Haftar's self-styled Libyan National Army (LNA) said it had taken areas surrounding Sirte, including al-Qardabiya air base, before moving towards the city center.
""The commander-in-chief decided on a well-planned, pre-emptive strike and within less than three hours we were in the heart of Sirte,"" said LNA spokesman Ahmed al-Mismari. 
""It was a sudden, swift operation,"" he said, adding that the advance had been preceded by several hours of air strikes.
An LNA military source said forces from the city of Misrata, to the northwest, had retreated. Misrata led the campaign against Islamic State and is a key source of military power for the GNA.
Earlier, a resident in Sirte city center told Reuters by phone: ""We can see convoys of LNA inside Sirte city ... they control large parts of the city now. We also hear gunfire.""
There was no immediate comment from GNA forces.
The LNA advance comes as Turkey prepares to send military advisors and experts to Libya to help shore up the GNA, part of rising international involvement in Libya's conflict.
Haftar's LNA has received material and military support from countries including the United Arab Emirates, Jordan and Egypt, according U.N. experts and diplomats. 
GADDAFI'S BIRTHPLACE
Since launching a bitter campaign for Benghazi, Libya's second city, in 2014, Haftar has gradually expanded his territorial control across the vast, mainly desert country.
Gains have sometimes been made through deals with local groups sympathetic to the LNA and have involved limited military effort, though the offensive to capture Tripoli, home to around half of Libya's population of 6 million, quickly stalled.
Sirte was the birthplace of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and the city in which he was captured and killed after a NATO-backed uprising in 2011. Among the cities that had opposed the uprising, it was taken over by Islamic State in early 2015, becoming the jihadist group's most important base outside the Middle East. 
It is also one of the main bases of the Ferjan tribe, of which Haftar is a member.
The city is just to the west of Libya's oil crescent, a strip of coastline along which several key oil export terminals are located. Haftar's forces seized the oil ports in 2016. 
LNA sources said Sirte's 604 Brigade, a powerful military unit dominated by ultra-conservative Salafists that also took part in the fight against Islamic State, switched allegiance to the LNA about two weeks ago.
Haftar says he is seeking to rid Tripoli of armed groups and combat extremism. His opponents say he has fueled war and instability, and fear he will return Libya to one-man rule. 
In recent weeks there has been an escalation of fighting, shelling and air strikes around Tripoli. On Saturday evening a military academy in the capital was hit, killing at least 30 people.

U.N. Libya envoy Ghassan Salame said the drone strike on the academy had likely been carried out by a foreign country backing the LNA, without elaborating. He called on foreign powers to ""keep out of Libya"".

More than 100 people were killed in two attacks in Argentina in the 1990s. In 1992, the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires was attacked with a car bomb, killing 29 people. Two years later, an explosives-laden truck blew up outside the AMIA Jewish community center, killing 85 people.
Argentine courts have blamed the attack on Iran. But no one has been brought to trial in either case. Iran denies playing a role in either attack.
In the United States, New York City, another frequent target of attacks, was bracing for Iranian retaliation with police on heightened alert but officials saw no imminent threats."

The accident also left 42 others injured, including two Brazilians and two Americans, Colonel Carlos López, a spokesman for the national police, told Reuters.
Cruz del Sur, the operator of the bus, said in a statement that the accident occurred early Monday morning when the bus was going around a bend and hit minivans that were at the edge of the roadway, causing the bus to roll.
The injured people were transferred to several hospitals in the area, it added.
The bus was heading from Lima to the city of Arequipa, located in the second most important region of the country.
Peru's transportation supervisory agency (Sutran) said in a statement that the bus was traveling 106 km (66 miles) per hour in an area where the maximum speed permitted should have been 90 km per hour.
A spokesman for Cruz del Sur acknowledged the bus was traveling at that speed and that the company would investigate the causes of the accident.
Road accidents are relatively frequent in Peru, where many vehicles travel in poor condition through precarious roads and are operated by drivers without proper training."

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haiti's calamitous earthquake a decade ago leveled much of the capital, killed tens of thousands and left some 1.5 million people homeless.
One of its longer term consequences has been the estimated 4,000 to 6,000 people who were permanently disabled as a result of the quake - people like 32-year-old Isaac Joseph, who lost the use of his legs after his neighbor's house collapsed on him.
""That was the worst day there could ever be since the beginning of time,"" said Joseph, who has been wheelchair-bound ever since. ""Everything happened in just 55 seconds.""
The 7.0-magnitude earthquake hit the poorest country in the Americas on Jan. 12, 2010, destroying much of Port-au-Prince. Estimates of the number of dead vary from 46,000 to more than 300,000.
""We were lying in bed when we felt a vibration. Then we heard lots of people screaming... the house next door fell on ours while we were in bed,"" he said. A collapsed wall pinned his legs and kept Joseph trapped under rubble for three days until rescuers freed him.
He was taken to hospital where doctors treated him and gave him the news that he would be paralyzed for life.
""It's very, very hard, when I think that my legs were working fine and in less than one hour, I am confined to a wheelchair for life,"" he recalled, fighting back tears.
After leaving hospital, he was sent to live in a tent city with amputees and other victims. Two years later, the tents were replaced with 400 small wooden prefabricated houses.
""We thought that something was going to happen for us because this was only supposed to be for two years. But no one has visited us since then,"" he said.
    There is no potable water or a health center nearby, the area is unsafe and the house is now dilapidated.
""If you want to go out somewhere, it's difficult to get there because of all the gunfire,"" Joseph said.
A security vacuum arose when United Nations peacekeeping forces withdrew from Haiti in 2017 after 15 years.
In a country where nearly 60% of the population survives on less than $2.40 a day, Joseph scrapes together a living tutoring neighborhood children. He is studying law and aims to become an advocate for handicapped Haitians.
At times, he feels judged for his disability.
""When I have to ask for help from people who don't want to help, it's very hard to accept it,"" he said. ""You can feel the person really doesn't want to help you, but you take their help anyway."""

BRUSSELS/PARIS (Reuters) - European parties to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal could launch a dispute resolution process this week that might lead to renewed U.N. sanctions on Tehran, European diplomats said. 
Iran took a further step back from its commitments to the 2015 pact with six world powers by announcing on Sunday that it would scrap limits on enriching uranium, though it said it would continue to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog. 
Its decision followed the killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike.
Iran has criticized Britain, France and Germany for failing to salvage the pact by shielding Tehran's economy from U.S. sanctions, reimposed since 2018 when Washington pulled out of the agreement.
Confirming an emergency meeting of the European Union's 28 foreign ministers would take place on Friday, an EU diplomat said: ""We must be ready to react to Iran's breaches of the nuclear deal."" 
Asked whether this could mean triggering a mechanism that could result in international sanctions being reimposed on Tehran, the envoy said: ""It is increasingly likely, but not yet decided. Friday will be key."" 
Two other diplomats said France, Britain and Germany could make the decision before Friday.
Asked whether the mechanism would be triggered, one of the diplomats said: ""Not later than Friday, but yes.""
""THE DEAL IS ALL BUT DEAD""
Iran, which says its nuclear program is for civilian purposes, has already breached many of the restrictions under the 2015 deal, intended to increase the amount of time Tehran would need to accumulate enough fissile material for an atomic bomb from 2-3 months to about a year.
""The vagueness of the Iran announcement makes it more necessary than ever to launch the mechanism since its whole purpose is to resolve the differences we have on this,"" a third diplomat said. 
Any party to the deal that believes another is not meeting its commitments can refer the issue to a Joint Commission comprising Iran, Russia, China, the three European powers and the EU. There would then be 15 days to resolve the differences, but the period can be extended if there is a consensus to do so.
The process can ultimately lead to a ""snapback"" - the reimposition of sanctions in place under previous U.N. resolutions unless the U.N. Security Council decides otherwise.
Diplomats have said that unless any violations by Iran cross an unacceptable threshold, the Europeans will focus on extending the process rather than pushing toward sanctions, but it is unclear what the Europeans' breaking point would be.

""The deal is all but dead, but we will do everything to slow and limit the (nuclear) proliferation slope that has been taken to try and save what can be saved,” said a fourth European diplomat, suggesting Europe still needed to gauge what would be the impact of any measures Iran takes most importantly on the breakout time.

The attack took place in the violent Gulf coast state of Tamaulipas near the town of Ciudad Mier, about 80 miles (130 km) south of Nuevo Laredo, which lies opposite Laredo, Texas.
The area is known as a hot spot in Mexico's long-running drug war where rival cartels battle over lucrative cross-border smuggling routes and control of other illicit activities.
The girl's 10-year-old brother, also a U.S. citizen, was injured in the attack, along with the children's parents, who are Mexican nationals but legal residents of the United States, a state security source told Reuters.
The boy plus his 48-year-old father and 42-year-old mother all remain in a local hospital, the source said, who described their condition as ""serious but stable.""
The source said the family was traveling Saturday night on an isolated stretch of highway.
Tamaulipas state security officials said in a statement on Sunday the family lives in the United States, and that an investigation had been launched.
""Initial reports indicate the victims were traveling Saturday evening toward the border to continue on to the United States, where they reside, when armed individuals stopped them and shot at them,"" the statement said.
The family was traveling in a truck and accompanied by another vehicle driven by relative who was also injured in the attack, the statement said.
Both vehicles had Oklahoma license plates.
The statement said a third vehicle with Tamaulipas plates was found at the scene and was likely used by the attackers, then abandoned after a collision."

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 12:35PM ET</span>",Michael Avenatti fails to narrow Nike indictment; U.S. judge cites Cosby case,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected Michael Avenatti's bid to dismiss two of the three counts in an indictment accusing the celebrity lawyer of trying to extort  Nike  Inc (N:NKE) by threatening to reveal its alleged improper payments to college basketball recruits.
Citing an alleged extortion of comedian Bill Cosby in the late 1990s, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said prosecutors could try to prove that Avenatti engaged in wrongful conduct by threatening Nike with economic and reputational harm unless it paid him millions of dollars. 
Gardephe also called it premature to dismiss as vague the two counts, alleging extortion and transmitting interstate communications with intent to extort.
Avenatti is also charged with honest services wire fraud against his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, by concealing how Nike had offered to settle so long as it did not have to hire and pay Avenatti to probe the alleged payments.
Lawyers for Avenatti did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment.
Avenatti, 48, became famous representing porn star Stormy Daniels and becoming an antagonist of U.S. President Donald Trump.
He faces a scheduled Jan. 21 trial after pleading not guilty to illegally demanding up to $25 million from Nike last March in exchange for not publicizing the basketball payments, and being hired for the internal probe. Nike has denied wrongdoing.
In letting the case proceed, Gardephe cited the 1997 conviction of Autumn Jackson for trying to extort $40 million from Cosby in exchange for not revealing she was his illegitimate child.
Cosby disputed that claim, but admitted to having an affair with Jackson's mother, and had quietly made payments to help her and put Jackson through college.
Jackson was sentenced to 26 months in prison. Cosby is serving a three- to 10-year prison sentence following his 2018 sexual assault conviction.
Gardephe said conduct becomes wrongful when people to threaten economic loss or reputational harm to obtain property to which they are not entitled. 
Prosecutors alleged that money Avenatti sought for himself was separate from the $1.5 million he sought for Franklin.
""While Avenatti's client may have been in a position to make demands to Nike, Avenatti had no right - independent of his client - to demand millions of dollars from Nike based on confidential information supplied by his client; without his client's knowledge; and to his client's detriment,"" Gardephe said.
Avenatti has also pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Manhattan that he cheated Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and in California that he defrauded clients out of millions of dollars.

The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373.

Prosecutors say Marry Mubaiwa, who denies all charges, tried to unplug Chiwenga's life support tubes in a South African hospital in June. She was initially arrested on Dec. 14 on separate charges including fraud and money laundering. 
A High Court judgment seen by Reuters showed Judge Pisirai Kwenda has granted Mubaiwa bail for 50,000 Zimbabwe dollar ($3,000), and ordered her to surrender her diplomatic passport and report to a local police station once every two weeks.
Mubaiwa is also required to hand over the title deeds of her parents' house with the court, the document showed. 
Her lawyer, Taona Nyamakura, said Mubaiwa could be released from prison on Monday or Tuesday.
Her arrest has sparked accusations against Chiwenga and the anti-corruption agency that initially arrested her. 
Opposition politicians say the vice president is using his position to influence a divorce settlement with Mubaiwa, while the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), which says she illegally transferred $900 million to South Africa, is conflicted. 

The ZACC denies this. Chiwenga, who returned to China last week for a medical review, could not be reached for comment.

The quake was shallow at 3.7 miles (6 km) beneath the surface with an epicenter 8 miles (13 km) south-southeast of Indios, the U.S. Geological Survey said, enough to rattle the southwestern corner of the Caribbean island.
It was the largest in a series of quakes that have struck the area over the past two weeks.
Several homes were knocked off their pillars in the towns of Guanica and Guayanilla. Television images showed a number of elevated homes that crushed vehicles parked beneath the main floor.
U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida said his office would be in contact with local and federal authorities to determine if government aid was needed for the U.S. territory.
Puerto Rico Governor Wanda Vazquez said she convened a meeting of her security team, which was assessing the damage.
Guayanilla also lost a tourist attraction called the Window of the Caribbean, a rock formation jutting into the sea that formerly featured a doughnut-like hole that provided a frame for the seascape behind it. With the quake, the top layer of rock and earth fell into the water.
The top of the frame had been subjected to partial collapse with the recent temblors and finally gave way with Monday's quake, Telemundo Puerto Rico television reported."

LIMA (Reuters) - The Lima Group regional bloc said on Monday it backed the re-election of opposition leader Juan Guaido as head of Venezuela's Congress after Nicolas Maduro's socialist government forced a separate vote imposing a new leader of the legislative body.
Luis Parra was installed as the new head of Congress on Sunday after armed troops blocked opposition legislators from entering parliament, in a move condemned by dozens of nations as an assault on democracy.
Opposition legislators responded by re-electing Guaido in a session at the headquarters of a pro-opposition newspaper. Guaido is recognized by dozens of nations as Venezuela's rightful leader.
The Lima Group, minus members Mexico and Argentina, said they welcomed Guaido's re-election as the leader of Congress and as the country's interim president, repeating a condemnation of ""force and intimidation tactics"" used against lawmakers.
The re-election of Guaido ""represents a rejection of the reckless actions by Nicolas Maduro's regime that sought to prevent his appointment,"" said the group, which was set up to find a way out of the Venezuelan crisis.
The Lima Group statement was signed by Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru and Bolivia, the last of which joined the bloc in December after the resignation of leftist leader Evo Morales.
Argentina's new center-left Peronist President Alberto Fernandez has been walking a tightrope between key trade partners including Brazil and the United States and potential leftist allies including Venezuela.
The South American country has given asylum to socialist former Bolivian leader Morales and welcomed a senior official from Maduro's government to Fernandez's inauguration in December, prompting criticism from the United States.
But Argentina's foreign minister, Felipe Sola, said on Twitter that his government rejected the move in Venezuela to block the proper functioning of the legislative assembly which would only lead to ""international isolation.""
""The assembly must elect its president with full legitimacy,"" he wrote."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Harvey Weinstein arrived at a Manhattan court on Monday for the start of his landmark trial on charges of rape, allegations that helped fuel the #MeToo movement and a reckoning for powerful men accused of sexual misconduct.
Once one of Hollywood’s most powerful producers, Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to charges of assaulting two women in New York. He faces life in prison if convicted on the most serious charge, predatory sexual assault.
Weinstein hobbled into court leaning on a walker, dressed in a black suit, with a member of his team holding his arm. Lead defense counsel Donna Rotunno followed close behind.
Outside the courthouse, the Silence Breakers, a group of Weinstein accusers including actresses Rosanna Arquette and Rose McGowan, held a press conference, demanding the former producer be held accountable.
""As we stand here at the beginning of a new year and a new decade, time's up on sexual harassment in all workplaces,"" said Arquette. ""And time's up on the pervasive culture of silence that has enabled abusers like Weinstein.""
Weinstein did not engage with the accusers who shouted at him outside court. McGowan was dismissive of Weinstein's feeble appearance. ""I think he's taken some good acting tips.""
More than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct dating back decades. 
Those accusations helped fuel the #MeToo movement, in which hundreds of women have publicly accused powerful men in business, politics, the news media and entertainment of sexual harassment or assault.
Weinstein has denied the allegations, saying any sexual encounters he had were consensual. 
Monday's court proceedings will being with a pretrial conference in state court in Manhattan, with jury selection starting on Tuesday, according to Danny Frost, a spokesman for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance, whose office brought the charges. 
One of the women Weinstein was charged with assaulting, former production assistant Mimi Haleyi, has said that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 2006. Prosecutors say Weinstein raped the second woman, who has not been publicly identified, in 2013
The trial will hang over the Hollywood awards season, which began with Sunday's Golden Globes. Weinstein was once a fixture at the industry's glitzy ceremonies, with numerous critically acclaimed small-budget films such as ""Shakespeare in Love,” which won the Oscar for best picture in 1999. 
Juda Engelmayer, a spokesman for Weinstein, said on Thursday that the two women in the criminal case had long-term relationships with Weinstein. He said it was prejudicial to conflate the criminal matter with allegations in civil cases or with public grievances he said were lodged by women who were not part of any lawsuit.
Allegations against Weinstein first were reported in the New York Times and The New Yorker magazine in October 2017.
Within days, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which selects Oscar winners, had expelled Weinstein. On Oct. 15, Alyssa Milano tweeted: ""If you've ever been sexually harassed or assaulted write 'me too' as a reply to this tweet.""
#MeToo became one of the most used widely used hashtags. In 2019 it was viewed 42 billion times, according to data from Brandwatch, a research firm.
Finding impartial New York City jurors amid the media frenzy surrounding the Weinstein case will be a challenge for both legal teams, experts said.
Lawyers will likely question potential jurors about their knowledge and opinion of the case, their work history and whether they have been victims of sexual misconduct.
If Weinstein is acquitted, he is still likely to face legal problems. At least 29 women in the United States, Canada and Europe have brought civil claims against him. The allegations in the civil lawsuits range from battery, assault and defamation to sex trafficking and racketeering. He has denied the allegations.
The parties have been trying to work out a $25 million settlement to resolve most of the civil cases. The deal would not require Weinstein to contribute personally or to admit wrongdoing, prompting at least one woman to reject the proposal.

The film company Weinstein founded with his brother Bob, The Weinstein Co, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2018.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia will mobilize fishermen to join warships in the South China Sea to help defend against Chinese vessels, the government said on Monday, as the biggest stand-off with China for years escalated off Southeast Asia's largest country.
In an unusually strong statement, President Joko Widodo told reporters: ""There is no negotiation when it comes to our sovereignty.""
The stand-off since last month in the northern Natuna islands, where a Chinese coastguard vessel has accompanied Chinese fishing vessels, has soured the generally friendly relationship between Jakarta and Beijing.
Indonesia's chief security minister, Mahfud MD, told reporters that around 120 fishermen from the island of Java would be sent to the Natuna islands, some 1,000 km (600 miles) to the north.
""We want to mobilize our fishermen from the north coast and maybe in turn from other areas to operate by fishing there and other things,"" Mahfud said.
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, said last week it was sending more warships to the area. Six Indonesian ships were there now and four more were on the way, Imam Hidayat, the head of the Maritime Security Agency's sea operations sub-directorate, told Reuters.
China claims much of the South China Sea, a global trade route with rich fishing grounds and energy reserves, as its own based on what it says its historic activity. But Southeast Asian countries - and the United States and much of the world - say such claims have no legal basis.
Indonesian vessels often confront Chinese fishermen off the Natuna islands, but the presence of the Chinese coastguard vessel has marked an escalation this year over which Indonesia summoned the Chinese ambassador.
Speaking in Beijing last week, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said China had sovereignty over the Spratly islands and their waters and that both China and Indonesia have ""normal"" fishing activities there. He did not specifically mention the Natuna islands, which are southwest of the Spratlys.
Last year, China engaged in a prolonged maritime stand-off in Vietnam's extended economic zone and jangled nerves with its naval presence off the Philippines and Malaysia.
The last peak in tensions between Indonesia and China over the South China Sea was in 2016, when a Chinese coastguard vessel rammed a Chinese fishing boat to free it after it had been intercepted for illegal fishing by Indonesian authorities."

World Food Programme has resumed the milling of grain for food aid to a starving population in Yemen after a halt in late December due to shelling damage, the agency said on Monday.
Artillery fire on Dec. 26 damaged WFP grain stores at the Red Sea Mills located on the front line in the Yemeni port city of Hodeidah. 
Milling resumed on Dec. 30, the WFP said in a statement. 
The mill and silos have become a focal point of the conflict in Hodeidah, where the United Nations is trying to enforce a ceasefire and troop withdrawal agreed a year ago at peace talks in Stockholm.
The Red Sea Mills lie on a front line between forces loyal to President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's internationally recognized government and those of the Iran-aligned Houthi militia.
The stores were off limits for around six months from late 2018 and at risk of rotting until the WFP negotiated access in February and began cleaning and milling what had been enough grain to feed 3.7 million people for a month.
So far just over 4,500 tonnes have been milled into flour and dispatched, the statement said. 
The war has severely hit food supplies in Yemen and millions of people are at risk of starvation in what aid agencies describe as one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.
Yemen has been mired in almost five years of conflict since the Houthi movement ousted Hadi's government from power in the capital Sanaa in late 2014, prompting intervention in 2015 by a Saudi-led military coalition in a bid to restore his government.
The United Nations has been trying to re-launch political negotiations to end a war which has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.

A year on from the Stockholm deal, U.N.-mediated talks between warring parties in the Hodeidah have so far failed to achieve a full troop withdrawal and ceasefire.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will send military experts and technical teams to support Libya's internationally recognized government, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Monday, a day after President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkish military units were moving to Tripoli.
Prime Minister Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord asked for Turkish support last month as it fends off an offensive by forces led by eastern leader Khalifa Haftar, backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.
Erdogan said on Sunday that Turkish military units had started moving to Libya to support the GNA. Asked to elaborate on Erdogan's comments, Cavusoglu said Turkey would send experts, advisers and technical teams under a military cooperation agreement signed with the GNA in November.
A bill passed by Turkey's parliament last week also allowed for the deployment of troops.
""How and when this will happen is to be decided by the government, under the president's leadership,"" Cavusoglu said.
On Sunday, Saudi Arabia condemned the ""recent Turkish escalation in Libya"" and the parliamentary approval for troop deployment, calling it a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions. The United Nations has imposed an arms embargo on both sides of Libya's conflict, which it says several countries have breached.
SYRIAN REBELS IN LIBYA
Cavusoglu's comments come a week after Turkish officials said that Ankara was considering sending Syrian rebel fighters to Libya as part of its planned military support.
Ankara has backed rebels fighting to oust Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in the almost nine-year civil war, and Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) fighters spearheaded a Turkish military offensive in northern Syria in October.
A spokesman for the FSA denied that Ankara had requested that it send fighters to Libya, but a military source within the FSA said some fighters had signed up on an individual basis to work as ""bodyguards"" for a Turkish security company in Libya.
Flights were suspended at Tripoli's only functioning airport on Friday due to rocket fire and shelling, and at least 30 people were killed in an attack on a military academy in Tripoli on Saturday.
The U.S. Embassy in Libya said the violence ""underscores the dangers of toxic foreign interference in Libya, such as the arrival of Syrian fighters supported by Turkey as well as the deployment of Russian mercenaries.”
Cavusoglu denied that any FSA fighters had been deployed to Libya and said Turkey was against the deployment of mercenaries in Libya, referring to Russian and Sudanese fighters.
Libya has lacked stable central rule since dictator Muammar Gaddafi was overthrown in 2011 by rebel fighters with air support from NATO.
In recent years the country has had two governments, the GNA based in the capital Tripoli and a rival administration based in the east. Haftar, the most powerful figure in the east, has launched a campaign to unite the country by capturing Tripoli."

China and Kiribati restored diplomatic ties last year after the Pacific state cut them with Taiwan. China considers Taiwan merely a Chinese province, with no right to state-to-state relations, and refuses to maintain diplomatic ties with countries that recognize Taipei.
Kiribati had established diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 2003, prompting the break with Beijing.
Up until then, China had operated a space tracking station in Kiribati, which played a role in tracking China's first manned space flight and is in a part of the world where the United States tests missiles and other military hardware.
A former Taiwanese ambassador to Kiribati, Abraham Chu, told Taiwan's Central News Agency last year that China had never fully removed the tracking station in Kiribati and that it ""could come back at any time"".
The Solomon Islands, another Pacific state, also switched to Beijing from Taipei last year, in a process watched with concern by Washington, which is wary of China's growing global clout.

Taiwan now has formal relations with just 15 countries, mostly small and poor nations in Latin America and the Pacific, including Nauru, Tuvalu and Palau. China has signaled it is coming for the rest of Taiwan's allies.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Police in Uganda on Monday fired tear gas to disperse supporters of pop star and presidential hopeful Bobi Wine when he tried to hold a rally, underscoring the hurdles he faces as he seeks to unseat long ruling President Yoweri Museveni, 75.
Police later arrested Wine, a lawmaker whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, accusing him of seeking to stage an illegal assembly.
Wine and his pressure group People Power had aimed to start countrywide consultations with his supporters on his plans to stand in presidential polls next year, in which he would seek to dislodge Museveni, who has ruled Uganda since 1986."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Delhi police are investigating how masked men burst into a premier university and attacked a student protest with sticks and rods, an officer said on Monday, the latest incident to ignite criticism of India's ruling Hindu nationalists.
Sunday's attack at a university long seen as a bastion of left-wing politics comes as students nationwide lead a campaign against a citizenship law introduced last month by Prime Minister Narendra Modi that is seen as targeting Muslims.
""Social media and CCTV footage will be part of the investigation,"" said police official Devendra Arya, adding that the violence at the university had prompted police to start a case. 
Students and some faculty of the Jawaharlal Nehru University have blamed the incident that injured at least 30 people on a students' union tied to Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, which has increasingly targeted the institution.
Students put out pictures of mobs entering university residential halls, their faces covered with cloth, carrying sticks and even sledgehammers. Some shouted slogans, threatening death for traitors.
More than 30 injured were admitted to the All-India Institute of Medical Science in the capital, a hospital official said, most of them with lacerations, cuts and bruises. 
The protests have persisted despite government efforts to quell them, with more protests planned across India on Monday, prompted by the university attack.
The Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, the students' wing of the BJP, denied accusations that it was behind the attack, which it blamed instead on rival leftist unions.
Authorities faced criticism for failing to rein in the violence on a campus viewed a center of resistance to Modi's policies, including the abolition last year of special status for Muslim-majority Kashmir. 
Rahul Mehra, a lawyer for the Delhi police, said he was astounded there were no police officials to stop Sunday's attack. 
""I...hang my head in shame after witnessing video clips of goons merrily entering JNU campus, creating mayhem and grievously injuring innocent students, damaging public property and then exiting the campus,"" he said on Twitter.
Critics accuse Modi of pushing a Hindu-first agenda that undermines India's foundations as a secular democracy.
The citizenship law lays out a path for Indian nationality for minorities from six religious groups in neighboring countries but excludes Muslims. 

The government says the law is meant to tackle the grievances of minorities, such as Christians, Hindus and Sikhs, who face persecution in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.

Thousands of suspected drug traffickers and users have been killed in the campaign that Duterte launched soon after he won election in 2016.
Vice President Leni Robredo, who was elected separately to the president, and recently served a brief stint as the president's drug ""tsar"", said vast quantities of the highly addictive drug were available because seizures had barely dented the supply.
""It is very clear, based on official data, despite the number of Filipinos killed and the budget spent, the volume of shabu supply curbed didn't exceed 1%,"" Robredo told a news conference, referring to methamphetamines.
Robredo, a former human rights lawyer, has long been a critic of Duterte's flagship anti-drugs campaign, the main focus of which has been methamphetamines.
Citing police data, she said annual seizures of the drug in the last three years were in a range of about 1,000 kg, compared with estimated consumption of 3,000 kg a week, which translates to 156 tonnes a year, worth about 1.3 trillion pesos ($25 billion).
The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime estimated the Asia-Pacific methamphetamine trade was worth as much as $61.4 billion in 2018, up from an estimated $15 billion just five years earlier.
Duterte appointed Robredo his ""drugs tsar"" on Nov. 5 after the opposition leader, in a Reuters interview and subsequent public appearances, expressed alarm about the death toll in the anti-narcotics campaign and said it needed a fresh approach.
But 18 days later Duterte fired her after she had exposed flaws in the campaign.
Robredo said the government must change its strategy and halt police anti-drug operations.
""Instead of chasing or killing drug peddlers in street corners, we need to pursue the source of drugs, the big suppliers. They are the real enemy, not the ordinary people,"" Robredo said. 
Responding to Robredo's comments, presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo, said her stint as the president's top anti-drugs official had been a failure.

""The fact remains that we have dismantled so many illegal drug factories ... caused the surrender of thousands of drug addicts and pushers ... and neutralized high-value drug suspects,"" Panelo said.

The law came into effect in October amid concern among rights groups and opposition politicians it could be used to silence criticism of the government ahead of a general election expected within months.
The government has denied such suggestions saying the law, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), only tackles falsehoods and that legitimate criticism and free speech would not be affected.
""The first few POFMA actions appear to have been issued against individuals that are either politicians or affiliated with political parties, or political parties.

Conte told la Repubblica newspaper in an interview the government was nearing a decision on whether to revoke Atlantia's motorway concession after a highway bridge collapsed in August 2018 killing 43 people in the city of Genoa.
""Clearly such a decision must be founded on a technical and juridical assessment of whether the concessionaire breached its obligations,"" Conte said.
""At the stage of the analysis we have reached, I can say that it is evident someone made mistakes and is responsible for serious and unforgivable acts of negligence.""
Atlantia has denied any wrongdoing and said it always acted in compliance with its obligations. It was not immediately possible to reach a company representative for comment.
Through its Autostrade per l'Italia unit, Atlantia manages Italy's biggest motorway network spanning some 3,000 kilometers. It is one of 26 motorway operators in Italy.
Autostrade CEO Roberto Tomasi said in a newspaper interview on Saturday that the company was at risk of bankruptcy if it was stripped of its motorway license without adequate compensation.
Italy's government recently passed a measure that curtails the payout owed to a company in the event of early termination of a concession if the firm is in breach of its contractual obligations.
In that case, state-owned company ANAS would temporarily manage the motorways involved, a draft document seen by Reuters shows.
Following the government's move, credit rating agency Moody's downgraded Atlantia's debt for a second time in a month, pushing it further below the investment grade threshold citing growing political pressure on the group."

KEP, Cambodia (Reuters) - Six children - including at least two infants - among 36 people killed when an unfinished building collapsed in Cambodia were living on the site with their families, a common practice in Cambodia's construction boom, survivors said on Monday.
The heavy death toll has highlighted the dangers of the lightly regulated industry, with workers saying they live on site to save money.
The building, a multi-storey guesthouse going up in the coastal town of Kep, crashed down on Friday as laborers and their families were relaxing after a hard day on the job, in which they laid the concrete for the building's seventh floor.
Authorities have yet to determine why it came down.
Scrap collectors were on Monday combing the rubble, cutting through iron fittings to collect metal to resell and looking for anything of value after authorities ended a search for survivors.
A black Mercedes Benz Kompressor belonging to the building's now-detained owner was left on the side of the road.
One entire family, including a 5-month-old baby and 4-year-old, died in the collapse, said Seth Pheara, a family friend.
The mother, Mae Ah Yai, came to work at the site with her husband when she was pregnant and the entire family lived in the unfinished building.
""She worked until she was eight months pregnant and then she stopped,"" Seth Pheara, who lives near the collapsed building, told Reuters.
WORKERS' PARTY
On Friday afternoon, workers finished laying the seventh-floor concrete so the construction supervisor, known to workers as ""Kun"", decided to throw a party for workers and their families.
His wife, who ran a small grocery store on the ground floor, provided some beers.
“They all lived at the construction site, there was no other home, they all worked and slept there,” said Chey Phat, 32, who lost four members of his family and works at another construction site in the area.
Twenty minutes into the party, the building collapsed.
The supervisor, his wife and their two children perished, as did Chay Phat's own relatives, including a 15-year-old and an 18-month-old.
""The baby was just starting to learn to run around and talk,"" Chey Phat said, speaking to Reuters by telephone from Svay Rieng province, near Vietnam, where some funerals took place.
SAFETY STANDARDS
Authorities have detained the owners of the building, identified as Ek Sarun and his wife, Chhiv Sothy, but Kep governor Ken Satha said on Monday he was unaware if they were charged with any crime.
""In principle, people are not allowed to live at construction sites,"" Ken Satha said. ""But we don't have places for them to live. This is a private construction.""
Asked whether authorities will ban workers from living at other construction sites, Satha replied: ""We will take measures.""
Prime Minister Hun Sen has played down the dangers, telling reporters on Sunday that disasters happened everywhere.
At least 23 people were injured in the building collapse.
Dem Yon, 34, counts himself lucky to have survived along with his wife.
He said he wanted to stop construction work as soon as he could afford to do so.
""I'll stop working on tall buildings, I'll only work on low ones,"" he vowed.
""Then I'll work growing vegetables,"" he said."
1290,By Bloomberg,"<span>Jan 06, 2020 02:51AM ET</span>",Soleimani Killing Leaves Trump’s Mideast Strategy in Tatters,"(Bloomberg) -- U.S. President Donald Trump and his top aides spent the weekend arguing that the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani would deter future attacks and help make the Middle East safer.
Instead, U.S. policy in the region seems to be going in the opposite direction of what Trump has long promised -- with more U.S. troops going in, not fewer; an Iran defiant, not cowed and broken by sanctions; and regional allies giving only lukewarm support to Trump’s airstrike instead of rallying around it.
Economic costs of the strike are also mounting: oil surged above $70 a barrel, equities around the world fell and gold rose to the highest in more than six years.
The blows deepened on Sunday, when the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State was forced to suspend operations and Iraq’s parliament called on U.S. troops to withdraw from the country. Trump responded by saying Iraq could face sanctions and would have to “reimburse” America. Iran said it would abandon limits on uranium enrichment put in place as part of a 2015 nuclear agreement that Trump withdrew from in 2018.
U.S actions have “unquestionably made an already volatile situation much more dangerous,” said retired Army Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis, a senior fellow at Defense Priorities who favors a U.S. troop withdrawal from Iraq. “If you paid any attention to Iran in the last 40 years you know they will never buckle to that kind of pressure. It’s just the opposite.”
How Iran Pursues Its Interests Via Proxies, Partners: QuickTake
The strike on Soleimani appeared to unite Iranians after months of violent protests against their own government, with thousands turning out to mourn a military chief who had made their nation -- battered by U.S. economic sanctions -- appear strong by giving Tehran leverage in conflicts from Syria to Yemen.
“The Trump administration monstrously miscalculated by playing into Iran’s hands,” said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of international relations at the London School of Economics. “It united most political forces in Iraq against the U.S. It provided Iran with a breathing space in Iraq.”
The fight against Islamic State was immediately affected, with the U.S.-led coalition saying it would suspend operations against the terror group in Iraq to focus on protecting bases that have recently come under attack.
Iraq is the home base for operations against Islamic State. Trump, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One late Sunday, said that the U.S. wouldn’t leave Iraq unless it got paid back for the “billions” spent on an air base there.
“If they do ask us to leave, if we don’t do it in a very friendly basis, we will charge them sanctions like they’ve never seen before ever,” he said. “It’ll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame.”
The escalating tensions hit global markets starting Friday and continuing through Monday. Oil futures jumped an additional 3% on Monday after the State Department warned of a “heightened risk” of missile attacks near military bases and energy facilities in Saudi Arabia. Japanese, Hong Kong and South Korean equities fell, and U.S. and European futures retreated.
‘Despicable Guy’
After Trump and Iranian officials traded public threats about future reprisals, the U.S. leader will now face questions from lawmakers returning to Washington from the end-of-year break ready to take up a bitter debate over the president’s impeachment by the Democratic-led House and a coming trial in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Reaction to the raid has fallen mostly along party lines, with Republicans hailing the action to eliminate a terrorist leader and Democrats questioning the administration’s assertion that Soleimani presented an “imminent threat” and asking whether Trump has a broader strategy or plan to deal with the aftermath.
U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, sent a letter to the chamber’s lawmakers announcing a vote this week on a resolution that would limit Trump’s power in any potential military actions regarding Iran.
“Look, everybody knows that Soleimani was a very bad, despicable guy,” Senator Chris Van Hollen, a Maryland Democrat, told “Fox News Sunday.” “There’s no debate there. But the claim of an imminent threat they have not supported, and what we do know is this dramatic escalation is now putting Americans at greater risk.”
Pompeo’s Diplomacy
After more than a dozen calls with foreign counterparts from China to Saudi Arabia, Secretary of State Michael Pompeo argued the administration’s case on all the major U.S. news shows on Sunday.
He said there were no doubts within the administration about the intelligence behind the decision to kill Soleimani, and that any moves taken by the U.S. against Tehran will be “lawful.” That was a response to concerns about Trump’s threat on Saturday to hit “52 Iranian sites,” including cultural targets, if Tehran retaliates for Soleimani’s killing. Trump’s threat raised concerns because attacks against cultural property are prohibited under the Geneva Convention and the U.S. Defense Department’s rules of engagement.
“We’ll behave inside the system,” Pompeo said Sunday on ABC’s “This Week.”
Despite the international outreach, there were few signs of strong support among key U.S. allies beyond Israel, while the NATO alliance planned an emergency meeting Monday to discuss growing tensions in the region.
How Qassem Soleimani Helped Shape the Modern Mideast: QuickTake
U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson summed up European reaction to the strike on Soleimani, saying “we will not lament his death,” but adding that “we are in close contact with all sides to encourage de-escalation.”
Working to the U.S. advantage is Iran’s dire economic situation following increasingly tight U.S. sanctions that have largely wiped out the country’s ability to sell oil abroad and cut it off from most trade partners. And some analysts said the political tensions in Iran will only be briefly masked by Soleimani’s killing.
“The killing of a general who wasted a lot of Iran’s resources on Arab civil wars is unlikely to trigger support for the government,” said Ray Takeyh, a senior fellow for Middle East studies at the Council on Foreign Relations.
Pompeo said that in the long-run, Soleimani’s death will make the Middle East more secure. And he seemed to minimize the significance of Iraq’s parliament calling for a withdrawal of U.S. forces, suggesting that outgoing Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi -- who said he was due to meet with Soleimani the morning he was killed -- was acting under enormous pressure from Iran. Pompeo said the U.S. was a force for good in Iraq, 17 years after it invaded to oust Saddam Hussein.

“It is the United States that is prepared to help the Iraqi people get what it is they deserve and continue our mission there to take down terrorism from ISIS and others in the region,” Pompeo told CBS’s “Face the Nation.” “That is in defense of the Iraqi people and is good for America, too.”
It’s unlikely U.S. troops will leave Iraq anytime soon, but Sunday’s vote was damning for Trump and U.S. plans for the region. The diplomatic compound in Baghdad was constructed after the 2003 invasion to be the biggest American embassy in the world, designed to essentially serve as a forward operating base and a listening post in the Middle East.
And with his latest deployment of about 3,500 troops to Kuwait, Trump has now bolstered American forces by about 17,000 personnel since May, undermining his vow to get the country out of “endless wars.”
“Rarely has any single tactical move, untethered from any long-range thinking, produced so many potential strategically negative consequences for the U.S.,” said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “In one single decision you’ve undermined 17 years of a U.S. mission, fraught though it may be.”

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian officials used a respite on Monday from fierce wildfires that have killed 25 people across the country's southeast to race to reopen blocked roads and evacuate people who have been trapped for days. 
A second day of light rain and cool winds brought some relief from heatwave-fueled blazes that ripped through two states over the weekend, but officials warned the hazardous weather conditions were expected to return later in the week.
Police on Monday confirmed the death of a 71-year-old man on the south coast of New South Wales (NSW) state who was reported missing on Dec. 31, bringing the national toll to 25.
More than 8 million hectares (19.8 million acres) of land have so far been destroyed in the current fire season, nearly the size of Austria.
""No one can be complacent. We've got big fire danger coming our way toward the end of this week with hot weather,"" Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Monday afternoon.
Authorities redoubled their efforts to provide supplies and repatriate thousands of people who have been trapped by fire lines in coastal towns for several days.
""What we are focusing on here is the human cost and the rebuilding cost for people's lives,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra as he announced funding of A$2 billion ($1.4 billion) over two years to the newly formed National Bushfire Recovery Agency.
Morrison said nearly 4,000 cattle and sheep have been killed as a result of the fires. 
Dean Linton, a resident of Jindabyne in the Snowy Mountains, used the break from an immediate threat to his town to visit his wife and four children who had evacuated to Sydney. He also used the 870 kilometer (540 mile) round trip to pick up a fire-fighting pump and generator to help him protect the family home.
""There's a lot of fuel in that national park; it would only take one lightning strike,"" Linton told Reuters.
The bushfire season started earlier than normal this year following a three-year drought that has left much of the country's bushland tinder-dry and vulnerable to fires. 
Following are highlights of what is happening across Australia:
* There were no emergency warnings in fire-ravaged states on Monday following the weather change. Two people remained missing as 146 fires continued to burn in New South Wales (NSW), however all fires were back at the ""advice"" level, the lowest alert rating.
* Victoria state had 40 fires with 13 ""watch and act"" alerts. All missing people had been accounted for, state authorities said.
* Around 67,000 people have left or been evacuated from fire-ravaged areas in Victoria, state Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said.
* Victoria set up a Bushfire Recovery Agency, with initial funding of A$50 million. The recovery is expected to cost ""a lot more"" than A$500 million, state premier Andrews said. 
* Fire officials said the light rain that has brought some relief also posed challenges for back-burning efforts to reduce fuel for future fires and bring existing fires under control.
* NSW state-owned power distributor Essential Energy said its network has suffered ""significant damage"", with almost 24,000 customers without power. Essential said that power ""may not be restored for a while due to the extent of the damage and challenges with gaining safe access."" Affected areas include Batemans Bay on the New South Wales south coast. 
* As conditions eased, the NSW RFS said residents of Bega, Tathra, Merimbula, Eden, Pambula, Bermagui and villages to the north and south can now return though they need to monitor conditions. 
* Military helicopters were due to evacuate more people, including the elderly and young children, from Mallacoota on Monday. More than a thousand people were evacuated from the Victoria state town by two naval ships on Friday.
* Insurers have received 5,850 bushfire-related claims in NSW, Victoria, South Australia and Queensland since the Insurance Council declared a bushfire catastrophe on Nov. 8.
* Bushfire losses are estimated at A$375 million since November, with a further A$56 million in insured property losses in September and October, the Insurance Council said. Figures do not include properties lost over the past 24 to 36 hours in areas such as the NSW Southern (NYSE:SO) Highlands and south coast.
* Accommodation provider  Aspen Group  (AX:APZ) said on Monday it expects a A$500,000 hit to both revenue and net operating income from the bushfires.
* Canberra was running short of masks with the nation's capital blanketed in smoke, ACT emergency services said. The National Gallery of Australia said it was closed to protect visitors and art works. The government department responsible for coordinating Australia’s response to disasters and emergency management also closed its doors due to poor air quality.
* Actor Russell Crowe skipped Hollywood’s Golden Globes ceremony, where he won an award for playing former Fox News Chief Executive Roger Ailes in the TV series ""The Loudest Voice in the Room."" Presenter Jennifer Aniston said Crowe stayed in Australia to protect his family from the bushfires and read remarks he had prepared where he said the fires were ""climate change based."" 
* Prime Minister Morrison continued to face criticism of his handling of the crisis. ""Poor political judgment is one thing. Competency is another thing altogether. This is the political danger zone Scott Morrison wants to avoid in his handling of the bushfire crisis,"" Rupert Murdoch's The Australian, a supporter of the government, said in an article by the newspaper's national affairs editor on Monday.
* State officials have thanked people for donations of clothes and food, but said that cash was more useful.
* 41 U.S. firefighters are in Victoria with a further 70 from Canada and the United States expected to join on Jan. 8, the Victoria Country Fire Authority said on Twitter.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - The new head of China's liaison office in Hong Kong, who was unexpectedly announced at the weekend, said on Monday he hoped the Asian financial hub, roiled by more than six months of anti-government protests, would return to ""the right path.""
Luo Huining's appointment is seen as a sign of Beijing's frustration with how his predecessor, Wang Zhimin, handled the crisis and makes Wang the shortest serving liaison office director since the city's 1997 return to Chinese rule.
The liaison office, which reports to China's State Council or cabinet, is a platform for Beijing to project its influence in the city.
In November, Reuters reported exclusively that Beijing was considering replacements for Wang, who had come under criticism for failing to foresee the public reaction to a now-withdrawn extradition bill or adequately report upwards on the sentiment on the ground.
Unlike Wang, who worked at China's state news agency and within the liaison office before taking its helm, Luo has no prior experience in Hong Kong, a point he was keen to address in his first remarks to the media after taking office.
""I worked in the mainland in the past, but I am not unfamiliar with Hong Kong,"" Luo, now the most senior mainland official based in the territory, told reporters in a brief statement, without taking any questions.
""Hong Kong is the pearl of the orient, an international metropolis. Hong Kong compatriots have made important contributions to the reform and opening up and modernization of our country. The motherland will always be Hong Kong’s strongest backer.""
""In the past half a year, the Hong Kong situation has been worrying. Everyone eagerly hopes Hong Kong can return to the right path,"" Luo said.
A loyalist of President Xi Jinping, Luo is known for enforcing Communist Party discipline. His appointment comes less than a month after he was given a different job, in the Financial and Economic Affairs Committee of the national legislature.
Until November, Luo was the top official of China's ruling Communist Party in the northern province of Shanxi, where he had been tasked with cleaning up a graft-ridden, coal-rich region where corruption was once likened to cancer.
Before moving to Shanxi, Luo had been the top party official in the western province of Qinghai.
SUPPORTS 'BASIC LAW' CONSTITUTION
Protests in Hong Kong escalated in June over a controversial bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent for trial to the mainland, where justice is controlled by the Communist Party. 
They have since evolved into a broad pro-democracy movement, with anger growing over a perception that Beijing is meddling too much into Hong Kong, which was promised a high degree of autonomy upon Britain's handover of the city.
Hong Kong's unrest is the biggest political challenge facing Xi since becoming president in 2012. China denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest. 
Analysts have interpreted Luo's appointment as a punishment for Wang, rather than a signal for a change in the central government's attitude to the protests.
""Clearly Wang is being dismissed given the Hong Kong chaos. He either didn't see it coming nor could he stop or limit it, either way he is gone,"" said Fraser Howie, Director of Newedge Financial in Singapore.
""What can Luo do differently, the answer is nothing unless Xi Jinping allows some move on the political changes."" 

Luo said the ""one country, two systems"" type of governance that guarantees Hong Kong freedoms not available on the mainland was the city's greatest advantage and that the basic law, the city's mini-constitution, will be ""fully implemented.""

Kim Jong Un said last week there were no longer grounds for Pyongyang to be bound by a self-declared moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear bomb testing and that a ""new strategic weapon"" would be introduced in the near future.
""I don't think he'd break his word to me, but maybe he will,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned to Washington after a two-week stay in Florida.
Trump - who in 2018 became the first sitting U.S. president to meet with a North Korean leader - said after Kim's comments that the North Korean leader had signed a denuclearization contract and Trump thought Kim was a ""man of his word.""
Last month, Pyongyang warned Washington of a possible ""Christmas gift"" after Kim gave the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over his country's nuclear arsenal.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - More than two decades after Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997, a long border fence still threads between mainland China and the city today.
The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have co-existed on one another's doorstep.
(Click https://reut.rs/2ZCU2tm to see a picture package of these borderlands.)
Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanization as China booms, as well as the preservation of a slower pace of life.
About 30km (20 miles) long, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China's high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other.
Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China's giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.
Mr. Lam, now in his 80s, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. 
He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the 'Shenzhen river' with his family 70 years ago. There were only ""old and broken"" sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. 
""Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.""
Over past decades of political upheaval in Communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Mr. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.
Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. 
""There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,"" he said.
The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. 
The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.
Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her master's degree from Hong Kong's Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai.
""I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands. That's why I've decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment."" 
Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome division.
""Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less.

""I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it's not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.""

1296,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 06:27PM ET</span>","Iran says no limits on enrichment, stepping further from 2015 deal: TV","By Parisa Hafezi
DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran announced on Sunday it would abandon limitations on enriching uranium, taking a further step back from commitments to a 2015 nuclear deal with six major powers, but it would continue to cooperate with the U.N. nuclear watchdog.
Iran had been expected to announce its latest stance on the deal this weekend. But its announcement coincided with a major escalation of hostilities with Washington following the U.S. killing of top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani in a drone strike on Friday in Baghdad.
State television said Iran would not respect any limits set down in the pact on the country's nuclear work: whether the limit on its number of uranium enrichment centrifuges to its enrichment capacity, the level to which uranium could be enriched, the amount of stockpiled enriched uranium or Iran's nuclear Research and Development activities.
""Iran will continue its nuclear enrichment with no restrictions .... and based on its technical needs,"" a government statement cited by television said.
Iran has steadily overstepped the deal’s limits on its nuclear activities in response to the United States’ withdrawal from the accord in 2018 and Washington's reimposition of sanctions that have crippled Iran’s oil trade.
Under the nuclear deal, Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of most international sanctions.
Relations between Tehran and Washington sharply deteriorated after President Donald Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the deal. Iran has criticized European powers for failing to salvage the pact by shielding its economy from U.S. sanctions.
Sunday's statement said Tehran can quickly reverse its steps if U.S. sanctions are removed.
""This step is within JCPOA (deal) & all 5 steps are reversible upon EFFECTIVE implementation of reciprocal obligations,"" tweeted Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif referencing the acronym that stands for the deal's official name, ""The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.""
A European Diplomat, who declined to be named, said the ""deal is all but dead,"" but said that Europe would do everything possible to slow proliferation and ""try and save what can be saved.""
Mark Fitzpatrick, associate fellow and nuclear non-proliferation expert at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said Iran's latest step left room for diplomacy.
""They are not saying how far they will push the enrichment or the number of centrifuges they’ll operate,"" Fitzpatrick told Reuters. “I think they have reserved a lot of room for negotiation and for taking further steps if they need to.”
'MAXIMUM PRESSURE'
Washington says the “maximum pressure” campaign it started after withdrawing from the nuclear agreement will force Iran to negotiate a more sweeping deal, covering its ballistic missile program and its role in Middle Eastern conflicts. Iran says it will not negotiate a new deal.
Tehran has rejected Western assertions that it has sought to develop nuclear weapons.
Iran has already breached many of the deal’s restrictions on its nuclear activities, including on the purity to which it enriches uranium, its stock of enriched uranium, which models of centrifuge it enriches uranium with and where it enriches uranium.
It has, however, not gone far over the purity allowed – the deal sets a limit of 3.67% and Iran has stayed around 4.5% in recent months, well below the 20% it reached before the deal and the roughly 90% that is weapons-grade.
The deal as a whole was designed to increase the time Iran would need to obtain enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb if it wanted one – the main obstacle to producing a nuclear weapon – from around two or three months."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - A small but growing number of Hong Kong protesters who fled to Taiwan for safety over the past few months fear an opposition victory in the island's election this week will put them in peril and force them to leave.
The mostly young men and women who came to Taiwan after taking part in increasingly violent protests in support of democracy in Hong Kong have no legal way to gain permanent asylum, but President Tsai Ing-wen's broadly sympathetic government has allowed about 60 of them to temporarily extend their stay.
Some of those protesters fear that support will vanish if the Jan. 11 election is won by Han Kuo-yu, the presidential candidate for Taiwan's Kuomintang opposition party, which favors close ties with China.
""If Han Kuo-yu is elected, I will buy a flight ticket and flee to another country right away,"" a protestor in his early 30s who asked only to be identified as Jero told Reuters.
Jero said he flew to Taiwan on a tourist visa days after he took part in the storming of Hong Kong's Legislative Council on July 1 fearing he could be charged with rioting, which carries a maximum prison term of 10 years.
He now lives in a small studio in Taipei funded by a network of local activists supporting the protesters.
The issue of Hong Kong has played a large role in Taiwan's election campaign. Tsai has vowed to defend the island's sovereignty and has rejected China's suggestion of a ""one country, two systems"" political formula, saying it has failed in Hong Kong.
Han, who says he wants to forge strong ties with Beijing and met with Hong Kong's embattled leader Carrie Lam and senior Chinese officials last year, has accused Tsai of using the Hong Kong protests to whip up fears of China for electoral gain.
Both Tsai and Han have voiced support for Hong Kong protesters. But the prospect of a Han presidency is more concerning to the protesters.
""Hong Kong people are fighting against the Chinese Communist Party, but how could we convince ourselves that the Kuomintang is also against the Communist Party?"" said a protester called Roger, whose tourist visa has been extended twice since his arrival in Taiwan in July.
Jacob Lin, a Taipei-based lawyer who is part of a team that has been offering legal assistance to protesters seeking residency in Taiwan since mid-summer, said many protesters are worried about a change of political control.
""If the ruling party is replaced, the treatment for protesters may be quite different,"" he said, referring to Tsai's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP).
Responding to protesters' concerns about a Han victory, Han spokeswoman Anne Wang urged Hong Kong protesters not to be used by the DPP for electoral gain.
""I hope they have a true understanding of Mr. Han's insistence on the value of democracy and freedom,"" she said. ""He's solely against provocation, conflict and war, but he's in full support of Hong Kong's democracy and freedom.""
Hong Kong's Security Bureau told Reuters in a statement that those accused of breaking the law in the city will have an open and fair trial, and any accusation of politically motivated prosecutions are ""unfounded.""
'PROTECTIVE UMBRELLA'
Taiwan's government has helped close to 60 protesters who are seeking shelter on the island for ""political"" reasons since the protests started about six months ago, a senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
The official, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said Taiwan has been offering ""assistance on an individual basis"" to protesters, discreetly allowing them to extend tourist visas multiple times or facilitating applications for student or work visas.
Taiwan's government will not deport those who had made it there, the official said.
""If we don't help Hong Kong when they are in trouble, who is going to help Taiwan when we are in trouble?"" he said.
Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council said in a statement that it will ""appropriately handle individual cases"" in accordance with existing laws, without elaborating.
Tired of waiting around, some are taking direct action to help the protesters restart their lives in Taiwan.
Hong Kong-based rights lawyer Daniel Wong is leading an initiative to set up at least 10 companies from a laundry service to a restaurant in Taiwan to give protesters much-needed residency via work visas.
Wong said the plan, dubbed ""project protective umbrella,"" will be funded by a group of anonymous supporters in Taiwan and Hong Kong, many of whom are lawyers, doctors and other professionals.
""We are going to help our own kids,"" he said. ""Hong Kong people are not refugees.""
Huang Chun-sheng, a pastor at a Presbyterian Church in Taipei which has received more than 100 protesters said he will set up a foundation for Hong Kongers in Taiwan to coordinate funding support for those needing shelters.
He said a few of those protesters had since returned to Hong Kong in the belief that they would likely not be charged there.
Shopping for daily necessities in Taipei, a protester in her 20s who identified herself as Tiffany sounded caution on the coming vote, and urged Taiwanese to vote for Tsai, who she says can protect the island's freedoms.
""I hope to study and find a job in Taiwan,"" she said. ""I hope Taiwanese can cherish the votes in their hands."""

Qassem Soleimani was killed on Friday in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport. The attack has prompted concern of ramping tensions between the U.S. and Iran.
Nigeria is split roughly evenly between Christians and Muslims, the latter of which are mostly Sunni. The government last year banned the country's largest Shi'ite Muslim group, the Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), after violent clashes between its members and police.
IMN was heavily influenced by the Iranian revolution of 1979 which saw Ayatollah Khomeini take power.
""The Inspector General of Police, IGP Mohammed Adamu, has placed police commands and formations nationwide on red alert,"" the Nigeria Police Force said in a statement on Sunday.
""This proactive measure follows intelligence report that sequel to the recent killing of an Iranian general; some domestic interests are planning to embark on massive public disturbances and sabotage,"" it said.
It said senior police officials had been ""directed to ensure maximum surveillance and security of lives and property across the nation.""
The statement did not name any specific groups or give further details. A police spokesman did not immediately respond to phone calls requesting comment.
Reuters was unable to independently verify claims that public events were planned.
Nigeria banned IMN and outlawed its demonstrations which its members held to call for the release of their leader, Ibrahim Zakzaky, who has been held since 2015 when government forces killed around 350 people in a storming of the group's compound.
The group last year said more than 30 of its members were killed in police crackdowns on its protests. Police gave no death toll."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Clashes broke out late on Sunday between students of New Delhi's Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), who were protesting against a fee hike, and youth wing members of a group closely tied to India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), injuring over a dozen people, witnesses and officials said.
Sahiba Mazid, who spoke by telephone from inside one of the university hostels, said many men wearing masks and carrying batons had entered the hostel.
JNU students on social media blamed members of the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), the youth wing of the Hindu nationalist Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh - the ideological parent of India's ruling BJP. It denied they had instigated clashes and said they were first attacked by the left-leaning students.
The ABVP members contacted by Reuters at the site did not belong to JNU.
JNU, one of India's most prestigious universities, has a history of left-wing activism. Many there have also in recent years protested against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP, accusing them of curbing free speech.
""Horrifying images from JNU — the place I know & remember was one for fierce debates & opinions but never violence. I unequivocally condemn the events of today,"" Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said on Twitter.
Protests against a fee hike began in November when hundreds of students marched from the campus seeking its cancellation, saying it would make education unaffordable.
""This is a desperate attempt by forces of anarchy ... to shore up their shrinking political footprint,"" said the BJP in a tweet about Sunday's violence."

LISBON (Reuters) - The presidents of Angola and Congo said on Sunday Isabel dos Santos, the billionaire daughter of Angola's previous leader, and her Congolese husband Sindika Dokolo should cooperate with the justice system after their assets were frozen. 
In a statement, the presidents said the best way forward for dos Santos and Dokolo, as well as Mario Leite da Silva, chairman of Banco de Fomento Angola (BFA), was ""maximum cooperation with the competent authorities of the state and the Angolan court"". 
They did not immediately react to the presidents' comments. 
Angolan President Joao Lourenco and Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Antoine Tshisekedi Tshilombo met on Sunday in the Angolan city of Benguela, the statement said. 
Since ending Jose Eduardo dos Santos' near 40-year grip on power in 2017, Lourenco has tried to erase the influence of his predecessor and reform sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest economy. 
But Lourenco is under pressure as the economy continues to contract under his watch.
A court document dated Dec. 23 said the government believed dos Santos, Dokolo and Silva had caused the state losses of more than $1 billion.
The asset freeze applies to personal bank accounts of dos Santos, Dokolo and da Silva in Angola and stakes they hold in Angolan firms including Unitel, BFA and ZAP MIDIA.
Dos Santos and her husband have denied the accusations, calling them ""politically motivated"". Silva has declined to comment. 
Called Africa's wealthiest woman, Isabel dos Santos has amassed a fortune estimated at more than $2 billion through stakes in Angolan companies including banks and the telecoms firm Unitel, earning her the nickname ""the Princess"".
She chaired the state oil company Sonangol before being sacked by Lourenco months after he came to power.
Last week, Bank of Portugal told Reuters it was evaluating dos Santos' suitability as a shareholder of Portuguese banks.
Dos Santos holds significant stakes in several important Portuguese firms, including Eurobic bank, telecoms company NOS and engineering company Efacec. She is also a shareholder in oil and gas company Galp Energia. 
The asset freeze against her comes as the ex-president's son, Jose Filomeno de Sousa, faces corruption charges, accused of helping transfer $500 million from the sovereign wealth fund.

In the same statement, Lourenco called for ""international cooperation to support the effort to combat corruption and impunity in Angola"", adding the country had the legitimacy to trigger legal and diplomatic mechanisms to ensure the return of financial assets ""illegally placed abroad"".

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela's parliament on Sunday swore in legislator Luis Parra as its new leader after government security forces blocked opposition leader Juan Guaido from entering parliament, in what Guaido's allies called a ""parliamentary coup."" 
Opposition leaders had expected to re-elect Guaido, recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela's legitimate leader, to a second term as chief of the legislature to continue pushing for the ouster of unpopular President Nicolas Maduro.
Following a confused scuffle on the floor of parliament on Sunday, state television announced that the new parliament leader was Parra - a legislator expelled last month from an opposition party following corruption accusations that he denies. 
""Luis Parra... has been sworn in during this session today,"" said a state television announcer, following an improvised swearing-in ceremony amid clamoring and what appeared to be protests by opposition legislators. 
Opposition leaders said the incident showed that Maduro has again flouted basic democratic principles by using intimidation and force to control an institution that the Socialist Party lost control of in a landslide 2015 election.
One video distributed by Guaido's press team shows him attempting to scale a fence outside parliament and being pushed back by security forces. He declared the new congress illegal and said he will continue holding sessions elsewhere.
But the gambit will help Maduro to sideline Guaido, who last year became an icon of hope for millions of Venezuelans seeking an end to the country's hyperinflationary crisis that has fueled an exodus of some 5 million citizens.
Guaido's claim to the interim presidency rested on his position as president of the opposition-held National Assembly. He argued that Maduro's 2018 re-election was fraudulent, meaning the presidency was vacant and that the constitution dictated the head of parliament should take charge temporarily. 
The United States, through its embassy to Venezuela which has been located in Bogota since the two countries cut off diplomatic relations in 2019, said Sunday's events in the National Assembly were ""completely against the will of the people and the laws governing the process."" 
Since being expelled from the Justice First opposition party, Parra has been harshly critical of Guaido's leadership. He and eight other legislators who were also ensnared in the corruption scandal have described themselves as being in ""rebellion."" 
Parra told state television that the lawmakers who were present in the chamber opened the session without Guaido because he had not arrived.
""We announced this morning before entering the legislative palace that the rebellion of the deputies ... would be clearly expressed,"" Parra said.

Guaido in December vowed to investigate alleged wrongdoing lawmakers including Parra for unduly advocating for a businessman linked to Maduro's government.

KOTA, Rajasthan (Reuters) - Some 109 children have so far died at a government hospital in northern India since the beginning of December, said a hospital official on Sunday, even as local authorities scrambled to bring in additional staff and equipment amid a rising outcry over poor healthcare facilities in the country.
""The death toll since Dec. 1 stands at 109,"" Suresh Dulara, the medical superintendent of JK Lon Hospital in Kota, in the northwestern state of Rajasthan, told Reuters on Sunday.
The deaths, which have begun to grab national headlines in the last week, have sparked a social media firestorm about the deplorable state of many government healthcare facilities.
It has also unleashed a political blame game between the state's ruling Congress party, and the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party at the center, after Rajasthan's chief minister defended the situation saying there had been more infant deaths at that hospital, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi's BJP was in power in the state. 
Roughly three quarters of the deaths have occurred in the hospital's neonatal intensive care unit, which treats up to one-month-old babies, said an official directly aware of the matter.
A team appointed by the central health ministry is probing the deaths and will come out with a report soon, said the source who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.
A lack of infrastructure and staff, along with unhygienic conditions may have played a role in some of the deaths, said the source, adding the hospital - the only center with a neonatal intensive care unit in a 200-kilometre radius - is often a hospital that receives critically ill children from elsewhere, contributing to higher mortality rates.
Much of north India has also been hit by a severe cold wave since late in December, and officials at the hospital have now rushed to provide blankets, bedsheets and heaters, said patients at the hospital.
On Saturday, the National Human Rights Commission sent a notice to the state government stating the situation raises some serious concerns.
""The state is duty bound to provide basic necessary medical care to its citizens,"" the commission said.
Separately, local media reported on Sunday that 219 infants had died in December at two government hospitals in the western state of Gujarat - a BJP-ruled state, which is the home state of Modi."

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera on Sunday announced a plan to overhaul the country's public health care system, the latest in a series of measures aimed at quelling the demands of protesters who took to the streets two months ago.
In a televised speech, Pinera said his proposed legislation would speed up treatment by setting new maximum wait times for surgeries, cover a minimum of 80% of health care costs and reduce the price of medications by more than half.
Under his plan, FONASA, the country's public insurer, would go from simply paying patient bills to ""defending the interests of its users.""
Chile's current health care system, with both public and private options for insurance, is widely perceived by Chileans as too expensive, complex and in some cases, ineffective. Nearly 3 million sick Chileans languish amid long waits for treatment. Specialists are in short supply throughout the country.
""I can imagine the indignation that Chilean feel when they see so many problems,"" Pinera said in the speech. He called on the country´s Congress to fast-track the legislation.
Protests in Chile began in mid-October over a small hike in metro fares but quickly spun out of control. Two months of sometimes violent riots, looting and mass demonstrations have since prompted Pinera's government to call for a vote on a new constitution, beef up pensions and the minimum wage, and to cut transportation costs.
Though the violence has largely subsided since the peak of riots in October and November, isolated incidents and skirmishes between protesters and security forces persist.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's parliament called on Sunday for U.S. and other foreign military forces to leave amid a growing backlash against the U.S. killing of a top Iranian military commander that has heightened fears of a wider Middle East conflict.
In a war of words between Iran and the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington would target any Iranian decision-makers it chose if there were further attacks on U.S. interests by Iranian forces or their proxies.
Qassem Soleimani was killed on Friday in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport, an attack that took U.S.-Iranian hostilities into uncharted waters and stoked concern about a major conflagration. 
As Washington and Tehran, longtime foes, traded threats and counter-threats, the European Union, Britain and Oman urged them to make diplomatic efforts to defuse the crisis.
The Iraqi parliament passed a resolution calling for an end to all foreign troop presence, reflecting the concern of many in Iraq that the strike could engulf them in a major war between two bigger powers long at odds in Iraq and across the region.
""The Iraqi government must work to end the presence of any foreign troops on Iraqi soil and prohibit them from using its land, air space or water for any reason,"" it said.
While parliamentary resolutions are non-binding to the government, this one is likely to be heeded: Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdihad earlier called on parliament to end foreign troop presence as soon as possible.
There was no immediate comment on the Iraqi move from the U.S. State Department or Pentagon.
FOUGHT SIDE BY SIDE
Iran's Supreme National Security Council Secretary Ali Shamkhani was quoted by state television as saying the Iraqi parliament's decision means the U.S. military presence in Iraq is considered an occupation.
Despite decades of U.S.-Iran enmity, Iranian-backed militia and U.S. troops fought side by side during Iraq's 2014-17 war against Islamic State militants, their common enemy. Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed in Friday's strike.
Some 5,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, most in an advisory role.
The resolution was passed by overwhelmingly Shi'ite lawmakers, as the special session was boycotted by most Sunni Muslim and Kurdish lawmakers. 
One Sunni member of parliament told Reuters that both groups feared that kicking out U.S.-led coalition forces would leave Iraq vulnerable to an insurgency, undermine security and heighten the power of Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias.
'TERRORIST IN A SUIT'
Earlier on Sunday, Iran lambasted Donald Trump after the U.S. president threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites hard if Tehran attacks Americans or U.S. assets in retaliation for Soleimani's death.
""Like ISIS, Like Hitler, Like Genghis! They all hate cultures. Trump is a terrorist in a suit. He will learn history very soon that NOBODY can defeat 'the Great Iranian Nation & Culture',"" Information and Telecommunications Minister Mohammad Javad Azari-Jahromi tweeted.
Soleimani masterminded Iran’s clandestine and military operations abroad as head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, creating an arc of Shi'ite power with the help of proxy militias confronting the regional might of United States and Israel. 
Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised on Friday that Iran would seek harsh revenge for his death.
Hundreds of thousands of mourners, many chanting, beating their chests and wailing in grief, turned out across Iran to show their respects after Soleimani's body was returned home to a hero's welcome.
Pompeo rejected suggestions that the intelligence assessment that led to the strike on Soleimani was thin and said there was no doubt Iran had absorbed the message from Washington.
""The intelligence assessment made clear that no action - allowing Soleimani to continue his plotting and his planning, his terror campaign - created more risk than taking the action that we took last week,"" he said on ABC's ""This Week"" show.
Democratic critics of the Republican president have said Trump was reckless in authorizing the strike.
The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said on ABC's ""This Week"": ""We do not need this president either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.""
Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, leader of Lebanon's powerful, Iran-allied Hezbollah movement, said the U.S. military in the Middle East would pay the price for Soleimani's death and U.S. soldiers and officers would return home in coffins.
Hezbollah has had numerous conflicts with U.S. ally Israel, including a month-long war in 2006.
Heightened fears of war drove Gulf stocks sharply lower on Sunday. 
IRANIAN TARGETS
Trump tweeted on Saturday that Iran ""is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets"". 
He said the United States has ""targeted 52 Iranian sites"", some ""at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD"".
In remarks to Fox News on Sunday, Pompeo said Trump had not threatened to target Iranian cultural sites.
Iran summoned the Swiss envoy representing U.S. interests in Tehran on Sunday to protest at ""Trump's hostile remarks"", Iranian state television said.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell urged Iran's foreign minister by phone to work to de-escalate the situation and invited him to Brussels to discuss ways of preserving world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Iran.
It was Trump's withdrawal of the United States from the deal in 2018 and reimposition of sanctions on Iran that touched off a new spiral of tensions after a brief thaw following the accord.
Iran will decide on Sunday about its next step to further roll back its commitments to the nuclear containment deal, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi was quoted as saying.

The incident at Metz came just two days after a man went on a knife rampage in the suburb of Villejuif just outside Paris on Jan. 3, killing one person and wounding two. The Villejuif attacker was subsequently shot dead by police.
The Metz local public prosecutor's office said it was in contact with the French anti-terrorism prosecutor's department over the incident, while French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner added he was monitoring the situation closely.
""I praise the quick thinking of the @PoliceNat57 (Moselle police force), which intervened to apprehend the individual. A probe is underway to determine the precise motivation and circumstances behind the act,"" Castaner wrote on Twitter.
The Metz local prosecutor's office said the suspect suffered gunshot wounds to the thigh. He was then taken away.
It added that the suspect, whom it did not name, was on an official list of those monitored for links to militant groups.
Paris has suffered major attacks by Islamist militants in recent years.
Co-ordinated bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theater and other sites around Paris killed 130 people - the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two."

KARACHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Protestors clashed with police in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi on Sunday, as thousands of demonstrators attempted to march toward the U.S. consulate to protest the killing of Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani.
Soleimani, a powerful Iranian military commander and the architect of Iran's spreading military influence in the Middle East, was killed in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq on Friday.
In Karachi, thousands of Shi'ite protestors, including women and children, carrying images of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as of Soleimani, marched and chanted slogans of ""Death to America,"" and ""Death to Israel.""
The protest was organized by a diverse group of Shi'ite Muslim organizations.
Pakistani security forces blocked the road leading to the U.S. consulate in Karachi using shipping containers. However, some protestors attempted to push through the security cordon and climb over the containers, leading to scuffles with security forces.
Police were able to push protestors back and prevent them from getting beyond the barricades. Following a brief period of tension on Sunday evening, the demonstration was called off.
Iran, with a Shi'ite Muslim majority, enjoys a large support base in Pakistan, its neighbor to the east. Though Pakistan is a Sunni Muslim-majority country, it has a fairly large Shi'ite population.
""Pakistan should not in any way allow its soil to be used against Iran,"" a senior cleric, Shahanshah Naqvi, said while addressing the protest rally.
A smaller rally was also held in the capital, Islamabad, where protestors burnt U.S. and Israeli flags.
It dispersed without any violence.
Earlier, the spokesperson of Pakistan's Army told local media the country would not allow its soil to be used against anyone, referring to speculation about an imminent military standoff between the United States and Iran.
He quoted Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Army chief as saying they wanted a peaceful resolution to all disputes."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Sunday defended the intelligence assessment that led the United States to kill Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, as Democratic lawmakers questioned whether there was an imminent threat.
Asked about reports indicating that intelligence behind Friday's targeted air strike was thin, Pompeo said there was ""no skepticism"" among senior leaders who had access to all the U.S. intelligence.
""The intelligence assessment made clear that no action - allowing Soleimani to continue his plotting and his planning, his terror campaign - created more risk than taking the action that we took last week,"" Pompeo told ABC's ""This Week.""
Soleimani, Iran's pre-eminent military commander, was killed in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport, an attack that took long-running hostilities between Washington and Tehran into uncharted territory and raised the specter of wider conflict in the Middle East.
After Iran vowed retaliation, Trump sent a series of Twitter posts on Saturday threatening to strike 52 Iranian sites, including some ""important to Iran & the Iranian culture,"" if Tehran attacked Americans or U.S. assets.
Pompeo insisted any future U.S. strikes would be lawful.
U.S. Senator Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he was not yet convinced there was an imminent threat that justified the strike that killed Soleimani and a top Iran-backed Iraqi militia commander.
""I accept the notion that there was a real threat. The question of how imminent is something that I need more information on,"" Warner told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""
The Senate's top Democrat, Chuck Schumer, said on ABC's ""This Week"": ""We do not need this president either bumbling or impulsively getting us into a major war.""
'RESPOND AGAINST DECISION-MAKERS'
Pompeo did not elaborate on his statement that Friday's strike aimed to disrupt an ""imminent attack."" He said the threat posed by Soleimani was long-term and ongoing, and that the Iranian general had been directing the killing of Americans for years.
""This was a bad guy. We took him from the battlefield. We saw that he was plotting further plans to take down Americans, in some cases many Americans,"" he said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
""We've told the Iranian regime: enough. You can't get away with using proxy forces and think your homeland will be safe and secure. We're going to respond against the actual decision-makers - the people who are causing this threat from the Islamic Republic of Iran,"" Pompeo said.
The Pentagon on Friday briefed staff members from the House Armed Services Committee and Senate Armed Services Committee on the attack. Pompeo said intelligence has been shared with leaders in Congress and he expects they will be briefed again this week.
On Saturday, the White House sent the U.S. Congress formal notification of Friday's strike - as required by law - amid complaints from Democrats that Trump did not notify lawmakers or seek advance approval for the attack. White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said the operation was legal and that Justice Department lawyers had signed off on the plan.
Republicans in Congress have generally backed Trump's action. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Friday that ""no man alive was more directly responsible for the deaths of more American service members than Qassem Soleimani.""
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, has said the strike was conducted without specific authorization from or consultation with Congress.
In a statement on Saturday, she said it was ""provocative, escalatory and disproportionate,"" and that the classified notification sent to lawmakers prompted ""serious and urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification of the administration's decision to engage in hostilities against Iran."""
1311,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 10:43AM ET</span>",Indian government seeks to woo Bollywood stars as citizenship law protests rage on,"By Shilpa Jamkhandikar and Promit Mukherjee
MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Indian government invited numerous Bollywood stars and film industry personalities to a private gathering on Sunday in an effort to garner support for a new citizenship law that has triggered weeks of sometimes violent protests nationwide.
At least 25 people have been killed so far in clashes with the police during five weeks of protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which eases the path for non-Muslims in the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to gain Indian citizenship.
If combined with a proposed national register of citizens, critics of the CAA fear it will discriminate against India's Muslim minority and chip away at its secular constitution.
Two industry sources told Reuters they had received invites to Sunday's gathering at a five-star hotel in Mumbai. Roughly 20 to 25 people from both the Hindi and Marathi film industry are expected to attend the event, one of the sources said.
An invitation seen by Reuters said the event hosted by two senior leaders of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) aimed to ""facilitate a discussion on myths and realities pertaining to the (CAA)"".
Wooing Bollywood stars, who have a huge social media following among Indians of all faiths, could help the BJP alter some of the negative narrative around the new law.
The law, and the outrage it has prompted, pose a dilemma for a film industry that has some big-name Muslim personalities, but caters predominantly to India's majority Hindu population. A handful of Bollywood figures have condemned the CAA, while some others have faced criticism for not weighing in on the issue.
Modi, who spearheads the Hindu nationalist BJP, has often appeared alongside actors and film industry figures at public events. The industry has, in turn, produced films that some critics have said approached political endorsements.
On Saturday, more than 100,000 people took part in a peaceful protest against the CAA in the southern city of Hyderabad.
Further protests were planned on Sunday in Mumbai, New Delhi, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and several other Indian cities.
A source close to the BJP who is involved in organizing Sunday's private gathering said several party leaders had been enlisted to help explain the rationale of the CAA to various professional groups such as lawyers."

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Somalia's al Shabaab militant group attacked on Sunday a military base in Kenya used by both U.S. and Kenyan forces and published pictures of masked gunmen standing next to an aircraft in flames. 
U.S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) confirmed an attack on the Manda Bay Airfield in Lamu county, close to the Somali border. The Kenyan military said the attack was repelled and that four militants had been killed. There were no immediate reports of Kenyan or U.S. casualties. 
""Seven aircraft and three military vehicles were destroyed in the attack,"" al Shabaab said in a statement in which it claimed responsibility for the assault. 
Major Karl Wiest from AFRICOM told Reuters less than 150 U.S. personnel were at the base, where they provide training and counter terrorism support to East African partners. 
""Initial reports reflect damage to infrastructure and equipment. An accountability of personnel assessment is underway,"" AFRICOM said in a press release.
The assault that began before dawn lasted around four hours, witnesses and military sources told Reuters. 
Kenyan military spokesman Colonel Paul Njuguna said the base was now secure.
""This morning at around 5:30 am an attempt was made to breach security at Manda Air Strip. The attempted breach was successfully repulsed,"" he said.
""The airstrip is safe. Arising from the unsuccessful breach a fire broke out affecting some of the fuel tanks located at the airstrip. The fire has been put under control.""
At least four militants were killed, Njuguna said. 
There was no indication the militants had managed to enter the base. The airfield is separate to another on Manda Island used by commercial flights to Lamu. 
Kenya sent troops into Somalia in 2011 after a spate of cross-border attacks and kidnappings. They were later absorbed into an African Union peacekeeping force, now 21,000-strong, that supports the shaky, Western-backed Somali government. Al Shabaab has been fighting for more than a decade to overthrow the government and impose strict Islamic law. 
Independent investigator Benjamin Strick, who analyses satellite imagery for open source investigation websites like Bellingcat, said the photos of gunmen next to a burning plane published by al Shabaab photos matched satellite images of buildings and a distinctive aircraft apron adjacent to the base but outside its perimeter. 
EXPLOSION IN THE DARK
Residents on nearby Lamu Island, a haven for wealthy tourists and visiting European royalty, say a loud explosion jolted them awake before 4 a.m. Abdalla Barghash said he later saw a large dark plume of smoke rising from the Manda Bay mainland, where the airstrip and base are located.
Resident Omar Ali said he was on the way to his farm when he heard a huge bang and saw smoke. Fellow farmers reported sustained gunfire, he said. The gunfire was still going on four hours later, a military source said.
Lamu county, which is far more impoverished than the island, is frequently targeted by al Shabaab with roadside bombs and ambushes on travelers or attacks on isolated villages. The insurgents killed three passengers when they attacked a bus in the county on Thursday.
The group carried out a similar raid in September on Baledogle base in Somalia, which is used by both Somali special forces and American troops. All the attackers were killed and the base was not breached. 

It comes nearly a year after al Shabaab launched a deadly suicide attack on an upscale hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital Nairobi, killing 21 people.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - Thirty-six people were killed and 23 more injured when a tourist guesthouse under construction in Cambodia collapsed, trapping workers under rubble, officials said on Sunday.
Officials said rescue operations ended two days after the seven-storey concrete building collapsed on Friday in the coastal town of Kep, about 160 km (100 miles) southwest of the capital Phnom Penh.
The 36 dead included six children and 14 women, officials said in a statement that did not detail why children were at the construction site.
Kep Governor Ken Satha said that the owners of the building, a Cambodian couple, had been detained for questioning.
However, Prime Minister Hun Sen defended the government response and said that no officials in Kep province would be fired. 
""Building collapses don't only happen in Cambodia ... they happen elsewhere ... including in the United States,"" Hun Sen said in a news briefing. 
Cambodia is undergoing a construction boom to serve growing crowds of Chinese tourists and investors. 
The Kep building collapse came six months after 28 people were killed when a Chinese-owned construction site collapsed in Preah Sihanouk province. Seven people were charged with involuntary manslaughter and Hun Sen fired a disaster management official over that accident.

1315,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 09:09AM ET</span>",At least 30 killed in Libya military academy attack,"Tripoli (Reuters) - At least 30 people were killed and 33 others wounded in an attack on a military academy in the Libyan capital late on Saturday, the health ministry of the Tripoli-based government said in a statement on Sunday.
Tripoli, controlled by the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), is facing an offensive by military commander Khalifa Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) that began in April.
There has been an increase in air strikes and shelling around Tripoli in recent weeks, with fears that fighting could escalate further after Turkey’s parliament voted to allow a troop deployment in support of the GNA.
Forces allied with the GNA described Saturday’s attack on the military camp at Al-Hadhba as ""an aerial bombing"" launched by their eastern rivals. An LNA spokesman denied involvement.
GNA Health Minister Hamid bin Omar told Reuters earlier in a phone call that the number of dead and wounded was still rising. Tripoli ambulance service spokesman Osama Ali said some body parts could not be immediately counted by forensic experts.
Earlier, the ambulance service appealed for a temporary ceasefire to allow its crews to retrieve the bodies of five civilians killed on As Sidra Road in southern Tripoli and to evacuate families.
Emergency teams withdrew after coming under fire while trying to access the area on Saturday, it said.
The GNA Foreign Ministry called for referring Haftar and his aides to the International Criminal Court on charges of committing ""crimes against humanity"", adding that it will call for an emergency UN Security Council meeting to discuss the alleged crimes.
Qatar, which supports GNA, said on Saturday that the attack ""may amount to a war crime and crimes against humanity"".
Ankara, which last week passed a bill approving a troop deployment in Libya to support Tripoli, also condemned the attack and said the international community needs to take steps to achieve a ceasefire.
""It is crucial for the international community to urgently take necessary steps to halt external support for the pro-Haftar army and its attacks and establish a ceasefire in Libya,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement. 
The United Nations Support Mission in Libya (UNSMIL) condemned the attack saying that ""rising escalation... further complicates the situation in Libya and threatens the chances of returning to the political process"".
In response to the attack, GNA allied forces have targeted the LNA air base of Al-Wattia in an air strike, around 159 km southwest of Tripoli, a spokesman said in a statement.
Two sources in Haftar forces said four fighters were killed in a drone strike early on Sunday.
An increase in air strikes and shelling in and around Tripoli has caused the deaths of at least 11 civilians since early December and shut down health facilities and schools, the U.N. mission in Libya said on Friday.
Rockets and shelling also shut down Tripoli’s only functioning airport on Friday.
On Friday, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire in Libya.
He warned that the delivery of foreign support to warring parties would ""only deepen the ongoing conflict and further complicate efforts to reach a peaceful and comprehensive political solution"".
The parliament which moved to the east in 2014 voted to provide Haftar with emergency funding on Saturday.

The pro-Haftar chamber also held a series of symbolic votes against the GNA and Turkey, which struck two pacts on maritime boundaries and military cooperation in November.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of thousands of mourners, many chanting, beating their chests and wailing in grief, turned out across Iran on Sunday to mourn slain military commander Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in Iraq in a U.S. military strike.
Soleimani's body was returned home on Sunday - given a hero's welcome as it arrived in the southwestern city of Ahvaz and then flown to the holy Shi'ite Muslim city of Mashhad.
State television showed huge crowds of mourners turning out to pay their respects, their chants, chest-beating and wails in keeping with the style of mourning common among Shi'ite Muslims.
Mourners carried posters bearing Soleimani's image as his casket wrapped in the national flag was driven slowly through the crowds.
Soleimani, the architect of Tehran’s overseas clandestine and military operations as head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Quds Force, was killed on Friday in a U.S. drone strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport.
While many Iranians have rallied in to show grief over the death of Soleimani, regarded as the country’s second most powerful figure after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, others worry his death might push the country to war with a superpower.
On Friday, Khamenei promised harsh revenge. U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to hit 52 Iranian sites “very hard” if Iran attacks Americans or U.S. assets.
When Soleimani's body arrived home, IRIB news agency posted a video clip of the casket wrapped in the national flag being unloaded from a plane as a military band played.
Thousands of mourners dressed in black marched through the streets of Ahvaz beating their chests, state television showed.
The body of Iranian-backed Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who was killed in the attack with Soleimani, was also flown to Ahvaz, according to IRIB.
Soleimani's body will be taken to Tehran on Monday and then he will be buried at his hometown Kerman on Tuesday.
Tens of thousands of people marched in Iraq on Saturday to mourn Soleimani and al-Muhandis, chanting ""Death to America""."

Corbyn said he would remain leader temporarily, and a contest to select his replacement is expected to begin shortly. The next leader will be chosen by a vote of party members and other affiliated or registered supporters.
Here are the likely candidates:
CLIVE LEWIS
Announcing his plan to run for leader, Lewis, 48, said he believed the party's members needed to have a greater say over selecting candidates and determining policy.
Before becoming a member of parliament in 2015, Lewis was a television news reporter for more than 10 years. He was also a member of the army reserve, serving in Afghanistan in 2009.
Lewis was involved in student politics while at university. He is now a junior finance spokesman for Labour, having previously done stints as both the party's spokesman for defense and for business.
LISA NANDY
Nandy, a 40-year-old former Labour policy chief for energy and climate change, has said the party will become irrelevant unless it changes course. She has put her name forward to run for the leadership.
A lawmaker who has represented the northern English town of Wigan since 2010, Nandy has long said Labour should focus more on towns, where, she believes ""there is a strong feeling ... that Labour stopped listening long ago"".
She resigned as Labour's policy chief for energy in 2016, one of several so-called ""shadow ministers"" who left their posts in protest against leader Corbyn. ""He is unable to form a broad, inclusive shadow cabinet that draws on the best of our movement's left and right traditions,"" she wrote at the time.
JESS PHILLIPS
Known for being outspoken and candid, Phillips has long been a critic of Corbyn's leadership. The 38-year-old ran women's refuges for victims of domestic abuse before becoming member of parliament for Birmingham Yardley in central England in 2015.
The youngest of four children, Phillips grew up in a Labour-supporting working class household and was given membership of the party for her 14th birthday. It was a childhood ambition of hers to become prime minister.
Phillips said she would run for the leadership to challenge Johnson, and to rebuild trust with the voters. Politics needs honest voices, she said.
KEIR STARMER
Starmer, 57, has served as Labour's Brexit spokesman since October 2016 and is seen as having played a key role in pushing the party to back a second referendum on leaving the EU.
Starmer said he had spent his life fighting injustice, and was now ready to take on Johnson's Conservatives. Seen as a party centrist, Starmer has warned against overreacting to the party's election defeat by ditching Corbyn's left-wing agenda entirely. He describes himself as a socialist.
Starmer is a trained barrister who served as a senior public prosecutor before entering parliament, and was knighted in 2014 for services to law and criminal justice.
EMILY THORNBERRY
Thornberry, 59, has represented the seat in north London next door to Corbyn's since 2005 and is Labour's foreign affairs spokeswoman. She has said she plans to run for the leadership.
A strong supporter of a second Brexit referendum and of remaining in the European Union, Thornberry has said the question for the next leader should not be their position on Brexit but what their plan is for taking on Johnson.
Thornberry joined the Labour Party when she was 17, saying she was motivated by her experience of being raised by a single mother in social housing. She went on to become a human rights barrister.
REBECCA LONG-BAILEY
Long-Bailey, 40, has yet to declare her intention to run but is seen as a strong contender because she has strong ties with trade unions, who are hugely influential within Labour, and is close to Corbyn and his senior ally John McDonnell.
She represents the northern English constituency of Salford and Eccles and currently serves as Corbyn's business spokeswoman. Her first job was working in a pawnbroker's, and she went on to become a solicitor in the healthcare sector."

Keir Starmer, a former senior public prosecutor and Labour's Brexit spokesman, took a leading role in persuading the party to back a second referendum but said the lack of clarity over how Labour would campaign in such a vote had been damaging.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives won a large majority in last month's election, paving the way for Britain to leave the EU at the end of January.
""We are going to leave the EU in the next few weeks and it is important for all of us, including myself, to recognize that the argument about leave and remain goes with it,"" Starmer said in an interview with the BBC.
""We will have left the EU and this election blew away the argument for a second referendum, rightly or wrongly, and we have to adjust to that situation, the argument has to move on.""
Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's decision to step down following the election defeat has opened the way for a leadership battle that will determine the direction of the party, which moved to the left during the veteran socialist's tenure.
Starmer is seen as a party centrist who could struggle to win over left-wing members who backed Corbyn, but is the bookmakers' favorite and a YouGov poll carried out at the end of last month gave him a strong lead over other candidates.
Starmer said Labour needed to focus on Britain's future ties with the EU. ""The argument now is can we insist on that close relationship with the EU,"" he said. ""My concern is less about technical membership of the EU now, it is if we shift our focus from the EU, move away from those standards and arrangements."""

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez failed on Sunday in a first attempt to get parliament's backing to form a government, leaving him two days to secure support to end an eight-month political gridlock.
Sanchez has been acting prime minister since a first inconclusive election in April and November did not produce a conclusive result. He needed an absolute majority of at least 176 votes in his favor in the 350-seat house to be confirmed as prime minister but failed to get it.
He obtained 166 votes in favor and 165 against, with 18 abstentions, while one lawmaker did not attend. 
On Tuesday, Sanchez will only need a simple majority - more ""yes"" than ""no"" votes. He is likely to get that after securing a commitment from the 13 lawmakers of Catalonia's largest separatist party, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), to abstain. 
Earlier this week, Socialist Party leader Sanchez and Pablo Iglesias, head of the far-left party Unidas Podemos, restated their intention to form the first coalition government in Spain's recent history.
The two parties together have 155 seats, short of a majority, so Sanchez is reliant on the votes of small regional parties.
In a sign of how close the race could be on Tuesday, a member from the small regional party Coalicion Canaria, Ana Oramas, voted against Sanchez instead of abstaining as her party had agreed on Friday.
During Sunday morning's debate, Sanchez stressed that a Socialist-Podemos coalition would take a progressive approach.
Sanchez and Iglesias have said they will push for tax hikes on high-income earners and companies and also intend to roll back a labor reform passed by a previous conservative government.
The morning was marked by tension during the speech of Mertxe Aizpurua of pro-independence Basque party EH Bildu. Aizpurua called the conservative and right wing parties People's Party, Vox and Ciudadanos ""Francoists"", a reference to late dictator Francisco Franco, and criticized the Constitution and King Felipe. 

She was met with boos and shouts of ""murderers"".

Last month a district court ruled that the woman, aged 19 at the time, had lied about being sexually assaulted by 12 Israeli teenagers at the holiday resort of Ayia Napa in July. She is due to be sentenced on Jan. 7 and faces up to one year in jail.
""There are clear questions around the due process and the fair trial safeguards that have applied in this case, I have raised those with my Cypriot opposite number,"" Raab told Sky News. In a separate interview with the BBC he said he had ""very serious concerns"" about her treatment.
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested after she withdrew an accusation that the teenagers had raped her in a hotel room.
She maintained that she had recanted her accusation under duress from police, during persistent questioning without a lawyer present. Prosecutors and the court dismissed that justification.
""My first priority and I think the first priority of the family will be to see this young lady released, come home safe and sound to this country to allow her to recover,"" Raab said.
Raab also said he had also spoken to the woman's mother, who has called for holidaymakers to boycott Cyprus. Britain accounted for a third of the 3.9 million tourists who visited Cyprus in 2018.
Asked by the BBC whether he would advise British people not to go to Cyprus if the woman is jailed, Raab said: ""We always keep our travel advice under review.""
""We have registered our concerns in crystal clear terms. Equally the Cypriots are every sensitive about political interference in that case so we will encourage them to do the right thing in the right way,"" he said."

The referendum drive reflects unease with the influx of foreigners, who now account for a quarter of the Swiss population. But imposing limits on EU citizens would violate bilateral accords that enhance Swiss access to the EU single market, the lifeblood of the export-led Swiss economy.
A binding referendum is expected in May on whether Switzerland should take back unilateral control of immigration, if necessary at the cost of abrogating the free-movement pact that took full effect in 2007.
The vote was put on the agenda by the far right People's Party, which is the largest in parliament and has two of seven seats in the federal cabinet.
The referendum under the Swiss system of direct democracy is being billed as Switzerland's ""Brexit moment"".
A Tamedia online survey of around 11,000 people across Switzerland found 58% were against the idea, 35% approved it and 7% had no opinion. It had a 2-point margin of error.
Battling the referendum campaign is a priority for the Swiss government, which has struggled to put relations with the surrounding EU on a new footing.
Brussels wants the Swiss to endorse a new treaty that would have Bern routinely adopt single market rules and create a more effective platform to resolve disputes.
The Swiss government has dragged its feet for months while it tries to forge domestic consensus on how to proceed, annoying Brussels and triggering a row over cross-border stock trading.
The treaty ran aground amid opposition that spanned the normally pro-Europe center left to the anti-EU far right. Critics say the pact infringes Swiss sovereignty to the extent that it would never get through parliament or pass a referendum.
The Tamedia poll found 39% of respondents wanted the treaty renegotiated, while 24% wanted it signed quickly and 24% wanted it rejected entirely.
Swiss voters in 2014 backed quotas on EU immigration, but parliament skirted a crisis with Brussels by instead giving hiring preference to people registered as unemployed in Switzerland. This angered the People's Party and led to the new referendum push."

Tanaka marked her birthday with a party on Sunday along with staff and friends at the nursing home, television footage from local broadcaster TVQ Kyushu Broadcasting Co showed.
Tanaka, whose birthday was on Jan. 2, took a bite from a slice of her big birthday cake. ""Tasty,"" she said with a smile. ""I want some more.""
Tanaka was last year confirmed as the oldest living person, aged 116 years 66 days old as of March 9, according to Guinness World Records.
Tanaka's record age is symbolic of Japan's fast-ageing population, which coupled with its falling birthrate is raising concerns about labor shortages and prospects for future economic growth.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Scuffles erupted between police and protesters in Hong Kong on Sunday, with dozens of arrests made, after thousands marched near the border, shouting pro-democracy slogans and venting their anger at mainland Chinese traders.
The demonstrators in Sheung Shui took aim at so-called ""parallel traders"" from China who buy vast amounts of duty free goods in Hong Kong and take them back to the mainland to sell at a profit.
Locals say it pushes up prices, overcrowds neighborhoods and adds to growing tensions between Hong Kong residents and mainland Chinese.
""The mainland Chinese come here, block the streets with their bags ... rents have gone up and it has made things more expensive for Hong Kongers,"" said Jasmin, a 19-year old student dressed all in black, who only gave her first name. 
""I want the government to know that too many of them are coming over here.""
The marchers, including families with children, shouted slogans such as ""Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times!"" and ""Patriots use China-made products, don't parallel trade!""
Organizers estimated 10,000 people took part in the march, while police estimated a crowd of 2,500 at its peak.
After the march ended, protesters dressed in black and wearing face masks remained in the area despite calls from organizers to disperse immediately. At one point, riot police stormed through, hitting protesters with batons and using pepper spray. It was unclear what triggered their intervention.
A few dozen people were arrested. They were seen sitting on the ground and leaning against a wall while police took down their details and were later escorted into two white buses.
Many shops in the area were closed.
Earlier in the day, in a separated incident, police fired tear gas to disperse a group of protesters hurling petrol bombs over the fence of the Sheung Shui police station before the march, damaging one police vehicle.
Sunday's protests follow a march in central Hong Kong of at least tens of thousands on New Year's Day and an escalation in clashes with the police over the festive period.
Anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong escalated in June over a now-withdrawn extradition bill, but have since developed into a broader movement, with demands including universal suffrage and an independent inquiry against alleged police brutality.
The police maintain they have acted with restraint.
Many people in Hong Kong are angered by Beijing's tight grip on the city which was promised a high degree of autonomy under this framework when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing denies interference and blames the West for fomenting the unrest.
The protest movement is supported by 59% of the city's residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.
In a Saturday statement, China's ministry of human resources and social security said the head of its Hong Kong Liaison Office, the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-controlled territory, had been replaced.
Wang Zhimin, who had held the post since 2017, had been replaced by Luo Huining, who until November was the top communist party official in the northern province of Shanxi.
Reuters reported exclusively in November that Beijing was considering potential replacements for Wang, in a sign of dissatisfaction with the Liaison Office's handling of the crisis.

1326,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 05, 2020 01:44AM ET</span>",Australia begins damage assessment amid temporary respite from bushfires,"By John Mair and Paulina Duran
SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian authorities began assessing the damage on Sunday from heatwave-spurred bushfires that swept through two states a day earlier, as cooler conditions provided a temporary respite from blazes that have scarred the country's east coast for weeks.
Light rain and cooler temperatures in the southeast of the country were a welcome change from the searing heat that has fueled the devastating fires, but officials warned they were not enough to put out almost 200 fires still burning.
""It certainly is a welcome reprieve, it is psychological relief if nothing else,"" New South Wales (NSW) state Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said in an afternoon briefing on the situation. ""But unfortunately it is not putting out the fires.""
Tens of thousands of homes in both NSW and Victoria states were without power on Sunday as a large-scale military and police effort continued to provide supplies and evacuate thousands of people who have been trapped for days in coastal towns by the fires.
Initial estimates put damaged or destroyed properties in the hundreds, but authorities said the mass evacuations by residents of at-risk areas appear to have prevented major loss of life. Twenty-four people have been killed since the start of this year's wildfire season.
Fire officials said temperatures were expected to rise again during the week and the next major flashpoint would come by Thursday, but it was too early to gauge the likely severity of the threat.
""The weather activity we're seeing, the extent and spread of the fires, the speed at which they're going, the way in which they are attacking communities who have never ever seen fire before is unprecedented,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Thousands of people have been evacuated from coastal towns at the peak of the summer holiday season, in one of the biggest coordinated operations since the evacuation of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy flattened the northern city in 1974.
Australia has been battling blazes across much of its east coast for months, with experts saying climate change has been a major factor in a three-year drought that has left much of the country's bushland tinder-dry and susceptible to fires.
Following are highlights of what is happening across Australia:
- Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Singapore and Papua New Guinea have made offers of military support; New Zealand was sending an additional three Air Force helicopters and crews, two Army Combat Engineer Sections and a command element to support Australian Defense efforts.
- As smoke cleared, about 350 people were due to be airlifted out of the Victorian town of Mallacoota on Sunday, where around 1,000 people were evacuated by sea on Friday. That would leave about 400 people who had chosen to stay in the community, The Age newspaper reported.
- No fires were burning out of control in the New South Wales, but four fires in Victoria had Evacuate Now or Emergency Level warnings.
- A threat earlier on Sunday to the NSW town of Eden had eased by late afternoon, and authorities said evacuation was no longer necessary.
- Haze from the fires was turning skies orange as far away as New Zealand; police there asked people to not call the emergency phone number.
- In Canberra, officials asked for 100,000 extra breathing masks from the national stockpile as the country's capital recorded the worst air quality in the world on Sunday, according to the IQAir AirVisual global index. The masks are expected to arrive on Monday.
- Actors, popstars and Britain's royal family stepped in to offer support for victims of the fires, helping to raise millions for firefighting services and wildlife shelters.
- The death of a 47-year old man who was defending a friend's rural property in NSW took the national toll this season to 24. NSW Premier Berejiklian said there was no one unaccounted for in NSW; Victorian authorities said four people were unaccounted for in Victoria.
- The federal government on Saturday announced an unprecedented call up of army reservists to support firefighters as well other resources including a third navy ship equipped for disaster and humanitarian relief. It also announced the creation of a federal bushfires response agency. [L4N29902C]
- RFS Commissioner Fitzsimmons criticized the government for not informing him of its policy proposal, saying he found out about it from the media and it created confusion on one of the busiest days ever for fighting fires.
- PM Morrison also faced criticism for a video he posted on social media outlining how the government is tackling the fires. Morrison has been under sustained attack handling of the crisis after he jetted out for a family holiday in Hawaii. He apologized and returned early but was heckled and snubbed when he toured fire-hit regions in recent days.
- More than 5.25 million hectares (13 million acres) of land has been burnt this fire season. Almost 1,500 homes have been destroyed in NSW state alone."

In the first round of voting two weeks ago, former prime minister Zoran Milanovic, who is Social Democrats' candidate, came first among the 11 candidates with 29.6% of votes. He finished ahead of the incumbent president, the conservative Croatian Democratic Union's (HDZ) Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic with 26.7%.
The opinion polls and analysts suggest that the race for the next five-year presidential term, which begins in February, could be tight, although some give a slight advantage to Grabar-Kitarovic.
""I believe that she has somewhat bigger chances as the Croatian electorate is generally slightly right-leaning. In any case, this election is a kind of a preliminary stage for the parliamentary election later this year,"" said political analyst Zarko Puhovski.
The polling stations close at 1800 GMT and the first preliminary results will be known around 1900 GMT.
The presidential role is to a large extent ceremonial as the head of state cannot veto laws, but has a say in foreign policy, defense and security matters.
Milanovic, who was the prime minister from 2011 to 2015, ran his election campaign on promises that he would fight corruption that he said had intensified since he left power and the conservatives took over.
The conservatives say Milanovic's government ran poor economic policy that piled up public debt.
Croatia, which took over the six-month rotating presidency of the European Union on Jan. 1, is set to hold the next parliamentary election in the autumn.
In the opinion polls, the ruling HDZ party is slightly ahead of the Social Democrats in popularity."

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - China has replaced the head of its Hong Kong Liaison Office, the most senior mainland political official based in the Chinese-controlled territory, following more than six months of often-violent anti-government protests in the city.
Wang Zhimin, who had held the post since 2017, had been replaced by 65-year-old Luo Huining, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security said on its website late on Saturday. Until November, Luo was the top official of China's ruling Communist Party in the northern province of Shanxi.
Reuters reported exclusively in November that Beijing was considering potential replacements for Wang, in a sign of dissatisfaction with the Liaison Office's handling of the crisis, the worst since the city reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997.
Saturday's statement gave no other details on the change.
Luo, a loyalist of President Xi Jinping, has not previously held any Hong Kong-related position and is at the age when top Chinese officials typically retire. In Shanxi, he had been tasked with cleaning up a graft-ridden, coal-rich region where corruption was once likened to cancer.
The Liaison Office, which reports to China's State Council, serves as the platform for Beijing to project its influence in the city, and has come in for criticism in Hong Kong and mainland China for misjudging the situation in the city.
Wang is the shortest serving Liaison office director since 1997.
Ma Ngok, a political scientist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, said it had been only a matter of time before Beijing made Hong Kong-related personnel changes, and that the switch did not necessarily indicate a change in policy.
""Beijing is having trouble devising new policy in Hong Kong,"" Ma said.
""Given his age it is possible he is only a stop-gap appointment,"" Ma said of Luo.
Johnny Lau, a political scientist and commentator, said Wang's exit was unlikely to placate Hong Kong protesters who have demanded that the city's leader, Carrie Lam, step down.
Writing in the Communist Party's official People's Daily in 2017, Luo said Shanxi province had been ardently following instructions from Xi to clean up the mess there.
""All the province's people have deeply felt that the all-out efforts to enforce party discipline have been like spring rain washing away the smog,"" Luo wrote.
Before moving to Shanxi, Luo had been the top party official in the western province of Qinghai.
""Shanxi has gone from being a victim of a regression in its political environment to being a beneficiary of all-out efforts to enforce party discipline,"" he wrote in 2017.
'STAUNCH SUPPORT'
Mass protests erupted in June in Hong Kong over an extradition bill that would have allowed individuals to be sent for trial to the mainland, where justice is controlled by the Communist Party. 
Though the bill was withdrawn, protests have continued over a broad perception that Beijing is meddling improperly in city affairs and complaints of police brutality.
Lam said in a statement on Saturday that the Liaison Office would continue under Luo's leadership to work with the Hong Kong government for the ""positive development"" of the relationship between the mainland and Hong Kong.
She added that Luo's predecessor had provided ""staunch support"" to the Hong Kong government's efforts to curb violence and uphold the rule of law during the unrest of recent months.

On Sunday, Australian actor Nicole Kidman pledged a $500,000 donation on behalf of her family to New South Wales state Rural Fire Service, without specifying a currency.
Kidman spent time in Sydney over the New Year, according to a picture posted on Instagram of herself and husband country music singer Keith Urban in front of the Sydney Harbour Bridge.
Sydney has seen some of the poorest air quality of any international city in recent weeks as smoke from bushfires has blanketed the city.
""Our family’s support, thoughts and prayers are with everyone affected by the fires all over Australia,"" she wrote, next to a link to a national firefighting donation page.
On Saturday, Britain's Queen Elizabeth joined grandsons William and Harry in expressing shock at the bushfires, and sent their thanks to the firefighters who risked their lives to save others.
Australian comedian Celeste Barber, who has family near the bushfire-hit town of Eden on the country's south eastern coast, and popstars P!nk and Iggy Azalea, who hails from a blaze-hit region north of Sydney, also raised money to support firefighters and animal rescue.
A GoFundMe page set up by Barber, who won fame for her parody photographs mimicking ""real-life"" reenactments of high-end fashion shoots, had raised A$20 million ($13.90 million) for the NSW Rural Fire Service as of Sunday.
""Our family are being evacuated. I feel sick,"" she wrote on social media on Saturday.
Meanwhile, pop singer P!nk pledged a $500,000 donation to local fire services that were ""battling so hard on the frontlines.""
""My heart goes out to our friends and family in Oz.""
Azalea, a rapper who was born in Sydney but raised in Mullumbimby on the north coast of New South Wales, which narrowly avoided bushfires in November, posted a photo on Instagram of her cuddling a koala and called for donations to a local wildlife shelter. By Sunday morning it had raised almost A$100,000.
""Got to visit this cutie yesterday, as well as so many animals injured & rehabilitated at @currumbinwildlifehospital,"" she said.
""Please donate if you can.""
These donations add to those already made by actor Russell Crowe and tech entrepreneur Mike Cannon-Brookes of Atlassian, according to Crowe on Instagram.
Crowe said they donated A$200,000 to regional RFS branches in November after bushfires threatened his property around Nana Glen, around 550 kilometres north of Sydney."

Labour's spokesman on Brexit, who is seen as a party centrist who could struggle to win over left-wing members who backed Corbyn, released a video talking up his role in key flashpoints in Britain's social history. 
From long-running battles over the closure of mines to the Iraq war and clashes with Rupert Murdoch, Starmer said he had spent his life fighting injustice, and was now ready to take on Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party.
""I still believe another future is possible,"" he said. ""But we have to fight for it.""
Corbyn's decision to step down following Johnson's crushing election victory in December has opened the way for a leadership battle that will determine the future direction of the party, which moved to the left during the veteran socialist's tenure. 
A recent YouGov poll of party members published in the Guardian newspaper put support for Starmer on 61% in a theoretical run-off against Rebecca Long-Bailey, the party's business spokeswoman who has strong ties with trade unions and the party's left wing. 
Starmer's support waned, however, among members who backed Brexit, after he took a leading role in persuading the party to back a second referendum on leaving the European Union.

Other candidates who have said they will run for the leadership of the party include foreign spokeswoman Emily Thornberry and outspoken Corbyn critic Jess Phillips. Long-Bailey is expected to join the race in the coming weeks.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Groups of protesters took to the streets in Washington and other U.S. cities on Saturday to condemn the air strike in Iraq ordered by President Donald Trump that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani and Trump's decision to send about 3,000 more troops to the Middle East.
""No justice, no peace. U.S. out of the Middle East,"" hundreds of demonstrators chanted outside the White House before marching to the Trump International Hotel a few blocks away.
Similar protests were held in New York, Chicago and other cities. Organizers at Code Pink, a women-led anti-war group, said protests were scheduled on Saturday in numerous U.S. cities and towns. 
Protesters in Washington held signs that read ""No war or sanctions on Iran!"" and ""U.S. troops out of Iraq!"" 
Speakers at the Washington event included actress and activist Jane Fonda, who last year was arrested at a climate change protest on the steps of the U.S. Capitol.
""The younger people here should know that all of the wars fought since you were born have been fought over oil,"" Fonda, 82, told the crowd, adding that ""we can't anymore lose lives and kill people and ruin an environment because of oil.""
""Going to a march doesn't do a lot, but at least I can come out and say something: that I'm opposed to this stuff,"" said protestor Steve Lane of Bethesda, Maryland. ""And maybe if enough people do the same thing, he (Trump) will listen.""
Soleimani, regarded as the second most powerful figure in Iran, was killed in the U.S. strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport on Friday in a dramatic escalation of hostilities in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies.

Public opinion polls show Americans in general have been opposed to U.S. military interventions overseas. A survey last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found 27% of Americans believe military interventions make the United States safer, and nearly half said they make the country less safe.

Britain's defence minister, Ben Wallace, ordered the HMS Montrose and HMS Defender to prepare to return to escort duties in the major oil shipping route as Prime Minister Boris Johnson came in for criticism for his silence over the killing.
Media reports have said Johnson is on holiday in the Caribbean.
""The government will take all necessary steps to protect our ships and citizens at this time,"" Wallace said in a statement. 
Britain was forced to defend its ships through the world's most important shipping route last year after Iranian commandos seized a British-flagged tanker in the Strait.
British forces had previously captured an Iranian oil tanker near Gibraltar that was accused of violating sanctions on Syria. The killing of Soleimani has raised fears that tankers could be targeted again.
Wallace said he had spoken to his U.S. counterpart, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and urged restraint on all sides.
""Under international law, the United States is entitled to defend itself against those posing an imminent threat to their citizens,"" he added.
Jeremy Corbyn, the outgoing leader of the opposition Labour Party, said he had written to the British prime minister to ask what was being done to protect UK nationals and others in the region. 

""Boris Johnson should have immediately cut short his holiday to deal with an issue that could have grave consequences for the UK and the world,"" he said in a statement.

""My thanks go out to the emergency services, and those who put their own lives in danger to help communities in need,"" Queen Elizabeth, who is Australia's head of state, said in a statement. ""Prince Philip and I send our thoughts and prayers to all Australians at this difficult time.""
Prince William, son of Prince Charles and the late Princess Diana, and his wife Kate said they had been shocked and saddened by the wildfires, while brother Harry and his wife Meghan sent messages of support and fundraising links on Instagram.
""This global environmental crisis has now been described as Ecocide,"" Harry and Meghan said. ""It's easy to feel helpless, but there's always a way to help."" 
The bushfires burned dangerously out of control on Australia's east coast on Saturday, fanned by high temperatures and strong winds that battered exhausted firefighters as they fought to save lives and property.
Australia's Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said the conditions were deteriorating rapidly as a change in wind conditions merged several large fire fronts.
The federal government has announced an unprecedented call-up of army reservists to support firefighters and has deployed additional resources, including a third navy ship equipped for disaster and humanitarian relief.
""We send our deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who have tragically lost their lives, and the brave firemen who continue to risk their own lives to save the lives of others,"" said William, the second in line to the throne.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - With shouts of ""Death to America"", tens of thousands of people marched in Iraq on Saturday to mourn Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia leader who were killed in a U.S. air strike that has raised the specter of wider conflict in the Middle East.
On Saturday evening, a rocket fell inside Baghdad's heavily-fortified Green Zone near the U.S. Embassy, another hit the nearby Jadriya neighborhood and two more rockets were fired at the Balad air base north of the city, but no one was killed, the Iraqi military said in a statement. There was no immediate claim of responsibility.
With security worries rising after Friday's strike, the NATO alliance and a separate U.S.-led mission suspended their programs to train Iraqi security and armed forces, officials said.
""The safety of our personnel in Iraq is paramount. We continue to take all precautions necessary,"" acting NATO spokesman Dylan White said in a statement.
Soleimani, commander of the Revolutionary Guards' foreign legions, was killed in the U.S. strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport. Iranian-backed Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed. The attack took Washington and its allies, mainly Saudi Arabia and Israel, into uncharted territory in their confrontation with Iran and its proxy militias across the region.
France stepped up diplomatic initiatives on Saturday to ease tensions. French President Emmanuel Macron talked with Iraq President Barham Salih, Macron's office said.
""The two presidents agreed to remain in close contact to avoid any further escalation in tensions and in order to act to ensure stability in Iraq and the broader region,"" a statement from Macron's office said.
Macron also spoke with the de facto ruler of the United Arab Emirates, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan.
Gholamali Abuhamzeh, a senior commander of the Revolutionary Guards, said Tehran would punish Americans ""wherever they are in reach"", and raised the prospect of possible attacks on ships in the Gulf.
Iraq's Kataib Hezbollah militia warned Iraqi security forces to stay away from U.S. bases in Iraq, ""by a distance not less than a thousand meters starting Sunday evening,"" reported Lebanese al-Mayadeen TV, which is close to Lebanon's Hezbollah.
VOTE ON U.S. TROOP PRESENCE
The United States has been an ally of the Iraqi government since the 2003 U.S. invasion to oust dictator Saddam Hussein, but Iraq has become more closely allied with Iran.
The top candidate to succeed Muhandis, Hadi al-Amiri, spoke over the dead militia commander's coffin: ""The price for your noble blood is American forces leaving Iraq forever and achieving total national sovereignty.""
The Iraqi parliament is convening an extraordinary session during which a vote to expel U.S. troops could be taken as soon as Sunday. Many Iraqis, including opponents of Soleimani, have expressed anger at Washington for killing the two men on Iraqi soil and possibly dragging their country into another conflict.
Soleimani, 62, was Iran's pre-eminent military leader - head of the Revolutionary Guards' overseas Quds Force and the architect of Iran's spreading influence in the Middle East.
Muhandis was de facto leader of Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) umbrella body of paramilitary groups.
A PMF-organised procession carried the bodies of Soleimani and Muhandis, and those of others killed in the U.S. strike, through Baghdad's Green Zone.
Mourners included many militiamen in uniform for whom Muhandis and Soleimani were heroes. They carried portraits of both men and plastered them on walls and armored personnel carriers in the procession. Chants of ""Death to America"" and ""No No Israel"" rang out.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi also attended. Mahdi's office later said he received a phone call from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and they ""discussed the difficult conditions facing Iraq and the region.""
BODIES TAKEN TO HOLY CITIES
Mourners later brought the bodies by car to the Shi'ite holy city of Kerbala, south of Baghdad, then to Najaf, another sacred Shi'ite city, where they were met by the son of Iraq's top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, and where Muhandis and the other Iraqis killed will be laid to rest.
Soleimani's body will be transferred to the southwestern Iranian province of Khuzestan that borders Iraq. On Sunday it will be taken to the Shi'ite holy city of Mashhad in Iran's northeast and from there to Tehran and his hometown Kerman in the southeast for burial on Tuesday, state media said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that Soleimani had been plotting ""imminent and sinister"" attacks on American diplomats and military personnel. Democratic critics said the Republican president's action was reckless and risked more bloodshed in a dangerous region.
Some U.S. national security and congressional officials questioned the use of the word imminent to justify the killing, while some legal experts and a senior U.N. rights investigator said the strike could have violated international law.
The U.S. strike followed a sharp increase in U.S.-Iranian hostilities in Iraq since last week when pro-Iranian militias attacked the U.S. embassy in Baghdad after a deadly U.S. air raid on Kataib Hezbollah, founded by Muhandis. Washington accused the group of an attack on an Iraqi military base that killed an American contractor.
Abuhamzeh, the Revolutionary Guards commander in Kerman province, mentioned a series of possible targets for reprisals including the Gulf waterway through which about a third of the world's shipborne oil is exported to global markets.

It was not immediately clear who was responsible for the blast, which hit one bus in a convoy of three that was carrying 160 passengers in all, it said in a statement.
The incident occurred in Sourou province, near the border with Burkina's chaotic neighbour Mali, where Islamist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State have increased attacks over the past two years despite international efforts to stamp them out. 
Three sources said earlier that the convoy had been ferrying pupils back from an end-of-year school break. The government statement said seven students were among the dead, without providing their ages. 
""The government strongly condemns this cowardly and barbaric act which aims to damage people's morale,"" the statement said.
Burkina has lost its reputation as a pocket of relative calm in the Sahel region as a homegrown insurgency has been amplified by a spillover of jihadist violence and crime from Mali, rendering much of the north ungovernable. 
Attacks over the past year have killed hundreds and forced nearly a million people from their homes. 
Insurgents killed 35 mostly female civilians on Dec. 24 after attacking a military outpost in Soum Province, also in the north. About 87 militants and local security forces were killed in the clash, authorities said.

PARIS (Reuters) - France's anti-terrorism prosecutors on Saturday took over the investigation of a fatal knife rampage near Paris, saying they had established that the attacker had been radicalized and had carefully planned an act intended to spread terror.
A man identified only as Nathan C. stabbed one person to death on Friday in a park in Villejuif, just outside southern Paris, and wounded two others. The attacker, who had a history of drug and psychiatric problems, was shot dead by police.
""While the troubling psychiatric problems of the individual have indeed been confirmed, the investigations carried out in the last few hours have allowed us to establish a definite radicalization of the suspect, as well as evidence of planning and preparation carried out before the act,"" the anti-terrorism prosecutor's department said.
""The steps taken to carry out the murderous act were carefully thought through, and were intended to spread intimidation or terror among the general public.""
The department said it was also looking into whether or not Nathan C., who was born in 1997 in Lilas, a northeastern suburb of Paris, had any accomplices. Religious texts including a copy of the Koran were found among his belongings.
The attacker had been to hospital a few months earlier and was undergoing psychiatric treatment. He also had drug problems.
Paris has suffered major attacks by Islamist militants in recent years. 

Coordinated bombings and shootings in November 2015 at the Bataclan theater and other sites around Paris killed 130 people - the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two.

PARIS (Reuters) - Police on Saturday fired tear gas at demonstrators in Paris's busy Gare du Nord station, used by tourists taking the Eurostar service, and at the Gare de l'Est, during demonstrations against plans to reform France's pension system.
The demonstrators, who set fire to rubbish bins, included ""Yellow Vests"" anti-government activists, whose name is derived from the high-visibility jackets worn at their protests. 
Police also used tear gas in Paris's Bastille area, as demonstrators marched through the city.
President Emmanuel Macron has said reforms are essential to simplify the convoluted pensions system, but his opponents say they will mean many French people having to work for longer.
""People have to think a bit about what kind of society they want in general and, on a more personal level, whether you're 20, 30, 40 or 50, one day you'll retire,"" said Jean-Gabriel Maheo, an industrial technician who said he was in his 50s.
""If the currently proposed system passes in the way it is laid out, it will be a social catastrophe. Already, the previous reforms are seeing people retire with measly pensions,"" added Maheo, taking part in the Paris demonstration.

Much of France has been crippled by a national transport strike since the pensions protests began a month ago. Another big nationwide demonstration is due on Jan. 9.

SALZBURG, Austria (Reuters) - Austria's Greens on Saturday formally approved a coalition deal with conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz, backing their leader's argument that it would keep the far right out of power and bring ambitious environmental reforms despite misgivings.
The parties struck the deal on New Year's Day, paving the way for Kurz to return to power three months after winning an election and for the left-wing environmentalists to enter government for the first time.
President Alexander Van der Bellen will swear in the new government on Tuesday, his office said.
The awkward alliance is being closely watched in Germany, where the electoral balance is similar, at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change.
Many Greens have balked at elements of Kurz's law-and-order agenda, despite their leader Werner Kogler saying the deal had to reflect their party's smaller share of the vote. The Greens won 13.9% compared to 37.5% for Kurz's People's Party (OVP), whose last coalition was with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO).
""The future is made of courage. Yes but also of the force of will, of a plan,"" Kogler told a party congress whose approval he needed to seal the coalition deal. He added that it ""makes a difference"" whether Kurz governs with the Greens or the FPO. 
He received a standing ovation and repeated applause before 93% of delegates backed the deal in a show of hands. 
Kurz has made a hard line on immigration and ""political Islam"" his trademark, and the deal includes extending a ban on headscarves in schools until the age of 14 from around 10 currently. 
The OVP-FPO coalition collapsed in May when FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache was caught in a video sting offering to fix state contracts. A provisional government of civil servants has been in place since June. 
MAKE IT SO
The new coalition deal resurrects some of the previous Kurz government's ideas such as preventive custody for people deemed a threat to public safety, proposed after a fatal stabbing apparently committed by an asylum seeker.
Many Greens expressed misgivings.
""It is not enough to say that we blocked the FPO,"" Flora Lebloch from the party's youth wing said, calling Kurz's OVP ""an authoritarian right-wing party"".
The dominant mood, however, was one in favor of compromise.
""Sometimes you have to work with the Klingons,"" one delegate from the eastern province of Burgenland said in a Star Trek-themed speech, arguing the party should ""boldly go where no Greens have gone before"".
Another contentious point is that the Greens' plan to overhaul taxation to better price in planet-warming carbon emissions has been put off until 2022.

""What will happen in 2022? I don't know yet either,"" said Kogler. ""But we will work on it and fight for it to move forward.""

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Over one hundred thousand protesters, many carrying the Indian tricolour flag, took part in a peaceful march in the southern city of Hyderabad on Saturday, chanting slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new citizenship law. 
The protest, dubbed the ‘Million March’, was organized by an umbrella group of Muslim and civil society organizations. More than 40 percent of Hyderabad's estimated population of nearly 7 million are Muslims. 
Demonstrators were still pouring into the protest site late on Saturday afternoon, according to a Reuters witness, despite police saying no march would be allowed and that permission had only been granted for a 1,000-person gathering. 
The Indian government has faced weeks of acrimonious and, at times, violent protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which was passed by Modi's government in December. 
The Hyderabad protesters held placards with slogans including ""Withdraw CAA immediately,"" and ""India's only religion in Secularism."" 
The Reuters witness said the protest remained peaceful, and estimated that more than one hundred thousand people were in attendance. 
The new law eases the path for non-Muslim minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain Indian citizenship. But, if combined with a proposed national register of citizens, critics of the CAA fear it will discriminate against minority Muslims in India and chip away at India's secular constitution.
Modi's government maintains the new law is necessary to help minorities facing persecution in Muslim-majority nations, and it has called the pan-India protests politically motivated.
At least 25 people have been killed in protest-related clashes with police since early December. 
Elsewhere, protests against the CAA also went ahead in several other Indian cities on Saturday with hundreds turning out for protests in cities in the southern state of Karnataka.

Hundreds of men and women gathered at a rally in the tech hub of Bengaluru, with some accusing Modi's government of trying to divide India along communal lines, to distract from a sharp domestic economic slowdown and job losses.

1342,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 04, 2020 08:54AM ET</span>",Bushfires rage out of control across southeast Australia,"By John Mair and Will Ziebell
SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Bushfires burned dangerously out of control on Australia's east coast on Saturday, fanned by high temperatures and strong winds that had firefighters battling to save lives and property, as a change in wind conditions merged several large fire fronts. 
By late evening, Victoria had 14 fires rated at emergency or evacuate warning levels, and New South Wales had 11 rated emergency, with more than 150 others burning across the states. New fires had started, and others had broken containment lines.
""There are a number of fires that are coming together - very strong, very large, intense fires that are creating some of these fire-generated thunderstorms,"" New South Wales Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said at an evening briefing.
""And unfortunately we've still got many hours to go of these elevated and dangerous conditions.""
The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said conditions were deteriorating rapidly as a gusty southerly wind change pushed up the coast and smoke plumes from the fires triggered storms.
Authorities are worried the fires could turn out to be worse than New Year's Eve, when they burnt massive tracts of bushland and forced thousands of residents and summer holidaymakers to seek refuge on beaches.
In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews said while conditions were difficult, the job of firefighters had been made easier by tens of thousands of people following advice to evacuate.
It may be Sunday or later before damage assessments can be made. Prime Minister Scott Morrison put the national death toll from the current fire season, which began in September, at 23. Twelve of those are from this week's fires alone.
In updates, the NSW RFS repeatedly delivered the same blunt advice to those who had not evacuated at-risk areas: ""It is too late to leave. Seek shelter as the fire approaches."" 
Residents used social media to post photos of the sky turning black and red from the smoke and glare of the fires, including in the Victorian town of Mallacoota, where around 1,000 people were evacuated by sea on Friday.
The first of those evacuees arrived near Melbourne on Saturday morning after a 20-hour journey by boat and a second ship with about 1,000 people landed in the afternoon.
The federal government announced an unprecedented call up of army reservists to support firefighters as well other resources including a third navy ship equipped for disaster and humanitarian relief.
Andy Gillham, the incident controller in the Victorian town of Bairnsdale, said the area had avoided the worst of the fires on Saturday but stressed this was an exceptional fire season.
""In a normal year, we would start to see the fire season kick off in a big way around early January and we're already up towards a million hectares of burnt country. This is a marathon event and we expect to be busy managing these fires for at least the next eight weeks,"" he said.
* Click on links to see maps posted by emergency services in NSW and Victoria to predict the spread of fires on Saturday: https:// and https:// 
Following are highlights of what is happening across Australia:
* Temperatures topped 113 degrees in much of the Sydney metropolitan area, with Penrith recording a high of 120 according to the BOM. Canberra, the national capital, recorded a temperature of 111.2 just after 4 p.m., which the chief minister said was a record for the territory.
*As the fires have flared, many towns have been isolated as major and minor roads are closed. Some fires are generating their own storm systems, which create the risk of lightning strikes generating new fires.
* A late southerly wind change on Saturday dramatically lowered temperatures, but also brought wind gusts of 43-50 miles per hour that caused some major fires near the border of Victoria and New South Wales states to merge and strengthen.
* In South Australia, two people died on Kangaroo Island, a popular holiday spot not far off the coast. South Australian Premier Steven Marshall said more than 247,000 acres have burned there, about one-quarter of the total area.
* Six people remain unaccounted for in Victoria, Premier Andrews said on Saturday, down from 28 reported on Friday.
* The focus on Saturday is preventing more loss of life, authorities said. National parks have been closed and people urged earlier this week to evacuate large parts of NSW's south coast and Victoria's north eastern regions, magnets for holidaymakers at the peak of Australia's summer school holidays.
* Morrison confirmed that his visit to India and Japan scheduled for mid-January had been postponed due to the fires.

* More than 13 million acres of land has been burnt this fire season.

The two leaders are likely to discuss whether they can strike a new trade relationship in the transition period that will follow until December 2020. Von der Leyen has said time is extremely short ""for the mass of issues that have to be negotiated"".
Johnson has set a hard deadline to reach a new trade deal with the EU, betting that the prospect of another Brexit cliff-edge would force Brussels to move more quickly to seal an accord.
The legislation required to implement Johnson's EU divorce deal will return to parliament for further scrutiny on Tuesday and is set to be approved in time for Jan. 31 following his crushing victory in a December election.
The hosting of a bilateral meeting in London indicates that unlike the first stage of the Brexit process, when ministers traveled to Brussels for talks, the second stage of trade talks will be held in both locations.
Von der Leyen, who replaced Jean-Claude Juncker in December, will also give a lecture at the London School of Economics titled ""Old Friends, New Beginnings: building another future for the EU-UK partnership."""

NEW DELHI/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Before midnight on New Year's Eve, a call to action was sent on a private WhatsApp group - within the hour, dozens gathered in the center of the southern Indian city of Hyderabad, many holding banners to protest a controversial new citizenship law.
Police quickly dispersed the group and briefly detained six people, but for Syed Faheem - who formed the WhatsApp group - it marked another successful flash protest, inspired by tactics used by protesters in Hong Kong.
Faheem, a software consultant, is one of a growing group of opponents to the new law who have begun to borrow tactics used in protests from Hong Kong to Paris, to protest legislation that critics say discriminates against Muslims. 
In Hyderabad, some protesters say it is impossible to secure police permission to hold demonstrations, forcing them to adopt new tactics to show dissent.
""The objective is to get 30 minutes at one spot. Some people support us, others come and argue with us,"" said Faheem, who has organized regular flash protests through WhatsApp messages that are amplified via social media.
The location of the protests, which change daily, are posted just an hour or two in advance, with the exact spots shared just minutes ahead of time. 
Hyderabad's police chief Anjani Kumar told Reuters people are being permitted to gather in areas such as sports grounds, or indoor auditoriums to protest, but added: ""We've not given permission for any rally or procession because that affects traffic.""
'BE WATER'
In Hong Kong, where anti-government demonstrations have raged on for months, protesters adopted a ""be water"" strategy, inspired by martial arts legend Bruce Lee, popping up in different locations almost daily to catch authorities flat-footed.
Sharjeel Imam, who helped organize a New Delhi sit-in protest against the new law that has run for weeks, said he plans to adopt the flash mob strategy to keep the agitation going.
In Hyderabad, the idea to copy Hong Kong's play-book came as protestors sought ways to run a long-term campaign that police would find hard to curb, two members from Faheem's group said.
""Hong Kong has been pivotal....It was very inspiring,"" said a 30-year-old IT professional, who declined to be identified. 
After police restricted protests in another southern city, students at the Indian Institute of Management in Bangalore took inspiration from 2015 protests in Paris where shoes were put on display - in place of canceled protests - to support action against climate change. Students also borrowed ideas from the 1975 protests against the imposition of an emergency in India.
""Police weren't letting us place placards with any messages, so we copied what the press did in 1975 and left blank placards with 'Concerned Citizens of IIM-Bangalore' written on them,"" a student involved in the protest said.

""Generations later, when they ask us what we did when they came for the Muslims, I at least want to be able to say - 'We tried'"", she said.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's acting prime minister Pedro Sanchez, seeking parliament's backing to form a government, set out his priorities on Saturday and tried to lower temperatures in the bitter debate over Catalonia by calling for dialogue.
Spain has been in political gridlock without a proper government for most of last year after two inconclusive elections.
""Spain is not going to break, the Constitution is not going to break. What is going to break is the blockade of a progressive government democratically elected by the Spanish people,"" Sanchez told deputies in opening remarks as he kicked off several days of debates and voting.
Earlier this week, the Socialist Party leader Sanchez and Pablo Iglesias, the head of the far-left party Unidas Podemos, restated their intention to form the first coalition government in Spain's recent history.
Since the two parties together fall short of a majority with 155 seats in a 350-member parliament, victory for Sanchez hinges on the votes of small regional parties.
Catalonia's largest separatist party, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), agreed to abstain in the second and decisive vote on Tuesday after Sanchez agreed to hold a dialogue over the region's future and submit its conclusions to Catalan voters.
But a last-minute decision by Spain's electoral board to block ERC's jailed leader Oriol Junqueras from becoming a member of the European Parliament has called the party's support into question. The board also decided to strip the head of Catalonia's regional government Quim Torra - an ERC ally - of his position as a regional lawmaker.
Teodoro Garcia Egea, a senior politician from the conservative People's Party, who has refused to back the coalition agreement between the Socialists and Podemos, accused Sanchez of hiding a pact with the separatists from Spaniards.
Sanchez said he wanted to resume dialogue rather than hammer out the dispute through Spain's courts, but said he would address the issues within Spain's constitutional framework.
Spain's constitution prohibits regions from breaking away and the Catalan independence drive, including a banned referendum in 2017, has caused the country's worst political crisis in decades.
Among his priorities, Sanchez mentioned increases in corporate tax, more worker-friendly labor legislation, fighting climate change and gender equality. He pledged to lift the minimum wage to 60 percent of average national wages by the end of the government's four-year term.

Sanchez is not expected to win the first confidence vote on Sunday, in which he would require an absolute majority of 176 members among all 350 lawmakers in the Spanish parliament. But he aims to win a second vote on Tuesday which would only require him to obtain more votes in favor than against.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - A rerun of Bolivia's election has been set for Sunday May 3, the president of the country's Supreme Electoral Tribunal said on Friday. 
Salvador Romero said both presidential and parliamentary elections would be held on the same day. 
""When we announce the electoral calendar over the next few days, together with the formal call for the election, all the deadlines that both political organizations and citizens must meet will be specified,"" he told reporters in La Paz.
The vote will be held almost seven months after the results of elections that handed a fourth term to Bolivia's former President Evo Morales but were then discredited.
An audit of last October's election found serious irregularities, prompting Morales' resignation and clashes between protesters and security forces that resulted in more than 30 deaths.
Morales, who had been in power for nearly 14 years, resigned following the election dispute and fled to Mexico, and later Argentina. He later said he had been toppled in a coup.
In an interview with Reuters last week, he ruled out standing as a candidate for his Movement for Socialism (MAS) coalition in the next election, but said that he would return to Bolivia by next Christmas.
He has identified Luis Arce Catacora, his former economy minister, and Andronico Rodriguez, a coca farmer union boss, as potential MAS presidential candidates.

Prosecutors have issued an arrest warrant for Morales on charges of sedition, terrorism and terrorist financing. The allegations have been pushed by the government of interim President Jeanine Anez, a former senator and political opponent of Morales.

""It was proved through recorded phone calls and meetings that he received money and gifts as bribes"", it added in a statement.
The statement gave no details but the state news agency MENA said he had received bribes from some chartered accountants who were dealing with the tax authority. Lawyers for Hussein could not immediately be reached for comment.
Deputy tax authority director Reda Abdul Kader has been named acting head of the agency, the finance ministry said on Saturday. ""The (finance) minister affirmed that there is no one above law, and hat there can be no covering up of any corruption,"" the ministry added in a statement.
Rare anti-government protests flared in September over economic austerity and allegations of official corruption and waste by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and the powerful military. Sisi denies such accusations.
Egyptian authorities have made notable efforts in recent years to improve tax collection and curb tax evasion, tightening laws and launching public campaigns to encourage people to settle their tax affairs.

SEOUL (Reuters) - A group of 11 North Koreans who were detained in Vietnam while seeking to defect to South Korea have been released thanks to the help of European institutions, a Seoul-based activist group said on Saturday.
The eight women and three men were caught by border guards in northern Vietnam in late November after crossing from China, and had been held in the northeastern border city of Lang Son.
Peter Jung, who heads the group helping the refugees, Justice for North Korea, said they were freed and on their way to South Korea last month.
Multiple European organizations played a key role, he said. He declined to identify them due to the diplomatic sensitivity but said they included a non-government group. 
The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that U.S. officials, including diplomats engaged in denuclearization talks with North Korea, intervened to secure the defectors' release, citing unidentified sources. 
But Jung said he was unaware of any U.S. contribution.
South Korea's foreign ministry said on Saturday that the WSJ report was ""not factual"", but said the government had made immediate efforts to prevent the defectors from being forcibly repatriated. It refused to elaborate.
""The European institutions acted after we published a video of the refugees making desperate appeals for freedom,"" Jung said. ""The South's foreign ministry got also involved later."" 
Jung had distributed a video of some of the 11 protesting against deportation before appearing to faint.
About 33,000 North Koreans have resettled in the affluent, democratic South. Most risked their lives to cross the border in a journey that may entail persecution and slave labor, if caught and repatriated.
As living examples of some of Pyongyang's worst abuses, defectors have long been the public face of campaigns to pressure Pyongyang to change its ways. 
But South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been criticized by groups like Jung's for not helping defectors enough and ignoring human rights issues as he promotes rapprochement with the North. 
In November, after brief questioning, South Korea expelled two North Korean fishermen calling them criminals who murdered 16 colleagues before crossing the border into the South.
A coalition of defector groups issued a joint statement criticizing the decision, saying the men should have been tried in the South because they would likely face torture, and possibly execution back home.

The indictment also charges Grafton Thomas, 37, with three counts of assault, three counts of attempted assault and two counts of burglary stemming from the Dec. 28 attack, Rockland County District Attorney Thomas Walsh announced at a brief news conference.
The original criminal complaint filed the day after the assault charged Thomas with five counts of attempted murder - one for each victim authorities then said was stabbed or slashed in the incident - plus a single count of burglary.
Walsh declined to take questions from reporters, and a copy of the indictment was not immediately provided. 
But the sixth attempted-murder count indicates investigators have revised their tally of victims, the most gravely injured of whom is reported to be a 72-year-old man who suffered machete blows to his head, leaving him partially paralyzed, comatose and breathing on a respirator.
Thomas is accused of storming into the home of Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg, a prominent Hasidic Jewish leader in a predominantly ultra-Orthodox community of Monsey, New York, and attacking guests gathered there for a Hanukkah celebration.
Authorities said Thomas fled by car to Manhattan, where he was arrested later that night.
Thomas, who according to his lawyer is a former U.S. Marine with a history of severe mental illness, was separately charged on Monday with federal hate crimes in connection with the attack.
Federal prosecutors cited journals they seized from the suspect's home containing references to Adolf Hitler, ""Nazi culture"" and the Black Hebrew Israelites movement, identified by experts in extremism as an anti-Jewish hate group.
The attack in Monsey capped a string of incidents in which Jews have been physically attacked or accosted in the New York metropolitan area in recent weeks, including a shooting at a kosher supermarket in New Jersey that left two members of the Hasidic community dead.
""Fear has spread through our community, and we must restore peace. This is the first stop in that process,"" Walsh told reporters. 
Thomas' attorney, Michael Sussman, has said his client's actions were likely an expression of psychosis rather than bigotry.
Thomas pleaded not guilty to the original attempted-murder charges the day after his arrest. 

His arraignment on the indictment is pending, and he remains held in lieu of $5 million bail after being moved to a federal detention facility, the District Attorney's office said in a statement.He faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted of the state charges. The felony case carries a maximum penalty of life in prison.

Here are profiles of the three presidential candidates.
TSAI ING-WEN
Tsai, 63, became Taiwan's first female president in 2016 following massive protests over a proposed trade pact with China that had been championed by the administration of President Ma Ying-jeou from the Kuomintang party, which favors close ties with China.
Growing up in a well-off family in Taipei, Tsai graduated with a degree in law from the island's top university before going first to Cornell and then the London School of Economics where she got her doctorate in trade law.
After a career in academia, Tsai was part of the team negotiating Taiwan's entry into the World Trade Organization and then joined the China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council, which she ended up running from 2000 to 2004.
Tsai joined the Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), which favors Taiwan's formal independence, in 2004, and briefly served as a vice premier from 2006-2007.
Tsai, an animal lover who frequently posts pictures of herself with cats and dogs on her social media pages, first stood for president in 2012, but lost to Ma who won a second term in office.
Since taking office China has heaped pressure on Tsai, fearing she is pushing Taiwan toward formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, and has vowed to defend the island's democracy and liberties.
Tsai says a vote for her is a vote against Taiwan becoming ""a second Hong Kong"" and being forced to accept a union with China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle. Tsai has repeatedly said Taiwan faces a life and death threat to its existence and democratic way of life from China. 
HAN KUO-YU
Han, 62, is the mayor of the southern Taiwanese city of Kaohsiung, and is the candidate for the Kuomintang, which once ruled mainland China before it was forced to flee to Taiwan in 1949 at the end of the Chinese civil war.
Han went to a military academy and then studied English literature at Taipei's prestigious Soochow University.
In 1992, Han won election to parliament, but later dropped out of politics before re-appearing in 2017 to run for the chairmanship of the Kuomintang - which he lost - though the following year he became the party's Kaohsiung mayoral candidate.
With a strong social media presence, Han unexpectedly won the election in a city which had traditionally been a DPP stronghold, promising to boost the economy in a city hard hit by factories moving to produce in far cheaper China.
Han has been combative on the campaign trail, not afraid to directly denounce media he doesn't like and accusing Tsai of being a covert supporter of Taiwan independence for refusing to call Taiwan by its Republic of China name. Tsai says this is nonsense.
Han has promised to repair ties with China, though he has also rejected ""one country, two systems"", and says he supports the passage of a refugee law to help protesters who have fled Hong Kong for Taiwan.
JAMES SOONG

After two elections in 2019 failed to deliver a clear winner, acting Prime Minister Sanchez struck a deal with far-left Unidas Podemos, but their combined 155 parliamentary seats are not enough for a majority in Spain's highly fragmented 350-seat parliament.
With the conservative People's Party and far-right Vox -- the second and third largest parties -- refusing to back the coalition, victory for Sanchez hinges on the votes of small regional parties that each control a handful of seats.
Catalonia's largest separatist party, Esquerra Republica de Catalunya (ERC), on Thursday agreed to abstain from voting after Sanchez agreed to hold a dialogue over the future of Catalonia if he is confirmed. He agreed to submit the dialogue’s conclusions to Catalan voters.
But a last-minute decision by Spain's electoral board to block ERC's jailed leader Oriol Junqueras from becoming a member of the European Parliament has called the party's support into question. The board also decided to strip the head of Catalonia's regional government Quim Torra - an ERC ally - of his position as a regional lawmaker.
Lawmakers will start debating support to the coalition on Saturday at 9 a.m. (0800 GMT).
In the first vote scheduled on Sunday afternoon, Sanchez needs an absolute majority of 176 members voting in favor of the motion, a remote possibility at this point. However, he is likely to be more successful in a second round of voting set to take place on Tuesday, for which the Socialist leader will only need more votes in favor than against. 
Abstention from Catalonia's ERC should secure this.
If confirmed, the PSOE-Podemos coalition would propose corporate tax increases, more worker-friendly labor legislation and policies aimed to fight climate change and promote gender equality.
However, the government would struggle to push through any legislation given its likely razor thin majority."
1353,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 08:49PM ET</span>",Inside the plot by Iran’s Soleimani to attack U.S. forces in Iraq,"By Reuters staff
(Reuters) - In mid-October, Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani met with his Iraqi Shi'ite militia allies at a villa on the banks of the Tigris River, looking across at the U.S. embassy complex in Baghdad.
The Revolutionary Guards commander instructed his top ally in Iraq, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, and other powerful militia leaders to step up attacks on U.S. targets in the country using sophisticated new weapons provided by Iran, two militia commanders and two security sources briefed on the gathering told Reuters.
The strategy session, which has not been previously reported, came as mass protests against Iran’s growing influence in Iraq were gaining momentum, putting the Islamic Republic in an unwelcome spotlight. Soleimani’s plans to attack U.S. forces aimed to provoke a military response that would redirect that rising anger toward the United States, according to the sources briefed on the gathering, Iraqi Shi’ite politicians and government officials close to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi.
Soleimani’s efforts ended up provoking the U.S. attack on Friday that killed him and Muhandis, marking a major escalation of tensions between the United States and Iran. The two men died in air strikes on their convoy at a Baghdad airport as they headed to the capital, dealing a major blow to the Islamic Republic and the Iraqi paramilitary groups it supports.
Interviews with the Iraqi security sources and Shi'ite militia commanders offer a rare glimpse of how Soleimani operated in Iraq, which he once told a Reuters reporter he knew like the back of his hand.
Two weeks before the October meeting, Soleimani ordered Iranian Revolutionary Guards to move more sophisticated weapons - such as Katyusha rockets and shoulder-fired missiles that could bring down helicopters - to Iraq through two border crossings, the militia commanders and Iraqi security sources told Reuters.
At the Baghdad villa, Soleimani told the assembled commanders to form a new militia group of low-profile paramilitaries - unknown to the United States - who could carry out rocket attacks on Americans housed at Iraqi military bases. He ordered Kataib Hezbollah - a force founded by Muhandis and trained in Iran - to direct the new plan, said the militia sources briefed on the meetings.
Soleimani told them such a group “would be difficult to detect by the Americans,” one of the militia sources told Reuters.
Before the attacks, the U.S. intelligence community had reason to believe that Soleimani was involved in “late stage” planning to strike Americans in multiple countries, including Iraq, Syria and Lebanon, U.S. officials told Reuters Friday on condition of anonymity. One senior U.S. official said Soleimani had supplied advanced weaponry to Kataib Hezbollah.
White House national security adviser Robert O’Brien told reporters on Friday that Soleimani had just come from Damascus, “where he was planning attacks on American soldiers, airmen, Marines, sailors and against our diplomats.”
An official at the headquarters of Iran's Revolutionary Guards declined to comment. A spokesperson for the Iranian foreign ministry was not available for comment.
PICKING U.S. TARGETS WITH DRONES
The United States has grown increasingly concerned about Iran's influence over the ruling elite in Iraq, which has been beset for months by protesters who accuse the government of enriching itself and serving the interests of foreign powers, especially Iran, as Iraqis languish in poverty without jobs or basic services.
Soleimani, leader of the Revolutionary Guards' Quds Force, was instrumental in expanding Iran's military influence in the Middle East as the operative who handles clandestine operations outside Iran. The 62-year-old general was regarded as the second-most powerful figure in Iran after Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
Muhandis, a former Iraqi lawmaker, oversaw Iraq’s Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF), an umbrella grouping of paramilitary forces mostly consisting of Iran-backed Shi’ite militias that was formally integrated into Iraq’s armed forces.
Muhandis, like Soleimani, had long been on the radar of the United States, which had declared Muhandis a terrorist. In 2007, a Kuwaiti court sentenced him to death in absentia for his involvement in the 1983 U.S. and French embassy bombings in Kuwait.
Soleimani picked Kataib Hezbollah to lead the attacks on U.S. forces in the region because it had the capability to use drones to scout targets for Katyusha rocket attacks, one of the militia commanders told Reuters. Among the weapons that Soleimani's forces supplied to its Iraqi militia allies last fall was a drone Iran had developed that could elude radar systems, the militia commanders said.
Kataib Hezbollah used the drones to gather aerial footage of locations where U.S. troops were deployed, according to two Iraqi security officials who monitor the movements of militias.
On December 11, a senior U.S. military official said attacks by Iranian-backed groups on bases hosting U.S. forces in Iraq were increasing and becoming more sophisticated, pushing all sides closer to an uncontrollable escalation.
His warning came two days after four Katyusha rockets struck a base near Baghdad international airport, wounding five members of Iraq's elite Counter-Terrorism Service. No group claimed responsibility for the attack but a U.S. military official said intelligence and forensic analyses of the rockets and launchers pointed to Iranian-backed Shi’ite Muslim militia groups, notably Kataib Hezbollah and Asaib Ahl al-Haq.
On Dec. 27 more than 30 rockets were fired at an Iraqi military base near the northern Iraq city of Kirkuk. The attack killed a U.S. civilian contractor and wounded four American and two Iraq servicemen.
Washington accused Kataib Hezbollah of carrying out the attack, an allegation it denied. The United States then launched air strikes two days later against the militia, killing at least 25 militia fighters and wounding 55.
The attacks sparked two days of violent protests by supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups who stormed the U.S. Embassy’s perimeter and hurled rocks, prompting Washington to dispatch extra troops to the region and threaten reprisals against Tehran.
On Thursday – the day before the attack that killed Soleimani - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper warned that the United States might have to take preemptive action to protect American lives from expected attacks by Iran-backed militias.
“The game has changed,” he said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. appeals court judges on Friday appeared skeptical about broad legal arguments by President Donald Trump's administration seeking to block a former White House lawyer from testifying to Congress as part of the impeachment effort against Trump, but also seemed wary about stepping into the heated political fight. 
Judge Thomas Griffith asked tough questions of the Justice Department lawyer who argued on the administration's behalf and the lawyer for the Democratic-led House of Representatives Judiciary Committee that subpoenaed former White House Counsel Don McGahn, and could be the pivotal vote in deciding the case.
The case was heard by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Griffith questioned whether the court should decide the case at all, in part because McGahn's testimony is not key to the two articles of impeachment against Trump approved by the House on Dec. 18.
Griffith, a Republican appointee, and Judge Judith Rogers, a Democratic appointee, questioned the administration's arguments that the House panel lacks legal standing to enforce its subpoena and that senior presidential advisers are ""absolutely immune"" from being forced to testify to Congress about official acts.
The other judge, Republican appointee Karen Henderson, said little. 
The committee filed suit in August seeking to enforce its April subpoena for McGahn to testify about Trump's efforts to impede former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that documented Russian interference in the 2016 election and numerous contacts between Trump's campaign and Moscow. 
The arguments came in the administration's appeal of U.S. District Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson's Nov. 25 ruling that McGahn must comply with the subpoena.
A second three-judge panel, with Griffith and Rogers joined by Trump appointee Neomi Rao, also appeared conflicted as it heard arguments in a separate lawsuit by the same committee seeking access to grand jury evidence from Mueller's inquiry.
Griffith asked whether there has ever been such ""broad scale defiance"" of congressional requests in U.S. history as Trump's administration has exhibited. It directed current and former officials not to comply with congressional subpoenas for testimony and documents. McGahn, who left his post in October 2018, defied the subpoena but has said he would testify if ordered by a court.
Griffith noted that the Supreme Court has previously said legislatures can have legal standing in such cases.
The committee sued a month before the House launched its impeachment inquiry against the Republican president centering on his request that Ukraine investigate Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son.
Griffith noted that McGahn was ""long gone"" from the White House when the Ukraine controversy unfolded and the judge appeared skeptical over some claims by House lawyer Megan Barbero.
""I wonder if we should be involved with this dispute at all,"" Griffith said.
'THE TOUGH QUESTION'
Congress has other means to leverage executive branch cooperation such as refusing to fund the government, Griffith said.
""The question is whether the Constitution allows you to pull the courts ... into this dispute, which historically has been fought out - duked out - between the political branches. To me that's the tough question,"" Griffith added.
Rogers added that if the House cannot enforce subpoenas, its ""critical power in terms of checking abuse of presidential power"" would be stymied. Rogers appeared to reject the administration's suggestion that courts have no role in enforcing such subpoenas, saying the Supreme Court has recognized such a role in some cases.
""That's what I think we are struggling with here,"" Rogers added.
The House passed two articles of impeachment - formal charges - accusing Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, setting up a trial in the Republican-led Senate to determine whether to remove him from office. Trump has denied wrongdoing.
House lawyers have said McGahn's testimony remains vital to the impeachment proceedings and could affect strategy for the Senate trial. The House has not ruled out McGahn's testimony or the Mueller grand jury material prompting additional articles of impeachment.
It was unclear whether the judges would rule in the two cases before the Senate impeachment trial. Their rulings could be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which ultimately may decide the disputes.
McGahn told Mueller's team that Trump repeatedly instructed him to have the special counsel ousted and then told him to deny having been so instructed when word of the action emerged in news reports. McGahn did not carry out either instruction. 
The second case involved the administration's appeal of a judge's October ruling that the Mueller grand jury information should be provided to lawmakers. The Justice Department argued that by law the material must be kept confidential.
House lawyer Douglas Letter stressed the importance of courts deciding such disputes, saying it avoids further conflict between branches of government. Absent court action, he raised the hypothetical of a ""gun battle"" between the House sergeant-at-arms and Attorney General William Barr's security detail if the Justice Department refused to hand over the material.

Based on questions posed by the judges, the court might consider sending that case back to a lower court for more analysis specifying the exact material sought by lawmakers and their reasons for wanting it.

1356,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>","Trump says Soleimani plotted 'imminent' attacks, but critics question just how soon","By Mark Hosenball
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After President Donald Trump said the top Iranian general killed in a U.S. air strike in Baghdad was plotting ""imminent"" attacks on U.S. interests, some U.S. national security and congressional officials are raising questions about the use of that word to justify the killing.
Senator Mark Warner, the Democrat who serves as Vice-Chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told Reuters on Friday after a briefing: ""I believe there was a threat, but the question of how imminent is still one I want answered.""
The word ""imminent"" implies attacks against American targets were about to happen and could help the Trump administration make a legal argument that killing Quds Force commander General Qassem Soleimani was an act of self-defense. 
A national security source familiar with internal government reporting before the air strike said U.S. agencies had collected evidence that groups or cells supported by Iran were actively engaged in planning attacks against U.S. personnel and targets.
When asked whether the United States had strong intelligence indicating that such attacks were ""imminent"", a characterization used both by Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the source said this depended upon how one defined ""imminent.""
Pushed on the question during a briefing for journalists on Friday, a senior State Department official said: ""Whether the specific plots that (Soleimani) has unleashed were so far advanced that they may be able to carry them out, I don't know.""
A Pentagon statement late on Thursday said Soleimani had been ""actively developing plans"" to attack American diplomats and service members in Iraq and throughout the region, but did not use the word ""imminent."" 
In television interviews early on Friday, Pompeo said the killing of the Iranian general disrupted an ""imminent attack"" on American targets. Later in the day, Trump weighed in. 
""Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats and military personnel but we caught him in the act and terminated him,"" Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort.
U.S. Army General Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that violent plots by Soleimani might still happen despite his death.
As chief of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Soleimani was the key organizer of subversive and paramilitary activities by pro-Iranian and pro-Shiite militant groups across the Middle East, according to U.S. officials. 
Another congressional source familiar with U.S. intelligence reporting on the threats said briefings given by intelligence officials to Congress indicated that claims that Iranian-organized attacks on Americans in the region were imminent were ""wildly exaggerated."" 

The second source said that while intelligence indicating Soleimani was in contact with persons involved in actively plotting attacks, Congress had not been presented with convincing evidence that such plots were on the verge of being carried out.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's administration stepped up deportations of Guatemalans in 2019, doubling the number of migrants sent back from the United States a decade earlier, data from the Central American country showed on Friday.
Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a major policy focus and has continued to press the issue in the run-up to the November U.S. presidential election.
Last year, the United States deported 54,547 people to Guatemala on 486 flights, the highest since at least 2007, according to data from the Guatemalan Institute of Migration. In 2009, the year Trump's Democratic predecessor Barack Obama took office, there were 27,222 deportations.
""We associate the increase with migration policies of the United States,"" Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for the Guatemalan Institute of Migration, told Reuters. She said she expected 2020 to follow a similar pattern.
There were more than 400,000 deportations to Guatemala during the decade through 2019, the institute's data show.
Deportations increased steadily in the first half-dozen year's of Obama's two terms as president, peaking at 51,157 in 2014, and then fell sharply the following year.
In 2017, the year Trump took office, 32,833 Guatemalans were deported from the United States. The next year deportations increased to 51,376.
A U.S. State Department spokesperson said deportations were one of several steps the Trump administration was taking ""to address the crisis"" on the U.S. border with Mexico.
""We will make every effort to reduce illegal immigration to the United States,"" the official said.
In July, the Trump administration brokered an agreement with the Guatemalan government, allowing U.S. immigration officials to send migrants requesting asylum at the U.S.-Mexican border to apply for asylum in Guatemala instead.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's acting deputy secretary, Ken Cuccinelli, said the agreement could also apply to Mexicans and other nationalities.
Under the program, 40 asylum seekers from El Salvador and Honduras have so far been sent to Guatemala.
Most of the people caught trying to enter the United States illegally come from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

As of 2017, an estimated 1.4 million people of Guatemalan origin were living in the United States, according to a recent analysis by the Pew Research Center.

1358,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",Flights suspended in Libya's capital as violence intensifies,"TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Flights were suspended at the only functioning airport in Libya's capital Tripoli on Friday because of rocket fire and shelling, as people in eastern Libya protested Turkish military support for their rivals.
Turkey's parliament voted on Thursday to allow troops to be sent to support the internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli, deepening fears of more fighting, though analysts and officials said Ankara was unlikely to immediately put boots on the ground.
The GNA has sought Turkey's support as it fends off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's forces, which control the east and swept through southern Libya in early 2019.
Haftar's forces said they had carried out air strikes in several places on Friday, including south of the city of Sirte and in Tripoli. Sirte lies in the center of Libya's coastline, on the dividing line between the warring factions.
An increase in air strikes and shelling in and around Tripoli has caused the deaths of at least 11 civilians since early December and shut down health facilities and schools, the U.N. mission in Libya said. 
Haftar's Tripoli offensive quickly stalled in the outskirts of the city, but led to increased international involvement in the conflict. Turkey has backed the GNA while Haftar has received support from the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Jordan.
Russian military contractors have also been deployed with Haftar's Libyan National Army for several months, diplomats and analysts said.
There were protests in several cities and towns in eastern Libya against the Turkish parliament's decision.
In Benghazi, where about 3,000 people took to the streets, protesters said they had turned out to oppose a Turkish ""invasion"" of Libya, which was part of the Ottoman Empire before coming under Italian occupation. 
Haftar later gave a televised speech in which he announced a ""call to arms and mass mobilization ... to defend our land and our honor"". 
Three subsidiaries of Libya's National Oil Corporation (NOC) which operate in areas under Haftar's control - Ras Lanuf Oil and Gas Company, Sirte Oil Co and Arabian Gulf Oil Company (AGOCO) - said they would boycott Turkish companies.
An engineer from Ras Lanuf said one Turkish company had been doing contracting work at Ras Lanuf port since 2017. It was unclear what immediate impact the companies' statements would have.
Mitiga airport has been repeatedly closed and reopened in recent years because of risks from shelling and air strikes, reopening most recently on Dec. 12 after a closure of nearly 3-1/2 months. It closed early on Friday because of rocket fire nearby, reopened briefly and then shut again because of shelling, airport and airline officials said.

1359,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>",U.S. killing of Iran's second most powerful man risks regional conflagration,"By Samia Nakhoul
BEIRUT (Reuters) - The U.S. killing of Qassem Soleimani, Iran's most powerful figure after its supreme leader, is seen by Tehran as an act of war that risks regional conflagration.
By ordering Friday's air strike on the commander of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard's foreign legions, President Donald Trump has taken the United States and its allies into uncharted territory in its confrontation with Iran and its proxy militias across the region.
The Iranian leadership may bide its time.
But most analysts believe this blow to its prestige, plus Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamanei's personal commitment to Soleimani and his campaign to forge an axis of Shi'ite paramilitary power across the Levant and into the Gulf, means Iranian reprisals will be lethal.
It risks a slide into direct conflict with the United States that could engulf the whole region.
""The direct assassination of Soleimani by the United States is a naked challenge and Iran has to carry out a major face-saving act to respond,"" said Mohanad Hage Ali, a fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. ""This is not the end of it.""
Soleimani, who made his name in Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s, rose in 1998 to command the Quds Force, the overseas arm of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
After the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 toppled Saddam Hussein's Sunni rule and brought Iraq's Shi'ite majority to power, the Quds Force built up a powerful array of proxy militias to harry the U.S. occupation.
They were modeled on Hezbollah, the Shi'ite paramilitary force Iran created in Lebanon – but in Iraq they were four times bigger.
When Syria was plunged into war by the Sunni rebellion that started in 2011, Soleimani mobilized Hezbollah and Iraqi Shi'ite militias to save President Bashar al-Assad and establish a new Quds fortress.
That enabled Iran to link up its paramilitary proxies in a Shi'ite axis of power across Iraq and through Syria to the Mediterranean, alarming U.S. allies such as Israel, Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
NETHER FORGOTTEN NOR FORGIVEN
Soleimani, the architect of this muscular policy, then became a regional legend and popular icon in Iran after his forces spearheaded the fight against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.
But the seemingly inexorable success of Soleimani's paramilitary strategy – permanently mobilized militias armed with precision missiles and drones – came at a cost.
In Iraq, the Popular Mobilization Forces, the 100,000-strong paramilitary alliance at the sharp end of the power struggle between Iran and the United States, may have over-reached.
At the instigation of Soleimani and the Quds Force, PMF units have stepped up harassment of U.S. troops in Iraq.
But the killing of an American contractor at a base in northern Iraq attacked by the Kataib Hezbollah militia last week prompted U.S. air strikes that killed 25 pro-Iranian fighters.
In response, the militias laid siege to the U.S. embassy in Baghdad, breaking through the perimeter before withdrawing.
That reminder of the occupation of the U.S. embassy in Tehran in 1979 – a humiliation Americans have never forgiven – may have prompted Trump, facing re-election as well as impeachment this year, to sign Soleimani's death warrant.
""The Americans have never forgotten the storming of their embassy in Tehran and the hostage-taking,"" says Sarkis Naoum, a leading regional analyst.
""This issue for them was bigger than Soleimani's killing,"" he added. ""Their embassy was the symbol of the nation and their influence.""
MULTI-PRONGED RESPONSE?
From Iran's point of view, protests against corruption and bad governance in Iraq and Lebanon are a reminder of the start of the Syrian conflict in which Soleimani's forces intervened to save Assad.
Soleimani traveled to both countries in recent weeks to ensure his Hezbollah and PMF allies held the line to protect Iran’s political and military influence.
After the elimination of Soleimani, Iran is expected to double down in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and Yemen on what it regards as its forward lines of defense against a U.S.-led attempt to encircle it with the help of Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Iran has already given examples of how it can respond.
After the Trump administration withdrew from the nuclear deal Iran signed with the United States and other world powers in 2015, the IRGC and its proxies progressed from limited attacks on oil tankers in the Gulf to spectacular missile and drone assaults on Saudi oil installations.
Analysts now see a multi-pronged Iranian response against the United States and its allies as certain.
Already the Soleimani killing has united otherwise fractious Iraqi Shi'ite groups in demanding U.S. forces quit Iraq.
A senior official in the Iranian-led regional military alliance said: ""When the Americans take this deliberate decision to kill Soleimani it means they have taken a decision for war.""
""There will not be a quick revenge,"" said Carnegie's Hage Ali. ""Even in a situation like this they are cold, they consider their options and then they react. It will take time but all options are on the table.""

The Soleimani operation ""is a strike into the heart of Iran: they have not just killed Iran's military mastermind in the region but taken out a future leader of Iran"", Naoum said.

1360,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>","U.S. Democratic contenders condemn Iran strike, warn of war","By John Whitesides and Simon Lewis
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential contenders on Friday condemned the air strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani, saying President Donald Trump's decision was reckless and could lead the United States to another war in the Middle East.
""President Trump just tossed a stick of dynamite into a tinderbox,"" said former Vice President Joe Biden. His campaign released a 30-second online ad that portrayed Biden as ""tested and trusted around the world"" against Trump's ""erratic, unstable"" presidency.
""We're on the brink of yet another war in the Middle East,"" said liberal U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. ""We're not here by accident. We're here because a reckless president, his allies and his administration have spent years pushing us here."" 
The overnight killing of Soleimani, regarded as the second most powerful figure in Iran, was a dramatic escalation of hostilities in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies.
A protracted conflict could reshape an election that has so far been dominated by domestic issues, such as healthcare and money in politics, strategists said. While that could be a plus for the leading Democratic candidates such as Biden, who has stressed his foreign policy experience and credentials, lesser-known contenders could have a harder time being heard.
""The ultimate beneficiary in the Democratic race could be the four candidates in front,"" said Democratic strategist Steve Elmendorf, referring to Biden, Warren, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana.
""Nobody behind them will have a chance to reset the race or change things,"" said Elmendorf, a Buttigieg supporter who served as chief of staff for former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.
The Democratic contenders are set to face voters for the first time in a month, when Iowa kicks off the state-by-state nominating battle on Feb. 3.
Public opinion polls show Americans in general are opposed to U.S. military interventions overseas. A survey last year by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs found only 27% of Americans believe military interventions make the United States safer, and nearly half said they make the country less safe.
""There are serious questions about how this decision was made and whether we are prepared for the consequences,"" said Buttigieg, a former Navy Reserve officer who served in Afghanistan.
Trump said the strike aimed to disrupt ""imminent and sinister attacks"" on Americans. His fellow Republicans praised the president for restoring American strength and leadership. 
""At a time when the president is under impeachment by the Democrats, there's nothing wrong with him showing strength and resolve in the face of a foreign threat,"" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who is close to the White House. 
While the Democrats were united in condemning Trump's decision, there were some distinctions in their responses. Biden and Buttigieg indicated they viewed Soleimani as a security threat who had sowed chaos in the region, whereas Sanders and Warren referred to him more neutrally and called his killing an ""assassination.""
Sanders, who has consistently opposed U.S. military intervention overseas, contrasted the strike with his own domestic priorities of universal healthcare, improved infrastructure and steps to combat climate change.
""We must invest in the needs of the American people, not spend trillions more on endless wars,"" Sanders said at a campaign event in Anamosa, Iowa.
Sanders also mentioned his 2002 vote against authorizing war in Iraq, which he frequently uses as a contrast to Biden, the former chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who backed the war.
Tulsi Gabbard, a House member and Army National Guard veteran of the Iraq war who also has opposed U.S. military interventions, said the strike showed ""we need to get out of Iraq and Syria now.""

""That is the only way that we're going to prevent ourselves from being dragged into this quagmire, deeper and deeper into a war with Iran,"" she wrote on Twitter, using the hashtag #WWIII.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Tensions between Iran and the United States are at their highest point since Iranian students seized the U.S. Embassy in Tehran in 1979.
Iran's clerical and military rulers have threatened revenge for an American air strike https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iraq-security-blast/u-s-says-killing-top-iran-general-averted-plot-against-americans-idUSKBN1Z11K8?il=0 at Baghdad airport on Friday that killed Qassem Soleimani, commander of Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards Quds Force and architect of its growing military influence in the Middle East.
Here are some of Iran's options:
MILITARY POWER
Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and U.S. President Donald Trump have talked tough during several crisis but neither have indicated an interest in all-out war.
But the possibility of a military confrontation cannot be ruled out. Khamenei faces a dilemma. 
If he calls for restraint, he could look weak at home and among proxies who have expanded Iran's reach. For this reason, Iran may choose to opt for a smaller scale retaliation.
Karim Sadjadpour, senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said on Twitter that Khamenei must carefully calibrate the reaction. ""A weak response risks losing face, an excessive response risks losing his head. Khamenei is Trump's most consequential international adversary in 2020.""
According to a U.S. Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) report in December, Iran’s military power relies on three core capabilities: its ballistic missile program, naval forces that can threaten navigation in the oil-rich Gulf and its militia proxies in countries such as Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.
Iran says it has precision-guided missiles, cruise missiles and armed drones capable of hitting U.S. military bases in the Gulf, and reaching Tehran's arch-enemy Israel, a U.S. ally. Iran's homemade Shahab ballistic missiles with a range of 2,000 km (1,200 miles) can carry several warheads. 
In retaliation for the killing of Soleimani, Tehran or its proxies could attack oil tankers in the Gulf and Red Sea, a major global shipping route for oil and other trade, linking the Indian Ocean with the Mediterranean via the Suez Canal. 
BLOCKING THE STRAIT OF HORMUZ
A military confrontation or heightened tensions could halt the flow of oil through the Strait of Hormuz, where one-fifth of the world's oil production is shipped through. Such interruption, even for a short period of time, could affect the United States and many countries around the world. 
Iran cannot legally close the waterway unilaterally because part of it is in Oman’s territorial waters. However, ships pass through Iranian waters, which are under the responsibility of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards Navy. 
Tehran could use its missiles and drones, mines, speedboats, and missile launchers in the Gulf area to confront the United States and its allies.
In recent years, there have been periodic confrontations between the Guards and the U.S. military in the Gulf. U.S. officials have said closing the Strait would be crossing a ""red line"" and America would take action to reopen it. 
IRAN'S ASYMMETRIC TACTICS AND PROXIES
The targeted killing of Soleimani could endanger U.S. forces stationed in the Middle East. Iran mainly relies on asymmetric tactics and its regional proxies in order to counter more sophisticated U.S. weaponry. 
Iran has passed on its drones and technical expertise to allies. Yemen’s Houthis have used Iran-made missiles and drones to bomb airports in Saudi Arabia, Iran's main regional foe.
The United States and Saudi Arabia have accused Iran of carrying out attacks against oil tankers near the Strait last year and have accused Tehran of being behind attacks on the kingdom's oil facilities in September. Tehran has denied the allegations. 
Iran-backed militias in Iraq have used mortars and rockets to attack bases where U.S. forces are located. In June, Iran came close to war with the United States after Tehran downed a U.S. drone with a surface-to-air missile, a move that nearly triggered retaliatory strikes by Washington. 
TIMING
Iran is unlikely to rush into action, according to Ali Alfoneh, senior fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. 
""Iran has no choice but to strike back and retaliate assassination of Major General Suleimani,"" he said. ""But the Islamic Republic is patient and the timing and nature of that strike is not yet known to us.""
IRAN'S LONG REACH
Iran and its allies have proven they have a long reach.
In 1994, an Iran-backed Hezbollah member drove a van filled with explosives to the Argentine Jewish Mutual Aid Society (AMIA) building, killing  85 people. Argentina blames Iran and Hezbollah for the attack. Both deny any responsibility.
Argentina also blames Hezbollah for an attack on the Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires in 1992 that killed 29 people.
U.S. and Argentine officials say Hezbollah operates in what is known as the tri-border area of Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, where an illicit economy funds its operations.
""What is more likely is sustained proxy attacks against U.S. interests and allies regionally and even globally. Iran has a long history of such attacks in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America, with mixed success,"" Carnegie's Sadjadpour wrote on Twitter. 
DIPLOMACY NOT CONFRONTATION
Iranian leaders have in the past kept the door open to diplomacy to achieve its aims, especially when its economy is squeezed hard by U.S. sanctions designed to weaken the leadership.
""Iran and America have worked together in the past, in Afghanistan, Iraq and other places. They have common interests and common enemies. A military confrontation will be costly for both sides. But diplomacy can solve many problems and it is an option,"" said a senior regional diplomat. 
Iran has ruled out any talks with the United States unless it returns to a 2015 nuclear deal and lifts all sanctions it reimposed on Tehran after exiting the pact in 2018. Signaling that the door was open for diplomacy, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said after Soleimani's killing that Washington was committed to reducing tensions in the region. 

""While many are predicting WWIII, the last 40 years of Iran's history reflect that what's paramount for the Islamic Republic is its survival. Tehran can ill-afford a full-blown war with the U.S. while facing onerous economic sanctions and internal tumult, especially without Soleimani,"" Sadjadpour said.

1362,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 07:15PM ET</span>","Conservative, liberal Methodists to split over gay marriage","By Rich McKay
(Reuters) - The United Methodist Church plans to split into two later this year, church officials said on Friday, a schism that follows years of contention over whether the church should end its ban on same-sex marriage and gay clergy.
The plan, if approved at the church's worldwide conference in Minneapolis in May, would divide the third-largest U.S. Christian denomination into two branches: A traditionalist side opposed to gay marriage and the ordination of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender clergy, and a progressive wing that will allow same-sex marriage and LGBT clergy.
The split would affect the denomination globally, church leaders said. The United Methodist Church lists more than 13 million members in the United States and 80 million worldwide.
The U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage throughout the nation in 2015, but that decision applies only to civil, not religious, services. Some denominations, including the Episcopal Church and certain branches of Judaism, have sanctified same-sex unions, while others including the Roman Catholic Church and Southern (NYSE:SO) Baptist Convention, have declined to do so.
A council of Methodist bishops in Washington called Friday's move the ""best means to resolve our differences.""
A meeting held last February on the issue failed to come up with a solution that satisfied the conservative and liberal wings of the church.
Church leaders from both camps said they welcomed the move.
""While we regret that it has come to this, we believe this gives us a path forward that honors the dignity of all people,"" said Reverend Junius Dotson, a leader in UMCNext, a liberal group within the church that favors gay rights. ""We want to reform the current United Methodist Church.""
Reverend Keith Boyette, president of the conservative Wesleyan Covenant Association, sounded a similar note.
""I think this is good news, as the potential agreement can end years of conflict and allows us a way to stay true to our values without this continuous battle,"" he said.
Last month, Grace Fellowship UMC of the Houston suburb of Katy, Texas, with about 2,800 members, voted to leave the denomination over the church's debate over same-sex unions and gay clergy, opting to remain conservative and oppose such marriages.

The new plan comes at a time when newly adopted sanctions were set to go into effect to more strictly punish church pastors who perform same-sex weddings, with sanctions that would include a year's suspension up to removal from the clergy.

1364,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 04:49PM ET</span>",Former Mexico security chief tied to Sinaloa cartel pleads not guilty in NY,"By Jonathan Stempel
NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Mexican government official who oversaw public security in his country pleaded not guilty on Friday to U.S. charges he accepted millions of dollars in bribes to protect the Sinaloa drug cartel once run by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman and let it operate with impunity.
Genaro Garcia Luna, 51, entered his plea through a translator at a hearing in federal court in Brooklyn, where lawyers signaled he may be in talks to change his plea later.
U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo ordered Garcia Luna detained after Assistant U.S. Attorney Erin Reid called him an ""unacceptable risk of flight,"" citing his alleged contacts with the Sinaloa cartel.
The defendant's court-appointed lawyer said he would seek bail later.
Garcia Luna, who had moved to Florida and was living there before his arrest, has been charged with drug trafficking conspiracy and making false statements, and faces up to life in prison if convicted.
He was arrested 3-1/2 weeks ago in Dallas but agreed to face the charges in Brooklyn, where Guzman was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without parole last year for smuggling tons of drugs to the United States in a colorful, decades-long career.
Garcia Luna wore handcuffs, tan pants and a gray sweatshirt in the courtroom, with a pair of glasses hanging from his neckline.
Kuo agreed to delay the case so the parties could negotiate what Reid called a ""potential disposition"" without the need for a trial, language that often signals a future guilty plea.
A lawyer for Garcia Luna who could not attend Friday's hearing did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. District Judge Brian Cogan, who oversaw Guzman's trial, scheduled a Jan. 21 status conference for Garcia Luna.
Once considered a leader in Mexico's efforts to reduce drug trafficking, Garcia Luna led that country's Federal Investigation Agency from 2001 to 2005 and was secretary of public security from 2006 to 2012.
But prosecutors said the Sinaloa cartel bribed Garcia Luna throughout his time in government to ensure safe passage for its drugs, and to obtain information about rival cartels and Mexican probes into its activities.
Garcia Luna had been the subject of testimony at Guzman's trial by Jesus Zambada, the brother of Guzman's partner Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada.
Jesus Zambada said he had given Garcia Luna a suitcase containing $3 million in 2005 or 2006, and paid him another $3 million to $5 million in 2007.
Garcia Luna at the time rejected the accusations, calling them ""defamation"" and without proof."

VILLEJUIF, France (Reuters) - French police shot dead a man near Paris on Friday after he went on a rampage with a knife in a park, killing one person and wounding two more, prosecutors said.
Religious documents including a copy of the Koran were found among the man's belongings, but there was no evidence the man had been influenced by radical Islamists, a spokesman for prosecutors said. 
The attacker had a history of mental illness, had been admitted to hospital a few months ago, and was undergoing a course of psychiatric treatment, the spokesman said. 
The attack happened in the town of Villejuif, about 8 km (5 miles) south of central Paris. Police cordoned off the area, and ambulances and police vehicles lined a road approaching the park.
The attack comes as the French capital has been rocked by major attacks resulting in mass casualties in the past four years.
The two injured victims were being treated in nearby hospitals, Laure Beccuau, the prosecutor whose office is handling the case, told reporters. 
""The suspect tried to attack other victims during his murderous spree, who were able to escape,"" she said. 
Laurent Nunez, the deputy interior minister, visited the scene and said the attacker likely would have hurt more people if police had not shot him when they did. ""It was an extremely courageous act,"" Nunez said of the police response.
The prosecutor's spokesman said the attacker, identified only as Nathan C., was born in 1997 in Lilas, a northeastern suburb of Paris. 
One witness described hearing the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar,"" or ""God is great,"" during the knife attack in the park, according to the spokesman.
But he said: ""We don't have evidence that would allow us to suppose there has been a radicalization."" The man was not known to domestic intelligence services and had no criminal record, the spokesman said. 
During the attack, the man first targeted a woman. The woman's spouse intervened to protect her, and in the process he was fatally stabbed. The woman was not gravely wounded, the spokesman said. 
In October last year, four people were stabbed to death at the Paris police headquarters by Mickael Harpon, an IT specialist working for the police. Prosecutors said that Harpon, who was shot dead by police, had come under the sway of radical Islamists.

Coordinated bombings and shootings by Islamist militants in November 2015 at the Bataclan theater and other locations around Paris killed 130 people in the deadliest attacks in France since World War Two.

1366,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 04:25PM ET</span>",Spain's electoral board orders Catalan leader stripped of lawmaker role,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's electoral board on Friday ordered the pro-independence president of Catalonia's government be stripped of his regional lawmaker role, in a move that may complicate efforts to end a prolonged national political deadlock.
The board issued its ruling that Quim Torra lose his legislator's job on the eve of a possible turning point in the country's bid to re-establish stable government following its worst political furore in decades.
On Saturday parliament holds a vote in which Socialist leader Pedro Sanchez is relying on the abstention of Catalan separatists Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) -- a political ally of Torra -- to confirm him as Prime Minister.
The ERC, which governs Catalonia as part of a coalition with Torra's Junts per Catalunya party, signaled discontent with the board's ruling, a sentiment that could cast a shadow over Sanchez's prospects of confirmation.
Senior ERC lawmaker Gabriel Rufian described the decision as a ""coup d'etat"" on Twitter, while fellow ERC top official Pere Aragones referred to it as ""abhorrent,"" confirming his support for Torra.
A parliamentary source also said the board has decided to block ERC's jailed leader Oriol Junqueras from taking up his position as a member of the European Parliament.
The ERC called a meeting of its executive board for Saturday to evaluate the political consequences of the ruling on Torra, which follows Torra's sentencing by Catalonia's highest court to an 18-month ban from public office over his refusal to remove separatist symbols from government buildings.
Torra has appealed against the court's ruling, meaning it could take months for the ban to come into force, if it is upheld.
Speaking outside the seat of the Catalan government in Barcelona, Torra condemned the board's decision and described the rulings against himself and Junqueras as an ""extremely serious attack.""
Torra's lawyer was not immediately available for comment and it is unclear if he can appeal against the board's ruling.
The board ordered the cancellation of Torra's regional lawmaker credentials but said this would not take effect until official notification by Barcelona's provincial electoral board.
According to a statement by the Catalan government, the ban refers to Torra's position as a lawmaker in the region's parliament but not his role as head of the regional government."

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian opposition parties and environmental groups on Friday criticized a new coalition deal between conservatives and the Greens as heavy on the center-right party's law-and-order agenda while delaying urgently needed action on climate change.
Conservative leader Sebastian Kurz has touted his deal, which would reinstate him as chancellor and bring the left-wing Greens to power for the first time, as ""the best of both worlds"", combining both parties' core campaign pledges.
The awkward alliance between ideological adversaries is being watched closely in Europe, particularly in Germany where similar voting patterns might make it a potential model for Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats after she retires. 
The deal must still be approved by a Greens party meeting on Saturday.
""It is not the best of both worlds,"" the leader of the Social Democrats, Pamela Rendi-Wagner, told a news conference about the deal between Kurz's People's Party (OVP) and the Greens. ""It is far more an OVP manifesto with Green camouflage.""
Many Greens balked at the deal, which retained much of the hard line on immigration and ""political Islam"" seen under Kurz's last coalition government with the far-right Freedom Party which collapsed in May. 
It includes extending a ban on headscarves in schools until the age of 14 from around 10 currently, as well as preventive custody for people deemed a threat to public safety even if they have not yet committed a crime.
""It is painful for us that we could not prevail with what we would like to see here,"" Greens negotiator Sigi Maurer told news channel Puls 24 in a discussion with OVP negotiator August Woeginger, adding that the Greens were still ""the party of human rights"".
When asked what in the deal was painful for the OVP, Woeginger said each party had stuck to its issues. 
On the environmental side, the deal includes measures such as increasing a tax on flights slightly and expanding the rail network. But the Greens' flagship policy of overhauling taxation to price in carbon emissions was put off until at least 2022.
Greens leader Werner Kogler conceded on Thursday, as he and Kurz presented the deal, that the agreement reflected the power balance between the parties; his party won 13.9% of the vote in the Sept. 29 parliamentary election compared to the OVP's 37.5%. 
Greenpeace's Austria chief Alexander Egit bemoaned the delay in the taxation overhaul.
""We don't have two years. The path to achieving (emissions) targets is getting steeper each year,"" he told ORF radio, while praising other parts of the deal. 
Few expect Saturday's meeting of the Greens' Federal Congress to block the deal, but it could raise questions about whether the coalition can last.
Austria's officially recognized body representing Muslims was also unusually critical.

""We would have expected of the Greens in government a course in line with human rights and the defense of equal treatment for all,"" it said in a statement. ""The indiscriminate use of the term 'political Islam' stigmatizes and criminalizes all Muslims living in Austria across the board.""

Iran promised vengeance after a U.S. air strike in Baghdad on Friday killed Qassem Soleimani, Tehran's most prominent military commander and the architect of its growing influence in the Middle East.
The overnight attack, authorized by President Donald Trump, was a dramatic escalation in a ""shadow war"" in the Middle East between Iran and the United States and its allies, principally Israel and Saudi Arabia.
The Pentagon said the Immediate Response Force (IRF) brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division was being deployed.
""The brigade will deploy to Kuwait as an appropriate and precautionary action in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities, and will assist in reconstituting the reserve,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.
The troops will be joining the roughly 750 forces that were sent to Kuwait earlier this week. Usually, a brigade consists of about 3,500 people. 
U.S. officials told Reuters earlier this week that thousands of additional troops could be sent to the region and had been told to prepare to deploy.
The United States has already dispatched about 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East since May.
Reuters first reported on Friday that U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper had canceled plans to take personal leave later in January amid rising tension with Iran.
The U.S. air strike followed a sharp increase in U.S.-Iranian hostilities last week when pro-Iranian militiamen attacked the U.S. embassy in Iraq following a U.S. air raid on the Kataib Hezbollah militia.
Iraq's prime minister said that with Friday's attack Washington had violated a deal for keeping U.S. troops in his country.

The intercommunal clashes that erupted on Dec. 29 were the worst in West Darfur for years, though details of casualties have been slow to emerge.
The violence presents a challenge to military and civilian authorities sharing power following the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir last April. They are trying to broker lasting peace in Darfur and other parts of the country affected by civil conflict.
The violence in West Darfur broke out after a dispute between Arab and African ethnic groups in the state capital of el-Geneina. Arab militiamen raided a camp for internally displaced people and attacked and burned several villages, according to residents.
The joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur, UNAMID, said on Friday it was deeply concerned by the ""deterioration of the security and humanitarian situation in el-Geneina and the surrounding area"".
Conflict spread in Darfur in 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against Khartoum. Government forces and mainly Arab militia which moved to repress the revolt were accused of widespread atrocities.
West Darfur had been largely calm since 2010, though there were occasional skirmishes over the past three years.
On Thursday and Friday there were also clashes in the east of the country at Port Sudan between Beni Amer and Nuba ethnic groups that left eight people dead and dozens injured, according to a local doctors' group.

PARIS (Reuters) - French prosecutors said on Friday they were opening an investigation into allegations of rape of a child, after a woman said she had been sexually abused by a prominent author when she was 14.
Vanessa Springora, now 47 and head of France's Julliard publishing house, has alleged abuse by Gabriel Matzneff, an 83-year-old who for decades was feted by France's cultural elite for his literary talent while saying publicly that he was romantically attracted to teenagers.
Matzneff has acknowledged being in a relationship with Springora but said in a letter published in France's L'Express weekly on Thursday that she was falsely representing him to be a pervert and a predator.
Reuters was unable on Friday to identify any lawyer representing Matzneff. Repeated calls to his representatives at two publishing houses were not returned.
The #MeToo movement has unleashed an international wave of people alleging they were sexually abused by people in powerful positions, but the response in France has been relatively muted.
Some cultural commentators say that, traditionally, French cultural circles have held to the belief that great talent excuses wrongdoing.
The Matzneff case, triggered by a memoir by Springora called Consentement (consent), indicates public attitudes are starting to shift.
""A literary aura does not guarantee impunity,"" Culture Minister Franck Riester said in a Tweet soon after Springora's allegations surfaced last month.
On Friday, the prosecutor's office said in a statement: ""After having analyzed the work 'Consent', published on Jan. 2, the Paris prosecutor has today opened an investigation for rape committed against a minor aged under 15, in connection, notably, to Vanessa Springora.""
A French judicial source, who spoke on customary condition of anonymity, told Reuters the investigation was related to revelations about Matzneff. 
France's junior health minister and the secretary of state for equality issued a statement saying Matzneff was being investigated by prosecutors.
PESTERING WOMEN
The #MeToo movement began in the wake of the scandal surrounding Hollywood film mogul Harvey Weinstein, accused of sexual misconduct dating back decades by more than 70 women. He has denied the allegations, saying any sexual encounters were consensual.
While many people in France embraced the movement, some prominent figures did not. Actress Catherine Deneuve put her name, with 99 other French women, to a 2018 letter saying the #MeToo campaign amounted to ""Puritanism"" and that men had the right to ""pester"" women.
Underage relationships have featured in Matzneff's writing, and in 1977 he published a piece in Le Monde newspaper giving his support to three people convicted of having sexual relations with 13- and 14-year-olds.
In a 1990 television talk show, he talked about his sexual exploits with girls.
Nevertheless, he was named by the Culture Ministry as an ""officer of the arts and letters"" in 1995 and he won the prestigious literary award, the Renaudot Essai, in 2013.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Friday called for Wikileaks founder Julian Assange to be released from prison in London, urging an end to what he described as his ""torture"" in detention.
Assange, 48, is in a British jail for skipping bail when he sought asylum in Ecuador's embassy in London, where he spent nearly seven years to avoid extradition to Sweden over allegations of rape that were dropped in November.
Assange is also battling U.S. attempts to extradite him over Wikileaks' publication of vast caches of leaked military documents and diplomatic cables. He faces a lengthy prison term if extradited to the United States.
A U.N. human rights investigator last year said Assange has suffered psychological torture from a defamation campaign and should not be extradited to the United States where he would face a ""politicized show trial.""
Lopez Obrador, a leftist who has close ties with Britain's opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn, expressed his solidarity with Assange and said he hoped the former hacker and activist is ""forgiven and released"" from prison.
""I don't know if he has recognized that he acted against rules and norms of a political system, but at the time these cables demonstrated how the world system functions in its authoritarian nature,"" Lopez Obrador said in response to a question about Assange at a regular government news briefing.
""Hopefully consideration will be given to this, and he's released and won't continue to be tortured.""
Assange's presence in London, holed up in Ecuador's embassy and then in jail, has been a diplomatic irritation for Britain, affecting domestic politics and relations with several countries.
Corbyn, who was a guest of honor at Lopez Obrador's inauguration in December 2018, said Assange should not be extradited to the United States ""for exposing evidence of atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan.""

The electoral commission said on Wednesday that Embalo won the Dec. 29 vote with 54%. But Domingos Simoes Pereira, the ruling party's candidate, complained of fraud, saying that votes surpassed the number of enrolled voters at some polling places.
After a turbulent lead-up, which included protests and political infighting, the two rounds of voting in November and December went smoothly, African observers said, with incumbent President Jose Mario Vaz eliminated in the first round.
Vaz, who is the first Guinea-Bissau president to have completed a full term but whose tenure was marred by political dysfunction and corruption allegations, conceded defeat and threw his support behind Embalo.
The Supreme Court will hear the petition by Pereira's PAIGC party to annul the election results beginning on Monday, court spokesman Salimo Vieira told reporters. It was not clear how long the court could take to decide the case.
Pereira's camp had no immediate comment about the complaint. Embalo says he is the rightful winner of the election.
The announcement of Embalo's victory sparked celebrations in the capital Bissau, which remained calm during the election. People in the country hope the next president can restore order to the political system and tackle widespread poverty.
Years of political turbulence, including nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974, have hurt the economy, which depends heavily on volatile prices for cashew nuts.
The instability has also made Guinea-Bissau a haven for drug traffickers, who exploit its unpoliced waters and maze of picturesque forested islands."

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Somalia's Western-backed government forces beat and detained a record number of journalists last year, the journalists' syndicate told Reuters on Friday, prompting suggestions the government is suppressing scrutiny of its security record ahead of elections due this year.
For years, the al-Qaeda linked al Shabaab insurgency was accused of killing Somali journalists. Those assassinations have fallen, although two journalists were among those killed in a bombing last year. Now media say they face a new danger: government forces.
State security forces detained an ""unprecedented"" 38 journalists in Somalia last year, according to data compiled by Abdalle Ahmed Mumin, secretary general of the Somali Journalists Syndicate. Most were detained while reporting on bombings or insurgent attacks but some were reporting on corruption.
That compares to 16 journalists detained in 2017, 12 in 2016, and six in 2016, the year before dual U.S.-Somali citizen President Mohamed Abdullahi - known by his nickname Farmajo - took power, Mumin said.
""The government is not allowing journalists to report,"" he said. Officials rarely release casualty figures from incidents like Saturday's truck bomb, which killed around 90 people.
In most cases journalists are not charged and are released after hours or days, according to his report, due to be released next week.
Last year, 37 journalists were beaten, shot at or threatened at gunpoint in Somalia, mostly by state security forces, the report said. The figures do not include the breakaway republic of Somaliland.
    Somalia's police spokeswoman, the interior minister and information ministry spokesman did not respond to requests for comment.
    ""I have no comment,"" Prime Minister Hassan Ali Kheyre told Reuters when asked about the crackdown during a visit to Qatar.
    INFORMATION CRACKDOWN
    There is no public database of attacks and bombings in Somalia. Citizens usually hear about attacks through the media. But while the size of bombings is increasing, journalists say coverage is shrinking.
    Farhan Mohamed Hussein, a reporter for privately owned Radio Kulmiye, said he was arrested three times last year and twice the year before. Once police blindfolded him and beat him with gun butts, he said. Another time, they smashed his camera.
    ""Many people see you as an enemy when they see you have a camera,"" he said. ""Reporters are victims of the government which was supposed to work with them ... Farmajo’s government is the worst we have ever seen.""
    Journalists have been banned from parliament and ignored by spokesmen who simply put out official statements on social media, he said. Mumin confirmed the ban and said the upper legislature is considering a bill to further restrict media freedom.
    Nimco Mohamed Bashir, director of privately owned Rajo Television Network, said the government stifled reporting in a way that assassinations never had.
    ""Farmajo’s police beat you with gun butts ... They openly tell you 'no covering stories of blasts',"" she said. After she posted news of one bombing on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), police came to her home to arrest her and threatened her family, he said.
    In April, the government told privately run Aamin Ambulance, often the only source for casualties from insurgent attacks, to stop releasing numbers of dead and wounded, said the service's head Dr Abdikadir Aden. They also tried to restrict ambulances from blast sites, he said.
The government did not respond to requests for comment.
    Such restrictions make it difficult to judge the government's security record, said Mumin. This year Somalia is due to hold its first one-person, one-vote elections since the civil war began in 1991. The polls are a milestone in drawing down Somalia's 21,000-strong African Union peacekeeping force."

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's far-right League leader Matteo Salvini, looking to avoid trial for alleged kidnapping, has defended his decision to detain migrants on a coastguard boat last July, saying the move had been backed by the whole government.
Salvini was interior minister at the time and had pledged to curtail mass immigration from Libya by making it much more difficult for boat migrants to enter Italian ports.
In July, some two weeks before he pulled the League out of its coalition with the 5-Star Movement, Salvini refused to let 131 migrants disembark from the Gregoretti coastguard vessel until other European states agreed to take them in.
A special tribunal has recommended that Salvini stand trial for the incident on charges of illegally detaining the migrants, and he faces up to 15 years in jail if found guilty.
However, under Italian law, former ministers cannot be tried for actions undertaken while in office unless a parliamentary committee authorizes the probe.
The 23-strong committee is due to take a decision on Jan. 20, and Salvini's lawyer handed over documents for his defense on Friday, including emails from Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte's office, which Salvini says prove the government had backed his actions.
""The management of migrants was not the fruit of the autonomous will of the interior ministry, but an initiative of the Italian government,"" Salvini wrote in the documents seen by Reuters, adding that he had acted out of ""national interest"".
The Gregoretti investigation echoes another case from earlier last year when magistrates sought to try Salvini over his decision to keep 150 migrants aboard a coastguard ship for five days in August 2018.
On that occasion, the parliamentary committee blocked the request to pursue the probe, with Salvini's then-coalition partner the 5-Star Movement rallying to his support, arguing that the decision to keep the migrants at sea was a collective one.
Salvini's position seems less secure this time around, with 5-Star still furious over his decision to quit their coalition.
5-Star leader Luigi Di Maio said last month that Salvini had acted on his own initiative in the Gregoretti case, suggesting his party would vote for its former ally to stand trial.
Prime Minister Conte, who has repeatedly clashed with Salvini since forging a new coalition between the 5-Star and Italy's center-left, said in December he did not recall being involved in the Gregoretti decision.
However, he acknowledged that his office sought help from European allies to take in the African migrants, with five countries eventually stepping forward to break the deadlock and allow the group finally to disembark."

After a basketball match between Serbia's Red Star and Germany's Bayern, thousands of fans marched in Belgrade on Thursday night and stopped in front of the Montenegro embassy, setting off fireworks that burned the flag outside.
Montenegro's Foreign Ministry said Serbia's ambassador had been summoned after authorities in Belgrade failed to stop the ""absolutely unacceptable"" attack on its embassy.
Serbia's Foreign Ministry condemned the burning of the flag but also summoned a Montenegrin diplomat, saying it would not comment on statements from Montenegro which try to ""falsely shift the responsibility for the crisis to Serbia"".
Under a law passed last week by Montenegro's parliament, religious communities must prove property ownership from before 1918, when predominantly Orthodox Christian Montenegro joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the predecessor of the now-defunct Yugoslavia.
Pro-Serb politicians and other critics of the legislation say it is an attempt to promote the small Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which is not recognized by other major churches, at the expense of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the dominant church in the country of 620,000 people.
Montenegro's long-serving and pro-Western leader, Milo Djukanovic, accuses the Serbian Orthodox Church of promoting pro-Serbian policies to undermine Montenegro, a NATO member and European Union membership candidate, which split from Serbia in 2006.
Serbia also wants to join the EU, but it refuses to join the transatlantic NATO alliance and has pursued ties with Russia and China. Most Montenegrins and Serbs share language and ethnic origins and many Serbians have Montenegrin roots and families there."

The boat sank on Thursday off the coast of Fethiye district in Mugla province, it said, adding that the others were missing and a search was underway.
Coast guard boats, a helicopter and plane were used during the search and rescue operation as well as a diving unit, the ministry said.
In 2015 Turkey became one of the main launch points for over a million migrants taking the sea route to European Union territory, many fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa.
Thirty four migrants died at sea off the coast of Turkey last year, and Turkey captured more than 60,000 irregular migrants in 2019, more than double the level in 2018, according to coast guard data."

The Chinese vessel entered waters off the coast of the northern Natuna islands in mid-December, leading Indonesian foreign ministry to issue a “strong protest” and summon the Chinese ambassador in Jakarta.
Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said China had sovereignty over the Spratly islands and their waters and that both China and Indonesia have ""normal"" fishing activities there.
He did not mention the Natuna islands, which lie to the southwest.
China claims most of the energy-rich South China Sea. Neighbors Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims.
Nursyawal Embut, director of sea operations of Indonesia's Maritime Security Agency, told Reuters that the agency had deployed more ships to the Natuna Sea.
""We're intensifying patrols in the sea to anticipate territorial violations, and also illegal fishing at North Natuna. We're trying to prevent foreign ships from violating our territory,"" he said.
Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi also told reporters that the government had agreed to increase patrols in the waters and reiterated Indonesia's accusations against China.
Indonesia on Wednesday called on Beijing to explain the “legal basis and clear borders” regarding its claims to the exclusive economic zone.
Chinese embassy in Jakarta did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Indonesia has repeatedly clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands, detaining Chinese fishermen and expanding its military presence."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's air force seeded clouds with salt on Friday to try to stop rainfall reaching the slowing sinking capital after deadly flash floods and landslides triggered by some of the heaviest rain ever recorded.
The death toll in Jakarta and surrounding areas rose to 43 as of Friday, the disaster mitigation agency said, while tens of thousands of people have been displaced.
Indonesia's technology agency BPPT and the air force carried out three rounds of cloud seeding on Friday, with more expected when needed, a BPPT official said.
The seeding, shooting salt flares in an attempt to trigger rainfall, is aimed at breaking up clouds before they reach Jakarta.
""We will do cloud seeding every day as needed,"" BPPT chief Hammam Riza told reporters.
Cloud seeding is often used in Indonesia to put out forest fires during the dry season.
The floods followed torrential rains on Dec. 31 and into the early hours of New Year's Day that inundated swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns, home to about 30 million people.
The deluge at the start of 2020 was ""one of the most extreme rainfall"" events since records began in 1866, the Meteorological, Climatological and Geophysics Agency (BMKG) said on Friday. 
The agency said climate change had increased the risk of extreme weather and warned that heavy rainfall could last until mid-February, with Jan 11-15 an expected peak.
Television footage showed flood waters inundating parts of Southeast Asia's largest city and mud-covered cars, some piled on top of each other.
President Joko Widodo blamed delays in flood control infrastructure projects for the disaster, including the construction of a canal that has been delayed since 2017 due to land acquisition problems.
Widodo last year announced he would move Indonesia's capital to East Kalimantan province on Borneo island to reduce the burden on overpopulated Jakarta. 
More than 50 people died in one of the capital's deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the centre of the city was inundated after canals overflowed.

Jakarta is sinking by several cm a year in northern parts, an official said in October, due to extraction of groundwater over the years causing layers of rock and sediment to slowly pancake on top of each other.

Controlled by Italy's Benetton family and in charge of the country's biggest motorway network,  Atlantia  has been in the crosshairs since a concrete bridge operated by its Autostrade per l'Italia (ASPI) unit collapsed in the city of Genoa in August 2018, killing 43 people.
Adding to the group's woes, parts of the roof to a highway tunnel managed by ASPI collapsed near Genoa this week. 
Deputy Transport Minister Giancarlo Cancelleri, a member of the ruling 5-Star Movement that has led the charge against Atlantia, said in an interview on Friday that there were ""no more alibis"" for the company and that Rome would have to strip ASPI of its contract with the state. 
""I repeat: we must give a strong signal... what else must collapse to make us understand that these people did not operate with common sense,"" Cancelleri told daily La Stampa.
ASPI, one of the country's 26 motorway operators, manages just over 3,000 kilometres of the country's motorway network.
The leader of the 5-Star Movement, Luigi Di Maio, on Wednesday said that a newly-introduced measure, which makes an early termination of the contract less costly for the government, was a first step in allowing Rome to strip ASPI of its concession.
The decision would now cost the state 8 billion euros ($8.92 billion), down from an initial estimated 23 billion euros, a calculation supplied by financial sources showed.
A source close to the company last month said the loss of the concession without compensation could trigger a default on 16 billion euros ($17.9 billion) of debt at the company and parent Atlantia.
ASPI has said that the new rule risked being unconstitutional and added it might take legal steps to protect itself and could seek multi-billion-euro compensation from the state.
Cancelleri added that it was not, however, the intention of the government to nationalise the Italian motorway network, but rather hand it over to ""entrepreneurs that want to respect the contracts they sign"".
The new rule also states that state-owned road company ANAS will temporarily manage the motorway if any operator's concession is revoked.
Shares in Atlantia were down 0.6% at 1010 GMT after opening 1.3% lower.

The government of Prime Minister Imran Khan approved an extension for General Qamar Javed Bajwa in August, citing a worsening national security situation in the region over its rivalry with India.
But in a surprise ruling, the Supreme Court struck down the extension in November, ordering the government and army to produce legal provisions and arguments on the reasoning behind the move, pitting the judiciary against the government and powerful military.
Pakistan's military has ruled the country for about half its 72-year history and sets defense and security policy and recently has had a role in framing economic policies too.
The army chief usually serves a three-year term.
On Friday, the first day of a new parliamentary session, the government introduced a lower house bill to provide legal cover for Bajwa's extension after managing to win the support of opposition parties, government officials said.
""We are willing to support the legislation if the government follows parliamentary procedures,"" said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the leader of a main opposition party.
The legalization is expected to be passed by next week, clearing way for Bajwa in his post until 2022.
During Bajwa's tenure, the opposition has accused the military of meddling in elections and politics to support Khan, while limiting civil liberties and muzzling the media.
The military denies interfering in politics."

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iran vowed harsh revenge after the United States killed Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, head of the elite Quds Force and architect of Iran's spreading military influence in the Middle East, in an air strike on Friday at Baghdad airport.
Soleimani's killing, authorized by President Donald Trump, marked a dramatic escalation in the regional ""shadow war"" between Iran and the United States and its allies, principally Israel and Saudi Arabia.
Top Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, an adviser to Soleimani, was also killed in the attack.
Iran has been locked in a long conflict with the United States that escalated sharply last week with an attack on the U.S. embassy in Iraq by pro-Iranian militiamen following a U.S. air raid on the Kataib Hezbollah militia, founded by Muhandis.
""At the direction of the president, the U.S. military has taken decisive defensive action to protect U.S. personnel abroad by killing Qassem Soleimani,"" the Pentagon said in a statement.
""This strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans,"" it added.
U.S. officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said was killed in a drone strike. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said he was killed in an attack by American helicopters.
Iraqi paramilitary groups said three rockets landed near Baghdad airport's cargo terminal, hitting two vehicles and killing five Iraqi paramilitary men and two ""guests"".
Pictures showed burning debris on an airport road.
Oil prices were up nearly $3 on the news.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said harsh revenge awaited the ""criminals"" who killed Soleimani. His death, though bitter, would double the motivation of the resistance against the United States and Israel, he said.
In a statement carried by state television he called for three days of national mourning.
Soleimani, who led the Quds Force, the foreign arm of the Revolutionary Guards and had a key role in fighting in Syria and Iraq, had acquired celebrity status at home and abroad. Over two decades he had been at the forefront of projecting the Islamic Republic's military influence across the Middle East. 
MOURNING IN IRAN 
Iranian state television presenters wore black and broadcast footage of Soleimani peering through binoculars across a desert and greeting a soldier, and of Muhandis speaking to followers.
President Hassan Rouhani said the assassination would make Iran more decisive in its resistance to the United States while Iran's Revolutionary Guards said anti-U.S. forces would exact revenge across the Muslim world.
Trump, who is facing impeachment charges, made no immediate comment but posted a picture of the U.S. flag on Twitter.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democratic and strong critic of the Republican president, said the attack was carried out without consultation with Congress and without authorization for the use of military force against Iran. 
Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi condemned the killings as a violation of the conditions of the U.S. military presence in Iraq and an act of aggression that breached Iraq's sovereignty and would lead to war.
Iraqi Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, who portrays himself a nationalist rejecting both Iranian and U.S. influence, ordered his followers to be ready to defend Iraq and urged all sides to behave wisely.
The Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad, long supported by Iran, condemned what it called criminal U.S. aggression.
In Israel, the government of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - which has long regarded Soleimani as a major threat - gave no immediate response to his death but Israel Army Radio said the military had gone on heightened alert. 
The slain commander's Quds Force, along with its stable of paramilitary proxies from Lebanon's Hezbollah to Iraq's Popular Mobilisation Forces grouping of Iran-backed militias - battle-hardened militias armed with missiles - has ample means to launch a multi-pronged response.
In September, U.S. officials blamed Iran for a devastating missile and drone attack on oil installations of  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222), the Saudi state energy giant and world's largest oil exporter. The Trump administration did not respond, beyond heated rhetoric and threats.
Iran, for its part, has absorbed scores of air strikes and missile attacks, mainly carried out by Israel against its fighters and proxies in Syria and Iraq.
But analysts say Iran is likely to respond forcefully to the targeting of Soleimani, who it has built into a legend as its influence has spread across the region in the wake of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 and subsequent occupation
Soleimani had survived several assassination attempts against him by Western, Israeli and Arab agencies over the past two decades.
The Quds Force, tasked with carrying out operations beyond Iran's borders, shored up support for Syria's Assad when he looked close to defeat in the civil war raging since 2011 and also helped militiamen defeat Islamic State in Iraq.
Soleimani became head of the force in 1998, a position in which he kept a low profile for years while he strengthened Iran's ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Syria's government and Shi’ite militia groups in Iraq.
IRAQI PARAMILITARY GROUPS
Muhandis, who was killed with Soleimani, oversaw Iraq’s PMF, a grouping of paramilitary groups mostly consisting of Iran-backed Shi’ite militias that was formally integrated into Iraqi armed forces. 
His Kataib Hezbollah militia, which received battlefield training from Lebanon’s Hezbollah, has long targeted U.S. forces and was one of the earliest groups to send fighters to Syria to support Assad.
In 2009, Washington declared Kataib Hezbollah a foreign terrorist organization, saying it threatened stability in Iraq and declared Muhandis a terrorist. In 2007, a Kuwaiti court sentenced him to death in absentia for his involvement in the 1983 U.S. and French embassy bombings in Kuwait.

Iran's ambassador to Iraq told state television that Soleimani's body would be sent to Iran.

BATEMANS BAY, Australia/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Authorities urged Australians on Friday to evacuate parts of the eastern states of Victoria and New South Wales to escape bushfires they fear are set to burn out of control this weekend.
In a harbinger of the searing conditions expected, a number of fires burnt out of control in South Australia as temperatures topped 40 degrees C (104 F) across much of the state and strong winds fanned flames.
Victoria declared a state of disaster across areas home to about 100,000 people, with authorities urging people to evacuate before a deterioration expected on Saturday.
""If they value their safety they must leave,"" Michael Grainger of the state's police emergency responders told reporters. ""I'd suggest personal belongings are of very, very little value in these circumstances. 
""These are dire circumstances, there is no doubt.""
At the summer holiday peak, authorities have advised tens of thousands of holidaymakers and residents to leave national parks and tourist areas on the south coast of New South Wales, where a week-long state of emergency has been called.
New South Wales ""Tourist leave zone"": https://graphics.reuters.com/AUSTRALIA-BUSHFIRES/0100B4TM2N3/tourist-leavezone.jpg
A death confirmed on Friday takes the state's toll this week to eight. Two people have died in Victoria, and 28 are unaccounted for.
In Victoria, naval vessels Choules and Sycamore started evacuations of about a quarter of the 4,000 people stranded on a beach in the isolated town of Malla­coota.
With roads blocked, sea transport and some airlifts are the only way out of the stricken town, although heavy smoke prevented flights on Friday. 
People in the fire-devastated New South Wales town of Cobargo angrily confronted Prime Minister Scott Morrison during a visit on Thursday, with one shouting that the leader should be ""ashamed of himself"" and had ""left the country to burn"".
Morrison's conservative government has long drawn criticism for not doing enough to battle climate change as a cause of Australia's savage drought and fires.
This season's fires have scorched more than 5.25 million hectares (13 million acres) of bushland, with 1,365 homes destroyed in New South Wales alone, including 449 this week on the south coast.
* Weather officials on Friday rated the danger from fire ""very high"" to ""extreme"" in most districts in South Australia, with a similar outlook for New South Wales and Victoria on Saturday.
* Please click on links to see maps posted on Twitter by emergency services in both states to predict the spread of fires on Saturday: https:// and https:// * The head of the opposition Labor Party demanded a national response. ""We haven't, in my lifetime, had people on beaches waiting to be evacuated in life jackets...like it's a peacetime version of something that we have seen during wartime,"" Anthony Albanese told a news conference.  * Since Monday, wildfires have killed ten people in New South Wales and Victoria, with 28 still missing in the latter.  * Police and emergency officials urged tourists to leave the south coast and Snowy Mountains of New South Wales because of dangerous fire conditions, and set a Friday deadline of 10 a.m. (2300 GMT Thursday) to leave Kosciuszko National Park.  * Thousands of people had already been evacuated from East Gippsland in Victoria, one of the largest such exercises since more than 35,000 people evacuated from the northern city of Darwin in the aftermath of cyclone Tracy in 1974. * A contingent of 39 firefighters from North America arrived in Melbourne this week, taking to almost 100 the number of U.S. and Canadians helping to tackle the crisis.  * New Zealand will send 22 more firefighters to Australia next week, adding to 157 sent since October. * Morrison blamed a three-year drought and lack of hazard reduction for the unprecedented extent and duration of the bushfires. * Morrison said he was inclined not to proceed with plans for a Jan. 13 visit to India because of the fires, following which he was to have visited Japan. 
* United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned the world was ""not winning"" the race to tackle global warming.

1389,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 03, 2020 01:49AM ET</span>","Soleimani was Iran's celebrity soldier, spearhead in Middle East","By Babak Dehghanpisheh
(Reuters) - Iranian Major-General Qassem Soleimani, the top commander of the elite Quds Force of the Revolutionary Guards, helped Iran fight proxy wars across the Middle East by inspiring militias on the battlefield and negotiating with political leaders. 
His death on Friday in a U.S. air strike on his convoy at Baghdad airport marked the end of a man who was a celebrity at home and closely watched by the United States, Israel and Tehran's regional rival Saudi Arabia.
The Pentagon said the strike was aimed at deterring future Iranian attack plans.
Soleimani was responsible for clandestine overseas operations and was often seen on battlefields guiding Iraqi Shi'ite groups in the war against Islamic State.
He was killed along with top Iraqi militia commander Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Both men were seen as heroes in Iran's fight against its enemies and state television heaped them with praise shortly after their deaths were announced.
The television showed footage of him with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and in war zones in military garb, including as a young high-school graduate commanding a unit in Iran's war with Iraq in the 1980s.
After that, he rose rapidly through the ranks of Iran's Revolutionary Guards to become chief of the Quds Force, a post in which he helped Iran form alliances in the Middle East as it came under pressure from U.S. sanctions that have devastated the Islamic Republic's economy.
The United States designated the Revolutionary Guards a foreign terrorist organization in 2019, part of a campaign of maximum pressure to force Iran to negotiate on its ballistic missile program and nuclear policy.
Soleimani had a pointed reply: any negotiation with the U.S. would be ""complete surrender.""
Soleimani's Quds Force shored up support for Syrian President Bashir al-Assad when he looked close to defeat in the civil war raging since 2011 and also helped militiamen defeat Islamic State in Iraq.
Its successes have made Soleimani instrumental to the steady spreading of Iran's clout in the Middle East, which the United States and Tehran's regional foes Saudi Arabia and Israel have struggled to keep in check.
Khamenei made Soleimani head of the Quds Force in 1998, a position in which he kept a low profile for years while he strengthened Iran’s ties with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Assad's government, and Shi’ite militia groups in Iraq.
In the past few years, he has acquired a more public standing, with fighters and commanders in Iraq and Syria posting images on social media of him on the battlefield, his beard and hair always impeccably trimmed.
""WE ARE CLOSE TO YOU""
Soleimani's growing authority within Iran's military establishment was apparent in 2019 when Khamenei awarded him the Order of Zolfiqar medal, Iran's highest military honor. It was the first time any commander had received the medal since the Islamic Republic was established in 1979.
In a statement after Soleimani's death, Khamenei said harsh revenge awaited the ""criminals"" who killed him. His death, though bitter, would double the motivation of the resistance against the United States and Israel, the Iranian leader said.
""Soleimani is ... not a man working in an office. He goes to the front to inspect the troops and see the fighting,"" a former senior Iraqi official, who asked not to be identified, said in an interview in 2014.
""His chain of command is only the Supreme Leader. He needs money, gets money. Needs munitions, gets munitions. Needs material, gets material,"" the former Iraqi official said.
Soleimani was also in charge of intelligence gathering and covert military operations carried out by the Quds Force and in 2018 he publicly challenged U.S. President Donald Trump.
""I’m telling you Mr. Trump the gambler, I’m telling you, know that we are close to you in that place you don’t think we are,"" said Soleimani, seen wagging an admonishing finger in a video clip distributed online.
""You will start the war but we will end it,"" he said, with a checkered keffiya draped across the shoulders of his olive uniform.
""GETS WHAT HE WANTS""
Softly-spoken, Soleimani came from humble beginnings, born into an agricultural family in the town of Rabor in southeast Iran on March 11, 1957.
At 13, he traveled to the town of Kerman and got a construction job to help his father pay back loans, according to a first person account from Soleimani posted by Defa Press, a site focused on the history of Iran’s eight year war with Iraq.
When the revolution to oust the Shah began in 1978, Soleimani was working for the municipal water department in Kerman and organized demonstrations against the monarch.
He volunteered for the Revolutionary Guards and, after war with Iraq broke out in 1980, quickly rose through the ranks and went on to battle drug smugglers on the border with Afghanistan.
""Soleimani is a great listener. He does not impose himself. But he always gets what he wants,"" said another Iraqi official, adding that he can be intimidating.
At the height of the civil war between Sunni and Shi’ite militants in Iraq in 2007, the U.S. military accused the Quds Force of supplying improvised explosive devices to Shi’ite militants which led to the death of many American soldiers. 
Soleimani played such a pivotal role in Iraq’s security through various militia groups that General David Petraeus, the overall head of U.S. forces in Iraq at the time, sent messages to him through Iraqi officials, according to diplomatic cables published by Wikileaks.
After a referendum on independence in the Kurdish north in 2017, Soleimani issued a warning to Kurdish leaders which led to a withdrawal of fighters from contested areas and allowed central government forces to reassert their control.
He was arguably even more influential in Syria. His visit to Moscow in the summer of 2015 was the first step in planning for a Russian military intervention that reshaped the Syrian war and forged a new Iranian-Russian alliance in support of Assad.
His activities had made him a repeated target of the U.S. Treasury: Soleimani was sanctioned by the United States for the Quds Force's support for Lebanon's Hezbollah and other armed groups, for his role in Syria’s crackdown against protesters and his alleged involvement in a plot to assassinate the Saudi ambassador to the United States.
Soleimani’s success in advancing Iran’s agenda had also put him in the crosshairs of regional foes Saudi Arabia and Israel.

Top Saudi intelligence officials looked into the possibility of assassinating Soleimani in 2017, according to a report in the New York Times in 2018. A Saudi government spokesman declined to comment, the Times reported, but Israeli military officials publicly discussed the possibility of targeting him.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will expand the scope of a program that returns non-Mexican migrants crossing Mexico's border to that country to await their U.S. court hearings, the Department of Homeland Security said on Thursday.
Washington already has sent more than 56,000 migrants to Mexico under the program, known as the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP). The majority have been Central Americans applying for U.S. asylum.
The effort — which had been implemented over the past year at ports of entry in Texas and California — will be applied at a port of entry south of Tucson, Ariz. Previously, migrants encountered in that area had been sent to El Paso, Texas, to process their return to Mexico. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has made immigration enforcement a major focus of his first term in office and has continued to press the issue in the run-up to the 2020 presidential election. 
Acting DHS Secretary Chad Wolf said in a written statement on Thursday that the MPP program has been ""an extremely effective tool"" for the United States.
Advocates counter that the initiative exposes migrants to violence in Mexico and restricts their ability to seek protections in the United States. The U.S. consulate in Mexico’s border city of Nuevo Laredo issued a security alert on Wednesday, warning against gun battles and urging government employees to take precautions. [L1N297021]
Mexico’s asylum agency, known as COMAR, said on Wednesday that it had received 66,915 applications for asylum in 2019, up nearly 126% from the previous year.
The agency has struggled to process the crush of applications with limited resources. COMAR received 20 million pesos ($1 million) in funding from the Mexican government in 2019, the lowest sum in seven years.
In December, U.S. border authorities expanded a separate program to process asylum cases rapidly to the Rio Grande Valley in Texas, according to CBS News. The program, known as Prompt Asylum Claim Review (PACR), had been launched months earlier as a pilot in the El Paso area.
U.S. authorities have not specified the criteria to place migrants in a growing array of border programs, which include MPP, PACR and another initiative that sends asylum seekers from Honduras and El Salvador to request protection in Guatemala.
Rodney Scott, acting deputy chief of the U.S. Border Patrol, told reporters in December that the factors ""change on a daily basis"" but are determined in coordination with the receiving countries.

Washington blacklisted Leopoldo Cintra Frias, minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba (MINFAR), and his children, Deborah Cintra Gonzalez and Leopoldo Cintra Gonzalez, in its latest action targeting Havana for its support of Maduro.
Pompeo said MINFAR had been involved in the torture of Venezuelans and subjected them to ""cruel, inhumane, or degrading treatment or punishment for their anti-Maduro stances"" alongside Maduro's military and intelligence officers.
The designation bars Cintra, a career military officer who joined Fidel Castro's rebel army in 1957, and his children from entering the United States.
The Cuban Embassy in Washington could not immediately be reached for comment.
""As Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Cuba, Cintra Frias bears responsibility for Cuba’s actions to prop up the former Maduro regime in Venezuela,"" Pompeo said.
""Dismantling Venezuela's democracy by terrifying Venezuelans into submission is the goal of MINFAR and the Cuban regime,"" Pompeo added.
The United States and more than 50 other countries have recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate president. Guaido invoked the constitution to assume a rival presidency last year, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was a sham.
But Maduro retains the support of the military, runs the government's day-to-day operations and is backed by Russia, China and Cuba.

The two-helicopter rescue operation began around 400 km southwest of the town of Bodo in the early afternoon on Thursday, but activities were severely hampered by bad weather - high winds and eight-meter-high waves, the ministry said.
""According to the Norwegian Joint Rescue Coordination Center, under the current climatic conditions there is no chance for those who have fallen into the water to survive for such a long time,"" the ministry said in a statement.
The crew of the Stara Planina cargo ship consists of 19 people - 18 Bulgarian citizens and one Ukraine citizen.

1393,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 05:12PM ET</span>",Leader of U.S. border militia group pleads guilty to weapons charge,"By Dan Whitcomb and Julio-Cesar Chavez
(Reuters) - The leader of a small right-wing militia accused of illegally detaining immigrants as they crossed the U.S. border with Mexico pleaded guilty on Thursday to federal weapons charges, prosecutors and a defense lawyer said.
Larry Hopkins, 70, agreed to plead guilty to an indictment charging him with being a felon in possession of a firearm because he ""felt like he had made his point"" to the U.S. government, his attorney, Kelly O'Connell, told Reuters in an interview.
""He had agreed that he was guilty of it and felon in possession is a pretty easy crime to prove,” O’Connell said.
A U.S. Attorneys spokeswoman said that during a hearing in federal court in Albuquerque, Hopkins had admitted to being in possession of nine firearms and ammunition for those weapons at the time of his arrest in April. 
Hopkins, who has four previous felony convictions, faces a maximum sentence of 10 years in federal prison, $250,000 in fines and penalties and three years of supervised release. He is scheduled to be sentenced in the coming months.
Prosecutors say Hopkins is a leader of the United Constitutional Patriots, a group the American Civil Liberties Union and other critics have accused illegally detained migrants by impersonating law enforcement.
The Patriots drew condemnation from immigrant rights activists after it posted an April 16 video showing as many as 300 migrants, most of them families, sitting at its camp waiting for Border Patrol. Hopkins was arrested later that month.
He was beaten in a federal jail on April 22, suffering blows to the head and a bloody nose, according to his attorneys, who sought a psychiatric evaluation for their client after he reported suffering headaches, dizzy spells and memory loss.
In October 2017, the Federal Bureau of Investigation received reports a militia was being run out of Hopkins' home in Flora Vista, New Mexico, the agency said in court papers filed in the case. Agents found nine firearms there.
Last June, Jim Benvie of the Guardian Patriots, another armed group known for stopping migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, was arrested and charged with impersonating a U.S. Border Patrol agent.
The Guardian Patriots split from the United Constitutional Patriots in May.
In April, the United Constitutional Patriots boasted they had helped the U.S. Border Patrol detain some 5,600 migrants in New Mexico in the previous 60 days.

""We want to improve performance and make me much less important — and within a year largely redundant,"" Dominic Cummings said in a post on his blog https:// on Thursday.
""We do not have the sort of expertise supporting the PM and ministers that is needed. This must change fast so we can properly serve the public.""
Cummings, who has made no secret of his disdain for much of the way Britain's civil service operates, said he had been lucky to have worked with some fantastic officials in recent months.
""But there are also some profound problems at the core of how the British state makes decisions,"" he said.
Cummings was one of the senior campaigners behind the Vote Leave victory in the 2016 Brexit referendum and was described by former Prime Minister John Major as ""political anarchist."" 
In his blog, Cummings said rapid progress could now be made on long-term problems thanks to the combination of policy upheaval after Brexit, an appetite for risk among some officials in the new government and Johnson's big majority in parliament.
The government was looking to hire data scientists and software developers, economists, policy experts, project managers, communication experts and junior researchers as well as ""weirdos and misfits with odd skills,"" he said.
""We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole,"" Cummings said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Thursday there were indications Iran or forces it backs may be planning additional attacks, warning that the ""game has changed"" and it was possible the United States might have to take preemptive action to protect American lives.
""There are some indications out there that they may be planning additional attacks, that is nothing new ... we've seen this for two or three months now,"" Esper told reporters, without providing evidence or details about the U.S. assessment.
""If that happens then we will act and by the way, if we get word of attacks or some type indication, we will take preemptive action as well to protect American forces to protect American lives.""
Iranian-backed demonstrators hurled rocks at the U.S. embassy in Baghdad during two days of protests, then withdrew on Wednesday after Washington dispatched extra troops.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces a re-election campaign in 2020, accused Iran of orchestrating the violence. He threatened on Tuesday to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want war. 
Iran has rejected the accusation. Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi criticized American officials, in a statement, saying they have ""the astounding audacity"" to blame Iran for protests sparked by U.S. air strikes.
The unrest outside the U.S. embassy followed American strikes on Sunday against bases of the Tehran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group. Washington said the air strikes, which killed 25 people, were in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq last week.
On Wednesday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei condemned U.S. attacks on Iranian-allied militias in Iraq, blaming the United States for violence in Iran's neighbor.
The protests marked a new turn in the shadow war between Washington and Tehran playing out across the Middle East.
""The game has changed and we are prepared to do what is necessary to defend our personnel and our interests and our partners in the region,"" Esper said.
During the same press briefing, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley said there had been a sustained campaign by Kataib Hezbollah against U.S. personnel since at least October and the missile attack in northern Iraq was designed to kill.
""Thirty-one rockets aren't designed as a warning shot, that is designed to inflict damage and kill,"" Milley said.
He said it was highly unlikely anyone could overrun the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and if they did, they would run into a ""buzzsaw.""
U.S. TROOPS PREPARED TO DEPLOY
The United States sent 750 troops to Kuwait this week and U.S. officials have told Reuters that about 3,000 additional troops could be sent to the region in the coming days.
Milley said additional troops had been alerted but a decision had not yet been made on deploying them. Since May, the United States has dispatched about 14,000 additional troops to the Middle East.
In his 2016 campaign, Trump promised to extract the United States from ""endless wars.""
In a statement, Esper said the demonstrations outside the U.S. embassy in Baghdad were carried out by Iranian-backed Shi'ite militia, saying leaders were seen in the crowd and some members showed up wearing uniforms. 
He said the series of rocket attacks on bases hosting U.S. forces in Iraq were being directed by the ""Iranian regime"" and specifically Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps leadership. 
Earlier on Thursday, Revolutionary Guards Commander Brigadier General Hossein Salami said: ""We are not leading the country to war, but we are not afraid of any war.""
The Iraqi government has attempted to integrate paramilitary organizations into its armed forces.

Esper said he had not seen the Iraqi government take sufficient action on stopping Iran-backed groups from carrying out attacks on U.S. forces and Baghdad needs to double down on efforts to control the groups.

HAVANA (Reuters) - Priests from Cuba’s Afro-Cuban Santeria religion offered some solace on Thursday to worshippers facing another year of relentless U.S. sanctions, government austerity measures and shortages on the Communist-ruled island.
In their annual prophesy the priests, known as babalawos, announced that 2020 would be under the divinity of one of Santeria’s most powerful and protective deities, Oshun, the goddess of beauty, purity, fertility, love, and sensuality.
The ritual-filled religion, which fuses Catholicism with ancient African beliefs brought to Cuba by slaves, is practiced by millions of Cubans, many of whom eagerly await guidance from its annual forecast.
Cubans coped with sporadic fuel, food, transportation and pharmaceutical shortages last year as key-ally Venezuela sunk further into crisis and the Trump administration reversed a short-lived detente and piled new sanctions on top of the decades-old trade embargo.
Washington is threatening more sanctions this year and Cuban authorities have warned austerity measures will stay in place and economic growth will be meager, at best.
""Cuba is going to escape any attempt to crush us,"" babalawo Víctor Betancourt, who presided over the commission that formulated this year’s prophesies, told Reuters.
""Oshun is a promising sign in that regard and we babalawos use this sign in adverse circumstances,"" he said.
The Letter of the Year warned against increased crime and epidemics and the disintegration of the ""traditional Cuban family due to promiscuity, lack of authority and loss of values"", among other threats.
The Santeria priests recommended tolerance, patience, good behavior in general, as well as avoiding too much pork or breeding pigs in inadequate spaces.
""Corruption must be buried in Cuba,"" Betancourt said, referring to crime and vulgar and loud behavior among the youth and drugs.
Babalawo Enrique Machin, a commission member, told Reuters U.S. President Donald Trump might not be re-elected, stressing the need for patience and dialogue.
""Every country in the world has to talk. The predictions with the United States is that the enemy will always be present,"" Machin said.
""That is why we are calling for social dialogue, for a political, economic dialogue, everything that can be done.""
Santeria followers have believed their gods were on the side of the Cuban revolution ever since a white dove landed on the shoulder of late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro during a victory speech in Havana."
1398,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 03:29PM ET</span>",Algeria appoints new government amid worst political crisis in decades,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria appointed a new government on Thursday, as the country faces its biggest political crisis in decades and a raft of economic problems caused by falling energy revenues. 
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune was elected last month and appointed Abdelaziz Djerad as prime minister on Saturday. They have kept several important posts unchanged, seemingly signaling continuity in major state policies. 
Abderrahmane Raouia was re-appointed finance minister, after previously serving in that post from 2017 until last March, when he was replaced. As is usual in Algeria, Tebboune will act as defense minister. 
Mass protests that broke out in February succeeded in unseating veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika in April. An election to replace him was postponed twice as protesters said it would be illegitimate while the ruling elite stayed in place. 
Tebboune was elected last month in a vote that the protest movement rejected, winning 58% on a turnout officially registered as 40%. 
He has offered dialogue with the protesters but the leaderless movement has continued to stage demonstrations since his election. 
Algeria, a major energy exporter, depends on its oil and gas sales for 60% of government revenue. However, sales have fallen since oil prices began to drop in 2014 and Algeria's foreign currency reserves have more than halved since then. 
A state budget agreed by the interim government and parliament late last year included new laws aimed at increasing foreign investment but pledged 9% cuts in public spending. 
The interim government appointed a new head of state energy producer Sonatrach, Kamel Edine Chikhi, and a new central bank governor, Benabderahmane Ayman, in November.
The parliament also approved a new energy law that would make international investment in oil and gas more attractive in order to arrest declining output, while still keeping a bar on majority foreign ownership of projects in the sector. 
Foreign Minister Sabri Boukadoum, Energy Minister Mohamed Arkab and Interior Minister Kamel Beldjoud continue in their posts. 

The position of deputy defense minister, traditionally an important role in a country where the top generals have held great political power, has not yet been filled. It was held by Gaed Salah until his death of a heart attack at age 79 last week.

1399,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 03:20PM ET</span>",U.S. presidential hopeful Joe Biden has best fundraising quarter of his campaign,"By Trevor Hunnicutt
NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden took in $22.7 million in the last three months of 2019, his campaign said in a statement on Thursday, a pickup in fundraising just weeks before voters kick off the party's nominating process.
The figure marks the best fundraising quarter for the former vice president since his campaign launched in April, and represents a rebound from the July-to-September quarter, when Biden netted $15.2 million. That figure had worried some supporters who thought his campaign may not have enough cash to take on both President Donald Trump and Democrats rivals.
Democrats are selecting a nominee to face Trump in the November 2020 election. While Biden, 77, leads in national polls, he faces better-funded campaigns in a competitive race that will be decided state-by-state. Iowa holds the Democrats' first nominating contest on Feb. 3.
Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders raised more than $34.5 million in the last quarter of 2019, while Trump drew $46 million, their campaigns said earlier on Thursday.
Democrat Pete Buttigieg raised $24.7 million in the quarter, while businessman Andrew Yang raised $16.5 million. U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren has not yet released her latest fundraising totals. 
In a memo to supporters, Biden campaign manager Greg Schultz said ""there's little doubt that Vice President Biden enters 2020 with wind in his sails, but our resource needs will only continue to grow.""
He also said the campaign has been resourceful, avoiding using outside vendors to make advertising videos by producing them in-house instead.
Fundraising has created a demand on Biden's time. The candidate has split his days between campaigning in early voting states and crisscrossing other parts of the country to attend events with high-dollar donors.
In October, the Biden campaign reversed its opposition to receiving support from super PACs, groups that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money. Shortly thereafter, a super PAC called ""Unite the Country"" started running millions of dollars in ads supporting Biden. The campaign does not accept money from lobbyists or fossil fuel executives. Sanders and Warren have disavowed super PACs, while Trump has not.
Data suggests Biden's campaign was significantly outspent on advertisements in mid-December on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) by Democratic rivals Sanders, Warren, Buttigieg and billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who is using his own money to fund his campaign.

In its most recent fundraising announcement, Biden's campaign touted doubling its online fundraising compared to the previous quarter and said much of the support was from small-dollar donors, with an average contribution of $41.

""We would urge restraint by Kim Jong Un,"" Esper said in an interview on Fox News.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said this week that there were no longer grounds for Pyongyang to be bound by a self-declared moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear bomb testing and that a ""new strategic weapon"" would be introduced in the near future.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there were no indications that North Korea was preparing for an imminent long-range missile test. 
The official said the assessment after Kim's speech was that North Korea believes it does not have to rush to test an intercontinental ballistic missile, though shorter-range missile or engine tests could be possible at any time. 
U.S. President Donald Trump - who in 2018 became the first American leader to meet with a North Korean leader - said after Kim's remarks that the North Korean leader had signed a denuclearization contract and Trump thought Kim was a ""man of his word.""
Last month, Pyongyang warned Washington of a possible ""Christmas gift"" after Kim gave the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over his country's nuclear arsenal.

Speaking with reporters on Thursday, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said that the alert status of American forces was at a sufficient level to respond to anything that happens and military defensive capabilities were adequate to defend the United States.

""The leaders agreed on the need for de-escalation in Idlib, Syria, in order to protect civilians,"" the White House said in a statement.
At least eight people were killed on Wednesday when the Syrian army launched missiles that struck a shelter for displaced families in the country's northwest, witnesses and residents said.
Five children were among those killed in the strike on a disused school in the town of Sarmin in Idlib province, two medics said, adding over 16 people were injured. 
The school building was being used by families fleeing a Russian-backed bombing campaign in Idlib, the last opposition bastion in the northwest.
The Russian-led campaign that started in April 2019 had already forced at least 500,000 people to leave for areas closer to the border with Turkey, which Russian jets rarely hit.
Rescue services and witnesses say the bombing campaign has killed several thousand civilians.
Trump spoke out last week against the ""carnage"" in Idlib. Moscow and Damascus deny claims of indiscriminate bombing of civilians, saying they are fighting jihadist militants.

President Tayyip Erdogan said last week Turkey would deploy troops in Libya to support Fayez al-Serraj's internationally-recognized Government of National Accord (GNA).
The GNA last month requested Turkish support as it fends off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's forces, which are backed by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan.
Fighting and air strikes continue around Tripoli, where the U.N. refugee agency said three mortars had fallen on Thursday close to an overcrowded transit center housing around 1,000 migrants in the center of the city.
Turkey's move comes after Ankara and the GNA signed two separate agreements in November: one on security and military cooperation and another on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean, infuriating Greece, Israel, Egypt and Cyprus.
Almost immediately after the vote, Egypt strongly condemned the parliament's decision, and called on the international community to urgently respond to the move.
The bill, opposed by all major opposition parties, passed with a 315-184 vote. Opposition parties said the move may exacerbate conflicts in Libya and endanger Turkish soldiers in the region and Turkey's national security. 
But Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said the bill was an important step for protecting Ankara's interests in North Africa and the Mediterranean, and for achieving peace and stability in Libya.
'DANGEROUS ESCALATION'
The GNA's interior minister Fathi Bashagha said Tripoli had requested Turkish support following a ""dangerous escalation"" in the conflict by Haftar's forces.
""As Libya's only legitimate and sovereign government, the GNA is the singular entity with the right to formalize military alliances necessary to safeguard our nation,"" Bashagha said, adding that the GNA aimed to stop a ""war criminal"" from seizing power and establish stability, security and democracy in Libya.
Dmitry Novikov, a Russian lawmaker, said after the vote that a Turkish military presence in Libya would ""only deteriorate the situation"", according to the Interfax news agency.
Later on Thursday, Erdogan discussed Libya with U.S. President Donald Trump in a phone call, the Turkish presidency said without providing more details. Erdogan is due to discuss Libya with Russian President Vladimir Putin later this month.
Ankara has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a U.N. report.
But analysts and some officials say Ankara is unlikely to immediately deploy troops, sending military advisers and equipment first.
""The hope would be that the Turkish military may not itself be involved in military action,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat who is chairman of the think-tank Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies.
'DETERRENT'
Last week, a senior Turkish official said Ankara could train Libyan soldiers in Turkey, and Reuters reported that Turkey may also consider sending allied Syrian fighters to Tripoli.
On Wednesday, Vice President Fuat Oktay said the bill served a symbolic role that Ankara hoped would be a ""deterrent"" to the parties, and that Turkey may not send troops if Haftar's forces pulled back. 
The maritime agreement between Ankara and Tripoli has ended Turkey's isolation in the eastern Mediterranean, where it is at odds with Greece over resources off Cyprus. Greece has said the accord violates international law, but Ankara rejects this, and says it only wants to protect its rights.
Greece, Cyprus and Israel signed a deal on Thursday to build a 1,900 km (1,180 mile) subsea pipeline to carry natural gas from the eastern Mediterranean to Europe, but analysts say the accord between Turkey and Libya could present a barrier to the plans.
""Ankara sees its involvement in Libya as a symbol of its new status as a regional power,"" said Asli Aydintasbas, senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations.

VIENNA (Reuters) - The dominant position of Austrian conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz in their new governing alliance with the Greens was clear on Thursday as they presented a coalition deal heavy on law-and order measures that will displease the Greens' base.
Kurz struck a coalition deal on Wednesday with the Greens to ensure his return to power and bring the left-wing party into government for the first time, three months after he won a parliamentary election.
Their alliance means Austria will most likely join Sweden and Finland in having the Greens in government at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change. Unlike in those countries, however, Austria's Greens are joining a conservative-led government. They are also the junior partner.
""We have very intentionally united the best of both worlds,"" Kurz told an event outlining details of the agreement.
The new alliance is being watched closely in neighboring Germany as a potential model for Angela Merkel's conservatives.
""It is possible for the Greens to keep their main campaign pledges and for us,"" he said, meaning a hard line on immigration and on ""political Islam"" for him, twinned with tax cuts and a balanced budget, and environmental measures plus greater transparency in government for the Greens.
The deal published on Thursday includes measures championed by his previous government in coalition with the far right as Kurz seeks to appeal to his base but also to disgruntled far-right voters after a video sting scandal in May brought down that party's leader and ended their coalition.
Kurz emerged relatively unscathed from the scandal, even gaining voters in the Sept. 29 parliamentary election.
The deal includes raising the age until which girls are banned from wearing a headscarf in school to 14 from around 10, an extension of a policy introduced under Kurz's last coalition.
It also includes reviving a disputed plan for preventive custody of potentially dangerous individuals, even if they have not committed a crime, which was put forward under the previous coalition after a fatal stabbing apparently committed by an asylum seeker in February.
Such measures will be harder for many Greens supporters to swallow than measures such as cutting the corporate tax rate to 21% from 25%. The coalition deal must still be approved by the Greens' decision-making body, the Federal Council, on Saturday. 
While few expect the Federal Council to block the deal, immigration and security are likely to be constant sources of friction within the coalition.

Greens leader Werner Kogler, however, touted successes of his own, such as increasing the tax on flights out of Austria and investments in expanding public transport. The plan includes making Austria climate neutral by 2040.
""I will let you decide if the proportion - we calculated it - is exactly 1:2.7,"" he said, referring to each party's measures in the deal and their respective vote shares of 37.5% and 13.9%. 
That is also roughly reflected in their share of ministries - the Greens will control four out of 15. 
""Flying will, slightly but still ... become more expensive,"" Kogler said. ""In the medium term also taking the train will become cheaper."" 
The current tax on flights out of Austria, ranging from 3.50 euros ($3.90) to 17.50 euros per passenger depending on distance, will be replaced by a flat rate of 12 euros. The existing road toll for trucks will also increase for the most polluting vehicles. 
A more thorough review on establishing ""price truth"" in carbon emissions will be carried out, to be implemented from 2022, the plan said.
For Kogler, this was the best deal possible since his party did not have several potential coalition partners as Kurz did.

""The Greens have only this possibility to put into effect what they ... were elected for,"" he said.

1406,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 02, 2020 01:13PM ET</span>","Prominent South Sudan economist, 30 others pardoned by President Kiir","By Denis Dumo
JUBA (Reuters) - South Sudan's President Salva Kiir on Thursday pardoned dozens of prisoners including a prominent economist jailed for giving interviews to foreign media, saying it was a goodwill gesture to rejuvenate the country's stalled peace process.  
In June 2019, economist Peter Biar Ajak was sentenced to two years in jail for disturbing the peace because he gave interviews to foreign media after he was arrested on treason charges that were subsequently dropped.
State TV South Sudan Broadcasting Corporation (HSBC) said a total of 31 people had been pardoned.
South Sudan plunged into war in 2013 after a political disagreement between Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar deteriorated into a military confrontation.
Kiir and Machar signed a peace deal in 2018 under pressure from the United Nations, United States and other countries in the region to end the country's grinding civil war and agreed to form a unity government by November 12 last year.
That target date passed without an agreement on key issues including security and the two leaders pushed the deadline back by 100 days.
The failed deadline prompted Washington to recall its ambassador and diminished prospects of an end to Africa's worst refugee crisis since Rwanda's 1994 genocide.
""It's a good gesture by President Salva Kiir for keeping his words. The release ... is a New Year gift to the family of Biar,"" Philip Anyang, Ajak's lawyer, told Reuters.
Ajak fled to the United States as a youth, was educated at Harvard and Cambridge and worked at the World Bank. He also worked as South Sudan country director for the International Growth Centre, part of the London School of Economics.
He was arrested in July, 2018 and charged with treason, although a court threw out those charges early last year.
He had been publicly critical of the way Kiir and Machar approached peace talks to end the civil war.

The legislation repealed the 2009 anti-terrorism law that said staging gatherings that could cause ""serious interference or disruption of any public services"" was an act of terrorism.
The new legislation states: ""If the disruption of public services was caused by a legally recognized protest, meetings or job strikes, the act will not be taken as a terrorist act.""
Since coming to power in 2018, Abiy has implemented a series of reforms that have reshaped public life in Ethiopia.
He made peace with Eritrea, freed political prisoners, and is opening up the economy to foreign investment by loosening state control.
The country is due to hold a general election this year, which will test the popularity of Abiy's reforms.
Under the new law, Ethiopians who suffer abuses at the hands of law enforcement can receive compensation of up to 50,000 Ethiopian Birr ($1,500).
For anyone convicted of terrorism, though, the new law maintains sentences of death or jail terms of 15 years to life.
Although Abiy's reforms have drawn plaudits and won him a Nobel prize, a freer environment has stirred violence in some areas as previously repressed ethnic groups assert their newly found freedom and demand a bigger share of the nation's resources."

    Paul Beckaert told Reuters that the Belgian judge in charge of the case had ruled in favor of Puigdemont and Toni Comin, another former member of the Catalan government, citing their immunity as members of the European Parliament (MEPs). 
The Belgian federal prosecutor’s office was not immediately available for comment. 
    The pair are wanted in Spain on charges of sedition after organizing a failed Catalan independence referendum in 2017 but Madrid’s three previous extradition requests have been refused. 
Another Catalan leader and MEP, former vice-president Oriol Junqueras, is serving a prison sentence for his role in the banned referendum.
Last month, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) said that Junqueras was entitled to immunity since he was elected as a member of the European Parliament in May 2019, implying that Puigdemont and Comin should benefit from the same immunity.
However it is still not clear whether they will be allowed to take their seats, despite receiving parliamentary accreditation in Brussels last month.
Puigdemont cheered the suspension on Twitter and called on Spain to free Junqueras from prison. 
""Spain must act in the same way as Belgium has done and respect the law,"" he said in a tweet. 
On Monday Spain's state attorney recommended that the Supreme Court release Junqueras, in line with the ECJ ruling. The court is expected to give a ruling in the coming weeks.
(The story corrects paragraph six to clarify that the ECJ ruling referred to Junqueras and to remove incorrect election date for Puigdemont and Comin).

The reported toll has varied between a Reuters account of 1,500 dead and an Amnesty International figure of more than 300. Both have been dismissed by Iranian authorities.
""According to the classified official bulletin, at least 631 people were killed during the unrest ... most of them were lower-income people,"" the Iranian reformist Kaleme website reported.
Hundreds of young and working-class Iranians took to the streets on Nov. 15 to protest against fuel price rises. The protests turned political, with demonstrators burning pictures of senior officials and calling on clerical rulers to step down.
London-based Amnesty said more than 300 people were killed and thousands were arrested following a crackdown after the unrest, for which Iranian officials have blamed foreign enemies.
Iranian authorities, who have yet to give a death toll, have dismissed Amnesty’s figures and a Reuters report that said 1,500 people were killed in less than two weeks after protests erupted.
Tehran said in December that some “rioters” were shot dead by security forces. Iran's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, denounced the unrest as a “very dangerous conspiracy” by Iran’s enemies."

Lakhdar Bouregaa's release after six months in detention comes at a critical moment in the struggle between the leaderless opposition protest movement and the state, after last month's presidential election and the death last week of the powerful army chief. 
The new president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, has offered dialogue with the protesters, and political analysts in Algiers said the release of the detainees may be aimed at winning support among the opposition for talks. 
""The release of Bouregaa today is a good signal to alleviate the tension,"" analyst Farid Ferrahi said.
About 35 young protesters detained during the past few months have also been freed in recent days, lawyers and activists said. 
Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in February, marching first daily and then weekly, and succeeding in April in forcing veteran president Abdelaziz Bouteflika to step down. 
The state authorities, including the powerful military, have tried to quell the protesters by arresting many Bouteflika allies on corruption charges, while allowing the demonstrations to continue. 
Tebboune was elected in a vote that the protest movement opposed as illegitimate, demanding that the entire ruling elite quit power before any election could take place. He took 58% of votes with a turnout of 40% according to official figures. 
The election had been pushed by the army and its chief of staff, Ahmed Gaed Salah, who died suddenly last week of a heart attack. Tebboune swiftly replaced him with another general of the same generation, the land forces chief, Said Chengriha. 
Although many protesters saw Gaed Salah and allied generals as the main obstacle in their path, many of them also credited him for not using violence against their demonstrations. Hundreds of thousands of people attended his funeral procession. 
Bouregaa, a veteran of Algeria's war of independence in the 1960s, was detained in June as the authorities began to arrest more of the protesters who had flooded the streets since February.

""It's a matter of principle,"" Lopez Obrador told reporters at a regular government news conference.
To hand over the people would mean abandoning what Mexico regards as a ""sacred"" right to grant asylum, he added.
Earlier this week, Bolivia expelled the Mexican ambassador to La Paz over the asylum spat, creating an awkward standoff for Lopez Obrador, who has sought to avoid foreign entanglements.
Mexico has not ejected Bolivia's ambassador in Mexico and Lopez Obrador said he would not react to provocations.
Relations have been rocky between the leftist Lopez Obrador and the conservative government in La Paz headed by caretaker president Jeanine Anez since Mexico gave asylum to Bolivia's former socialist leader Evo Morales in November.
Mexico gave refuge to nine people in La Paz, some of whom the Anez government, which is gearing up for presidential elections, has described as criminals and wants to put on trial.

The Mexican government has accused the Anez administration of harassing and intimidating its diplomatic staff in La Paz.

The county is part of a large swath of territory where Islamist group al Shabaab carries out gun and bomb attacks to pressure Kenya into withdrawing its forces from Somalia.
A Kenyan military contingent forms part of an African Union peacekeeping force that helps defend Somalia's government against the Islamists.
According to a report by Lamu county police seen by Reuters, the attack took place in the early afternoon when armed men sprayed bullets into a passenger bus.
""Three men were shot at close range,"" the report said, adding they had died instantly, while two others were injured.
The report did not give details of the bus's route or say how many people it was carrying.
In April 2015, al Shabaab fighters stormed Garissa University in the area and sought to kill Christian students. At least 148 people were killed.
The al Qaeda-affiliated al Shabaab seeks to topple Somalia's government and establish its own rule based on a strict interpretation of sharia law.

Turkey already hosts some 3.7 million Syrian refugees, the largest refugee population in the world, and Erdogan said it was taking steps with some difficulty to prevent another wave from crossing its border. 
With winter worsening an escalating crisis, the United Nations has said some 284,000 people had fled their homes as of Monday. Up to 3 million people live in Idlib, the last rebel-held swathe of territory after Syria's nearly nine year civil war.
""Right now, 200,000 to 250,000 migrants are moving toward our borders,"" Erdogan told a conference in Ankara. ""We are trying to prevent them with some measures, but it's not easy. It's difficult, they are humans too."" 
Towns and villages have been pounded by Russian jets and Syrian artillery since a renewed government assault last month, despite a deal agreed last September by the leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran to ease tensions. 
At least eight people, including five children, were killed on Wednesday in on Idlib town when the Syrian army launched missiles that struck a shelter for displaced families, witnesses and residents said.
In a report, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the city of Maarat al-Numan and the surrounding countryside ""are reportedly almost empty.""
""Displacement during winter is further exacerbating the vulnerability of those affected. Many who fled are in urgent need of humanitarian support, particularly shelter, food, health, non-food and winterization assistance,"" the OCHA said.
It said those displaced in December were fleeing toward Turkey, other parts of northern Idlib or toward other areas in northern Syria such as Afrin and al-Bab that Turkey seized in previous cross-border military operations.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, backed by Russia and Iran, has vowed to recapture Idlib. Turkey has for years backed Syrian rebels fighting to oust Assad. 
Erdogan said last month his country could not handle a fresh wave of migrants from Syria, warning Europe that it will feel the impact of such an influx if the bombing is not stopped.
Moscow and Damascus both deny allegations of indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they are fighting al Qaeda-inspired Islamist militants. However, their advances also pile pressure on Turkey, which has 12 military posts in the area.

On Tuesday, Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar said it was out of the question for Turkey to evacuate its observation posts in Idlib.

Trump accused Iran of orchestrating demonstrations at the U.S. embassy in Iraq on Tuesday and said Tehran would be held responsible. Iran has rejected the accusation.
""We are not leading the country to war, but we are not afraid of any war and we tell America to speak correctly with the Iranian nation.

ROME (Reuters) - Italy's ruling anti-establishment 5-Star Movement has expelled a senator from its ranks on disciplinary grounds, in a fresh blow to the government's already small majority in the upper house of parliament.
The expulsion of Gianluigi Paragone comes less than a month after three 5-Star senators quit the party to join the far-right League opposition group, and will leave the fractious coalition with just a 5-seat majority in the 321-seat Senate.
""I was expelled from a nothing party,"" Paragone wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), referring to the 5-Star's sharp loss of popularity since obtaining 33% of the vote in the 2018 election. Latest polls put it at around 18%.
Paragone, a former TV presenter, voted against the budget bill and was a fierce critic of the pact the 5-Star signed in September with its old enemy the center-left Democratic Party (PD) after its previous coalition with the League collapsed.
The expulsion further highlights the 5-Star's many problems, with party chief Luigi Di Maio facing criticism over his leadership and allegations from some dissidents of having betrayed the party's mission to overhaul the institutions.
Underscoring the divisions, party heavyweight Alessandro Di Battista leapt to the defense of Paragone, hailing him as a man who had defended 5-Star ideals. ""There has never been a time when I have not been in agreement with him,"" he said.
Italy's upper and lower houses have identical powers and a coalition needs a majority in both chambers to govern.
Despite the slender official majority in the Senate, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte can still rely on the backing of a small number of minority parties and unaligned senators who are not in the coalition but do not want an early election.
However, discontent within government ranks is growing over an array of issues, from justice reform to migrant rights, which could potentially tear the coalition apart.
In a bid to shore up the alliance, Conte has called for a meeting of the four coalition parties for Jan. 7 to try to thrash out a deal on some of the most contentious problems and put an end to the constant infighting.
Di Maio himself said on Wednesday that the ruling parties needed to draw up a new pact to establish policy priorities and to set out a timetable for their implementation."

Starmer has not yet said whether he will run for the leadership but is expected to launch a campaign in the coming weeks. [nL8N28U33Z]
A YouGov poll of party members published in the Guardian newspaper put support for Starmer on 61% in a run off against Rebecca Long-Bailey, the party's business spokeswoman who has strong ties with trade unions and the left wing of the party that backed Corbyn.
The poll put support for Long-Bailey on 39%, when respondents were given a choice between the two.
Starmer was the first choice in all regions of the country however his support waned among party members who voted to leave the European Union as opposed to those who wanted to remain.

The arrests take the total to about 7,000 since protests in the city escalated in June over a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extradition to mainland China, and will highlight the apparent absence of any progress towards ending the unrest.
The tension on Wednesday rose after some arrests were made in the Wan Chai bar district near a branch of global banking group HSBC (HK:0005), which has been the target of protester anger in recent weeks.
When scuffles broke out, large numbers of black-clad protesters rushed to the scene while other protesters formed human chains to pass them various supplies including bricks, forcing police to bring in their own reinforcements.
Police then asked organizers to call off the march early and crowds eventually dispersed as a water cannon truck and scores of police in riot gear patrolled the streets late into the evening.
Jimmy Sham, one of the leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front that organized the march, criticized the police decision to get the crowd to disperse at such short notice and said they had arrested protesters indiscriminately.
Police told media on Thursday they had arrested 420 people over the New Year holiday, most on New Year's Day, with 287 of them in one sweep for illegal assembly, including a 12-year old.
Police said they only made the arrests on Wednesday after they notified the march organizers and gave sufficient time for demonstrators to leave. Four officers were injured during the day, they said.
Organizers estimated that just over one million people took part in the New Year's Day march. Police put the number at 60,000 at its peak.
Over the months, the protests have evolved into a broad movement pushing for full democracy in the Chinese-ruled city and an independent investigation into complaints of police brutality. Police maintain they act with restraint.
Arrests were also made on New Year's Eve, when protesters briefly occupied a major road on the Kowloon peninsula as crowds of thousands counted down to midnight along the Victoria harbor.

Some protesters allege HSBC was complicit in action by the authorities against activists trying to raise money to support their campaign. The bank denies any involvement.

ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Five commercial fishermen were believed to have died after their crabbing vessel sank on New Year's Eve in the Gulf of Alaska, the U.S. Coast Guard said after ending a search and rescue operation amid high winds and heavy seas.
There were two survivors: crewmen who took refuge in a lifeboat and were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter. The two were taken to a hospital in Kodiak and were reported to be in stable condition, the Coast Guard said.
But after scouring a 1,400 square-mile (3,600 square km) area for 20 hours with helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft in the air and a cutter at sea, the Coast Guard called off its search for five missing crew on Wednesday night.
The wreck appeared to be the worst Alaska commercial fishing accident in nearly three years. In February of 2017, another crabbing vessel, the F/V Destination, sank in the Bering Sea, and all six aboard perished.
""The decision to suspend an active search and rescue case is never easy, and it's only made after careful consideration of a myriad of factors,"" said Rear Admiral Matthew Bell, commander of the Coast Guard's Alaska district.
""Our deepest condolences to the friends and families impacted by this tragedy,"" he said in a statement.

SEOUL (Reuters) - If North Korea returns to long-range missile launches or other weapons tests in 2020, its military could make valuable technical advances and gain experience alongside whatever political message is sent to Washington.
This week North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said that the world would soon see his country's ""new strategic weapon"" and that there was no longer reason for Pyongyang to be bound by a self-imposed moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests.
Kim's comments were the strongest indication that the North could resume some of the major tests it had suspended more than two years ago in the run-up to summit diplomacy with the United States.
After years of development, the weapons programs of North Korea are now advanced enough that it is hard to predict what it might test, said Jeffrey Lewis, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies (CNS).
U.S. military officials have said they see a long-range missile launch as one of the most likely possibilities.
Other experts said North Korea could launch a satellite, deploy the new ballistic missile submarine it says it is developing, or field new domestically produced ""transporter erector launcher"" (TEL) vehicles for its largest missiles.
""Any tests or drills they run will not only allow them to develop weapons that are faster, longer-range, or more reliable, but they also give the people operating these systems more exposure to and practice using and deploying the weapons,"" said Grace Liu, a research associate at CNS.
ROCKET ENGINES
In December, North Korea said it had carried out two important tests at its Sohae satellite launch site, aimed at developing ""another strategic weapon"" to counter nuclear threats from the United States.
Although North Korean state media did not say exactly what was tested or what the new weapon might be, officials in Washington and Seoul said it appeared likely the North had tested rocket engines, possibly for ICBMs.
""They might work toward developing better liquid-propellant engines or revisit older engines that they've had trouble with in the past,"" said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the U.S.-based Federation of American Scientists (FAS).
Analysts also speculated that North Korea could be developing better solid rocket motors (SRMs), which can offer some benefits like easier storage and transportation.
SRMs would also be important for North Korea's efforts to field an operational submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM), similar to what was test-fired from a submerged barge in October.
""Every missile they've flight-tested in 2019 to date has used a solid rocket motor and they're clearly becoming more adept at casting these motors in different diameters,"" Panda said. ""There are challenges associated with moving to ICBM-sized SRMs, but perhaps North Korea will demonstrate a breakthrough on that front.""
REENTRY VEHICLES AND NUCLEAR WARHEADS
A warhead launched by an ICBM needs a protective reentry vehicle to help it survive the fiery descent through the atmosphere to hit its target.
After the November 2017 launch of its largest ICBM to date, the Hwasong-15, state media said the test confirmed ""the safety of a warhead in the atmospheric re-entry environment.""
U.S. military officials later said North Korea had not demonstrated a survivable re-entry vehicle, though they did not discount the possibility.
During North Korea's last ICBM tests in 2017, its scientists may have gleaned useful data on how their reentry vehicles worked, Panda said.
However, the tests were conducted on a ""lofted trajectory"" high into space, potentially limiting the usefulness of some of the data, as the missile would take a much different trajectory during a war, he added.
A final card North Korea could play is an atmospheric test of a nuclear warhead, though many analysts say that is unlikely, as it could anger Pyongyang's backers in Beijing and Moscow.
But North Korea is believed to have continued producing material for nuclear weapons, and analysts said it is likely to continue stockpiling additional warheads while seeking to make them even smaller.
Korea National Defense University's Jeong Han-beom said North Korea could use computer simulations to develop smaller and lighter warheads without new nuclear tests.
EVADING MISSILE DEFENSES
In 2019, North Korea conducted several tests of new short-range missiles such as the KN-23, which experts said are designed to better evade missile defenses.
This year, North Korea could seek to develop multiple reentry vehicles for large-diameter missiles like the Hwasong-15, Panda said.
""Adding more nuclear warheads to a single missile can better assure them of an ability to penetrate American missile defense and, if they're worried that their warheads might have reliability issues, more warheads increases the odds that one warhead will successfully detonate,"" he said.
North Korea often seems more focused on making a splash with new weapons rather than pragmatically building more of the weapons it already has, said Markus Schiller, a missile expert based in Europe who focuses on the way North Korea has used outside help for its technology.
""This new stuff will again be something they have procured from somewhere else, or some publicity event that our political scientists will interpret as a huge leap toward new technology,"" he said.
Schiller said one technology that could generate the buzz North Korea is looking for could be a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), which the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance defines as weapons that travel faster than Mach 5 (3,800mph/6,174kmh) and have the capability to maneuver during the entire flight.

Gun battles have killed at least three people this week in the northern city bordering the Texas city of Laredo, media have said. It one of the Mexican cities where the U.S. government has sent asylum seekers to wait as their cases are decided.
""The consulate has received reports of multiple gunfights throughout the city of Nuevo Laredo,"" it said in a Twitter post. ""U.S. government personnel are advised to shelter in place.""
On Twitter, users purportedly from Laredo reported hearing gunfire ringing out from the neighboring Mexican city.
In a Twitter post late on Wednesday, Francisco Cabeza de Vaca, the governor of Tamaulipas, the state home to Nuevo Laredo, blamed the attacks on its Cartel of the Northeast.
""After the cowardly attacks on the part of the Cartel of the Northeast in Nuevo Laredo, the (government of Tamaulipas) will not let down its guard and will continue acting with strength against criminals,"" he wrote.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of people were evacuated in Indonesia's capital Jakarta on Thursday after flash floods and landslides in the area killed up to 21 people, with more heavy rain forecast, authorities said.
The flooding, among the deadliest in years, caused chaos in parts of Southeast Asia's biggest city with train lines blocked and power outages in some areas. Swathes of Jakarta and nearby towns were inundated after heavy rain fell on Dec. 31 and into the early hours of New Year's Day.
Social affairs ministry spokesman said in a message to Reuters that the death toll had now reached 21, while the disaster mitigation agency said it was 19. 
As of Thursday, over 62,000 people were evacuated in Jakarta alone, disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibowo said, twice as many as a day earlier.
Thousands of livestock were reported missing and thousands of houses damaged in neighboring province of Banten, media reported. 
Indonesia's President Joko Widodo told reporters on Thursday that evacuation and safety procedures should be prioritized, and called for more coordination between city administrations and the central government.
On his Twitter page, Widodo blamed delays in flood control infrastructure projects for the flooding. He said some projects have been delayed since 2017 due to land acquisition problems.
Some of the victims had drowned, while others were killed in landslides. Four were electrocuted, while three died of hypothermia.
Indonesia's Cabinet Secretary said in a statement, citing the geophysics agency, that extreme weather may continue across Indonesia until Jan. 7 and warned people to remain on alert for further flooding or landslides.
Dwikorita Karnawati, head of the geophysics agency, told reporters separately that heavy rainfall may continue until mid February.
Umar Dani, 52, and his family were evacuated overnight from his home in East Jakarta on a rubber boat after water levels rose up to his neck.
""It has not flooded for so long here. We didn't have the chance to bring anything,"" he said. ""I have to live on the streets now."" 
Television footage on Thursday showed rescuers in the nearby city of Tangerang evacuating residents, guiding them across a strong current by holding on to a rope.
Jakarta police on their Twitter account warned that a number of major streets across the capital were not yet passable, accompanied by a video showing a postal truck being stuck in the middle of a road.
Jakarta and its surroundings are home to more than 30 million people. More than 50 people died in one of the capital’s deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the center of the city was inundated after canals overflowed. 

The government announced last year that it is relocating the capital to East Kalimantan province on Borneo, though the planning ministry pledged that the government will invest $40 billion in modernizing Jakarta.

BATEMANS BAY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of holiday makers raced to evacuate popular seaside towns on Australia's east coast on Wednesday, fleeing ahead of advancing bushfires, as military ships and helicopters began rescuing thousands more trapped by the blazes.
Fueled by searing temperatures and high winds, more than 200 fires are now burning across the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, threatening several towns.
Long queues formed outside supermarkets and petrol stations near high-danger areas and shelves were emptied of staples like bread and milk, as residents and tourists sought supplies to either bunker down or escape.
More than 50,000 people were without power and some towns had no access to drinking water, after catastrophic fires ripped through the region over the past few days, sending the sky blood red and destroying towns.
Authorities urged a mass exodus from several towns on Australia's southeast coast, an area hugely popular in the current summer peak holiday season, warning that extreme heat forecast for the weekend will further stoke raging fires.
""The priority today is fighting fires and evacuating, getting people to safety,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Sydney. ""There are parts of both Victoria and New South Wales which have been completely devastated, with a loss of power and communications.""
-- Eight people have been killed by wildfires in the eastern states of New South Wales and Victoria since Monday, and 18 are still missing, officials said on Thursday.
-- A naval ship arrived on Thursday at the southeastern coastal town of Mallacoota, where 4,000 residents and visitors have been stranded on the beach since Monday night. Up to 800 people are expected to be evacuated on the first trip, state Premier Daniel Andrews said. The HMAS Choules is expected to make two or three voyages over coming days, state authorities said.
-- ""It is hell on earth. It is the worst anybody's ever seen,"" said Michelle Roberts, owner of the Croajingolong Cafe in Mallacoota, told Reuters by telephone from her cafe in Mallacoota. Roberts hoped to get her 18-year-old daughter out on the ship to get away from the spot fires and thick smoke that continue to engulf the town. 
-- Five military helicopters were en-route to the south coast to back up firefighters and bring in supplies like water and diesel, the Australian Defence Force said on Thursday. The aircraft will also be used to evacuate injured, elderly and young people.
-- Traffic on the main highway out of Batemans Bay on the NSW coast was bumper to bumper after authorities called for the town to be evacuated. Residents of the town reported was no fuel, power or phone service, while supermarket shelves were stripped bare of staples. ""Everyone's just on edge,"" local resident Shane Flanagan told Reuters.
-- The New South Wales state government declared a state of emergency, beginning on Friday, giving authorities the power to forcibly evacuate people and take control of services. The state's Kosciuszko National Park, home to the Snowy Mountains, was closed with visitors ordered to leave due to extreme fire danger. 
-- Prime Minister Scott Morrison urged those waiting for help and those stuck in traffic jams ""to be patient ... help will arrive.""
-- Dairies in New South Wales that had lost power were being forced to dump milk. ""That is the tragedy of what is occurring as a result of these disasters,"" Morrison said.
-- Temperatures are forecast to soar above 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit) along the south coast on Saturday, bringing the prospect of renewed firefronts to add to the around 200 current blazes. ""It is going to be a very dangerous day. It's going to be a very difficult day,"" NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said 
-- PM Morrison said the fires will burn for ""many, many months ... unlike a flood, where the water will recede, in a fire like this, it goes on and it will continue to go on ... until we can get some decent rain.""
-- PM Morrison, forced to defend his government's limited action on climate change, blamed a three-year drought and lack of hazard reduction for the unprecedented extent and duration of this year's bushfires.
-- Bushfires so far this season have razed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) of bushland and destroyed more than 1,000 homes, including 381 homes destroyed on the south coast just this week.

In a statement, the ministry said it had sent a team to rescue the 13 people aboard the Black Hawk helicopter, who included Taiwan's chief of general staff, Air Force General Shen Yi-ming, and several survivors had been found. 
""Some crew are still trapped inside, while some have come out,"" a military spokesman told a news conference broadcast live on television, although further details would not be available until troops reached the area of the crash. 
The helicopter made the emergency landing in New Taipei City after aviation authorities lost contact with it at 8:22 a.m., the ministry said. 
The incident comes a week before democratic Taiwan holds presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11.
President Tsai Ing-wen, who is seeking re-election, canceled election campaign activities scheduled for Thursday, and urged authorities to make every effort for the rescue. 
The United States, which has no diplomatic ties with Taiwan but is its strongest international backer and main arms supplier, sold it 60 UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters in 2010.
It was not immediately clear whether the helicopter involved in Thursday's incident was one of these.
China, which claims Taiwan as its territory to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary, regularly calls the island the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States. 
Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

1426,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 11:33PM ET</span>",Rock-throwing Iraqi militias quit U.S. Embassy after protests,"By Ahmed Aboulenein
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Supporters of Iranian-backed Iraqi paramilitary groups who stormed the U.S. Embassy's perimeter and hurled rocks in two days of protests withdrew on Wednesday after Washington dispatched extra troops and threatened reprisals against Tehran.
The demonstrators, angry at U.S. air strikes against the Tehran-backed Kataib Hezbollah group in which at least 25 people were killed, threw stones at the building while U.S. forces stationed on the rooftops fired tear gas to disperse them.
By mid-afternoon, most appeared to have obeyed a call to withdraw, issued by the Popular Mobilization Forces (PMF) umbrella group of mainly Shi'ite militia, which said the demonstrators' message had been heard.
Young men used palm tree branches to sweep the street in front of the embassy compound. Others packed up equipment and vans arrived to take people away. Some left to set up a protest camp in front of a nearby hotel.
Iraq's military said all protesters had left by the evening.
The protests marked a new turn in the shadow war between Washington and Tehran playing out across the Middle East. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces a re-election campaign in 2020, accused Iran of orchestrating the violence. He threatened on Tuesday to retaliate against Iran but said later he did not want war. 
Iran, under severe economic duress from punishing U.S. sanctions put in place by Trump, denied responsibility.
The unrest followed U.S. air raids on Sunday against Kataib Hezbollah bases in retaliation for missile attacks that killed a U.S. contractor in northern Iraq last week. 
On Tuesday, crowds chanted: 'Death to America!', lit fires, and smashed surveillance cameras. They breached an outer perimeter of the embassy but did not enter the main compound.
BIGGEST U.S. EMBASSY
The huge embassy, built along the banks of the Tigris River in central Baghdad's fortified ""green zone"" during the American occupation following the 2003 invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein, is the biggest U.S. diplomatic mission in the world.
Washington said its diplomats were safe and it was rushing hundreds of extra troops to the region.
The State Department said on Wednesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo decided to postpone his upcoming trip to Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Cyprus to remain in Washington and monitor the situation in Iraq. [L1N29606E]
Pompeo spoke on Wednesday with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the State Department said.
Pompeo said on Twitter that Abdul Mahdi had agreed that Iraq ""would continue to uphold its responsibility to keep U.S. personnel secure and would move the Iran-backed attackers away from @USEmbBaghdad.""
Pompeo wrote on Twitter he thanked the emir in the call ""for Qatar’s solidarity in the face of Iran’s malign regional influence,"" including the attack on the embassy in Baghdad.
The embassy said all public consular operations were suspended and all future appointments canceled.
The anti-American action came after months of protests in Iraq against the government and the Iran-backed militias that support it. Many Iraqis complain their country has become a battlefield for a proxy war for influence between Washington and Tehran, and that their leaders are too beholden to outside powers.
Iraq's government has long faced frictions in its close relations with the two foes. Trump spoke to Abdul Mahdi on Tuesday and demanded Iraq protect the embassy.
Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday condemned the U.S. attacks. Iran summoned a Swiss envoy, who represents U.S. interests in Tehran, to complain about what it described as ""warmongering"" words from Washington.
U.S. officials said 750 extra troops would initially be based out of Kuwait and as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in coming days.
More than 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq supporting local forces. The air strikes have galvanized calls inside Iraq to expel them.
Many in the crowd outside the embassy said ending Washington's presence in Iraq was their main goal.
'DEVIL'S DEN'
Despite decades of enmity between Iran and the United States, Iran-backed militias and U.S. forces found themselves on the same side during Iraq's 2014-2017 war against Islamic State fighters, with both powers helping the government recapture territory from militants who had overrun a third of Iraq.
Since then, U.S. troops have yet to leave, while the Iran-backed militias have been incorporated into the security forces. 
Abdul Mahdi, who has announced plans to step down in the face of anti-government protests in which more than 450 people were killed, is backed by Iran and its allies.
The militia may have decided to pull back from the embassy to avoid making him look weak or to avert clashes with government forces.
Overnight, demonstrators pitched tents and camped outside the embassy walls, then brought food, cooking equipment and mattresses during the morning, indicating plans to stay before the withdrawal call.

""Our sit-in is eternal, until this devil's den is closed off forever, but don't give anyone an excuse to make your protest violent. Don't clash with security,"" one protest leader told the crowd from a stage erected at the embassy before the departure.

1427,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 06:19PM ET</span>",Drug lord 'El Chapo' once held as much power as Mexican president -Lopez Obrador,"MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador declared an end to the days of collusion between crime and government, saying in a holiday address there was a time when drug lord Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman was as powerful as the country's president.
Lopez Obrador, who took office in December 2018, rose to power with pledges to root out corruption in Mexico. He hailed his progress toward that goal in a speech on New Year's Eve at the Palenque ruins in southern Mexico.
""There was a time when Guzman Loera was as powerful, or had the influence, that the president had at that time,"" said Lopez Obrador. ""That made it hard to punish those who had committed crimes. That is now history.""
Last month, Genaro Garcia Luna, a former Mexican government official responsible for public security, was charged in the United States with accepting millions of dollars in bribes from the Sinaloa drug cartel once run by Guzman.
Lopez Obrador has said Mexico will not investigate former President Felipe Calderon, who led the country at the time. But he added the Mexican government would cooperate with U.S. authorities in the probe of Garcia Luna, who moved to the United States in 2012.
Guzman was sentenced last year to life in prison without parole and moved to a high-security facility in Colorado after being convicted in a U.S. court of smuggling tons of drugs to the United States over a colorful, decades-long career..
He had become almost legendary for escaping from Mexican high-security jails twice and avoiding massive manhunts, while cultivating a Robin Hood image among the poor in Sinaloa.
Lopez Obrador acknowledged in his speech on Tuesday that his government had work to do, particularly in curbing rampant violence, but described his anti-corruption drive as a point of pride.
""We are purifying public life so there is moral authority,"" Lopez Obrador said."

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservative leader Sebastian Kurz struck a coalition deal on Wednesday with the Greens to ensure his return to power and bring the left-wing party into government for the first time, three months after Kurz won a parliamentary election.
The deal marks a swing left for Kurz, whose last coalition was with the far-right Freedom Party. It also means Austria will join fellow European Union member states Sweden and Finland in having the Greens in government, albeit in a junior role, at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change.
After a final round of coalition talks on New Year's Day and two days of leaks of new Cabinet members' names, Kurz and his Greens counterpart said they had struck a deal, as widely expected. They held off, however, on providing details of their plans - those will be presented to the public on Thursday.
""We have reached an agreement,"" Kurz told reporters standing next to Greens leader Werner Kogler. ""We succeeded in uniting the best of both worlds,"" he added.
The two will become chancellor and vice chancellor of the new government, and the Greens will control just four of 15 ministries, roughly reflecting their performance in the Sept. 29 election. Kurz's People's Party (OVP) won with 37.5% of the vote while the Greens came in fourth with 13.9%.
""It is possible to reduce the tax burden and to ecologize the tax system,"" Kurz said, referring to core campaign pledges of each party and hinting at the deal's contents. The Greens said they wanted an investment package in environmental measures and to make products that damage the environment more expensive.
COMPROMISE
For the Greens, many of whose supporters viscerally oppose Kurz and his trademark hard line on immigration, going into government with Kurz was a trade-off between the compromises of power politics and the chance to shape policy after campaigning for rapid action on climate change.
Whether their coalition can hold for five years will depend on whether the Greens can show they have obtained concrete results in at least some key areas. They will control a sprawling ministry covering the environment, transport, infrastructure and energy, officials say.
""On climate change we have possibly agreed on more than we could have imagined beforehand,"" Kogler said. ""Austria should become a European and international leader on climate change issues. More on that tomorrow.""
For Kurz, regaining the reins of power is also a chance to soften his image after 17 months in coalition with a far right that shared his views on immigration but was also prone to anti-Semitic and xenophobic scandals. Immigration is likely to remain a point of friction with the left-wing Greens.
Allying with the Greens, who campaigned on ""clean environment, clean politics"", is also a chance to turn the page on his association with the Freedom Party (FPO). Their coalition collapsed in May after FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache was caught in a video sting offering to fix state contracts.

Kurz's party will control the finance, interior, defense and foreign ministries, with Kurz appointing party loyalists such as Vienna OVP chief Gernot Bluemel as finance minister and OVP Chairman Karl Nehammer as interior minister. Neither has a wealth of experience related to their future portfolio.

UNITED NATIONS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is ""deeply concerned"" that North Korea has indicated it could resume nuclear and missile tests, a U.N. spokesman said on Wednesday. 
""The Secretary-General very much hopes that the tests will not resume, in line with relevant Security Council resolutions. Non-proliferation remains a fundamental pillar of global nuclear security and must be preserved,"" spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said this week that there were no longer grounds for Pyongyang to be bound by a self-declared moratorium on intercontinental ballistic missile and nuclear bomb testing and that a ""new strategic weapon"" would be introduced in the near future. 
""Diplomatic engagement is the only pathway to sustainable peace,"" Dujarric also said.
U.S. President Donald Trump - who in 2018 became the first American leader to meet with a North Korean leader - said after Kim's remarks that the leader had signed a denuclearization contract and Trump thought Kim was a ""man of his word.""
Trump has repeatedly pointed to the moratorium, in place since 2017, as a sign that his policy of engagement with North Korea was working.
Kim has complained the United States had continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopted cutting-edge weapons and imposed sanctions while making ""gangster-like demands.""
Last month, Pyongyang warned Washington of a possible ""Christmas gift"" after Kim gave the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over his country's nuclear arsenal.
North Korea experts said that Kim's remarks - made during an hours-long plenum speech - were likely directed at his party, military, and government officials in North Korea, preparing the country for another period of economic hardship as it prepares for a long stalemate with the United States.
""The main points, almost certainly, were not headlines about weapons development or a possible resumption of testing,"" said Robert Carlin, a North Korea expert at the Stimson Center think tank in Washington.

""It means preparing the economy and the people for a long-term confrontation with the U.S.,"" he said, adding that the message was ""no longer working for relief of sanctions but girding to live under them.""

1431,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 02:21PM ET</span>",Ex-Guinea Bissau PM Embalo wins presidency; opponent disputes vote,"By Alberto Dabo
BISSAU (Reuters) - Former prime minister and ex-army general Umaro Cissoko Embalo has won Guinea-Bissau's presidential vote, the electoral commission said on Wednesday, but his opponent complained of fraud and vowed to contest the result in court.
Embalo, 47, won with 54% of Sunday's vote, the commission said, versus 46% for another ex-prime minister and ruling party candidate Domingos Simoes Pereira in the poll to succeed incumbent President Jose Mario Vaz.
Vaz's tenure was marred by political infighting, an ill-functioning parliament and corruption. 
If Pereira's challenge fails, Embalo, who served as prime minister under Vaz from 2016-18, faces the difficult task of overcoming a long-running political impasse and modernizing the West African nation of 1.6 million people. 
Guinea Bissau has seen nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974.
""I call for union, reconciliation and concord for a peaceful life in Guinea Bissau,"" Embalo told a press conference on Wednesday in which he also promised to revive the education and energy sectors. ""We must believe in ourselves and put ourselves to work to create wealth and develop the country.""
However, Pereira's complaint looks set to extend the political chaos that has dogged the tiny ocean-side country in recent years and made voters weary of the political class.
The 56-year-old, who easily won a November first round, told supporters that in some polling stations votes surpassed the number of enrolled voters and he would file a complaint to the Supreme Court. 
""There has been an infringement of the electoral truth and the most legitimate rights of the people of Guinea Bissau,"" he said. 
Embalo's candidacy gained support from the main contenders who failed to reach the run-off, including Vaz. 
The announcement of his victory sparked celebrations in the capital Bissau, which has remained calm and optimistic during an election many hoped would draw a line under weeks of turmoil including violent protests, an alleged coup attempt and the emergence of two competing prime ministers.
""We voted for Embalo for change,"" said Kady Gassama, a 38-year-old cleaner. ""We voted to bring the country out of the economic, political and social crisis."" 
The next president also faces widespread poverty and an unstable political system in which the majority party appoints the government but the president can dismiss it.
There have been seven prime ministers since Vaz took over in 2014 and instability has hurt the economy, which depends heavily on volatile prices for cashew nuts, the main income source for more than two thirds of households.

Traffickers also exploit Guinea-Bissau's unpoliced waters and maze of picturesque forested islands to ship South American cocaine destined for Europe.

1432,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 02:21PM ET</span>",Israel's Netanyahu says he will seek immunity in graft cases,"By Jeffrey Heller
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday he would ask parliament to protect him from prosecution in the three graft cases he faces, a politically-risky move that could delay criminal proceedings against him for months.
Netanyahu was indicted in November on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust over allegations he granted state favors worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Israeli media barons in return for gifts and favorable coverage.
He denies any wrongdoing, saying he is the victim of a witch hunt by the media and left to oust a popular right-wing leader. 
A trial cannot get under way once an immunity request is made, and Netanyahu announced the move in a speech on live television just four hours before a deadline for an application was to expire.
Netanyahu said in his address that the charges against him were politically motivated and he was entitled to parliament's protection.
""In a democracy, only the people decide who will lead them,"" said Netanyahu, who has been in power consecutively for the past decade and has likened the indictment against him to an attempted coup. 
Under Israel law, a legislator seeking immunity can do so on numerous grounds that include an argument that the prosecution is not acting in good faith.
Had Netanyahu not filed the request by Wednesday's deadline, the indictment against him could have been submitted to a court as early as Sunday, setting proceedings in motion.
Amid deep political deadlock, parliament seems unlikely to decide the issue before Israel's March 2 election. Netanyahu will need the support of 61 of its 120 legislators for immunity to be granted, the same majority that eluded him in attempts to form a government after national ballots in April and September.
If immunity is ultimately granted - entitling Netanyahu to avoid standing trial as long as he is a member of parliament - - Israel's Supreme Court is empowered to review the decision and strike it down.
Netanyahu's immunity request carried political risks, adding more ammunition to challengers who seek to portray him as an autocratic leader who sees himself as above the rule of law and who represents a danger to Israel's democratic and judicial foundations.
Responding to Netanyahu's speech, his main rival, Benny Gantz, a former armed forces chief who heads the centrist Blue and White party, said the prime minister was ""jeopardizing the civic principle upon which we were all educated - that everyone is equal before the law"".

Recent opinion polls have shown neither Blue and White nor Netanyahu's Likud party are within easy reach of a governing bloc in parliament in an election now two months away.

The new government, which Jemli said last month would be formed of political independents, will be put to parliament on Thursday, where it must win majority support before taking office. 
It comes nearly three months after an election that returned a deeply fractured parliament in which no party took more than a quarter of the seats, leading to hard negotiations to build a coalition that could pass a confidence vote. 
Jemli said at a news conference that his government would focus on the economy, a subject that has bedevilled all administrations in Tunisia since its 2011 revolution that introduced democracy.
The outgoing government has made painful cuts to reduce the public deficit, but the International Monetary Fund and other foreign lenders are seeking more fiscal reforms. 
Anger at public services that are seen as worse than under Tunisia's pre-revolution autocrat Zine El-Abidine Ben Ali, who died in exile in September, has undermined the trust of some Tunisians in its political establishment. 
The moderate Islamist Ennahda party nominated Jemli to form a government after it came first in the Oct. 6 election, winning 52 of the 218 seats. 
The president, an independent who won his own election a week later, then formally requested Jemli to build a coalition able to command a majority in parliament. 
Jemli struggled to bring rival parties together during the coalition talks, but said on Wednesday that all parties would support the new government ""one way or another"", without giving specifics. 

Saied, who was presented by supporters during the presidential election as a man of great personal integrity, has urged action against state corruption but he has little direct control over policy except in matters of foreign affairs and security.

Five children were among those killed in the strike on a disused school in the town of Sarmin in Idlib province, two medics said, adding over 16 people were injured.
The school building was being used by families fleeing a Russian-backed bombing campaign in Idlib, the last opposition bastion in the northwest.
Sarmin is among towns and villages that have been pounded relentlessly by Russian jets and Syrian artillery since a renewed government assault last month, despite a deal agreed last September by leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran to ease tensions.
Ground-to-ground missiles fired by the Syrian army killed at least 11 children at a camp in Qah village in Idlib on November 20, according to medics and witnesses.
The United Nations last week said 235,000 civilians had fled their homes in just two weeks between Dec 12 and 25.
The Russian-led campaign that started in April 2019 had already forced at least 500,000 people to leave for areas closer to the border with Turkey, which Russian jets rarely hit.
Rescue services and witnesses say the bombing campaign that has killed several thousand civilians has left many towns in ruins and knocked out dozens of medical centers.
U.S. President Donald Trump spoke out last week against the ""carnage"" in Idlib. Moscow and Damascus deny claims of indiscriminate bombing of civilians, saying say they are fighting jihadist militants."

An STC spokesman told Reuters the STC negotiating team had withdrawn from the joint committees working to implement the deal, known as the Riyadh agreement.
It was not clear what impact this suspension would have on the future of the agreement, which Saudi Arabia had hailed as a step towards a wider political solution to a conflict which has raged since 2015.
A member of the STC's presidential council, Salim al-Awlaqi, said in announcing the move on Twitter that it was in protest against violence in Shabwa province it blamed on forces loyal to the Islah party.
The STC and its backers the United Arab Emirates oppose the Islamist Islah party, which is the backbone of the government of internationally recognized President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
Recent violence in Shabwa is part of an ongoing struggle for influence between forces loyal to Hadi and southern forces. The separatists accuse Hadi's government of mismanagement and corruption and took over the interim capital Aden in August, prompting the talks which led to the Riyadh agreement.
The Aden standoff had opened a new front in the almost five-year war and fractured a Saudi-led coalition battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement that ousted Hadi's government from the capital, Sanaa, in the north in late 2014.
Implementation of the November pact has been slow and a number of deadlines missed, although it has enabled the return of the prime minister for the internationally recognized government to Aden."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - At least 24 people were confirmed killed after a camp for internally displaced people was attacked in Sudan's West Darfur, an international peacekeeping official said on Wednesday, as top officials arrived to try to calm the violence.
Krinding Camp, just east of state capital el-Geneina, was raided on Dec. 29-30 following a dispute between Arab and African ethnic groups, said Ashraf Eissa, a spokesman for the joint African Union-United Nations peacekeeping mission in Darfur, UNAMID. [nL8N2943KC]
""The Arab tribesman's people came to the IDP camp and started shooting and killing and burning,"" he said.
""Then relatives went to the hospital and threatened hospital staff at gunpoint and destroyed the blood bank ... and when a government of Sudan policeman tried to intervene he was shot and killed.""
Brokering lasting peace in Darfur and other parts of Sudan is one of the main challenges facing military and civilian authorities sharing power following the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir last April.
Conflict broke out in Darfur in 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against Khartoum. Up to 300,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced, including more than 180,000 displaced in West Darfur, according to U.N. estimates.
West Darfur has been generally calm since 2010 though tensions between the Masalit and Arab tribes resurfaced in 2017 leading to occasional, smaller scale skirmishes, Eissa said.
On Wednesday, senior officials including sovereign council member General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo and Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok arrived in el-Geneina and were briefed on the security situation, the council said in a statement.
At least 17 people were wounded in the violence around el-Geneina, though casualty figures were initial estimates and could rise, Eissa said. Many people from the camp fled to el-Geneina or nearby mountains.
After exchanges of fire across al-Geneina on Tuesday, he said the situation remained very tense.
A local journalist said the violence had spread to the surrounding area, at least 10 villages had been burned, and some people were trying to flee across the border into Chad. A statement from the non-Arab Masalit ethnic group put the number of dead at more than 50, but the figure could not be independently confirmed.
UNAMID, which has been gradually drawing down its presence in Darfur, withdrew from el-Geneina in May 2019. On the day it was meant to hand over its headquarters in the city to the government, the camp was raided and gutted by security forces and civilians.
UNAMID does not have a mandate to conduct peacekeeping operations in el-Geneina, though its mandate could be extended to the area ""in extremis"", Eissa said.
On Dec. 27 hundreds of men in uniform and civilians raided and looted another former UNAMID camp in Nyala in South Darfur, which had been handed over to the government in November, UNAMID said in a statement.

1437,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",Six Saudi prisoners freed by Yemen's Houthis return home,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Six Saudi Arabian prisoners held in Yemen by the Iran-aligned Houthi group returned home on Wednesday, in a move welcomed by the United Nations as it pushes for political negotiations to end almost five years of war.
Facilitated by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) the six men arrived in Riyadh, the spokesman for a Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis in Yemen said in a statement.
He said the exchange had been part of the Stockholm agreement, a U.N.-mediated deal reached last December in a breakthrough in peace efforts. The agreement contained a prisoner exchange which has been slowly and only partially implemented in small batches throughout the year.
""We await reciprocal steps to be taken by the enemy forces for the release of our prisoners,"" the head of the Houthis' prisoner affairs file said in comments carried by al-Masirah TV.
In late November dozens of Houthi prisoners released by Saudi Arabia returned to Yemen's Houthi-held capital Sanaa. 
""I urge the parties to continue the momentum of confidence-building until all detainees are reunited with their loved ones,"" United Nations Yemen envoy Martin Griffiths said on Twitter.
Yemen has been mired in almost five years of conflict since the Houthi movement ousted the internationally-recognized government of President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power in Sanaa in late 2014, prompting intervention in 2015 by a Saudi-led military coalition in a bid to restore his government.
The United Nations has been trying to re-launch political negotiations to end the war, which has killed tens of thousands of people and pushed millions to the brink of famine.
Meanwhile, Riyadh has been holding informal talks with the Houthis since late September about a wider ceasefire, sources familiar with the discussions have said, as it seeks to exit an unpopular war after its main coalition partner the United Arab Emirates withdrew troops earlier in 2019.

1438,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 10:19AM ET</span>",Tear gas fired at Hong Kong New Year's protests,"By Mari Saito and Marius Zaharia
HONG KONG (Reuters) - A march drawing tens of thousands of anti-government protesters in Hong Kong on New Year's Day spiraled into chaotic scenes as police fired several rounds of tear gas and water cannon at crowds including families before halting the event.
The violence broke out during the largely peaceful march as masses of citizens pressed authorities for further concessions in the Chinese-ruled city.
In the Wanchai bar district, some protesters had spray-painted graffiti and smashed cash machines in an HSBC bank branch when riot police moved in, pepper-spraying crowds in a tense face-off. Tear gas was then fired into the crowds, making some children cry.
The protesters, some with gas masks and clad in black, regrouped and formed their own lines as police blocked roads to prevent large crowds from completing the march as night fell.
Organizers estimated just over one million people took part, but police said 60,000 protesters attended at the march's peak
The atmosphere grew tense in several districts on Hong Kong island, as hundreds of protesters dug in, forming road blocks, setting fires and throwing a few petrol bombs. Human chains formed down roads to help ferry supplies to people on the front lines, including umbrellas and bricks.
Protesters have directed their ire at global banking group HSBC alleging a link between the arrest of four members of a group that raised funds to support the protesters and an earlier closure of an HSBC account linked to the group. HSBC denies any connection.
A bronze lion at the bank's headquarters was daubed with red paint and scorched by a fire.
A bank spokesman said: ""We strongly condemn the acts of vandalism and damage directed at our premises repeatedly in the last few days. We believe these are unjustified.""
Earlier in the day, under grey clouds, citizens young and old, many dressed in black and some masked, carried signs such as ""Freedom is not free"" before setting off.
""It's hard to utter 'Happy New Year' because Hong Kong people are not happy,"" said a man named Tung, who was walking with his two-year-old son, mother and niece.
""Unless the five demands are achieved, and police are held accountable for their brutality, then we can't have a real happy new year,"" he added.
DEMANDS
He was referring to the push for concessions from the government including full democracy, an amnesty for the more than 6,500 people arrested so far, and a powerful, independent investigation into police actions.
Along the route, a number of newly elected pro-democracy district politicians mingled with the crowds on their first day in office, some helping collect donations to assist the movement. Youths also carried ""Hong Kong Independence"" flags and chanted that splitting the city from Chinese rule was the ""only way out"". 
""The government has already started the oppression before the New Year began ... whoever is being oppressed, we will stand with them,"" said Jimmy Sham, one of the leaders of the Civil Human Rights Front that organized the march. The organizers also condemned the police decision to cancel the rally. 
Thousands of Hong Kong revelers had earlier welcomed in 2020 on neon-lit promenades along Victoria Harbour, chanting the movement's signature slogan - ""Liberate Hong Kong. Revolution of our Time"" - for the final seconds before clocks struck midnight.
China's President Xi Jinping said in a New Year's speech that Beijing will ""resolutely safeguard the prosperity and stability"" of Hong Kong under the so-called ""one country, two systems"" framework.
Many people in Hong Kong are angered by Beijing's tight grip on the city which was promised a high degree of autonomy under this framework when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
Beijing denies interference and blames the West for fomenting the unrest.
A group of 40 parliamentarians and dignitaries from 18 countries had written an open letter to Hong Kong's leader Carrie Lam on New Year's Eve, urging her to ""seek genuine ways forward out of this crisis by addressing the grievances of Hong Kong people."" 
The protest movement is supported by 59% of the city's residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute. 

Demonstrations have grown increasingly violent in recent months, at times paralyzing the Asian financial center.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - As wounded men screaming for their mothers were brought into a Mogadishu hospital after a huge truck bomb on Saturday, doctors fought to save eight month-old Mohammed Hassan, whose mother was already dead.
The baby had lost too much blood to cry, but on Tuesday, hooked up to oxygen tubes and IV and swathed in bandages - he flexed his uninjured hand, sending a waterfall of tears coursing down the cheeks of his father, Somali farmer Abdi Abukar Hassan.
""Oh thank God,"" Hassan exclaimed as his son moved for the first time after his right arm was shredded and his back torn by shrapnel in the bombing, which killed at least 90 people and wounded dozens at a bustling checkpoint. ""Look, he is alive now, please let’s recite the Koran over him!""
Somalia’s al-Qaeda-linked Islamist al Shabaab insurgency claimed the bombing, saying it was directed at Turkish engineers and their government-provided security detail. In a rare admission, the group acknowledged civilian casualties but said they had been ""unintentional"".
Al Shabaab wants to overthrow the weak, U.N.-backed government and impose a strict version of Islamic law. The conflict is complicated by layers of clan loyalties and rivalries between regional powers like Qatar and Turkey, which are jostling for power in the Horn of Africa nation.
On Wednesday, Hassan thanked the Turkish-run Erdogan Hospital for its free treatment, saying nurses had told him the oxygen and intravenous tubes would be removed from his baby and he may open his eyes later in the day.
Two Turkish nationals were killed in the explosion, which took place as Turkish engineers visited a construction site near the checkpoint.
Mohamed's grandmother had left her tin shack to help the baby and his mother onto a minibus when the bomb went off. Mohamed’s mother was killed instantly.
    His grandmother, wounded in the legs, staggered toward the family's home, clutching him and screaming for help before she collapsed.
A neighbor ran out, shoeless, and tried, unsuccessfully, to flag down motorbike taxis fleeing the scene before catching a minibus to the hospital, cradling the baby’s bleeding arm attached by only a thin piece of skin. Hassan’s aunt called him to break the news.
""My wife, Naimo Mohamud Jeylani, she was very kind. May God rest her soul and take her to paradise,” said Hassan, as his six-year-old daughter Khadija and four-year-old Sadaq leaned silently against their father. “Thank God, my son is now moving. I am happy he is alive. Yesterday, I thought he was dead.’""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis apologized on Wednesday for having angrily slapped a woman's arm when she had grabbed hold of his hand and yanked him towards her, saying he had lost his patience and set a ""bad example"".
His unusual apology came after he used his first homily of the new year to denounce violence against women, which he compared to profaning God.
Pope Francis, 83, had a sharp encounter with a woman on Tuesday evening during a walkabout in St. Peters Square (NYSE:SQ). 
The pilgrim, who has not been identified, unexpectedly seized his hand and pulled him towards her, causing him evident alarm. A clearly disgruntled Francis wrenched himself free by slapping down at her arm.
""So many times we lose patience, even me, and I apologize for yesterday's bad example,"" the pope told thousands of pilgrims gathered in St. Peter's Square on Wednesday at the end of the traditional New Year Mass.
He had used the service to issue a forthright condemnation of the abuse of women in modern society.
""All violence inflicted on women is a desecration of God,"" he told a packed St. Peter's Basilica.
""How often is a woman's body sacrificed on the profane altar of advertising, profit, pornography,"" he said, adding that the female body ""must be freed from consumerism, it must be respected and honored"".
Despite creating life, women ""are continually offended, beaten, raped, forced into prostitution"" and made to have abortions, he said. ""We can understand our level of humanity by the way we treat a woman's body,"" he told the congregation.
During his homily, Francis also addressed another theme close to his heart, immigration, saying women who moved abroad to provide for their children should be honored, not scorned.
""Today even motherhood is humiliated, because the only growth that interests us is economic growth,"" he said.
""There are mothers, who risk perilous journeys to desperately try to give the fruit of the womb a better future and are judged to be redundant by people whose bellies are full of things, but whose hearts are empty of love.""
The leader of the Roman Catholic Church, which allows only unmarried men to be ordained as priests, also said women ""must be fully involved in decision-making processes"".

The pope said last April the Church had to acknowledge a history of male domination and sexual abuse of women. A month later, he appointed for the first time four women to an important Vatican department that prepares the major meetings of world bishops.

1441,By Reuters,"<span>Jan 01, 2020 07:40AM ET</span>",Indonesia rejects China's claims over South China Sea,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia said on Wednesday it rejected China's claims over a disputed part of the South China Sea as ""having no legal basis"", after two days earlier protesting to Beijing over the presence of a Chinese coastguard vessel in its territorial waters.
The boat trespassed into Indonesia's exclusive economic zone off the coast of the northern islands of Natuna, leading Indonesians officials to issue a ""strong protest"" and summon the Chinese ambassador in Jakarta.
Speaking in Beijing on Tuesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang had said China had sovereignty over the Spratly Islands and their waters and that both China and Indonesia have ""normal"" fishing activities there. 
In a sharp rebuke, Indonesia's foreign ministry called in a statement on Wednesday for China to explain the ""legal basis and clear borders"" regarding its claims on the exclusive economic zone, as based on the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).
""China's claims to the exclusive economic zone on the grounds that its fishermen have long been active there... have no legal basis and have never been recognized by the UNCLOS 1982,"" the foreign ministry said. 
Jakarta also noted that the argument had been refuted during China's legal defeat against the Philippines in 2016 over disputed South China claims at Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.
Indonesia has no claims over the Spratly Islands, which lie to the northeast of the Natuna Islands. 
The foreign ministry reiterated its stance that the country is a non-claimant state in the South China Sea and that it has no overlapping jurisdiction with China. 
However, Jakarta has repeatedly clashed with China over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands, detaining Chinese fishermen and expanding its military presence in the area. 
China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route which is believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas. 
Several Southeast Asian states dispute China’s territorial claims and are competing with China to exploit the South China Sea’s abundant hydrocarbon and fishing resources. 
Beijing has raised the ante by deploying military assets on artificial islands constructed on shoals and reefs in disputed parts of the sea. 

China's embassy in Indonesia was not immediately reachable for comment.

""As of 4 pm today, there are 19,079 displaced residents who have been evacuated at temporary shelters throughout Jakarta,"" city governor Anies Baswedan told a news conference.
""The rain in Jakarta has stopped, now we are waiting for the water to recede"".
Indonesia's disaster mitigation agency (BNPB) said at least 9 people had died in flash floods and landslides triggered by the rain in Jakarta and nearby towns.
Most of the deaths were due to hypothermia, though one was a teenager who was electrocuted by a power line, disaster mitigation agency spokesman Agus Wibobo said.
Television footage showed cars almost completely submerged and people wading through meters murky brown water in some neighborhoods of the capital.
Water levels in East and South Jakarta as well as in the satellite cities of Tangerang and Bekasi in West Java province started to quickly rise from 3 a.m. local time (2000 GMT), according to the disaster mitigation agency.
Indonesia's state electricity utility said it had switched off the electricity in hundreds of districts in Jakarta, which is home to 30 million people.
The floods also caused the temporary closure of the runway at Jakarta's domestic Halim airport, with flights redirected to the capital' bigger Soekarno airport.
City authorities have in the last few years sought to improve low-lying Jakarta’s vulnerability to flooding during the rainy season.
More than 50 people died in one of the capital’s deadliest floods in 2007 and five years ago much of the center of the city was inundated after canals overflowed.
Jakarta resident Daniel, whose neighborhood had been waterlogged, told reporters of his disappointment with the city government's efforts to mitigate the floods, which happen yearly during the rainy season.
“I only have one hope, which is to ask the current governor to fix this because it impact all the people,"" he pleaded.
""Take the right action please, look at what is happening now, bring the situation back to normal."""

In a case that Britain's foreign ministry said raised serious concerns, a district court ruled on Tuesday that the woman, aged 19 at the time, had lied about being sexually abused by 12 Israeli teenagers. Sentencing has been set for Jan. 7.
The woman, who has not been identified by media, was arrested after police said she had withdrawn an accusation that the teenagers had raped her in a hotel room at the holiday resort of Ayia Napa in July.
The woman maintained that she had recanted her accusation only under duress from police, during persistent questioning without a lawyer present. Prosecutors and the court dismissed that justification.
The case has attracted widespread media coverage in Britain, which accounted for a third of the 3.9 million tourists who visited Cyprus in 2018. The woman faces a jail sentence of up to one year. Her lawyers have said she intends to appeal the verdict.
Speaking to BBC radio, the woman's mother said she supported calls on social media for British holidaymakers to avoid the island.
""My personal view is that's a good thing to do,"" she said.
""The place isn't safe - it is absolutely not safe. And if you go and report something that's happened to you, you're either laughed at, as far as I can tell, or, in the worst case, something like what's happened to my daughter may happen."""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A third person was confirmed dead on Wednesday in devastating bushfires that engulfed Australia's southeast coast this week and a fourth was missing and feared dead, as navy ships rushed to provide supplies and assist with evacuations.
Twelve people have now lost their lives in fire-related deaths across Australia since blazes broke out a few months ago, including three volunteer firefighters, after a three-year drought in large parts of the nation created tinder-dry conditions.
Fanned by soaring temperatures, columns of fire and smoke blackened entire towns on Monday and Tuesday, forcing thousands of residents and holidaymakers to seek shelter on beaches. Many stood in shallow water to escape the flames.
Bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) and new blazes are sparked almost daily by extremely hot and windy conditions and, most recently, dry lightning strikes created by the fires themselves.
Cooler conditions on Wednesday gave the country a moment to count the cost of the fires, although there were still more than 100 blazes in New South Wales (NSW) state alone and thousands of firefighters on the ground. 
The body of a man was found in a burnt car early on Wednesday on the south coast of New South Wales after emergency workers began reaching the most damaged areas, and police said the death toll will rise.
""Sadly, we can report today that police have confirmed a further three deaths as a result of the fires on the South Coast,"" NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys told reporters in Sydney.
""Police are also at Lake Conjola now, where a house has been destroyed by fire and the occupant of that home is still unaccounted for.""
NSW police did not identify the missing man but said he was 72 years old and authorities have been unable to reach his home.
Police said early assessments have found nearly 200 homes have been destroyed, though they cautioned it was an early estimate. 
Large-scale livestock and animal casualties are also expected across Australia's east coast, though Mogo Zoo - home to Australia’s largest collection of primates, along with zebras, white rhinos, lions, tigers and giraffes – was saved.
The wildlife park was threatened by an out-of-control bushfire, though zoo keepers and firefighters managed to save all 200 animals.
In Victoria state, four people remain missing, state Premier Daniel Andrews said, after a massive blaze ripped through Gippsland - a rural region about 500 km (310 miles) east of Melbourne.
About 4,000 people in the town of Mallacoota in Victoria headed to the waterfront after the main road was cut off.
Mark Tregellas, a resident of Mallacoota who spent the night on a boat ramp, said only a late shift in the wind direction spared lives.
""The fire just continued to grow and then the black started to descend. I couldn't see the hand in front in my face, and it then it started to glow red and we knew the fire was coming,"" Tregellas told Reuters.
""Ash started to fall from the air and then the embers started to come down. At that point, people started to bring their kids and families into the water. Thankfully, the wind changed and the fire moved away.""
In Milton, a small town on the on the NSW south coast, locals queued for hours for the few remaining items left of shelves on supermarkets.
Emma Schirmer, who evacuated from her house in Batemans Bay with her three-month child on Tuesday, said the local shop was limiting sales to six items per customer, while a power outage meant shoppers could pay only with cash. 
As shops run low and firefighters struggle with exhaustion, Australia's military, including Black Hawk helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft and naval vessels were being deployed.
""We've got choppers taking 90 firefighters out of the Mallacoota area, they can't be removed any other way - we're essentially doing a shift change by the air,"" Andrews told reporters.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said authorities were working to restore communications with areas cut off by the fires, and she warned conditions will deteriorate again over the weekend.
""Weather conditions on Saturday will be as bad as they were"" on Tuesday, Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney.
Meanwhile, Australia's capital Canberra was blanketed in thick smoke, reaching about 20 times hazardous levels, prompting health warnings.
The smoke has also drifted to New Zealand where it has turned the daytime sky orange across the South Island.

Macron said in a traditional New Year's Eve address on Tuesday that he expected his government to quickly find a compromise with unions on the reform, but without departing from the principles laid out by ministers.
Unions are trying to force the former investment banker to abandon his overhaul of France's pension system with nationwide strikes since Dec. 5 that have crippled public transport.
""I was under the impression of having heard these words a thousand times,"" Philippe Martinez, the head of the CGT union, told BFM television of Macron's address.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Carlos Ghosn's daring flight from Japan, where he was awaiting trial on charges of financial wrongdoing, has revived global criticism of the nation's ""hostage justice,"" but in Japan is prompting talk of reversing more lenient curbs on defendants.
The ousted boss of Japan's Nissan Motor Co (T:7201) and France's  Renault  SA (PA:RENA) fled to Lebanon, saying on Tuesday that he had ""escaped injustice"" and would ""no longer be held hostage by a rigged Japanese justice system.""
Ghosn was first arrested in November 2018 when his private jet landed in Tokyo and kept in jail for more than 100 days as prosecutors added more charges, all of which he has denied. He was released on $9 million bail in March - only to be arrested and bailed again the following month.
He was facing four charges, including underreporting his Nissan salary and transferring personal financial losses to his employer's books while he ran Japan's No. 2 automaker.
His apparent escape from Japan's legal system - Tokyo and Lebanon don't have an extradition treaty - will likely halt or even reverse a trend of recent years toward granting bail in more cases, said Colin Jones, a law professor at Doshisha Law School in Kyoto.
“I would expect it to be more difficult for foreign defendants to get bail,” Jones said.
In Japan, suspects who deny the charges against them are often detained for long periods and subject to intense questioning without a lawyer present, a system critics call ""hostage justice.""
Japanese civil rights groups and the main bar lawyers association have long criticized a system that convicts 99.9% of criminal defendants. They say it gives too much power to prosecutors, who can detain suspects for long periods before indictment, and relies too much on confessions, some later found to have been forced and false.
Ghosn's escape is clearly a shock to Japan's legal establishment.
""This case raises the extremely serious issue of whether it's all right to continue the trend toward bail leniency,"" said former prosecutor Yasuyuki Takai.
""The legal profession and lawmakers need to quickly consider new legal measures or a system to prevent such escapes,"" Takai, who was formerly with the special investigation unit of the prosecutor's office, told public broadcaster NHK.
""Until the way to achieving this is in sight, we should carefully consider temporarily halting this trend toward bail leniency.""
The Tokyo District Court granted Ghosn bail over the objection of prosecutors because of his lawyer's assurances that the former executive would observe his unusually strict bail conditions - which included surrendering his passports, barring him from seeing his wife Carole or using the internet outside his lawyers' office.
""But this trust was betrayed and even this high bail didn't prevent him from fleeing the country,"" Takai said.
Tokyo-based lawyer Stephen Givens said Japan's political right is using Ghosn's flight to say, ""See, we caved in to Western demands and look what happened.”
Still, Givens said the Ghosn case likely won't reverse the recent trend of greater willingness to grant bail, as Japan was becoming more sensitive to foreign criticism.
The bold escape ""may provide grounds for a backlash but only in very unusual cases,"" he said."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea's leader plans to further develop nuclear programs and to introduce a ""new strategic weapon"" in the near future, state media said on Wednesday, although he signaled there was still room for dialogue with the United States.
Kim Jong Un presided over a four-day meeting of top Workers' Party officials this week amid rising tensions with the United States, which has not responded to his repeated calls for concessions to reopen negotiations. Washington has dismissed the deadline as artificial.
Kim said there were no grounds for North Korea to be bound any longer by a self-declared moratorium on testing nuclear bombs and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM), according to a statement on the results of the policy meeting carried by the official KCNA news agency.
At times smiling or striking the podium with his hand as he made remarks during the meeting, Kim accused the United States of making ""gangster-like demands"" and maintaining a ""hostile policy"", such as by holding continued joint military drills with South Korea, adopting cutting edge weapons and imposing sanctions.
He pledged to continue bolstering his country's nuclear deterrent but said the ""scope and depth"" of that deterrent will be ""properly co-ordinated depending on"" the attitude of the United States.
""The world will witness a new strategic weapon to be possessed by the DPRK in the near future,"" Kim said, using the initials for North Korea's official name - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
""We will reliably put on constant alert the powerful nuclear deterrent capable of containing the nuclear threats from the U.S. and guaranteeing our long-term security.""
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it would be ""deeply disappointing"" if Kim reneges on denuclearization commitments and Kim would hopefully ""choose peace and prosperity over conflict and war.""
In his latest comments on Tuesday in the United States, President Donald Trump said he had a good relationship with Kim and thought the North Korean leader would keep his word.
""He likes me, I like him. We get along. He's representing his country, I'm representing my country. We have to do what we have to do.
""But he did sign a contract, he did sign an agreement talking about denuclearization,"" Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida.
Seoul's Unification Ministry in charge of inter-Korean affairs said large-scale joint military drills with the United States had been halted and it would be unhelpful for negotiations if North Korea took action to introduce what it called a new strategic weapon.
There were no official reports as of early afternoon on Wednesday in South Korea that Kim had delivered an annual New Year's address. 
'STRATEGIC WEAPONS'
Kim had previously said he might have to seek a ""new path"" if Washington failed to meet his expectations. U.S. military commanders said Pyongyang's actions could include test firing an ICBM alongside nuclear warhead tests. North Korea last test fired an ICBM in 2017.
Jeffrey Lewis, a non-proliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said it was difficult to predict North Korea's next move. But it might involve firing a solid-fuel ICBM and an atmospheric nuclear test, he said.
However, Jeong Han-beom, who teaches security policy at Korea National Defense University in Seoul, said North Korea would not immediately stage such a provocative act as an ICBM or nuclear test because it could risk derailing negotiations.
Tension had been rising ahead of the year-end as North Korea conducted a series of weapons tests and waged a war of words with Trump.
The nuclear talks have made little headway despite three meetings between Kim and Trump since 2018. Working-level talks in Stockholm in October broke down, with a North Korean chief negotiator accusing U.S. officials of sticking to their old stance.
Kim said there will ""never be denuclearization on the Korean peninsula"" if Washington adheres to what he calls its hostile policy.
We ""will steadily develop necessary and prerequisite strategic weapons for the security of the state until the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and lasting and durable peace-keeping mechanism is built,"" Kim said.
He called for North Koreans to brace for an ""arduous and prolonged struggle"" and foster a self-reliant economy because of a delay in the anticipated lifting of sanctions.
""The present situation warning of long confrontation with the U.S. urgently requires us to make it a fait accompli that we have to live under the sanctions by the hostile forces in the future, too, and to strengthen the internal power from all aspects."" 
Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said the party assembly results made clear Kim wants U.S. security guarantees before taking substantial action toward denuclearization.

""And he is suggesting that he will take the bull by the horns to achieve that goal, while promoting self reliance at home and still being open to talks depending on how Trump handles 'hostile policy,'"" Yang said.

1449,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 10:25PM ET</span>",Taiwan leader rejects China's offer to unify under Hong Kong model,"TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Wednesday the island would not accept a ""one country, two systems"" political formula Beijing has suggested could be used to unify the democratic island, saying such an arrangement had failed in Hong Kong.
China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Tsai, who's seeking re-election in a Jan. 11 vote, also vowed in a New Year's speech to defend Taiwan's sovereignty, saying her government would build a mechanism to safeguard freedom and democracy as Beijing ramps up pressure on the island.
Fear of China has become a major element in the campaign, boosted by months of anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong.
""Hong Kong people have showed us that 'one country, two systems' is definitely not feasible,"" Tsai said, referring to the political arrangement that guaranteed certain freedoms in the former British colony of Hong Kong after it was returned to China in 1997.
""Under 'one country, two systems', the situation continues to deteriorate in Hong Kong. The credibility of 'one country, two systems' has been sullied by the government's abuse of power,"" Tsai said.
Hong Kong has been hit by months of anti-government protests triggered by widespread resentment of perceived efforts by Beijing to exert control of the city despite the promises of autonomy.
Taiwan's parliament passed an anti-infiltration law on Tuesday to combat perceived threats from China, further straining ties between Taiwan and Beijing. [nL4N295146]
Tsai said the law will protect Taiwan's democracy and cross-strait exchanges will not be affected amid worries that the legislation may damage business ties with China.
China suspects Tsai and her independence-leaning Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party of pushing for the island's formal independence, and has threatened it with war if there was any such move.
Tsai denies seeking independence and reiterated that she would not unilaterally change the status quo with China."

BAGHDAD/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Protesters angry about U.S. air strikes on Iraq hurled stones and torched a security post at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, setting off a confrontation with guards and prompting the United States to send additional troops to the Middle East.
The protests, led by Iranian-backed militias, posed a new foreign policy challenge for U.S. President Donald Trump, who faces re-election in 2020. He threatened to retaliate against Iran.
The State Department said diplomatic personnel inside were safe and there were no plans to evacuate them.
Embassy guards used stun grenades and tear gas to repel protesters, who stormed and burned the security post at the entrance but did not breach the main compound.
The Pentagon said that in addition to Marines sent to protect embassy personnel, about 750 soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were being sent to the Middle East and that additional troops were prepared to deploy over the next several days.
""This deployment is an appropriate and precautionary action taken in response to increased threat levels against U.S. personnel and facilities, such as we witnessed in Baghdad today,"" U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper said in a statement.
U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 750 troops would initially be based out of Kuwait. The officials said that as many as 4,000 troops could be sent to the region in the coming days if needed. 
More than 5,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq supporting local forces.
The unprecedented attack on an American diplomatic mission in Iraq marked a sharp escalation of the proxy conflict between the United States and Iran - both influential players in the country - and plunged U.S. relations with Iraq to their worst level in years.
The United States and its allies invaded Iraq in 2003 and ousted Saddam Hussein. But political stability has been elusive.
Trump, on a two-week working vacation in Palm Beach, Florida, spoke by phone to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi of Iraq. ""President Trump emphasized the need to protect United States personnel and facilities in Iraq,"" the White House said.
Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the violence.
""Iran will be held fully responsible for lives lost, or damage incurred, at any of our facilities. They will pay a very BIG PRICE! This is not a Warning, it is a Threat,"" Trump said in a tweet.
Iran, under severe economic duress from punishing U.S. sanctions put in place by Trump, denied responsibility.
""America has the surprising audacity of attributing to Iran the protests of the Iraqi people against (Washington's) savage killing of at least 25 Iraqis,"" Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said.
The embassy incident came seven years after the 2012 attack by armed militants on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that resulted in the death of the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans and led to multiple congressional investigations.
TENSIONS OVER AIR STRIKES
The protests followed U.S. air strikes on Sunday on bases operated by the Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah inside Iraq, which killed at least 25 fighters and wounded 55. The strikes were retaliation for the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, which Washington blamed on Kataib Hezbollah.
""Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible."" 
Democrats upset that Trump ditched the Iran nuclear deal negotiated by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2015 were quick to pounce on the incident as a failure of Trump's Iran policy.
""The predictable result of the Trump administration’s reckless bluster, escalation and miscalculation in the Middle East is that we are now hurtling closer to an unauthorized war with Iran that the American people do not support,"" said U.S. Senator Tom Udall, a Democratic member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
The protesters, joined briefly by Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim militia leaders, threw stones at the embassy gate, while others chanted: ""No, no, America! No, no, Trump!""
Iraqi special forces prevented protesters entering, later reinforced by U.S.-trained Iraqi Counter Terrorism forces.
The embassy has been hit by sporadic but non-lethal rocket fire in recent months, and was regularly shelled following the U.S.-led invasion of 2003, but had not been physically attacked by demonstrators in that way before.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told CBS News that U.S. officials never contemplated evacuating the embassy and had kept the heat on Iraqi officials to ensure the compound was safe.
""We reminded them throughout the day of their continued responsibility,"" he said.
The Popular Mobilisation Forces, an umbrella grouping of the militias that have been officially integrated into Iraq's armed forces, said 62 militiamen and civilians were wounded by the tear gas and stun grenades fired to disperse the crowd.
A Reuters witness saw blood on the face of one wounded militiaman and on the stomach of the other as their colleagues carried them away.
Iraqis have been taking to the streets in the thousands almost daily to condemn, among other things, militias such as Kataib Hezbollah and their Iranian patrons that support Abdul Mahdi's government.
Kataib Hezbollah is one of the smallest but most potent of the Iranian-backed militias. Its flags were hung on the fence surrounding the embassy.

DENVER (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration has launched an investigation into nighttime sightings of unidentified drones flying in formation over rural northeastern Colorado and southwest Nebraska over the last two weeks, the agency said on Tuesday.
The cluster of drones, technically known as unmanned aircraft systems, have been spotted in at least four counties in Colorado, garnering national media attention.
FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said in a statement emailed to Reuters that ""multiple FAA divisions and government agencies are investigating these reports,"" adding that the agency does not comment on the details of its open investigations.
No private companies nor government agencies have claimed the drones.
The Phillips County, Colorado Sheriff's Office said in a Dec. 20 Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post it was investigating ""multiple reports of drone sightings in the county over the last week.""
On that day, deputies from Phillips and Yuma counties ""tracked over 16 drones between the two counties. We believe that the drones, though startling, are not malicious in nature.""
Phillips County Sheriff Thomas Elliot said in a phone interview that the drones with blinking lights are flying in square grid patterns nearly every night between 5 and 10 p.m., and appear to be widening their path.
""They now have moved into Morgan County (Colorado) and have been spotted in Perkins County, Nebraska,"" he said.
Elliot said he had spoken to FAA investigators about whether the agency could determine if the aircraft were being used to map the area for possible oil and gas exploration purposes.
Wyatt Harman, who chased the drones when they flew over his Washington County, Colorado, property, told NBC's Today show on Tuesday that seeing the mysterious aircraft was ""unnerving.""
""They can sit there and hover,"" Harman said. ""They can descend very fast. They can take off very fast.""
U.S. Senator Cory Gardner, a Colorado Republican and a member of the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Aviation and Space, said in a Tuesday statement that he had been in contact with the FAA.
""I'm encouraged that they've opened a full investigation to learn the source and purpose of the drones,"" said Gardner, who is from Yuma County.
Last week, the FAA proposed requiring nearly all drones operating in U.S. airspace to be remotely tracked, a move which Sheriff Elliot said he would welcome.
""I could put all this to rest if whomever is doing this would come forward and identify themselves,"" Elliot said."

Fresh from winning a large parliamentary majority in an election just over two weeks ago, Johnson said in a New Year's message that his first job was to ensure Brexit was delivered, more than three years after Britain voted to leave the EU, and then to heal the wounds the vote had opened.
""As we say goodbye to 2019, we can also turn the page on the division, rancour and uncertainty which has dominated public life and held us back for far too long,"" he said.
""Now we have a new parliament, elected by the people to deliver the people’s priorities, which will finally respect the referendum and deliver Brexit. So we’ll get Brexit done before the end of this month,"" he added.
Johnson has already won initial approval for his EU divorce deal and the final stages of ratification will begin when lawmakers return after Christmas in time for a Jan. 31 exit.
He will then begin talks on forging a new trading relationship with the bloc, having said those negotiations would not be extended beyond the end of 2020.
With an eye on voters in northern and central England who broke their long tradition of backing the opposition Labour Party to support him in the election, Johnson also said the state-run NHS health service would be his top priority while vowing that extra funding for education and infrastructure would be spread ""more fairly"".
""We will do all of this while keeping your taxes low,"" he said."

Wang Yi, pastor of the Early Rain Covenant Church in China's southwestern city of Chengdu, was among dozens of the church's members and leaders detained by police in December 2018, most of whom were subsequently released.
He was sentenced to prison on Monday on charges of inciting subversion of state power, part of Beijing's crackdown on unregistered religious groups.
""We are alarmed that Pastor Wang Yi ... was tried in secret and sentenced to nine years in prison in connection to his peaceful advocacy for religious freedom,"" U.S. State Department Morgan Ortagus said in a statement that called for his immediate and unconditional release.
""This is yet another example of Beijing's intensification of repression of Chinese Christians and members of other religious groups,"" the statement added. ""We continue to call on Beijing to uphold its international commitments and promises made in its own constitution to promote religious freedom for all.""
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but since President Xi Jinping took office six years ago, the government has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
The government has cracked down on underground churches, both Protestant and Catholic, and has rolled out legislation to increase oversight of religious education and practices, with harsher punishment for practices not sanctioned by authorities.
Chinese law requires that places of worship register and submit to government oversight, but some have declined to register, for various reasons, and are known as ""house"" or ""underground"" churches.
An unusually outspoken religious figure, Wang has openly criticized Xi and was among three Chinese Christians who traveled to Washington in 2006, where they met with then-President George W. Bush, asking for his support in their fight for religious freedom."

SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The world rang in the New Year on Wednesday with spectacular firework displays from Sydney to Tokyo, although celebrations in Australia were overshadowed by deadly wildfires and the festive mood in Hong Kong and India was dampened by protests.
About a million revelers thronged Sydney harbor and nearby districts to watch more than 100,000 fireworks explode above the city, even as thousands of people along Australia's eastern seaboard sought refuge from the bushfires on beaches.
Thousands of Hong Kongers welcoming 2020 on neon-lit promenades in the picturesque Victoria Harbour broke into pro-democracy chants shortly after the countdown to midnight.
Hong Kong authorities canceled the main midnight fireworks display for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns. A ""Symphony of Lights"" took place instead, involving projections on the city's tallest skyscrapers, while smaller-scale pyrotechnics were launched from waterfront rooftops.
Sydney decided to press ahead with its fireworks despite calls by some members of the public for the display to be canceled in solidarity with fire-hit areas in New South Wales, of which the city is the capital.
Sydney Mayor Clover Moore said planning had begun 15 months ago and that the event also gave a boost to the economy. 
Some other towns in eastern Australia canceled their New Year's celebrations as naval vessels and military helicopters helped firefighters rescue people fleeing the fires, which have turned swathes of New South Wales into a raging furnace.
The fires have killed at least 11 people since October, two of them overnight into Tuesday, destroyed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) and left many towns and rural areas without electricity or mobile coverage. 
Some tourists trapped in Australia's coastal towns posted images of blood-red, smoke-filled skies on social media. One beachfront photograph showed people lying shoulder-to-shoulder on the sand, some wearing gas masks.
Elsewhere, revelers from Auckland, New Zealand, to Pyongyang, the capital of isolated North Korea, welcomed the new year with fireworks displays. In Japan, people took turns to strike Buddhist temple bells, in accordance with tradition.
'PERSIST IN 2020'
In Hong Kong, rocked by months of sometimes violent pro-democracy demonstrations, protesters were urged to wear masks at a New Year rally called ""Don't forget 2019 - Persist in 2020"", according to social media posts.
""This year there are no fireworks, but there will probably be tear gas somewhere,"" said 25-year-old IT worker Sam. ""For us it’s not really New Year’s Eve. We have to resist every day.""
Some 6,000 police were deployed and Chief Executive Carrie Lam appealed for calm and reconciliation in her New Year's Eve video message. 
The protests began in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and have evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.
Thousands of Indians ushered in the year by demonstrating against a citizenship law they say will discriminate against Muslims and chip away at India's secular constitution.
Demonstrations were planned in New Delhi, in the grip of its second coldest winter in more than a century, as well as Mumbai and other cities, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attempts to dampen demonstrations that have run for nearly three weeks.
Irshad Alam, a 25-year-old resident of the Shaheen Bagh area of New Delhi, stood with his 1-year-old in his arm and his wife by his side. He said he had been participating in the protest every day.

""It’s freezing here,"" he said. ""But we are still here because we care about this movement."" More than 200 people gathered in and around a makeshift stage in the Muslim neighborhood chanting slogans and reciting poetry.

1456,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 03:04PM ET</span>",France's Macron pledges to push through pension reform,"PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron pledged on Tuesday to push through an overhaul of the pension system, after weeks of nationwide strikes by trade unions.
Macron said in a traditional New Year's Eve address he expected his government to quickly find a compromise with unions on the reform, but without departing from the principles laid out by ministers.
Unions are trying to force the former investment banker to abandon his overhaul of France's pension system with nationwide strikes since Dec. 5 that have crippled public transport.
""The retirement reform that I've committed myself to before you will be carried through because it is a project of social justice and progress,"" Macron said in the prime-time televised address to the nation.
Macron wants to replace France's current system of 42 different sector-specific pension schemes with a points-based system for all, which his government says would be fairer and more transparent.
While Macron's government has rejected union calls to drop the reform altogether, it has offered concessions to a growing list of sectors as it seeks to defuse tensions.
""We will take into account difficult tasks so that those who do them can leave earlier,"" Macron said.
Macron has so far refused to back down on plans to encourage people to work until they are 64 instead of the legal retirement age of 62, a key union demand.
Under his plans, workers would receive reduced pension rights if they retire before 64, unless they benefit from special exemptions due to their profession, like police officers or soldiers.

Far left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said on Twitter that Macron's words were ""a declaration of war on those who reject the reform"".

Both sides have said they expect a deal to be reached this week, in which case Austria would join fellow European Union members Finland and Sweden in having the Greens in government at a time of growing calls for urgent action on climate change. 
It would also mark a swing to the left for Kurz, who will return as chancellor and whose last coalition was with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO), which shared his hard line on immigration. Their alliance collapsed in May when FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache was ensnared in a video sting and quit.
The Greens would, however, be the clearly junior partner, heading four ministries out of 15, officials on both sides said. That reflects their scores in the Sept. 29 parliamentary election, which Kurz's People's Party (OVP) won with 37.5% while the Greens came fourth with 13.9% of the vote.
Few policy details have emerged from the coalition talks so far. The Greens have called for a package of investments in environmental measures and there have been media reports of plans to expand Austria's rail network.
Kurz has made clear his priorities include balancing the budget and fighting illegal immigration.
His OVP will control the finance, interior, defense and foreign ministries, party officials said. For finance, Kurz has opted for his close ally Gernot Bluemel, who heads the OVP in Vienna. 
Senior Greens lawmaker Leonore Gewessler - a former head of an environmental group that is part of Friends of the Earth - is due to become a minister, the Greens said. Party officials said she would head a sprawling ministry covering transport, the environment, energy, infrastructure, technology and innovation.
The Greens also confirmed they were nominating Alma Zadic, a 35-year-old lawyer and lawmaker born in Bosnia who has championed a more open immigration policy. She is likely to become justice minister. 
Ministerial nominations, like the deal itself, must be approved by a Greens party meeting on Saturday. 

Greens leader Werner Kogler is widely expected to become vice chancellor. Media reports also said the Greens would take over the social affairs ministry and that female ministers would be in the majority for the first time in Austria.

1459,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 12:16PM ET</span>",Row with Bolivia creates New Year headache for Mexican president,"By Dave Graham
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A row between Mexico and Bolivia has created a New Year's headache for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, exposing him to opposition attacks and testing the credibility of his pledge to stay out of other countries' affairs.
    The dispute, in which Bolivia has expelled the Mexican ambassador to La Paz, has created an awkward standoff for Lopez Obrador, who has sought to avoid foreign entanglements and appears to have little to gain from a protracted spat.
""Getting into a fight with a 'small' country doesn't do anything for him; on the contrary, it looks bad,"" said Roy Campos, head of polling firm Consulta Mitofsky.
Bolivia on Monday gave Mexican ambassador Maria Teresa Mercado 72 hours to leave the country as tensions escalated over Mexico's decision to grant asylum to several people described as criminals by the new interim Bolivian administration.
Relations have been rocky between the leftist Lopez Obrador and the conservative government in La Paz headed by caretaker president Jeanine Anez since Mexico gave asylum to Bolivia's former socialist leader Evo Morales last month.
    Mexico cast that decision as a principled gesture on behalf of people at risk of political persecution, and has accused the Bolivian government of harassing and intimidating its diplomatic staff in La Paz.
    The Anez administration, which is gearing up for presidential elections, has likened Mexico's attitude to that of colonial overlord meddling in Bolivia's domestic politics.
    Although the economy has stagnated and violence has hit record levels under Lopez Obrador, he remains popular after just a year in office. The 66-year-old has blamed previous administrations for Mexico's problems and says it will take time to transform the country after years of corruption and economic mismanagement.
Nevertheless, Morales' sojourn in Mexico was ultimately negative for the president's poll ratings, Mitofsky's Campos said.
    Mexico sought to contain tensions on Monday, saying it currently had no intention of breaking ties with Bolivia even as Spain, which has been drawn into the spat, expelled three Bolivian diplomats in a tit-for-tat move.
The European Union denounced Bolivia's expulsion of the Spanish diplomats on Tuesday.
    Morales resigned under pressure from Bolivia's armed forces after a presidential election that the Organization of American States said was rigged in his favor.
    Mexico's embassy in Bolivia gave refuge to nine people, including Morales allies whom the Anez administration blames for stirring up violent protests and wants to put on trial.
   
    CONTRADICTIONS
    Broadsides from Bolivia have caused offense in some quarters in Mexico, even among critics of Morales, whose tilt for a fourth term ignored the results of a 2016 referendum.
    ""The current Bolivian government is as indefensible as Evo's bid to stay in power,"" said Agustin Basave, a former leader of the opposition center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution. ""It's a clumsy and rude government with no idea of diplomacy.""
    Lopez Obrador last month acknowledged that the arrival in Mexico of Morales, who is now in Argentina, created a crisis for his government. But he has defended Mexico's right to offer asylum and said he will not be provoked by insults.
    Critics of Lopez Obrador say his support for Morales not only undermined his commitment to non-intervention in other countries' affairs, but also to public sector austerity.
    The decision to send a plane to fetch Morales from Bolivia and put up him and others at taxpayers' expense did not look like Mexico was staying neutral, said Victor Giorgana of the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), a former chairman of the lower house foreign relations committee.
    Nor did the government look credible digging in its heels with Anez's administration after it had meekly acquiesced to U.S. President Donald Trump's demands that Mexico tighten its borders against illegal immigrants, Giorgana said.
    Still, Heriberto Galindo, a former Mexican ambassador to Cuba and PRI member, said Lopez Obrador had rightly upheld a proud tradition by giving Morales and his allies asylum.

    It was Morales, said Galindo, who then aggravated tensions by continuing attacks on his Bolivian adversaries from Mexico.

The Arab League's council, its top body, met in Cairo after Egypt called for an emergency meeting on Libya, where eastern-based forces led by military commander Khalifa Haftar are trying to seize the capital Tripoli.
Turkey has said it will seek parliamentary support for sending troops to Libya, and senior Turkish sources have said Ankara is also considering sending allied Syrian fighters as part of the deployment.
Egypt is one of Haftar's foremost foreign backers. Turkey supports the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.
A statement issued by the Arab League's council warned of ""the gravity of taking any unilateral steps ... in a manner that allows foreign military interventions and contributes to the escalation and prolongation of the conflict"".
""Regional interventions that help among other things in facilitating the transfer of foreign extremist fighters from other regional conflict zones to Libya"" should be prevented, it said.
Egypt has been flexing its diplomatic muscles since Turkey signed two accords with the Tripoli government last month, one on security and military cooperation and the other on boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.
Both sides in Libya have received foreign air support, mainly through drones, and Russian military contractors have been deployed on the front line to help Haftar's forces in recent months, diplomats and analysts say."

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Thousands of Hong Kong revelers welcomed in 2020 on neon-lit promenades along the picturesque Victoria Harbour, breaking into pro-democracy chants as the clocks struck midnight after more than half a year of often violent unrest.
Protesters briefly blocked Nathan Road, a key artery leading through Kowloon to the harbor, after forming human chains across the Chinese-ruled city and marching through shopping malls, urging people not to give up the fight for democracy in 2020. 
The protesters fled when police came to clear the road of umbrellas, street furniture and debris and a three-meter-tall skeleton of a metal Christmas tree. Several arrests were made.
Authorities had canceled the popular new year fireworks for the first time in a decade, citing security concerns. A ""Symphony of Lights"" took place instead, involving projections on the city's tallest skyscrapers after the countdown to midnight.
There were small-scale pyrotechnics on waterfront rooftops, but the grandiose fireworks launched from vessels in the center of the harbor, broadcast around the world every year, were absent.
The carnival atmosphere on the harbor was interrupted as parts of the crowd of thousands watching the show began chanting protest slogans, such as ""Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times"" and ""Five demands, not one less."" 
The latter refers to the goals of the anti-government movement, which include universal suffrage and an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality.
The protesters are angry at what they see as creeping Beijing influence in the city which was guaranteed wide-ranging autonomy when it returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997. Beijing denies interference and blames the West for fomenting the unrest.
""I hope people can continue fighting in 2020,"" 28-year-old engineer Eric Wong said. 
""We should not forget the people in jail who could not count down to the new year with us.""
On Nathan Road, protesters in a chain stretching for several kilometers raised lit-up smartphones as passing cars and buses honked in support and tourists in party hats and 2020-shaped glasses took pictures. Many protesters held up cards reading ""Let’s keep fighting together in 2020."" 
The chain later spilled over on to the road, and some protesters built barricades and hid behind umbrellas until police chased them away. A water cannon truck, flanked by an armored jeep, patrolled the road at midnight.
""This year there are no fireworks, but there will probably be tear gas somewhere,"" said 25-year-old IT worker Sam. ""For us it’s not really New Year’s Eve. We have to resist every day.""
Dozens of people had earlier laid flowers at the Prince Edward metro station, scene of some of the most violent clashes with the police this summer.
The protests began in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and have evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement.
The protest movement is supported by 59% of city residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute. More than a third of respondents said they had attended an anti-government demonstration.
BEST WISHES
In a New Year's Eve video message, Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the unrest had caused sadness, anxiety, disappointment and rage.
""Let's start 2020 with a new resolution, to restore order and harmony in society. So we can begin again, together,"" Lam said.
Chinese President Xi Jinping extended his best wishes to Hong Kong residents in a speech carried by state television.
""Without a harmonious and stable environment, how can there be a home where people can live and work happily?"" he said. ""We sincerely hope for the best for Hong Kong and Hong Kong compatriots.""
Police, who reject allegations of brutality and say they have shown restraint, have arrested nearly 6,500 people since the protests began escalating in what is the worst political crisis faced by the city in decades.
Protesters have thrown petrol bombs and rocks, with police responding with tear gas, water cannon, pepper spray, rubber bullets and occasional live rounds. There have been several injuries.
On Jan. 1, tens of thousands of people are expected to join a pro-democracy march, starting from a park downtown and ending in the heart of the central financial district.
The previous march organized by the Civil Human Rights Front (CHRF) drew an estimated 800,000 people in early December.

""January 1, see you in Victoria Park,"" people gathered on the waterfront chanted.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - The European Union said on Tuesday it was ""deeply concerned"" about Bolivia's expulsion of Spanish officials caught up in an escalating diplomatic row between Mexico and the interim conservative administration in La Paz.
Bolivian stand-in President Jeanine Anez said Monday her administration had asked Mexican ambassador María Teresa Mercado and several Spanish officials to leave the country within 72 hours.
Anez said Bolivia expelled the Spanish diplomats because masked men posing a ""security risk"" had accompanied the officials on a visit to Mexico´s embassy in La Paz.
""Expelling diplomatic officials is an extreme and unfriendly measure that should be saved for grave situations,"" the EU said in a statement.
The EU said it was ""deeply concerned over the increasing diplomatic tension"" and has demanded further explanation from the Anez government.
Spain's foreign ministry responded to the expulsion of its officials with a tit-for-tat move, saying it would expel three Bolivian diplomatic staff.
The row began after Mexico admitted ousted Bolivian President Evo Morales as an exile following allegations he had rigged the country´s October presidential election. Morales is now in Argentina.
    Mexico's embassy in Bolivia has given refuge to nine people, including Morales allies whom the Anez administration blames for stirring up violent protests and wants to put on trial.
Bolivia's disputed October election sparked widespread, often violent demonstrations. Morales resigned last month in the face of growing civil and military pressure. Anez took over by default, and has made sharp policy shifts away from his socialist government, fraying ties with leftist allies in the region.
Morales claimed he was toppled in a right-wing ""coup"" and many of his allies have rallied behind him with the country headed for new elections in 2020."

Milomir Savcic, 60, is accused of commanding the Bosnian Serb Army headquarters 65 Protection Motorised Regiment, which included a military police battalion, to capture, kill and bury adult Muslim Bosniaks from the U.N.-protected eastern enclave of Srebrenica in July 1995.
Bosnian Serb forces led by General Ratko Mladic attacked Srebrenica on July 11, 1995, separated men from women and children, and killed about 8,000 Muslims, who were then buried in mass graves.
The Srebrenica massacre is regarded as Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.
Savcic consciously helped Mladic and colonel Ljubisa Beara, as well as other commanders of the Drina Corps and Zvornik Brigade, which executed the massacre, to destroy the Muslim men as an ethnic group in the area, the prosecutor said in a statement.
Both Mladic and Beara were jailed for life over the Srebrenica genocide by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
""Savcic is accused of planning, commanding and supervising the activities ... during the capture and detention of several hundred Bosniak men at several locations in the Nova Kasaba area, and their illegal arrest, torture and murder,"" the statement said.
""Savcic is accused ... of committing the criminal act of helping in genocide,"" the statement added.

Savcic, who is not in detention, is the president of the Bosnian Serb Republic's war veterans' organization. He holds Bosnian and Serbian citizenship.

PARIS (Reuters) - A French chef who said he had contemplated suicide after the prestigious  Michelin  (PA:MICP) guide removed one of his restaurant's stars on Tuesday lost a legal attempt to force the guide's inspectors to justify their decision. 
Marc Veyrat, 69, took the Michelin Guide to court in September demanding that it explain why it had stripped him of one of his three stars a year after awarding it.
He had said the only explanation he had been given was that he had used English cheddar in a souffle, instead of traditional French cheese - an accusation he said was false.
But a court in Nanterre, on the outskirts of Paris, rejected his request.
""This decision enshrines the freedom to criticise and enshrines the fact that his grievances were imaginary and unfounded,"" said Richard Malka, the lawyer representing the Michelin Guide. 
Reached by telephone, Veyrat described the court ruling as nonsense, and said he wanted his restaurant expunged from the Michelin Guide altogether.
""They offended me, I've had enough,"" he told Reuters.
Veyrat said the Michelin inspectors should have known better than to think that his restaurant in the French Alps, would use English cheddar. ""We're not in London,"" he said.
Well known in France for his trademark Fedora hat, he runs the Maison des Bois restaurant.
He has previously said that since the restaurant lost one of its stars he has struggled to sleep, and his partner has to hide his hunting rifles, fearing that he may try to harm himself.
""Can you imagine the sense of shame I feel? I am the first chef in history to have won a star and lost it the next year,"" Veyrat said in an interview with French media outlet Le Point in July.
""Every morning, I wake up with that in my head. I'm at the end of my tether, I struggle to sleep, I hardly eat any more ... I'm on medication. I've had dark thoughts.""
In his court case, the chef asked the Michelin Guide to prove its inspectors had gone to his restaurant and to show they were qualified to pass judgment.

The guide said it could not comply because to do so would mean revealing its inspectors' identity, and they would therefore no longer be able to inspect restaurants incognito.

Concern had grown over the sultan's health after he spent a week in Belgium undergoing medical treatment this month and Omani authorities said nothing about his health after his return.
An ally of the West, Qaboos, 79, has ruled the Gulf Arab state since leading a bloodless coup in 1970 with the help of Britain, Oman's former colonial power.
Qaboos has no children and has not publicly named a successor. A 1996 statute says the ruling family will choose a successor within three days of the throne's becoming vacant.
If they fail to agree, a council of military and security officials, Supreme Court chiefs and heads of the two assemblies will put in power the person whose name has been secretly written by the sultan in a sealed letter.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Protesters and militia fighters enraged by U.S. air strikes on Iraq staged a violent demonstration outside the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on Tuesday, torching a security post and hurling stones as security forces and embassy guards hit back with stun grenades and tear gas.
Iraqi officials said the ambassador and other staff had been evacuated but this could not be confirmed with American officials.
In Washington, U.S. President Donald Trump accused Iran of orchestrating the violence and said Tehran would be held responsible.
The protesters and militiamen stormed and burned a security post at the entrance of the U.S. Embassy but did not breach the main compound, Reuters witnesses said.
They threw stones at the gate while others chanted, ""No, no, America! No, no, Trump!""
Iraqi special forces were deployed around the main gate to prevent them entering the embassy. U.S.-trained and -equipped Iraqi Counter Terrorism forces later reinforced them.
Medical sources said 12 militiamen were wounded by the tear gas and stun grenades fired to disperse the crowd.
U.S. planes on Sunday had attacked bases belonging to an Iranian-backed militia - an action that risks drawing Iraq further into a proxy conflict between Washington and Tehran at a time when mass protests are challenging Iraq's political system. 
The attack on the Kataib Hezbollah militia was in response to the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base.
""Iran killed an American contractor, wounding many. We strongly responded, and always will,"" Trump said in a tweet. 
""Now Iran is orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Embassy in Iraq. They will be held fully responsible. In addition, we expect Iraq to use its forces to protect the Embassy, and so notified.""
Two Iraqi foreign ministry officials said the U.S. ambassador and other staff had left, but they did not say when. 
The Washington Post reported that inside the embassy, U.S. diplomats and staffers were huddled in a fortified safe room, according to two reached by a messaging app.
A few hours into the protest, tear gas was fired in an attempt to disperse the crowd and some of the militias encouraged protesters through loudspeakers to leave. 
""We have delivered our message, please leave the area to avoid bloodshed,"" one announcement said.
Security guards inside the embassy also fired stun grenades at protesters outside the gates of the compound. Reuters correspondents heard at least seven loud bangs.
A Reuters witness saw blood on the face of one wounded militiamen and on the stomach of the other as their colleagues carried them away from the scene.
'CLOSED IN THE NAME OF THE PEOPLE' 
Iraqis have been taking to the streets in their thousands almost daily to condemn, among other things, militias such as Kataib Hezbollah and their Iranian patrons that support Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi's government.
But on Tuesday, it was the militias who protested, spraying ""Closed in the name of the people"" on the gates of the U.S. Embassy and smashed the surveillance cameras around the building with bricks and stones. 
Qais al-Khazali, leader of the Iranian-backed Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia, and many other senior leaders were among the protesters. 
""Americans are unwanted in Iraq. They are a source of evil and we want them to leave,"" Khazali told Reuters. 
Khazali is one of the most feared and respected Shi'ite militia leaders in Iraq, and one of Iran's most important allies. 
Kataib Hezbollah is one of the smallest but most potent of the Iranian-backed militias. Its flags were hung on the fence surrounding the embassy.
Militia commander Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, also known as Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes, and Badr Organisation leader Hadi al-Amiri were also at the protest.
There are more than 5,000 U.S. troops in Iraq supporting local forces, though Iraq has rejected any long-term presence of additional U.S. forces that crossed its border during an American withdrawal from northern Syria.

Sunday's air strikes killed at least 25 fighters and wounded 55.

1467,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 08:37AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Hong Kongers support protester demands; minority wants independence from China - Reuters poll,"By James Pomfret and Clare Jim
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's protest movement is supported by 59% of city residents polled in a survey conducted for Reuters by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute, with more than a third of respondents saying they had attended an anti-government demonstration.
Supporters of the protests outnumbered opponents by a ratio of nearly two to one, with 30% percent saying they were opposed. Of those polled, 57% said they favored the resignation of Carrie Lam, the city's leader. Lam was a particular target of the anti-government demonstrations that gripped Hong Kong for most of 2019 after she attempted to push through a deeply unpopular extradition bill.
Nevertheless, only 17% expressed support for seeking independence from China, and 20% were opposed to ""the current path of one country, two systems"" - the arrangement under which Hong Kong is governed by Beijing. 
Many protesters say Beijing has used its authority under the system to gradually undermine certain freedoms - such as an independent judiciary and freedom of speech - that are supposed to be guaranteed at least until 2047 under the arrangement. 
The results of the survey, involving 1,021 people and conducted from Dec. 17-20, also showed a large plurality of respondents mainly blamed the Hong Kong government for the crisis, the worst civil unrest to hit the city in decades, rather than the central government in Beijing.
""The figures are consistent with Carrie Lam's low popularity rate, which shows her ability to lead the government is very low,"" said Ma Ngok, a professor of government and public administration at Chinese University of Hong Kong. ""Resistance and protests will continue next year.""
A Hong Kong government spokesman said in a response to the poll results that Lam and her team would ""continue to engage the people through dialogue"".
China's Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office under the State Council, or cabinet, did not respond to a request for comment. 
The protests erupted following an attempt by the Hong Kong government to introduce a bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China for trial in courts that are controlled by the Communist Party.
The bill was later withdrawn, but the protests have escalated into a broader call for greater democratic representation in the city and an inquiry into alleged police brutality in dealing with the protests.
The results of the poll reinforce claims by protesters that their key demands are broadly backed by the general public, according to Samson Yuen, a political science professor at Lingnan University. They also counter Beijing's characterization of the protests as a movement aimed at undermining its sovereignty over the city. 
The poll conducted for Reuters also shows little public support for the denunciations of China by hardline protesters, some of whom have called for independence for Hong Kong or scrapping the ""one country, two systems"" model.
""People go on the street due to their dissatisfaction with police and the political system, not asking for independence,"" Yuen said.
The survey was the first in a series commissioned by Reuters to gauge public sentiment in Hong Kong amid its worst political crisis in decades. The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute is an independent polling firm.
Among the key findings:
-- 57% of respondents said they wanted Lam to resign.
-- 37% of respondents said they had taken part in protests in 2019, versus 63% who had not. 
-- 47% said the Hong Kong government deserved most of the blame for the unrest in the city, 14% blamed the pro-democracy camp the most, and 12% mainly blamed the central government in Beijing. 
-- 41% of respondents said they ""strongly oppose"" Hong Kong independence, and 26% said they ""somewhat oppose"" it. Only 8% said they ""strongly support"" independence, and 9% ""somewhat support"" it.
-- 74% said they wanted an independent inquiry into alleged police brutality in handling the protests. Only 9% said the police deserved most of the blame for the unrest.
The Hong Kong government has rejected calls by protesters and opposition politicians to set up an independent inquiry into police actions, saying that its oversight of the force is adequate.
SUPPORT FOR INQUIRY
The people of Hong Kong ""are not seeking a quick fix"", said Yuen, the Lingnan University professor. ""They think Carrie Lam should be held accountable but it's not the most important thing. They want an independent inquiry to improve the relationship between police and people.""
The Hong Kong police did not respond to a request for comment.
Many protesters say they are incensed by what they see as an abuse of power by the police in dealing with the unrest. The police say they have used reasonable and appropriate force against illegal acts including vandalism and rioting. 
Since Hong Kong reverted from British to Chinese rule in 1997, many people in the city of 7.5 million have become increasingly angered by what they see as efforts by China to undermine the city's autonomy and roll back freedoms.
When asked whether Hong Kong should keep on its ""current path"" of one country, two systems, 39% of respondents said they ""strongly support"" the model, and 29% said they ""somewhat support"" it.
China has denounced acts of violence in the protests, which it sees as being aimed at undermining Chinese sovereignty.
The large number of respondents saying they had participated in a protest chime with the huge demonstrations the city saw in 2019. On June 9, an anti-extradition march drew an estimated one million people; that was followed a week later by an even larger demonstration.
Widespread discontent was also reflected in city-wide elections for district council seats on Nov. 24, in which pro-democracy candidates won nearly 90% of the 450 seats. While voter participation is usually low in elections for the councils, which oversee things like garbage collection, nearly three million people in the city voted in the November election, or 71% of registered voters. It was the highest turnout in Hong Kong electoral history.
The degree of support for the protests varied sharply by age, education and whether respondents were born in Hong Kong. Younger, better-educated people born in Hong Kong, for example, were far more likely to support or take part in the protests, the poll showed.

For the poll, which had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, respondents were randomly polled by telephone in Cantonese, which is spoken by the vast majority of people in Hong Kong. The results were weighted according to the latest population figures in Hong Kong.

Ble Goude headed the notorious Young Patriots street militia during Gbagbo's presidency. 
Gbagbo and Ble Goude were acquitted in January by the International Criminal Court (ICC) in The Hague of charges of crimes against humanity during the violence, in which some 3,000 people were killed.
But Ivorian prosecutors this month brought charges against Ble Goude - who has remained in Europe while ICC prosecutors appeal against the acquittals - for rape, torture and other crimes related to his role in the conflict. He denied the charges. 
Political tensions are rising in Ivory Coast ahead of an October 2020 presidential election. President Alassane Ouattara, whose victory over Gbagbo in 2010 sparked the civil war, is expected to step down after 10 years in office, but he has refused to rule out running for re-election. 
Ble Goude's lawyer in the Netherlands, Geert-Jan Knoops, said on Tuesday the Ivorian court had convicted his client on Monday.
""I am quite astonished that a country that is supposed to cooperate with the ICC is not respecting the system,"" Knoops said. ""Once a case is before the ICC, the domestic courts should abstain from prosecution for the same facts."" 
Ble Goude's lawyer in Ivory Coast, Ndry Claver, said a warrant had been issued for Ble Goude's arrest. 
An official at the court in Abidjan confirmed the sentence. A government spokesman was not immediately available for comment. 
Ivory Coast extradited Ble Goude to the ICC in 2014. 
Gbabgo also remains in Europe pending the ICC appeal. If he is able to return to Ivory Coast in time, he could stand in the presidential election, a move that Ouattara said would make him rethink plans to step down.

PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - More than 7,000 Cambodians have lost their jobs and dozens of casinos have been shuttered since a ban on online gambling in August, with more losses expected when the government begins inspections this week, officials said on Tuesday.
The southern coastal city of Sihanoukville has emerged as a center for gambling and many of the dozens of Chinese-run casinos that have sprung up there have online gambling operations.
Prime Minister Hun Sen said this week that he would make the online gambling ban permanent after first announcing a halt in August, saying that the industry had been used by foreign criminals to extort money.
Officials will begin inspecting all casinos nationwide beginning Jan. 1 to make sure they have shut down their online operations, Ros Phearun, deputy director-general of the Finance Ministry's financial industry department, told Reuters.
Ros Phearun said that government revenue would be hard-hit, since online gambling had contributed about a quarter of an estimated $80 million per year in total taxes from casinos.
Since the August announcement, an unspecified number of casinos had already ceased operations, with 136 left nationwide by December, he said.
That number is expected to go down to 94 casinos by the end of January, said Ros Phearun.
""When the online gambling was banned, they went back to their country, then there is a decline of casinos,"" Ros Phearun said, adding that Sihanoukville has been hit hard by the ban, with the number of casinos cut by half from more than 70 to 36 remaining.
Yov Khemara, director of the Sihanoukville labor department, said on Tuesday that more than 7,700 locals had been left unemployed after the ban.
""Before, they worked in factories and when there was better salary in casinos, they came to work in casinos,"" Yov Khemara said.
He said many of those workers were now going back to factories."

The asset freeze follows an injunction application by the government, which is seeking to recover around $1 billion of funds that it says it is owed by Isabel dos Santos and her associates.
It is one of the highest-profile moves in an anti-corruption drive launched by President Joao Lourenço, who ended dos Santos' nearly 40-year grip on power when he became head of state in 2017.
Isabel dos Santos, who owns stakes in companies including telecoms firm Unitel and financial firms, has denied wrongdoing during her father's time in office.
""I would like to leave a message of tranquillity and confidence to my teams,"" she tweeted on Monday. ""We will continue, every day, in every business, doing our best and fighting for what I believe in for Angola. The road is long, the truth will prevail. United we stand stronger.""
Ranked as Africa's wealthiest woman by Forbes, Isabel dos Santos chaired the state oil company Sonangol - a crucial pillar of Angola's oil-dependent economy - before being sacked by Lourenço in late 2017.
The court order, dated Dec. 23, said the asset freezes applied to Isabel dos Santos, her husband, Sindika Dokolo, and Mário Filipe Moreira Leite da Silva, chairman of Banco Fomento Angola (BFA).
It freezes their personal bank accounts in Angola, as well as their stakes in Angolan firms including Unitel, BFA and ZAP MIDIA.
Reuters was not immediately able to reach dos Santos, Dokolo or da Silva for comment on Tuesday.
The order said the central bank would be responsible for ensuring that no funds leave the personal bank accounts of the three accused.
The boards of directors of the companies subject to the asset freezes are responsible for ensuring no profits are transferred to the accused directly or through intermediaries, until a court makes a further ruling.

Many Western countries have expressed deep concern at reports China has interned Muslims in its far western region of Xinjiang in harsh conditions, with Pompeo particularly critical. Beijing says it is running a vocational training program to fight extremism.
Next week Pompeo visits Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, close friends of China which have not criticized its policies in Xinjiang although their citizens have close cultural and religious connections to the people of Xinjiang.
Speaking at a daily news briefing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Central Asian countries were better placed to assess the situation than Washington.
""On the real situation in Xinjiang, the five Central Asian countries have an even better understanding than the United States and greater right to speak about it,"" Geng said.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, mostly ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained. China strongly denies any mistreatment.
The United States had already tried and failed to ""throw dirty water"" at China during a meeting earlier in the year with Central Asia foreign ministers, Geng said.
""If the United States once again tries to get up to its old tricks, it will certainly still be futile for them. On the Xinjiang issue the Central Asia countries understand and support China's position, and positively appraise China's counter-terrorism and counter-extremism measures.""
China strongly believes that Central Asian countries are firm in their joint fight with China against terror and extremism, and attempts to sow discord will fail, Geng said.
Pompeo is due to meet the foreign ministers of Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan while he is in Tashkent.
China was infuriated earlier this month when the U.S. House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved a bill that would require the Trump administration to toughen its response to China's crackdown in Xinjiang.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Large crowds thronged Sydney harbor on Tuesday to watch Australia's famous New Year's Eve fireworks, even as smoke from deadly wildfires turned skies in nearby coastal towns blood-red.
The planned spectacle is going ahead despite calls from some members of the public for the fireworks to be canceled, in solidarity with fire-hit areas in New South Wales (NSW) of which Sydney is the capital city.
Elsewhere in Australia, thousands of people were trapped on the country's east coast by fierce fires, as the government readied naval vessels and military helicopters to aid firefighting and evacuations.
""Tonight we expect a million people around the Harbor and a billion people around the world to watch Sydney's New Year Eve celebrations, which is Australia's biggest public event,"" City of Sydney mayor Clover Moore told reporters.
Responding to calls to cancel the event and reallocate the funding to fire-affected regions, Moore said planning for the fireworks began 15 months ago and most of the budget had already been allocated. The event was also a boost to NSW's economy.
Moore added that people viewing the fireworks around the harbor will see a donation link projected onto the Sydney Harbor Bridge pylons throughout the night.
Some tourists trapped in Australia's coastal towns posted images of blood-red, smoke-filled skies on social media. One beachfront photograph showed people lying shoulder-to-shoulder on the sand, some wearing gas masks.
The weather in Sydney was relatively mild, although its skies were still cloaked in smoke from nearby fires.
The fires have spread across four states, with fronts stretching hundreds of kilometres in some cases. They have killed 11 people since October and left many towns and rural areas without electricity and mobile coverage.
""Many of us have mixed feelings about this evening, but the important thing we take out of this is that we're a resilient state,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.
""I don't want to take a second away from the deep sense of loss and tragedy many people are feeling.""
Worryingly, by Tuesday evening the bushfires had reached Western Sydney, some 30 km away from Sydney Harbor Bridge, with an emergency warning issued for an out-of-control blaze burning in the suburb of Greystanes.
Fires so close to Australia's largest city sparked anger among some residents.
    ""Is Sydney seriously still getting fireworks tonight when half our country is on fire,"" one Twitter user @swiftyshaz13 said."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Thousands of Indians are set to ring in the New Year by holding protests against a citizenship law, despite Prime Minister Narendra Modi's attempts to dampen demonstrations that have run for nearly three weeks.
India has been rocked by the protests since Dec. 12, when the government passed legislation easing the way for non-Muslim minorities from the neighboring Muslim-majority nations of Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan to gain Indian citizenship.
Combined with opposition to a proposed national register of citizens, many Indians fear the move will discriminate against the minority Muslim community and chip away at the country's secular constitution.
Protesters plan at least three demonstrations in New Delhi, the capital, including the area of Shaheen Bagh, where hundreds of residents have blocked a major highway for 18 days.
Poetry recitals and speeches are planned by organizers at a protest outside New Delhi's Jamia Millia University, which was stormed by police this month.
""New Year's resolution to defend the constitution,"" read the schedule for another protest planned in New Delhi, now in the grip of its second coldest winter in more than a century.
Police said they planned to deploy additional forces in New Delhi on New Year's Eve, with traffic curbs imposed in some parts of the capital.
""All precautionary measures are in place,"" said police official Chinmoy Biswal, who oversees the southeastern part of the city that includes Shaheen Bagh and Jamia Millia University.
""Recently, there have been no incidents. So we hope things will remain fine,"" he told Reuters.
In the southern city of Hyderabad, at least two small groups of demonstrators have been organizing flash protests, to skirt police restrictions on larger gatherings.
Typically, half a dozen demonstrators pop up in public places, such as malls and coffee shops, holding up placards and encouraging passersby to join in, a member of one of the groups, which has held 11 protests, told Reuters.
""Everyday, we are doing something, somewhere,"" said the person, who sought anonymity for reasons of security, adding that another protest is planned to be staged on Tuesday night.
Street-side poetry recitals, stand-up comedy, and music performances are also planned in the financial capital of Mumbai and the eastern city of Kolkata.
All three cities have seen large, peaceful protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Citizens' Register (NRC), which were part of the election manifesto of Modi's ruling Hindu nationalist party.
But some protests have turned violent, particularly in the populous northern state of Uttar Pradesh, and at least 25 people have been killed in clashes with police since early December.
Initially caught off guard by the scale of the protests, Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has scrambled to douse public anger, with Modi declaring that there had been no discussions on the NRC, contradicting party colleagues.
The BJP has also launched an effort, backed by a social media campaign, to explain that the CAA is not discriminatory and is needed to help non-Muslim minorities persecuted in the three neighboring countries."
1477,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 05:10AM ET</span>",Taiwan passes law to combat Chinese influence on politics,"By Yimou Lee and Fabian Hamacher
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's parliament passed an anti-infiltration law on Tuesday to combat perceived threats from China as the island gears up for a presidential vote on Jan. 11 amid heightened tension with Beijing.
The legislation is part of a years-long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process, through illicit funding of politicians and the media and other methods.
The move further strains ties between Taiwan and Beijing, which suspects Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen of pushing for the island's formal independence and has ramped up pressure on her since she took office in 2016. 
""The rise of China has posed a threat to all countries, and Taiwan is facing the biggest threat,"" Chen Ou-po of the majority Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) told parliament after the bill was passed. 
""Taiwan is on the frontline of Chinese infiltration and urgently needs the anti-infiltration law to protect people's rights."" 
Lawmakers of Tsai's DPP backed the bill, which passed 67 to zero, despite opposition criticism of it as a ""political tool"" to gain votes before the election.
Lawmakers of the main opposition Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China, did not participate in the vote.
China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office, in a statement carried by state media, said the DPP was seeking electoral gain from the move and creating enmity across the Taiwan Strait.
""We sternly warn the DPP, blood is thicker than water for the compatriots from both sides of the strait, who protect and help each other: this is something no force can change,"" it said.
The law gives legal teeth to efforts to stop China funding activities on the island, such as lobbying or election campaigns. It carries a maximum penalty of seven years in jail and will take effect after Tsai signs it into law in January.
China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
The Kuomintang has said it supports efforts to protect Taiwan from infiltration, but accused the DPP of rushing through the legislation for electoral gain, calling it a threat to Taiwan's democracy.
Several Kuomintang lawmakers staged a sit-in protest in front of the speaker's podium during the parliamentary session, holding signs that read ""Objecting to bad law"" and ""Damaging human rights"" while wearing black masks that read ""Objection"".
A handful of supporters from pro-China political parties protested outside parliament, calling lawmakers to withdraw what they see as legislation that ""ruins"" cross-Strait exchanges.
China said last week the DPP was trying to ""blatantly reverse over"" democracy with the bill. In response, Tsai said it was hypocritical of an autocratic China that lacks democracy, human rights or freedom of speech to use the language of democracy to criticize the proposal.

1478,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 04:30AM ET</span>",Thousands trapped on Australian beaches by dangerous bushfires,"By Sonali Paul and Swati Pandey
MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Thousands swarmed to beaches on Australia's east coast on Tuesday to escape fierce wildfires bearing down on several seaside towns, as the government readied naval vessels and military helicopters to aid firefighting and evacuations.
Government officials called for Australian military support and assistance from U.S. and Canadian fire crews as authorities confirmed two people had died overnight, taking to 11 the total deaths in wildfires since the beginning of October. 
The huge bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres), with new blazes sparked into life almost daily by extremely hot and windy conditions in bushland left tinder dry after a three-year drought.
Fueled by searing temperatures and high winds, more than 200 fires are now burning across the southeastern states of New South Wales and Victoria, threatening several towns and snapping their power, mobile and internet links.
""This is absolutely one of the worst fire seasons we've seen,"" Shane Fitzsimmons, commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, told a briefing in Sydney. 
""It's going to be a very long, difficult dangerous night still ahead. It's going to be another difficult day again tomorrow.""
Authorities said the main firefront was moving up the coast and warned those in its path to seek shelter close to the beach.
About 4,000 people in the town of Mallacoota in Victoria headed to the waterfront after the main road was cut off. Those who could not make it there scrambled for shelter in a gymnasium and other public buildings, as emergency sirens wailed.
Some of those trapped in the town posted images of blood-red, smoke-filled skies on social media. One beachfront photograph showed people lying shoulder-to-shoulder on the sand, some wearing gas masks.
It looked ""a lot like Armageddon,"" said David Jeffrey, the owner of the Wave Oasis guesthouse, adding, ""It's terrifying.""
Fisherman Steve Casement said he had lost his house in Mallacoota to the fires.
""We are stuck here now,"" he told Reuters by telephone. ""Everyone is pretty shocked at the moment, most of my mates are in the same position.
""Right now, I am on a trailer watching the town burn down, listening to gas bottles explode at some poor bugger's home and seeing smoke all around me.""
Authorities said that by late afternoon the worst danger had passed.
DARKNESS IN THE AFTERNOON 
Several hundreds of kilometers north, the Jervis Bay tourist spot famed for having the whitest sand beach in the world, was shrouded in darkness in the afternoon as massive fires burned, with conditions expected to worsen.
The blazes were also generating their own weather patterns, with erratic winds, dry lightning and a significantly faster spread in different direction, fire authorities said.
Ellie Morello took refuge at a beachside motel with her mother, some neighbors, friends at pets as fires approached Batemans Bay, a town on the New South Wales coast. 
""My throat's hurting from the smoke,"" she told Reuters by telephone. ""Burned leaves and sparks were falling on me like rain.""
Another small fire was closing in behind her as she spoke, she added. 
""Helicopters are flying right overhead and dropping ocean waters a couple of hundred meters from where I am. But we have nowhere to go so we are still here.""
Morello and others said they had run out of food and were unable to replenish supplies as shops had shut.
James Findlay, a Melbourne-based broadcaster, said his parents' home in the town was gutted after palm trees on the lawn caught fire. The couple were vacationing in New Zealand.
""There were a lot of family heirlooms in there,"" he told Reuters. ""A lot of priceless memories.""
The fires have been spread across four states, with fronts stretching hundreds of kilometers in some cases, affecting many towns and rural areas. 
The two people who died overnight were believed to have been a father and son protecting their property near the town of Cobargo in New South Wales, police said, with a third missing, feared dead, while in Victoria, four more were unaccounted for.
Bushfires burned on the outskirts of Sydney, cloaking the harbor city in smoke ahead of a fireworks display planned for New Year's Eve.
Authorities said the fireworks would go ahead, despite some public calls for cancellation in solidarity with fire-hit areas in the state.

""Many of us have mixed feelings about this evening, but the important thing we take out of this is that we're a resilient state,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters.

1479,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 04:25AM ET</span>",Bavarian leader Soeder quashes talk of German chancellery run,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Bavarian leader Markus Soeder has dismissed speculation that he will run for chancellor, a month after giving a speech to Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) that re-ignited debate over who should succeed her as German leader.
Soeder, leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Merkel's CDU, delighted the CDU congress with a speech that raised hopes he would revive the fortunes of their alliance before Merkel, 65, steps down.
But Soeder, the Bavarian state premier, told the media group RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland in comments published on Tuesday that he was happy in his current role, putting the spotlight on Merkel's protege, Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer.
""My mother always said: 'Cobbler, stick to your trade.' And that's Bavaria for me. My dream job is here,"" Soeder said, adding that ""Germans are really quite fond of the Bavarians"".
""But whenever they have the impression that a Bavarian wants to become chancellor, they worry that the Hofbraeuhaus (brewery) will be the future seat of government,"" he added - a reference to the beer halls and gardens that to many symbolize Bavaria.
No chancellor has ever come from the CSU, although Franz Josef Strauss and Edmund Stoiber of the CSU were candidates in 1980 and 2002 respectively. Both elections were won by the Social Democrats.
Merkel, in power since 2005, has said she will not seek office again at the next national election, due in 2021. She helped Kramp-Karrenbauer, 57, become CDU leader with an eye on 2020, when the CSU-CDU will decide on a chancellor candidate.
But Kramp-Karrenbauer has made several gaffes since taking over as CDU leader last December that have hurt her popularity and raised questions about her suitability to be the next chancellor.
Soeder set out clear criteria for the Union's chancellor candidate: ""Ultimately, it has to be the person with the greatest chance of success. The spirit of the times, the program and the person must fit together,"" he said."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean prosecutors indicted former Justice Minister Cho Kuk on Tuesday on a dozen charges including bribery, two months after he resigned over a scandal involving family investment and university admissions for his children.
The accusations are a setback for President Moon Jae-in after the liberal leader named Cho, a former top aide, to the cabinet post to lead reform of the prosecutors' office, which critics saw as being susceptible to political pressure.
The Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office indicted Cho and his wife on Tuesday morning over family investment and use of their position to gain the admissions for the children, it said in a statement.
Cho faces a dozen charges, ranging from bribery and document fraud to manipulation of evidence and violations of public service ethics law, it added.
Together with his wife, Chung Kyung-shim, he is being prosecuted for falsifying documents regarding family investments and efforts to gain university admissions.
Cho will remain free as he stands trial. Chung, who is also a university professor, was arrested in October on the same charges. 
Cho's lawyer, Kim Chil-joon, did not immediately respond to telephone calls or a text message to seek comment.
The Yonhap news agency quoted him as saying the prosecutors had handed down ""a political indictment based on their imagination and fiction"".
Moon's office called the investigation result ""meager"" and said it would deepen people's distrust of the prosecutors.
""The investigation shook the president's authority,"" said Yoon Do-han, Moon's press secretary. ""The result raised questions about the intent of the investigation.""
Cho's resignation and indictment were a spectacular downfall for the former star legal scholar known for progressive thinking who was one of Moon's closest political allies and viewed by some as a potential presidential successor. 
Moon came to power in 2017, promising to clean up corruption after weeks of large street protests led to the impeachment of predecessor Park Geun-hye. 
Cho stepped down in October after just one month in office, saying the graft scandal around his family had become a political burden for Moon's government. 
His appointment was followed by street protests for and against the president on a scale not seen since 2017, hitting Moon's public support ratings.

1483,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 31, 2019 01:55AM ET</span>",North Korea's Kim to unveil 'new path' in New Year speech after U.S. misses deadline,"By Hyonhee Shin
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is set to make a closely watched New Year address on Wednesday which is likely to offer a glimpse of a ""new path"" he has vowed to take if the United States fails to meet his deadline to soften its stance over denuclearization.
The New Year address is expected to touch upon a wide range of issues from foreign affairs and military development to the economy and education.
In his 2019 speech, Kim said he might have to change course if Washington sticks to its pressure campaign and demands unilateral action, while stressing a ""self-reliant"" economy, a drive he has launched amid tightening sanctions.
The United States was on track to ignore a year-end deadline set by Kim, which Washington has downplayed as artificial, to show more flexibility to reopen talks aimed at dismantling North Korea's nuclear and missile programs.
The upcoming speech is expected to be the culmination of an ongoing meeting of the ruling Workers' Party's 7th Central Committee, a key policy-making body, which Kim convened on Saturday. It was still under way on Tuesday, state media said.
Discussions at the gathering remain largely unknown, but official media KCNA said on Tuesday that Kim spent seven hours during a Monday session discussing state, economic and military building. On Sunday, he called for ""positive and offensive measures"" to ensure the country's security.
""The Central Committee plenary meeting is meant to legitimize the process behind the policy decisions Kim Jong-un will announce in his New Year speech,"" said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha Womans University in Seoul.
""This meeting is to provide political justification for the economic and security policies Pyongyang will pursue in 2020.""
North Korea has provided few hints for what the ""new path"" may involve, but U.S. military commanders said Pyongyang next move could include the testing of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which it has halted since 2017, alongside nuclear bomb tests.
U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien warned Washington would be ""extraordinarily disappointed"" if North Korea tests a long-range or nuclear missile, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he hoped it would choose peace over confrontation.
""We still maintain our view that we can find a path forward to convince the leadership in North Korea that their best course of action is to create a better opportunity for their people by getting rid of their nuclear weapons. That's our mission set,"" Pompeo told Fox News on Monday.
The U.S. Air Force flew an RC-135 surveillance plane over South Korea on Monday and Tuesday, according to military flight tracker Aircraft Spots.
Despite mounting speculation over a potential military provocation, any restart of an ICBM test would risk a personal relationship with Trump, which Pyongyang has repeatedly touted while denouncing Pompeo and other aides, analysts say.
Cho Tae-yong, a former South Korean deputy national security advisor, said Kim had few options that can leave the Trump ties intact.
""In any case, North Korea would add a lot of caveats before and after testing to make sure they're not intent on destroying the negotiating table and it was the Americans who betrayed them,"" Cho told Reuters."

The remarks follow comments by Singapore's envoys in letters to Britain's Economist magazine and the Washington Post newspaper that the law, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), does not curb free speech.
The law empowers ministers to ask online media platforms and users to carry corrections or remove content the government deems false.
In Tuesday's letter, Foo Teow Lee, Singapore's consul-general in Hong Kong, said the South China Morning Post reported ""untrue"" accusations regarding how the city-state was wielding the law.
""In every case where we have issued correction notices to online posts, we have detailed the falsehoods as well as the public interest involved.""
The three-month-old law has been used four times since Nov. 25, with three figures linked to the opposition and an opposition party being told their online posts must carry a banner stating they contain false information.
In one case,  Facebook Inc  (NASDAQ:FB) issued a correction notice on a user's post at the government's request, after the user refused to do so.
Rights groups fear the law may curb free speech, and opposition politicians say it could give the government too much power as elections loom.
Singapore's next general elections must be held by early 2021, but the government is widely expected to call for a vote within the next few months.
""We have not restricted free debate,"" Foo said, adding that none of the statements that triggered action under the law had been removed.
""Surely, giving readers more information, and enabling them to decide for themselves where the truth lies, can only enhance public debate.""
The SCMP did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from Reuters.
Singapore's government says the financial hub is vulnerable to misleading and inaccurate news because of social sensitivities arising from its mixed ethnic and religious population, and widespread internet access."
1485,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 11:56PM ET</span>",A plateful of plastic: Visualizing the microplastic we consume,"(Reuters) - Microscopic pieces of plastic have been discovered in the most remote locations, from the depths of the ocean to Arctic ice - and in our bodies as we breathe in and eat microplastic, and drink plastic-infused water every day.
People could be ingesting the equivalent of a credit card of plastic a week, a recent study by WWF International concluded, mainly in drinking water but also via food like shellfish, which tend to be eaten whole so the plastic in their digestive systems is also consumed.
Reuters used the findings of the study to illustrate what this amount of plastic actually looks like over various periods of time. (Open https://graphics.reuters.com/ENVIRONMENT-PLASTIC/0100B4TF2MQ/index.html in an external browser to see a visualization of the amount of microplastic we consume.)
Plastic production has surged in the last 50 years, leading to the widespread use of inexpensive disposable products that are having a devastating effect on the environment, cluttering beaches and choking marine wildlife.
Plastic does not biodegrade. Instead, it breaks down into smaller pieces, and ultimately ends up everywhere, including in the food chain.
In a week, we ingest a plastic bottle cap's worth, and in six months, we consume a cereal bowl full.
This may not sound like much, but it can add up. At this rate of consumption, in a decade, we could be eating 2.5 kg in plastic.
And over a lifetime, we consume about 20 kg (44 lb) of microplastic.
We also don't fully know what impact this ingestion of micro and nano-sized plastic particles has on our health, said Thava Palanisami of Australia's University of Newcastle, who worked on the WWF study.
""All we know is that we are ingesting it and that it has the potential to cause toxicity. That is definitely a cause for concern,"" he said."
1486,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 10:18PM ET</span>",China rattles saber - and offers friendship - days before Taiwan's elections,"By Ben Blanchard
BEIJING (Reuters) - With just days to go before Taiwan's elections, its giant neighbor is trying a push-and-pull strategy on the island Beijing claims as Chinese territory, rattling its saber while trying to coax electors with outwardly friendlier policies.
Taiwan, which says it is an independent country, has long been wary of Chinese attempts to sway its elections in favor of candidates who may look more kindly upon Beijing.
Fear of China has become a major element in the campaign, boosted not only by the anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong but also by a speech Chinese President Xi Jinping gave in January outlining China's ""reunification"" agenda, including threats of force.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and her team are pressing home a message that people need to ""protect"" Taiwan from China when they vote in the Jan. 11 presidential and parliamentary election.
On Thursday, Taiwan's Defence Ministry said China had sailed another carrier group through the Taiwan Strait just weeks after the last mission.
Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu quickly took to Twitter to denounce it.
""There it goes again!"" he wrote. ""Military threats like this only toughen Taiwan's determination to defend itself and preserve regional peace and stability.""
A few days before that, retired but influential Chinese General Wang Hongguang outlined at a state-media organized forum in Beijing how China could bring Taiwan to its knees by invading its outlying islands and ""terrifying"" Taipei into submission.
At the same time, China has rolled out policies promising better treatment for the Taiwanese business community, which has invested billions in China, and on Saturday revised a law to give those promises a firmer legal basis.
China has also encouraged Taiwanese abroad, even in places where Taiwan has its own representative offices, to seek consular help from Chinese embassies. 
Taiwan says China has sinister intentions, and it must defend its freedoms.
Taiwan only enjoys democracy now after decades of struggle, Tsai's running mate, William Lai, told supporters on Saturday.
""How can we go backwards, and become a second Hong Kong or Tibet?"" he said.
China has ramped up pressure on Tsai since she won office in 2016, cutting off talks and flying bombers around Taiwan, believing she wants to push for the island's formal independence.
Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country: the Republic of China, its official name.
China may have overreached recently, said one senior foreign envoy in Taipei, describing Xi's January speech as effectively ""Xi campaigning for Tsai"" because of how badly it was received in Taiwan.
'WE WOULD WIN'
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Beijing doesn't see it that way. 
Jin Canrong, Deputy Dean of the School of International Studies at Beijing's elite Renmin University and a government adviser, said Xi's speech marked a shift in policy away from preventing independence to actively promoting ""reunification"".
China is confident that it could successfully use force against Taiwan, he added.
""China really does have the military ability, which is the say the armed ability, to resolve the Taiwan issue,"" Jin said. ""Although we would pay a price, in the end we would win.""
Any invasion would be bloody and difficult, as Taiwan's military is well-armed, though the island could probably not hold out for long unless U.S. forces came quickly to their aid, military experts have said.
Opposition presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu of the Kuomintang (KMT) party, which favors close ties with China and who is trailing in the polls, says the best way to deal with China is to talk to Beijing and stop demonizing the Chinese for electoral gain.
Han adviser Su Chi, a former general secretary of Taiwan's National Security Council, said he believed Xi was actually a ""dove among the hawks"" when it came to Taiwan and wanted a peaceful solution.
""There are loud voices in the mainland for using force to reunify Taiwan, especially in the People's Liberation Army. I think he (Xi) doesn't really want this,"" Su said.
But Tsai's returning to office would not necessarily mean relations with China would continue to worsen, as Beijing may realize it must talk to her, said senior legislator Lo Chih-cheng of the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP).
""If our party or our president continues to be in power, eventually China has to come to terms with the incumbent government. They refuse to talk to the DPP because they believe the KMT had a chance to come back,"" he told Reuters at his campaign office in a Taipei suburb.

""After seeing the probable defeat of the KMT, leaders in Beijing may believe that in the foreseeable future the KMT may not come back to power again,"" he added. ""So it might be reasonable or sensible for them to come to terms with the DPP government.""

The bombing was the deadliest in more than two years in a country wrecked by nearly three decades of Islamist violence and clan warfare. 
In an audio message, al Qaeda-allied al Shabaab claimed responsibility for the bombing at the busy Ex-Control checkpoint northwest of Mogadishu. 
""The blast targeted a convoy of Turkish and Somali forces and they suffered great loss,"" Ali Mohamud Rage, al Shabaab's spokesman said in the message. 
The National Intelligence and Security Agency did not name the country that it said was involved in the blast. ""A foreign country planned the massacre of the Somalis in Mogadishu on 28 Dec 2019,"" it said in a tweet.
NISA also said it would use assistance from an unnamed foreign intelligence organization in its investigation. 
Rage accused Turkey of ""taking all resources of Somalia"" and vowed to continue targeting their personnel in the country.
""We shall always fight...the Turkish who work with the
apostate government of Turkey. We are not against innocent
Turkish Muslim citizens,"" he said. 
Two of those killed were Turkish nationals. A small team of Turkish engineers was present at the time of the blast, constructing a road into the city.
In recent years, Somalia has become an arena for military and diplomatic rivalry between Turkey and Qatar on one side and Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on the other. 
Al Shabaab frequently carries out bombings to try to undermine Somalia's central government, which is backed by the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping troops.

The most deadly attack blamed on al Shabaab was in 2017 when a truck bomb exploded next to a fuel tanker in Mogadishu, killing nearly 600.

The victims of Sunday's shooting, identified as Anton Wallace, 64, of Fort Worth and Richard White, 67, of River Oaks, were also members of the civilian security force at West Freeway Church of Christ, the state's attorney general said. 
Jack Wilson, the head of the security detail, fired a single shot that took down the gunman, who has been identified by authorities as Keith Thomas Kinnunen, 43, of River Oaks.
Wallace was serving communion at the church in the Fort Worth suburb of White Settlement and was approached twice by the suspect in the moments before the gunfire rang out.
""When he sat back down the second time, shortly after that, he stood up, turned, and produced a shotgun,"" Wilson told NBC News. 
Wilson and White began ""drawing our weapons. Richard did get his gun out of the holster. He was, I think, able to get a shot off, but it ended up going into the wall. The shooter had turned and shot him and then shot Tony and then started to turn to go toward the front of the auditorium,"" Wilson told NBC.
""I fired one round. The subject went down.""
Kinnunen was not a regular at the church and raised suspicion when he walked in wearing the wig and fake beard that he kept adjusting, Wilson said.
The reason for Kinnunen's actions are unclear. State Attorney General Ken Paxton told a news conference that the gunman may have been mentally ill.
TRUMP PRAISES ARMED 'HEROES'
The attack and response by armed civilians were likely to further inflame a nationwide debate over gun violence ahead of the 2020 presidential campaign. 
""Our prayers are with the families of the victims and the congregation of yesterday’s church attack,"" President Donald Trump said on Twitter.
""It was over in 6 seconds thanks to the brave parishioners who acted to protect 242 fellow worshippers. Lives were saved by these heroes, and Texas laws allowing them to carry arms!,"" Trump said.
Local TV station NBC DFW, citing unidentified law enforcement sources, said Kinnunen had a criminal record that included charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2009. A Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman declined to comment. 
Texas allows concealed carry in places of worship under a law that took effect in September. It was passed following a shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, in 2017 that killed 26 people.
Paxton encouraged other states to allow citizens to carry concealed weapons for defense in case of active shooters.
Wilson had previously trained other churchgoers to use firearms, and had his own shooting range, Paxton said.
But gun control advocates and some religious leaders have argued such laws have no place in houses of worship.

""Instead of looking for a success story in a tragedy, lawmakers should be talking about how they can prevent gun violence in the first place,"" said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.

There were no details of the scale of the deployment or the clashes around el-Geneina, but information minister Faisal Saleh said the head of Sudan's transitional ruling council and the prime minister would visit the city. Aircraft would be sent to evacuate the wounded to the capital, Khartoum, he said.
A resident from el-Geneina told Reuters that the violence flared after a soldier from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) was stabbed to death with two of his relatives in apparent retaliation for incidents in which locals had been hit by cars.
On Monday Arab groups responded to the soldier's death by raiding camps for internally displaced people near el-Geneina, killing people and livestock both in el-Geneina and the camps, the resident said. A second resident confirmed the revenge attacks.
It was unclear how many people had been killed and injured. The regional government declared a curfew across West Darfur.
Sudan's transitional authorities, who took power after former President Omar al-Bashir was overthrown in April following a popular uprising, have been holding talks with rebel groups to try to end conflicts in several areas of the country, including Darfur.
Conflict broke out in Darfur in 2003 after mostly non-Arab rebels rose up against Khartoum. Up to 300,000 people have been killed and 2.7 million displaced, according to U.N. estimates.
Government forces and mainly Arab militias known as the Janjaweed -- some of whose men were later incorporated in the RSF -- were accused of committing atrocities during the conflict, accusations that authorities at the time denied."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Monday filed hate crime charges against a man accused of going on a stabbing rampage during a Hanukkah celebration at a rabbi's home north of New York City, saying the suspect kept journals containing references to Adolf Hitler and ""Nazi Culture.""
The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York filed the charges. A day earlier the suspect, Grafton Thomas, was arraigned on five counts of attempted murder in a state court in the town of Ramapo.
Thomas is accused of stabbing five people on Saturday night with what the criminal complaint described as a ""machete"" after bursting into a Hanukkah celebration that included dozens of people at Rabbi Chaim Rottenberg's home in Monsey, about 30 miles (48 km) north of New York City. The town is in Rockland County, home to a large Orthodox Jewish community. 
The suspect was expected to appear at a federal court in White Plains on Monday afternoon to face five counts of obstruction of free exercise of religious beliefs involving an attempt to kill and use of a dangerous weapon resulting in bodily harm. 
Handwritten journals confiscated from the suspect's Greenwood Lake, New York, home contained anti-Semitic sentiments including ""referring to 'Adolf Hitler' and 'Nazi culture'"" as well as a drawing of a swastika, FBI agent Julie Brown said in the complaint. She said his cell phone was used to search ""Why did Hitler hate the Jews"" on Nov. 9, Dec. 3, Dec. 7 and Dec. 16.
Brown also said the phone showed searches for Jewish temples in Elizabeth, New Jersey and Staten Island, both on Dec. 18, and for prominent American companies founded by Jews on Dec. 27. 
The following day, Dec. 28, the phone was used to access an article headlined ""New York City increased police presence in Jewish neighborhoods after Possible Anti-Semitic Attacks. Here's what's to know.""
The complaint identifies the victims of Saturday's attack only by initials. Four of the five people stabbed were released after being treated at a local hospital. One was still hospitalized with a skull fracture, the New York Times quoted officials as saying. 
'SCOURGE OF HATE'
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo denounced ""a scourge of hate in this country"".
""Its ignorance is intolerance. But it's also illegal. And it's spreading,"" Cuomo told CNN a day after he called the stabbing an act of domestic terrorism. 
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio pointed to a ""national crisis of anti-Semitism"" in an interview with MSNBC.
Thomas' family said through his attorney he had a long history of mental illness, no known history of anti-Semitism and no prior convictions.
On Friday, New York City's police department said it was stepping up patrols in heavily Jewish neighborhoods. Commissioner Dermot Shea told a Sunday news conference the city had seen a 21% increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes this year.
These included an incident last Monday in which a 65-year-old man was reportedly punched and kicked by an assailant yelling an anti-Semitic slur, followed a day later by attacks on two other men in Brooklyn.
""New York is facing a growing problem of #antiSemitic incidents. The pattern is undeniable,"" Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO of the Anti-Defamation League wrote on Twitter. ""The #antiSemitic stabbing in Monsey is the latest horrific attack to shake our community. There is an absolute need for greater action to protect the Jewish community."" 
Attacks on synagogues have shaken the Jewish community elsewhere in the country.
On the last day of Passover in April, a gunman killed a rabbi and wounded three people during Sabbath services at Congregation Chabad in Poway, near San Diego. 

Six months before that, a gunman killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history.

The attack occurred in Apetina, in a remote forested area a few miles from the Ugandan border where attacks by the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), a Ugandan Islamist group, have increased since Oct. 30, when the army launched a campaign to root them out.
Democratic Republic of Congo President Felix Tshisekedi has said the campaign has dismantled nearly all of the ADF's sanctuaries, but attacks continue unabated. Earlier this month, 22 were killed in ambushes on two villages in the same region.
""There was a raid by ADF rebels in...​​Apetina on Sunday night. These rebels killed 18 people and burned down eight houses,"" said Donat Kibwana, the administrator of Beni territory.
He said that the army was alerted to the attack but arrived after the killings had occurred. CEPADHO, a human rights group, also said that 18 had been killed.
The Congolese government has blamed the ADF for attacks going back years, including dozens of night-time massacres since 2014 that have killed hundreds of civilians. But repeated military operations have failed to fully eradicate the group.
The recent surge in violence has complicated efforts to stamp out an Ebola outbreak in the area. Infections have started to rise in areas health workers have been unable to access because of insecurity.
The U.S. Treasury this month imposed sanctions on six members of the ADF, including its leader Musa Baluku. Islamic State has claimed some ADF attacks this year, but researchers say there is a lack of hard evidence linking the two groups."
1493,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 03:31PM ET</span>",Iraq condemns U.S. air strikes as unacceptable and dangerous,"By Ahmed Aboulenein and Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi on Monday condemned U.S. air strikes on bases of Iranian-backed Iraqi militia, a move that could plunge Iraq further into the heart of a proxy conflict between the United States and Iran.
The U.S. military carried out air strikes on Sunday against the Kataib Hezbollah militia in response to the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, officials said.
At least 25 militia fighters were killed and 55 wounded.
""The prime minister described the American attack on the Iraqi armed forces as an unacceptable vicious assault that will have dangerous consequences,"" his office said.
The air strikes will force Iraq to reconsider working with the U.S.-led international coalition against Islamic State, the National Security Council said in a statement.
Iraq's foreign ministry said it would summon the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad to voice Baghdad's disapproval.
Tensions have risen between Iran and the United States - Iraq's two main allies - since last year when President Donald Trump pulled out of world powers' 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran and reimposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic.
Earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed Iranian-backed forces - which helped Baghdad turn the tables on Islamic State militants and are integrated into the Iraqi security apparatus - for attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq. He said any attacks by Tehran or proxies harming Americans or allies would be ""answered with a decisive U.S. response.""
U.S. officials said Washington had displayed patience amid escalating provocations from Iran and its allies, but that it was time to re-establish deterrence against aggression. 
""After so many attacks it was important for the president to direct our armed forces to respond in a way that the Iranian regime will understand,"" U.S. special representative for Iran Brian Hook said in a news briefing.
Iran denies involvement in attacks on U.S. forces and has condemned the air raids as ""terrorism"".
""This claim without any evidence cannot justify bombing and killing people in violation of international law,"" Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei said.
""NATURAL RIGHT""
The strikes come at a time of protests in Iraq with thousands taking to the streets to condemn, among other things, militias such as Kataib Hezbollah and their Iranian patrons which support Abdul Mahdi's government.
They also demand an overhaul of a political system they see as corrupt and keeping most Iraqis in poverty.
At least 450 people have been killed as security forces and militias have sought to quell the protests, which forced Abdul Mahdi to resign. He remains in a caretaker capacity.
About 400 people in Basra protested against the air strikes, demonstrating in support of the militias.
The raids brought threats of reprisal. ""Our response will be very tough on the American forces in Iraq,"" militia commander Jamal Jaafar Ibrahimi, also known as Abu Mahdi al-Mohandes, said on Sunday.
Mohandes is a senior commander of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), an umbrella grouping of paramilitary organisations mostly consisting of Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim militias that were integrated into Iraq's armed forces.
He is also one of Iran's most powerful allies in Iraq and formerly headed Kataib Hezbollah, which he founded.
His threat was met positively by his Iranian backers.
""Taking revenge and responding to this crime are the natural right of the Iraqi nation and those groups that defend Iraq,"" said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which trains some Iraqi militias including Kataib Hezbollah.
Iraqi security sources said U.S. forces in northern Iraq were ramping up security.
The PMF bolstered Iraq's security forces during their battle to retake a third of the country from Islamic State insurgents.
They were later folded into Iraq's official security structure and wield major political influence.
The Iraqi government is in control of the militias in ""95% of cases"", Abdul Mahdi said at a televised cabinet meeting. 
He said was told about the air strikes hours before in a phone call with U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper and tried to warn the militia.
REGIONAL RIVALRIES
The Iraqi government cannot do much because of its caretaker status and has to take its lead from parliament, Abdul Mahdi told his ministers.
Iraq's Fatih alliance, a political bloc representing the militias that holds the second largest number of seats in parliament, condemned the air strikes.
Their main rival, populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr who leads parliament's largest grouping, said he was willing to work with them to end the U.S. military presence in Iraq. But he also called on them to reign in their militias so as not to provide an excuse for further U.S. attacks.
Iraq's influential top Shi'ite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, condemned the strikes but his office also denounced alleged attacks by Iranian-backed militias on U.S. personnel.
He urged Iraqi authorities to prevent such attacks and ""ensure Iraq does not become a field for settling regional and international scores and that others do not interfere in its internal affairs"".
Abdul Mahdi said his government's policy was to keep Iraq out of regional alliances and away from war.
Any escalation risks Iraq becoming the battlefield for a proxy war between the United States and Iran, which would also ensnare regional allies of both sides.
Lebanon's powerful Shi'ite group Hezbollah, backed by Iran, also condemned the air strikes.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said he congratulated Pompeo ""on the important operation by the United States against Iran and its proxies in the region"". 

Russia, which like Iran and Hezbollah backs President Bashar al-Assad's government in Syria's civil war, said the strikes were unacceptable and counterproductive. The Syrian government also denounced the air strikes.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 03:03PM ET</span>",Gunman in Texas church had trained worshippers to shoot: state prosecutor,"(Reuters) - The gunman who opened fire in a Texas church on Sunday, killing two before dying from gunshot wounds, owned a shooting range and had taught its parishioners how to shoot, the Texas Attorney General said on Monday.
A livestream video caught the terrifying moment when the man, whom authorities have not identified by name, stood next the pews wearing a dark hood and started firing a long gun before the church's volunteer security team members shot him.
""My understanding is he was a reserve deputy and had significant training, his own shooting range and taught other people how to shoot, and taught many people in this church how to be prepared,"" Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton told reporters on Monday.
The incident took place in White Settlement, a suburb northwest of Fort Worth, at the West Freeway Church of Christ.
Local TV station NBC DFW, citing unnamed law enforcement sources, identified the gunman as Keith Kinnunen, a 43-year-old resident of River Oaks, Texas, who had a criminal record including charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon in 2009. A Texas Department of Public Safety spokeswoman did not immediately confirm that. 
The Fort Worth Fire Department said three people, including the suspected shooter, were transported from the scene in critical condition on Sunday. Two, including the suspect, died en route to the hospital, said Macara Trusty, a spokeswoman for local emergency services provider MedStar, said in a phone interview. The third later died of their wounds, the Dallas Morning News reported. 
Two more people sustained minor injuries as they ducked for cover inside the church, Trusty said.
SIX SECONDS
Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick praised the church's volunteer security guards for taking down the shooter.
""Because of the quick action of these two men, this evil event was over in six seconds,"" Patrick said in a statement on Sunday.
One of the two guards said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post that he was acting against evil. ""The events at West Freeway Church of Christ put me in a position that I would hope no one would have to be in, but evil exists and I had to take out an active shooter in church,"" he said.
Patrick said a new state law allowing concealed carry in places of worship enabled the parishioners to stop the gunman. The law, which took effect in September, was passed in the wake of a shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs in 2017 that left 26 dead.
Paxton praised the law and encouraged other states to allow citizens to carry concealed weapons for defense in cases of active shooters. Gun control advocates and some religious leaders have criticized such laws, arguing that weapons have no place in sacred houses of worship.

""I do hope that through this tragedy, more churches will prepare the way this church did, not just in Texas but really across the nation,"" Paxton said. ""This is the model for the future.""

1495,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 03:03PM ET</span>","CIA devised way to restrict missiles given to allies, researcher says","By Raphael Satter
LEIPZIG, Germany (Reuters) - The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has devised technology to restrict the use of anti-aircraft missiles after they leave American hands, a researcher said, a move that experts say could persuade the United States that it would be safe to disseminate powerful weapons more frequently.
The new technology is intended for use with shoulder-fired missiles called Man-Portable Air-Defense Systems (MANPADS), Dutch researcher Jos Wetzels told a cybersecurity conference https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHj_iQZ9pTk in Leipzig, Germany on Saturday. Wetzels said the system was laid out in a batch of CIA documents published by WikiLeaks in 2017 but that the files were mislabeled and attracted little public attention until now.
Wetzels said the CIA had come up with a ""smart arms control solution"" that would restrict the use of missiles ""to a particular time and a particular place."" The technique, referred to as ""geofencing,"" blocks the use of a device outside a specific geographic area.
Weapons that are disabled when they leave the battlefield could be an attractive feature. Supplied to U.S. allies, the highly portable missiles can help win wars, but they have often been lost, sold, or passed to extremists. 
For example, Stinger MANPADS supplied by the United States are credited with helping mujahedeen rebels drive Soviet forces out of Afghanistan in a conflict that spanned the 1980s and 1990s. But U.S. officials have since spent billions of dollars https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2007-09/features/countering-manpads-threat-strategies-success to clear the missiles from the country - and from other conflict zones around the world.
Wetzels said it was unclear whether the CIA's design ever left the drawing board or where it was meant to have been deployed, but he noted that the apparent period of development in the documents' metadata - 2014 to 2015 - roughly coincided with media reports about the deployment of MANPADS to rebels in Syria. Geofencing might have been seen as a way of ensuring the missiles were used on the Syrian battlefield and nowhere else, he said.
The CIA declined to comment.
Outside experts who reviewed Wetzels' analysis said they found it plausible.
N.R. Jenzen-Jones, who directs the British-based ARES intelligence consultancy, said geofencing has long been discussed as a safeguard to allow powerful weapons ""into the hands of friendly forces operating in high-risk environments.""
Wetzels said geofencing was no panacea, running through a list of security vulnerabilities that could be used by insurgents to bypass the restrictions.

""It's not a watertight solution,"" he said.

MANAGUA (Reuters) - The Nicaraguan government said it freed more than 90 people on Monday who rights groups say were jailed for anti-government activity, including about a dozen people who were arrested after ferrying water to a group of mothers on hunger strike. 
Dozens of people have been jailed since April 2018, after demonstrations against President Daniel Ortega's attempt to cut welfare benefits escalated into broader protests of his rule. 
The protests also left more than 300 people dead, according to rights groups.
The interior ministry said 91 people have been released as part of a ""special act"" aimed at national reconciliation, including prominent student protester Amaya Coppens.
The Nicaraguan and Belgian national, along with a dozen other protesters, delivered water last month to nine mothers who were on a hunger strike demanding the release of their children that they consider to be political prisoners. 
The police cut off water and electricity supplies to the church in the city of Masaya soon after the hunger strike began. The mothers were later transported to a hospital. [nL2N28300X]
During the strike the government accused 13 activists who brought water to the mothers of planning to carry out terrorist attacks. 
On Monday, a video posted on social media showed Coppens waving a large blue-and-white Nicaraguan flag, chanting, ""Yes, we did it!"" 
Another freed prisoner, Olga Valle, said in a separate video: ""Families, take in your people. We left, we did it. Long live free Nicaragua."" 
The opposition Blue and White National Unity movement said about 80 people are still jailed for political reasons.

""We continue demanding the liberation of every single political prisoner,"" the grouping of opposition organizations said in a statement.

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - A Sudanese court sentenced 29 members of the national intelligence service to death by hanging on Monday over the killing of a teacher in detention in February during protests that led to the overthrow of former president Omar al-Bashir.
The group that spearheaded the protests welcomed the ruling, the first to deliver sentences over crackdowns on demonstrations in the months before and after Bashir was toppled in April.
Prosecuting members of the intelligence services is seen as a test of how far Sudan's transitional government will go to erase Bashir's legacy and challenge the security apparatus.
""This day is a victory for justice, a victory for all Sudanese and a victory for the revolution,"" teacher Ahmed al-Khair's brother Saad told reporters after the verdict. 
Thirteen defendants were sentenced to prison terms and a further four were acquitted in the ruling, which could face several stages of appeal.
The judge listed 27 agents from Kassala, capital of eastern Kassala state, who received death sentences. Another two agents from Khashm al-Qirba, the town in Kassala state where teacher Khair was killed, were also sentenced to death, a lawyer said. 
Khair's death became a rallying point during 16 weeks of protests against Bashir's rule. His family said security officials initially claimed he had died of poisoning, though days later a state investigation found he had died of injuries from beating.
Hundreds of people rallied outside the court in Omdurman where the verdict was delivered on Monday, some waving national flags or holding pictures of Khair. 
They broke into celebration after the ruling. Security forces fired tear gas to try to clear the rally and reopen roads. One woman, who suffered from asthma, died after inhaling tear gas, according to a doctors' committee linked to the anti-Bashir protests. 
The Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which spearheaded protests against Bashir, said the trial restored confidence in the judiciary. 
""With this ruling, the revolution will have paid off its debt to the martyrs a first time, to be followed as many times as the number of martyrs,"" it said.
The SPA is an important member of the Forces of Freedom and Change coalition that struck a three-year power-sharing deal with the military in August. 

Dozens of protesters were killed during crackdowns on the protests against Bashir, and dozens died when security forces cleared a sit-in pushing for further change in June.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey is considering sending allied Syrian fighters to Libya as part of planned military support for the besieged government in Tripoli, senior Turkish sources said on Monday, potentially bringing more foreign influence into the complex conflict.
President Tayyip Erdogan said last week Turkey would deploy troops to Libya after Fayez al-Serraj's internationally-recognized government requested support to fend off an offensive by General Khalifa Haftar's eastern forces.
The move is meant to protect Turkish private investment in Libya and bolster its energy claims in the Mediterranean, but could also put Ankara at odds with other foreign players in the war.
Two senior Turkish government officials and two security officials, who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said Ankara had not yet deployed any Syrian fighters to Libya.
""But evaluations are being made and meetings are being held on this issue, and there is a tendency to go in this direction,"" said one official, adding no decision had been made on numbers.
Turkey-backed Syrian fighters spearheaded a Turkish military incursion into northeast Syria in October targeting a Kurdish militia. Ankara, which opposes President Bashar al-Assad, also backs Syrian rebels in the northwest province of Idlib in Syria's nearly nine-year civil war.
It was unclear whether Ankara was mulling sending Syrian fighters as part of a first deployment into Libya.
Haftar's forces - supported by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan - have failed to reach the center of Tripoli. But they have made small gains in recent weeks with the help of Russian and Sudanese fighters, as well as drones shipped by the UAE, diplomats say.
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitor, cited sources saying 300 Turkey-backed Syrian fighters had been sent to Libya while others were training in Turkish camps.
However, a spokesman for the Turkey-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA) on Monday denied that Ankara had made a request to send FSA fighters to Libya.
A military source within the FSA said the FSA was not being deployed to Libya, but that Syrian fighters in Syria and Turkey had signed up on an individual basis, for a salary, to work as ""bodyguards"" for a Turkish security company to protect bases and headquarters which Turkish forces will use in Libya.
BUSINESS INTERESTS
Turkey's military has been involved in Syria since 2016.
""The military's experience abroad will be very useful in Libya. However, there is the possibility of using the experience of Syrian fighters as well,"" said one of the security officials.
""After parliament accepts the mandate, a step may be taken in this direction,"" the person added.
Ankara signed two accords with Libya's government last month: one on security and military cooperation and another on boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.
The maritime deal ends Turkey's isolation at sea as it ramps up offshore energy exploration that has alarmed Greece, Cyprus and others. The military deal would preserve its lone ally in the region, Tripoli, and protect investments by construction firms and other Turkish companies.
Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has said Turkey aims to prevent Libya sliding into chaos. Erdogan, who discussed the Libyan conflict with his Tunisian counterpart last week, has said a ceasefire in Libya must be set as soon as possible.
The deployment bill was sent to parliament on Monday, prompting the main opposition party to reject it on grounds it would exacerbate conflict.
The bill's text warned that Haftar's army has threatened Turkish companies in Libya and Turkish ships in the Mediterranean.
""Turkey's interests ... will be negatively impacted if attacks by the so-called Libyan National Army are not stopped and clashes become a severe civil war,"" it said.
Turkey exported $1.5 billion in jewelry, furniture, poultry and other goods to Libya last year, more than quadruple the imports of mostly metals from the North African country.
Construction firms including Ustay Yapi, Tekfen (IS:TKFEN) and Guris Insaat dominate the Turkish-Libya Business Council's board, highlighting the sector's interests there.
Mega-infrastructure projects have driven the Turkish economy's mostly booming 17 years under Erdogan."

PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the state of relations between their two countries in a phone call instigated by Putin, the White House said on Monday.
The official reason for the call, according to both sides, was for Putin to thank Trump for what White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said was ""information the United States provided that helped foil a potential holiday terrorist attack in Russia.""
No details were provided, but Russia said on Sunday it had thwarted attacks reportedly planned in St. Petersburg thanks to a tip from Washington.
Gidley said both presidents committed to continuing counterterrorism cooperation between the two countries.
""The presidents also discussed the state of relations between the United States and Russia and future efforts to support effective arms control,"" he said, an apparent reference to Trump's stated desire for a new nuclear arms control deal. 
Trump, on a two-week working vacation at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, has longed for strong U.S. relations with Russia and complained that a U.S. probe into whether his 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia had stymied him.
He has faced sweeping opposition to warmer ties with Russia from Republican and Democratic lawmakers troubled by Putin's annexation of Crimea and Russian support for separatists in eastern Ukraine, among other strains.
Some new tensions have arisen between the two countries.
Trump on Thursday warned Russia, Syria and Iran against killing civilians in Syria’s Idlib province.
Syrian and Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of targets in Idlib, the last significant rebel pocket of Syria. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recapture it.
In another potential strain, Russia joined with China on a draft proposal to the U.N. Security Council to seek a lifting of some U.N.-backed sanctions against North Korea over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

The Trump-Putin call came as the State Department announced Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will travel to Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Cyprus from Jan. 3-7.

LA PAZ/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Bolivia's interim government on Monday asked the Mexican ambassador and several Spanish officials to leave the country, raising the tension over Mexico's decision to grant asylum in its La Paz embassy to nine people including some allies of Bolivia's former socialist president, Evo Morales.
In a statement, Bolivia's conservative caretaker President Jeanine Anez said Mexican ambassador María Teresa Mercado and a number of Spanish government officials were ""persona non grata"" and asked them to leave within 72 hours.
Mexico's foreign ministry said on Monday it instructed Mercado, who has worked in the foreign service since 1982, to return to Mexico to ensure her safety. It described Bolivia's move as ""political in nature"".
On Friday, Mexico's government said Bolivian authorities had harassed and intimidated its diplomatic staff and impeded the departure of Spanish officials visiting its embassy in the capital.
A number of allies of Morales holed up in Mexico's embassy in La Paz after the long-term leftist leader resigned under pressure last month and left the country. Some of them are wanted by Bolivia's new caretaker administration.
Anez took over by default after Morales stepped down, and has made sharp policy shifts away from his socialist government, fraying ties with leftist allies in the region.
Anez said the Bolivian government would not tolerate people ""trying to cover up and protect criminals who have committed crimes of sedition, armed uprising and terrorism"" and that Bolivia would not be a ""colony"" of any other country.
According to Bolivia's government, a former senior aide to Morales, Juan Ramon Quintana, is among nine people who have taken asylum in the Mexican embassy. Some are wanted by the government for crimes including sedition and armed revolt.
Mexico said last Thursday that it was asking the International Court of Justice to mediate the dispute."

Tel Aviv Magistrate's Court deferred sentencing of Erik Lederman, 65, who under a plea bargain was spared an additional charge of criminal threats against the envoy, Marek Magierowski.
In the May 14 incident, police said Lederman struck a car carrying Magierowski, then opened the door and spat on him twice. Lederman had apologized, saying the car had honked at him and he had not known the ambassador was inside.
According to a transcript of Monday's hearing, Lederman's lawyer said his client had been aware that the car carried embassy staff ""but not necessarily the ambassador himself and his driver"".
The lawyer asked the court to consider Lederman's lack of a criminal record in sentencing, and suggested that he warranted ""non-conviction"" - under Israeli legal procedure, an accelerated expunging of the assault case from his files.
But prosecutors were opposed to this, the lawyer noted.
At the indictment stage, Lederman said he had come to the embassy to inquire about Polish restitution for his family, which had been through the Holocaust, and had been turned away. He said an embassy employee used an anti-Semitic slur when he was there - an account denied by Magierowski.
Polish-Israeli relations deteriorated this year over accusations that Warsaw has tolerated a revival of anti-Semitic behavior - something it denies - and disagreement over the degree of Polish involvement in the Nazi genocide of the Jews.
A lawyer who attended Monday's hearing on behalf of the Polish embassy voiced disappointment at not having been informed in advance of the plea bargain, saying that to have done so would have been ""collegial, at least""."

The ambassador will report back to Beijing, but both sides have decided to maintain good bilateral relations, it said.
China's embassy in Jakarta could not immediately be reached for comment.
Local fishermen saw a Chinese coastguard vessel escorting fishing boats several times in recent days and then reported what they had seen to the Maritime Security Agency, media reports said.
Indonesia's foreign ministry reiterated its stance that the country is a non-claimant state in the South China Sea and that it has no overlapping jurisdiction with China.
However, Jakarta has clashed with Beijing before over fishing rights around the Natuna Islands and has also expanded its military presence in the area.
China claims most of the South China Sea, an important trade route which is believed to contain large quantities of oil and natural gas.
Beijing has been building artificial islands in the area, developments that have irked members of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines - all members of ASEAN - and also Taiwan also have claims in the sea."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for ""positive and offensive measures"" to ensure the country's security before a year-end deadline he has set for denuclearization talks with the United States, state media KCNA said on Monday. 
Kim convened a weekend meeting of top Workers' Party officials to discuss policy matters amid rising tension over his deadline for Washington to soften its stance in stalled negotiations aimed at dismantling Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
At a Sunday session, Kim suggested action in the areas of foreign affairs, the munitions industry and armed forces, stressing the need to take ""positive and offensive measures for fully ensuring the sovereignty and security of the country,"" KCNA said, without elaborating. 
The meeting was the largest plenary session of the party's 7th Central Committee since its first gathering in 2013 under Kim, according to Seoul's Unification Ministry handling inter-Korean affairs. 
The key policymaking organ drew several hundred attendees, state television showed on Monday. The committee also met in 2018 and in April but on a much smaller scale.
""By 'positive and offensive measures,' they might mean highly provocative action against the United States and also South Korea,"" said Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean studies in Seoul. 
KCNA said the meeting was still under way. It was the first time the gathering had lasted more than one day since Kim took power in late 2011, ministry spokesman Lee Sang-min told a regular briefing. 
The United States was watching the end-of-year meeting closely and hoped North Korea would choose peace over confrontation, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Monday.
""We still maintain our view that we can find a path forward to convince the leadership in North Korea that their best course of action is to create a better opportunity for their people by getting rid of their nuclear weapons,"" Pompeo told Fox News.
North Korea has urged Washington to offer a new approach to resume negotiations, warning that it may take an unspecified ""new path"" if the United States fails to meet its expectations. 
U.S. military commanders said the move could include the testing of a long-range missile, which North Korea has suspended since 2017, along with nuclear warhead tests. 
Washington would be ""extraordinarily disappointed"" if North Korea tests a long-range or nuclear missile, White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said on Sunday, vowing to take appropriate action as a leading military and economic power.
The United States had opened channels of communication with North Korea and hoped Kim would follow through on denuclearization commitments he made at summits with U.S. President Donald Trump, O'Brien said.
A video released by the U.S. Air Force and reviewed by Reuters on Monday showed a simulation of an Aegis destroyer spotting what appeared to be a North Korean intercontinental ballistic missile being fired toward the Pacific over the skies of Japan, prompting the launch of ground interceptor missiles.
The 65-second clip was dated September and released on Dec. 2 on the website of the U.S. Defense Visual Information Distribution Service. 
A South Korean military source said while it was largely a regular promotional video, its release coincided with heightened tensions amid a recent series of North Korean weapons tests and a war of words between Pyongyang and Washington.
'INDEPENDENT ECONOMY'
North Korea's economy seemed to be another key item on the agenda for the second-day session, Yang said, with the economy hit by international sanctions over its weapons programs. 
KCNA said Kim discussed state management and economic issues in line with his campaign to build an ""independent economy."" 
Kim ""presented the tasks for urgently correcting the grave situation of the major industrial sectors of the national economy,"" KCNA said. 
In New York, U.N. Security Council members were scheduled to hold an informal meeting on Monday to contemplate a Russian and Chinese proposal to ease sanctions on North Korea.
Russia and China proposed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution this month that would lift some sanctions in a bid to kick-start the denuclearization talks.
Speaking in Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the proposal was aimed at promoting the talks process and to ""satisfy reasonable humanitarian and livelihood requirements"" from North Korea.
""China hopes that when it comes to the peninsula issue, Security Council members can assume their responsibilities and take proactive steps to support a political resolution,"" he told a daily news briefing. 
The move is seen as an attempt to create a crack in a U.S.-led global campaign to pressure North Korea to give up its weapons programs amid lackluster progress in the negotiations.

Sanctions on industries that earned North Korea hundreds of millions of dollars a year were imposed in 2016 and 2017 to cut off funding for Pyongyang's weapons programs.

1505,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 30, 2019 08:52AM ET</span>",Spain's state attorney recommends release of jailed Catalan leader,"MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's state attorney on Monday recommended the release of Catalan separatist leader Oriol Junqueras from prison in what was widely seen as a gesture of political goodwill as the Socialist Party seeks support to form a government. 
The state attorney's office asked the Supreme Court to let Junqueras go to Brussels to take his seat as a European MP. He was sentenced in October to 13 years in prison over his role in a failed 2017 bid for Catalan independence. 
Junqueras was elected to the European Parliament in May while he was awaiting the verdict in his case in jail. The European Union's top court said this month that Junqueras was entitled to immunity as an EU lawmaker.
The Spanish Supreme Court is expected to give a ruling in coming weeks.
The state attorney's opinion was widely anticipated as the Socialists are trying to persuade Junqueras's party, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) to back a Socialist-led government. 
The Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) and ERC have been meeting regularly since a Nov. 10 election that saw the Socialists emerge as the winner but fall short of a majority in a fragmented parliament.
A rapid coalition deal with the far-left Unidas Podemos party brought their total seat count to 155, still short of the 176 seats needed for a majority. After the Basque nationalist party PNV, with six lawmakers, agreed to back the Socialist-led coalition, the 13 seats held by ERC are crucial.
An ERC spokesman declined to comment on the state attorney's decision though the party's leadership is scheduled to meet on Monday afternoon, at the same time as the leaders of the Socialist Party and Unidas Podemos, Pedro Sanchez and Pablo Iglesias, have scheduled a joint press conference.
The Spanish attorney also asked the European Parliament to strip Junqueras of immunity so that the case against him would not be completely dropped, but this would require a difficult-to-achieve consensus among the 700-odd MEPs.

BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - After several attempts at landing a job in Libya's state oil industry, 22-year-old engineering graduate Belghasem Abdulsalam decided to make a living baking cakes.
Most Libyans work in the public sector but the state has been hiring less as the country has been engulfed in conflict in the years since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.
Jobs in the private sector have also become scarce, as foreign companies have left due to the deteriorating security situation.
Forced to give up his dream of working in the oil industry, Abdulsalam took the ""Benghazino chef course"" at a private training center in Benghazi to learn the confectionery trade.
He now works full time in a busy cafe in Benghazi and he gets paid every month, unlike many who work fore the cash-strapped public sector.
""The income is much better than from the government because you have your salary in your hand,"" Abdulsalam said.
The training center's owner, accountancy graduate Sara Bashir al-Zawy, 35, said young people needed to take care of themselves.
""If I had been waiting for the country to provide me with a job, I would have been unemployed at home for eight years now,"" she said.
Another alumnus of the confectionery course, 30-year-old Nabil Mohamed al-Mabrouk, started his own cake business to cater to cafes and supplement his father's state pension of 450 dinars ($321) in order to feed a family of nine.

""My hands make money,"" said Mabrouk, who has a certificate of business administration and bank financing. ""Making three to four cakes can gain me half of a state salary.""

The visit is part of a trip that includes several former Soviet republics, the U.S. State Department said.
As well as holding talks with Zelinskiy, Pompeo will also meet Ukraine's foreign and defense ministers to reaffirm U.S. support for the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the State Department said. 
Russia annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula in 2014 and since then Russian-backed rebels have been waging an insurgency in eastern Ukraine.
It was not clear if Trump's impeachment would figure as a talking point.
The Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives impeached him on Dec. 18 for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges stemming from his effort to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, a leading contender in the 2020 Democratic presidential race.
The House inquiry into the matter concluded that Trump withheld military aid from Ukraine in order to influence Kiev, sending the matter to the U.S. Senate for trial. Trump has denied any wrongdoing.
In Kiev, Pompeo will also discuss human rights, investment climate, and the government's reform agenda, the State Department said. 

He will also visit Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Cyprus on a trip from Friday through to next Tuesday.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong will end 2019 with multiple protests planned for New Year's Eve and New Year's Day aimed at disrupting festivities and shopping in the Asian financial hub, which has seen a rise in clashes between police and protesters since Christmas.
Events dubbed ""Suck the Eve"" and ""Shop With You"" are set for New Year's Eve on Tuesday in areas including the party district of Lan Kwai Fong, the picturesque Victoria Harbour, and popular shopping malls, according to notices on social media.
A pro-democracy march on Jan. 1 has been given police permission and will start from a large park in bustling Causeway Bay and end in the central business district.
Organizers Civil Human Rights Front were behind the peaceful million-plus marches in June and held a mass protest earlier in December, which they said around 800,000 people attended.
""On New Year's Day, we need to show our solidarity ... to resist the government. We hope Hong Kong people will come onto the streets for Hong Kong's future,"" said Jimmy Sham, a leader of the group.
The protests began in June in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party, and have evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement. 
Police said they would deploy crowd control patrols on Tuesday and urged marchers on Wednesday to remain peaceful.
In a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post, Police Commissioner Chris Tang thanked his frontline officers for guarding Hong Kong's ""safety and stability"" and issued a warning to protesters.
""If you use violence, you will not get public support. We, police, will do all we can to arrest you,"" Tang said.
The demonstrations planned for New Year follow a pick up in clashes since Christmas Eve, when riot police fired tear gas at thousands of protesters following scuffles in shopping malls and in a prime tourist district.
While the protests -- now in their seventh month -- have lessened in intensity and size in recent weeks, marches or rallies continue to occur almost daily.
Hundreds of people gathered in the central district on Monday night to remember people that have been killed or injured during the protests.
More than 2,000 protesters have been injured since June.
While there is no official count of deaths, student Chow Tsz-lok died after a high fall during a pro-democracy rally in November. Multiple suicides have been linked to the movement.
""For most Hong Kong people, Christmas and New Year's don't mean anything to us anymore,"" said Roger Mak, a 35-year old who attended Monday's rally. 
""What we're fighting for is our future,"" he said, adding that he planned to attend both protests scheduled this week.
Police arrested 34 over the weekend and used pepper spray to break up a gathering aimed at disrupting retail business near the border with mainland China. 
More than 6,000 protesters have been arrested since challenges began to the extradition bill, seen as an example of meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the special administrative region when Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997.
China denies the claims and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign countries including Britain and the United States for inciting unrest.
The protests have battered Hong Kong's economy, already reeling from the fallout of the U.S.-China trade war. Trade figures on Monday showed exports falling 1.4% year-on-year in November and imports dropping 5.8%, with both set for a clean sweep of negative monthly figures in 2019.
Paul Chan, the city's financial secretary, said on Sunday that a fall in GDP in the fourth quarter was ""unavoidable"".

To alleviate the ""pain"" of the economic downturn, he said the government's budget in February would focus on boosting the economy, protecting unemployment and easing the ""plight"" of the people and enterprises.

Last week, President Tayyip Erdogan said his government would seek parliamentary consent to deploy troops to Libya after Fayez al-Serraj's Government of National Accord (GNA) requested support. The GNA is fending off an offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces in the east of the North African country.
Erdogan had said on Thursday the bill would pass around Jan. 8-9. 
But Cavusoglu, after meeting with Turkish opposition leaders to seek support for the legislation, told reporters the bill would be submitted to parliament later on Monday.
""As the Foreign Ministry, we presented the mandate to the Presidency for it to be sent to the parliament. And as of today, we have learned from the President's office that the mandate will be sent to parliament with the signature of the Honourable President within the day,"" Cavusoglu said.
Earlier on Monday, Turkey's main opposition party said after talks with Cavusoglu that it opposes the bill, arguing that such a move would exacerbate the country's conflict and cause it to spread across the region. [L8N2941HH]
Cavusoglu later met with the opposition Iyi Party, which he said would evaluate the bill. 
Ankara has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations embargo, according to a U.N. report seen by Reuters last month, and has said it will continue to support the GNA. Haftar's forces have received support from Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan.

Their Santa Claus dolls, toy Christmas trees and red-and-white puppets come into high demand over the holiday season in Gaza, Bethlehem and Italy.
Though most of Gaza's 2 million population are Muslim, around 1,000 are Christian, mostly Greek Orthodox, who celebrate Christmas on Jan. 7.
""Our prophet encouraged us to respect all religions and we like to join with them in celebrating their day,"" said the group's product designer Laila Tayeh. 
Tayeh and colleagues are part of the Zaina Cooperative Association, working in a Gaza community that often restricts women's movement outside the home. 
Haneen Alsammak, the association's executive manager, said the project had given women training in carpentry and tailoring, and enabled them to leave their homes to work and spread some Christmas cheer.
""This is a message of love toward Christians inside and outside Gaza,"" she said. 
Gaza is run by the Islamist Hamas movement, which is designated a terrorist group by the West and neighboring Israel against which it has fought three wars in the past decade. 
Citing security reasons, Israel restricts movement in and out of Gaza and maintains a naval blockade of the coastal strip where the economy suffers from high unemployment and poverty.

In 2018, only 26% of Gaza women participated in the workforce, according to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics.

Turkey's foreign minister has warned that the Libyan conflict risks sliding into chaos and becoming the next Syria, as he sought to speed up domestic legislation to allow Ankara to send troops to the North African country.
Last week, Erdogan announced his government's decision to seek parliamentary consent to send troops to Libya, at the request of Tripoli.

He urged all involved parties to exercise maximum restraint, respect an international embargo for arms exports to Libya and step up efforts for a diplomatic solution.
""A further exchange was agreed to strengthen diplomatic efforts,"" the government spokesman said, adding that Merkel also discussed the developments in Syria with Erdogan and Putin during the phone calls, which took place on Sunday.

LONDON (Reuters) - Teenage climate change activist Greta Thunberg said on Monday that talking to U.S. President Donald Trump at a United Nations summit on global warming would have been a waste of time since he would not have paid any attention.
In an interview with BBC radio's Today program, for which she was the guest editor on Monday, Thunberg also said she regarded personal attacks on her as funny and that she hoped to go back to having a normal life.
A video of the 16-year-old Swedish campaigner giving Trump what media described as a ""death stare"" at a U.N. climate summit in New York in September went viral on social media. Trump has questioned climate science and is pulling the United States out of the 2015 Paris Agrement on global warming.
Asked what she would have said to the president if they had spoken, Thunberg said: ""Honestly, I don't think I would have said anything because obviously he's not listening to scientists and experts, so why would he listen to me?
""So I probably wouldn't have said anything, I wouldn't have wasted my time,"" she said.
This month Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called Thunberg ""a brat"". Trump has said on Twitter she needs to work on her anger management problem.
""Those attacks are just funny because they obviously don't mean anything,"" she said. ""I guess of course it means something - they are terrified of young people bringing change which they don't want - but that is just proof that we are actually doing something and that they see us as some kind of threat.""
Thunberg came to world attention when she began a grassroots campaign aged 15 by skipping school every Friday to demonstrate outside the Swedish parliament. The protests have inspired millions of young people to take action against climate change.
PRAISE FROM DAVID ATTENBOROUGH
Thunberg, who was named Time Magazine's Person of the Year for 2019, said becoming an activist had helped rescue her from the depression she had previously been suffering.
She also spoke in Monday's BBC program with veteran British broadcaster David Attenborough, telling him how his nature documentaries had inspired her.
""You have aroused the world,"" the 93-year-old Attenborough told Thunberg in reply, adding that she had achieved things ""that many of us who have been working on the issue for 20 years have failed to do"".
Her father Svante Thunberg, also interviewed for the BBC program, said she had dealt very well with ""the fake news, all the things that people try to fabricate about her, the hate that that generates"" while in the global media limelight.
""Quite frankly, I don't know how she does it, but she laughs most of the time. She finds it hilarious,"" he said.
The teenager rejoined activists outside the Swedish parliament this month after four months of overseas trips to attend climate conferences in New York and Madrid.
""I hope I won't have to sit outside the Swedish parliament for long. I hope I don't have to be a climate activist any more,"" she said on Monday, adding she was looking forward to returning to school in August.
""I just want to be just as everyone else. I want to educate myself and be just like a normal teenager."""

Police have rounded up jihadist militants in late December in the last two years, since New Year's Day in 2017 https://www.reuters.com/article/us-turkey-attack/gunman-kills-39-in-istanbul-nightclub-manhunt-under-way-idUSKBN14K0NH when a gunman killed 39 people in an Istanbul nightclub in an attack claimed by the militant group. 
Counter-terror police carried out the operations in the central provinces of Ankara, Kayseri and Adana, and Batman in the southeast, state-owned Anadolu news agency reported. Istanbul police said it also made arrests. 
At 5 a.m. (0200 GMT) in Batman, some 400 police officers detained 22 people in simultaneous raids on various addresses, seizing weapons, ammunition and documents, Anadolu said.
It said 30 Iraqis, two Syrians and one Moroccan were detained in Ankara. Nine Iraqi citizens who had operated in Syria and Iraq were detained in Kayseri, while four Syrian and two Iraqi citizens were detained in Adana, it added.
Istanbul police said 20 Turks and four foreign nationals were captured in separate raids aimed to prevent potential attacks by the group ahead of New Year's.
U.S. President Donald Trump announced on Oct. 27 that Islamic State leader Baghdadi had been killed in a raid by U.S. special forces in northwest Syria, near the Turkish border.
Two days later, Turkish police detained dozens of Islamic State suspects believed to have been plotting attacks targeting celebrations of Turkey's Republic Day celebrations.
The government has said it will have repatriated most of its Islamic State detainees to their home countries by the end of the year.
Ankara had accused its European allies of being too slow to take back their citizens who traveled to the Middle East to join Islamic State.
Turkey's NATO allies have been worried that its October offensive into northeastern Syria against the Kurdish YPG militia could lead to Islamic State suspects and their families escaping from the prisons and camps run by the YPG.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - More than 10,000 people have registered for a ""Run Against Dictatorship"" in Bangkok next month while supporters of the Thai government plan to stage a rival walk on the same day, organizers said on Monday.
The twin events, set for January 12, point to the rising political temperature in Thailand, though there is no immediate sign of any return to the violent street protests that have roiled the Thai capital over the past two decades.
Opponents of the government say it manipulated an election held in March to extend the rule of junta leader Prayuth Chan-ocha and they now fear that authorities will move to dissolve the vocal opposition party Future Forward.
""We want to show the government the discontent that citizens have with the administration,"" university student Tanawat Wongchai, who is helping organize the anti-government event, told Reuters.
The rival event is called ""Walk to Cheer Uncle"" - a reference to Prayuth's nickname of Uncle Tu. Organizers say some 2,500 people have registered to take part.
""This event is for the public, for all of us, in the name of the people who love Uncle, love the nation and the monarchy,"" its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page says.
The two events will be held on Jan. 12 at parks that are 11 km (seven miles) apart at overlapping times.
""These events could open the floodgates to more gatherings,"" said Ben Kiatkwankul of the Maverick Consulting Group political advisory firm.
OPPOSITION RALLY
On Dec. 14, thousands of people joined a rally for opposition politician Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit after authorities sought a ban on his Future Forward party for violating electoral law - an accusation the party says is unfounded.
Thanathorn has already been banned as a member of parliament.
This month's rally was the biggest protest since Prayuth took power in a 2014 coup in the name of ending street violence between conservative, royalist ""yellow shirts"" and ""red shirt"" backers of ousted populist leader Thaksin Shinawatra.
Thanathorn has been invited to the anti-government run, but has not been involved in organizing it, organizer Tanawat said.
Plans for the run had to be hastily redrawn last week after local authorities barred use of the original venue.
Government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat said the prime minister was not connected to either event and cared only about the safety of participants and those in the area.
""Each side can organize events, it is their right, as long as it is within the scope of the law,"" she added.
Another potential flashpoint comes on Jan. 21, when the Constitutional Court will rule on whether to dissolve Future Forward on a complaint it seeks to overthrow the monarchy. It rejects that accusation, which is not directly related to the charge that it broke election rules."

BLUE MOUNTAINS, Australia (Reuters) - A possum severely burnt by bushfires in Australia's Blue Mountains laps water from a bowl as her rescuer holds her gently in a towel, while at a nearby home a kangaroo with bandaged feet is rocked like a baby by another carer.
As Australia battles wildfires that have razed more than 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) across five states, volunteers are trying to save wild animals caught in the inferno.
Australia's bushland is home to a range of indigenous fauna, including kangaroos, koalas, wallabies, possums, wombats and echidnas. Officials fear that 30% of just one koala colony on the country's northeast coast, or between 4,500 and 8,400, have been lost in the recent fires.
Authorities have no exact figure on how many native animals in total have been killed but experts say it is likely to be in the millions. 
Tracy Burgess, a volunteer at Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Services (WIRES), said it was very concerning that rescuers were not receiving as many animal patients as they would expect.
""We're not getting that many animals coming into care,"" Burgess told Reuters as she held the injured brushtail possum. ""So, our concern is that they don't come into care because they're not there anymore, basically.""
With limited government funds, WIRES relies heavily on donations from the public and the goodwill of volunteers like Burgess who care for the animals in their own homes.
The possum being looked after by Burgess was found in the rural town of Clarence in the World Heritage listed Blue Mountains region, around 100 kilometers (62.1 miles) west of Sydney. 
Another WIRES rescuer, Tracy Dodd, is caring for the badly scalded kangaroo that was found in the same town, where several houses were destroyed by blazes.
""He was just sitting under a bush and his mum was not too far away but he was obviously not well enough to hop around,"" Dodd said as he cradled the kangaroo. ""He's had lots of fluids and now he's off to the vet.""
WIRES and other groups usually discourage people from feeding wild animals but wildfires have prompted them to change that advice to encourage people to provide much-needed food and water.
Photos and videos posted on social media in recent weeks have shown dehydrated animals crawling to residential pools and bird baths.

In a case closely followed by rights groups, a district court in the town of Paralimni ruled that the woman, aged 19 at the time, had lied about being sexually abused by 12 Israeli teenagers. Sentencing was set for Jan. 7. 
The woman, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was arrested after police said she had withdrawn an accusation that the teenagers had raped her in a hotel room at the holiday resort of Ayia Napa in July.
She was convicted of public mischief, which carries a fine, a jail term of up to one year, or both.
The woman maintained that she had recanted her accusation under duress from police during persistent questioning without a lawyer present. Prosecutors and the court dismissed that claim.
""My conclusion is that the guilt of the accused has been proven beyond reasonable doubt,"" the presiding judge said in his verdict, describing her claims as inconsistent and adding that she had attempted to mislead the court.
Her lawyers said she would appeal. Nonetheless, they urged the court to exercise leniency in sentencing, including the possibility of suspending any jail term.
""We believe there have been many violations in the procedure and the rights of fair trial of our client have been violated,"" said her lawyer, Nicoletta Charalambidou.
The Israelis were released without charge 10 days after being arrested, on the day the woman retracted her accusation.
The individuals she had accused were not summoned to court because prosecutors considered the case one of public mischief, not rape.
In testimony in open court, the defendant said she had been in a hotel room with one of the Israeli youths, with whom she had a relationship, before others appeared and she was pinned down.
One defense witness, Marios Matsakis, a forensic pathologist who formerly worked for the state, said the woman's injuries were consistent with rape. Prosecutors said she had fabricated the allegation, angry at being filmed during sex.
""This victim was never protected, from the first instance,"" said Zelia Gregoriou, an activist who stood with about 20 individuals protesting against the verdict. ""From the first instance, she was raped again and again by the press, by society and the legal system."" 

The woman left the courthouse with a blanket over her face and a handkerchief around her mouth, imprinted with an image of female lips sewn shut.

MOL's chief executive and chairman Zsolt Hernadi was found guilty of bribing former Croatian Prime Minister Ivo Sanader to allow MOL become the key decision-maker in Croatian energy firm, in which MOL is the biggest but not the majority shareholder.
The two of them received two and six years in prison, respectively, the N1 television reported. The ruling is not final and can be appealed. MOL owns close to 50% of INA while Zagreb owns some 45%.
Court President Ivan Turudic said: ""There is an active European arrest warrant for Hernadi and Hungary should act accordingly.""
Hernadi and Sanader have denied any wrongdoing and were absent.
MOL said in a statement that it was disappointed with the verdict. 
""The company is disappointed as the existing decisions of the Hungarian authorities and those of the United Nations Tribunal in Geneva concluded that there was no wrongdoing by any MOL Group officer,"" it said, adding that it would use all measures as defense ""against any allegations of illegal practices.""
Hungary has refused to heed an international Interpol arrest warrant for Hernadi.

SYDNEY/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - A volunteer firefighter was killed battling Australian bushfires on Monday as ""columns"" of flames generating their own dangerous weather systems bore down on a tourist region, prompting the evacuation of tens of thousands of people.
The firefighter, and two others who suffered burns, were working on a fire about 70 km (45 miles) east of Albury in New South Wales (NSW) when, it is believed, their truck rolled after being hit by strong winds, authorities said on Twitter.
The incident took the death toll from the country's raging bushfires to nine and added pressure on authorities to reconsider New Year celebration plans for the city of Sydney.
Around 100 fires are burning across Australia, with as many as 14 ""emergency"" warnings in place for Victoria while fires are also threatening homes and infrastructure in South Australia and Tasmania.
Tens of thousands were evacuated as ""columns of fire"" fuelled by extreme heat and high winds bore down on the popular tourist region of East Gippsland in Victoria state in Australia's southeast.
Wildfires that have plagued the country's eastern coast for weeks flared again to danger levels in East Gippsland, an area encompassing two national parks, lakes and coastal plains that is half the size of Belgium.
By late afternoon, officials warned holiday makers to stay off the roads because of thick smoke and unpredictable, fast-moving fires, adding that it was now too late for people who had not left the region to do so.
""Leaving now would be deadly,"" authorities said.
The state's Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said ""columns of fire"" were punching into the atmosphere and generating their own erratic weather systems.
""There's lightning coming out of these columns,"" Crisp told reporters. ""It is unpredictable, it's dangerous out there.""
With some firefronts stretching more than 1,000 km (620 miles) and temperatures reaching as high as 43 Celsius (109 Fahrenheit), Crisp said the danger will remain high into the evening.
Bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (10 million acres) - an area the size of Japan -- across Australia in recent weeks.
At the Wallagaraugh River Retreat in Mallacoota, a coastal town in East Gippsland, owner Lynette Sykes told Reuters her property was evacuated this morning. 
""We were not going to take any risks with people's lives,"" Sykes said.
A video posted on social media site Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) showed tourist Nicholas Costanzo escaping from the Victorian bushfire on a narrow two-way road dotted with fire trucks as thick smoke blurred vision. ""Please pray for us,"" he said.

DRY LIGHTNING
Authorities across Australia's south, including fire-ravaged South Australia, warned that dry lightning could spark further flare-ups overnight even as the temperature is forecast to cool.
Dry lightning occurs when a storm forms from high temperatures, but the much-needed rain evaporates before reaching the ground.
Large parts of Australia have suffered through several years of drought that has created tinder dry conditions, leaving bushland ready to ignite.
The heat wave in Australia's south even pushed up the mercury in Tasmania, the country's closest point to Antarctica, to 40.8 Celsius (105.4 Fahrenheit). That was the hottest ever December temperature recorded in the state capital city of Hobart, according to the Bureau of Meteorology.
In New South Wales state, temperatures are forecast to spike on New Year's Eve, when hundreds of thousands of people are expected to gather around the harbour in Sydney to watch the city's world-famous firework celebrations.
Authorities said they are planning to push ahead with the celebrations, despite some calls for the fireworks to be cancelled. 
""If regional areas have had fireworks banned, then let's not have two classes of citizens,"" tweeted New South Wales Deputy Premier John Barilaro, who represents a rural district affected by drought and fire.

An online petition calling for the Sydney spectacle to be cancelled and the money given to farmers and firefighters had attracted close to 275,000 signatures by late Monday.

The air strikes came a day after at least 90 people were killed in a truck bombing at a busy checkpoint in the Somali capital Mogadishu, the deadliest attack in more than two years.
The United States Africa Command (AFRICOM) said in a statement that two militants had been killed by two air strikes in Qunyo Barrow and another two by an air strike at Caliyoow Barrow. It said no civilians were killed.
The United States carries out regular air strikes in Somalia in support of a weak, United Nations-backed government in Mogadishu, which has fought al Shabaab for years.
""The U.S. and the Federal Government of Somalia will continue to increase pressure on the terrorist organization in order to deny them the ability to plot terrorist attacks,"" the AFRICOM statement said.
Plans by the United States to withdraw hundreds of troops from Africa could curtail the fight against al Shabaab and other militant groups across the continent."

Wang was among dozens of churchgoers and leaders of the Early Rain Covenant Church detained by police in December 2018, most of whom were subsequently released.
The church is one of China's best known unregistered Protestant ""house"" churches.
Chinese law requires that places of worship register and submit to government oversight, but some have declined to register, for various reasons, and are called ""house"" churches.
""Today's verdict makes a mockery of China's supposed religious freedoms,"" Amnesty International China researcher Patrick Poon said in a statement on Monday. 
""Wang Yi was merely practicing his religion and peacefully standing up for human rights in China. This nine-year sentence is appalling and unjust.""
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom, but since President Xi Jinping took office six years ago, the government has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
The government has cracked down on underground churches, both Protestant and Catholic, and has rolled out new legislation to increase oversight of religious education and practices, with harsher punishment for practices not sanctioned by authorities.
According to the statement posted on the website of the Chengdu court in the western province of Sichuan, Wang has also been deprived of his political rights for three years and 50,000 yuan ($7,160) of his personal property was confiscated as part of his sentencing. 
China also sentenced Nobel Peace Prize-winning dissident Liu Xiaobo in 2009 to 11 years in prison on charges of 'inciting subversion of state power'. Liu died in prison in 2017 after he was denied permission to leave China for treatment for late-stage liver cancer.

He Jiankui, then an associate professor at Southern (NYSE:SO) University of Science and Technology in Shenzhen, said in November 2018 that he had used gene-editing technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 to change the genes of twin girls to protect them from getting infected with the AIDS virus in the future.
The backlash in China and globally about the ethics of his research and work was fast and widespread.
He and his collaborators forged ethical review materials and recruited men with AIDS who were part of a couple to carry out the gene-editing. His experiments ultimately resulted in two women giving birth to three gene-edited babies, according to Xinhua.
The court also handed lesser sentences to Zhang Renli and Qin Jinzhou, who worked at two unnamed medical institutions, for having conspired with He in his work. 
""The three accused did not have the proper certification to practice medicine, and in seeking fame and wealth, deliberately violated national regulations in scientific research and medical treatment,"" the court said, according to Xinhua. 

""They've crossed the bottom line of ethics in scientific research and medical ethics.""

WASHINGTON/BAGHDAD (Reuters) - U.S. officials said on Sunday that air strikes in Iraq and Syria against an Iran-backed militia group were successful, but warned that ""additional actions"" may still be taken in the region to defend U.S. interests. 
The U.S. military carried out the strikes on Sunday against the Kataib Hezbollah militia group in response to the killing of a U.S. civilian contractor in a rocket attack on an Iraqi military base, officials said.
U.S. President Donald Trump was briefed by his top national security advisers following the strikes at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida. 
""We will not stand for the Islamic Republic of Iran to take actions that put American men and women in jeopardy,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters after the briefing with Trump.
Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper and General Mark Milley, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, appeared briefly in a club ballroom to comment on the airstrikes.
Esper termed the offensive ""successful,"" but said that Trump was informed that a further military response could be warranted.
""We discussed with him other options that are available,"" Esper said. ""I would note also that we will take additional actions as necessary to ensure that we act in our own self-defense and we deter further bad behavior from militia groups or from Iran.""
Iraqi security and militia sources said at least 25 militia fighters were killed and at least 55 wounded following three U.S. air strikes in Iraq on Sunday.
At least four local Kataib Hezbollah commanders were among the dead, the sources said, adding that one of the strikes had targeted the militia group's headquarters near the western Qaim district on the border with Syria.
The Pentagon said it had targeted three locations of the Iranian-backed Shi'ite Muslim militia group in Iraq and two in Syria. The locations included weapons storage facilities and command and control locations the group had used to plan and execute attacks on coalition forces, it said.
A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the strikes were carried out by F-15 fighter jets.
The United States had accused Kataib Hezbollah of carrying out a strike involving more than 30 rockets on Friday which killed the U.S. civilian contractor and injured four U.S. service members and two members of the Iraqi Security Forces near the oil-rich city of Kirkuk.
""In response to repeated Kata'ib Hizbollah attacks on Iraqi bases that host Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR) coalition forces, U.S. forces have conducted precision defensive strikes ... that will degrade KH's ability to conduct future attacks against OIR coalition forces"" chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said in a statement.
Earlier this month, Pompeo blamed Iranian-backed forces for a series of attacks on bases in Iraq and warned Iran that any attacks by Tehran or proxies that harmed Americans or allies would be ""answered with a decisive U.S. response.""

Tensions have heightened between Tehran and Washington since last year when Trump pulled the United States out of Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran's economy.

1525,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2019 07:57PM ET</span>",City dwellers find simpler life in rural China commune,"By Huizhong Wu
GUANZHONG, China (Reuters) - Yang Zhaoyu quit his job in a big Chinese city nine months ago and moved to a small community that preaches sustainable living and mindful consumption.
""After graduating from college, I lived a very mainstream life,"" the 30-year-old former software developer said. ""I dated, got married, and found a job.""
But Yang realized he wanted something different, so he ditched his career in Suzhou, west of Shanghai, and found a new life in an isolated community centered around sustainability and organic farming.
(Click https://reut.rs/2MpNmtk to see a picture story about this commune.)
China's teeming megacities have drawn hundreds of millions of people from rural villages and small towns in search of jobs and wealth, but people like Yang are part of an emerging trend in the opposite direction.
A recent poll of people aged 18-35 by a state think-tank found 52% of those living in smaller towns and cities had moved there after spending on average three years in top-tier cities, citing the fast pace of life.
Known as AnotherCommunity, Yang's new home is an hour's drive outside of Fuzhou city in Fujian province, at a village called Guanzhong. It was set up by Tang Guanhua, 30, and his wife, Xing Zhen, 35, in late 2015.
After a year at AnotherCommunity, residents can vote to have a say in its affairs and use shared funds and resources. There are currently five permanent members.
It is now opening to the public for a four-month trial. Since mid-October, over 20 potential residents - from former computer programmers to online English teachers and freelance videographers - have signed up to join the community.
Freelance videographer Chen Yan said she originally planned to stay only a week when she came in October, but ended up staying a month.
""I lived in a room that ... was half open and remained connected to the outside world, to the mountain,"" the 24-year-old said.
""I stayed longer because I wanted to continue to feel that fullness, that richness.""
The community also serves as a safe space for 63-year-old transgender woman Liu Peilin, who has known Tang for several years.
In 2018, the community had to destroy much of what they had built due to pressure from the local government, though in recent months they have been left alone.
""Whatever they do, I just hope they make something of it,"" said the village's Communist Party chief, surnamed Lin.
Chinese media is full of stories about people seeking alternative lifestyles in the countryside.
A newspaper reported in 2018 that a young woman had moved into the Zhongnan Mountains in Shanxi province seeking a hermit life. Her story went viral on social media after she was forcibly evicted.
Those mountains have since attracted young people from all over China. At one point, the community had over 600 residents, many former city dwellers, according to media reports.
The regional government, irked by what they saw as an incursion, tore down the illegal structures."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - An assailant who stabbed five people attending a party at an Hasidic rabbi's home in what New York's governor called an act of domestic terrorism appears to have been acting alone, police said on Sunday.
Grafton Thomas, 37, is accused of attempted murder after bursting in to the Hanukkah celebration on Saturday night in Rockland County, about 30 miles (48 km) north of New York City. Police said he fled and was later arrested in Manhattan by two officers who were on the lookout for his car.
""We have nothing to indicate at this time that there were other people (involved), but that will be part of a very lengthy, very methodical and thorough investigation,"" New York Police Department Commissioner Dermot Shea told reporters.
Speaking at a news conference alongside Mayor Bill de Blasio and other city leaders, Shea said that the suspect said ""almost nothing"" to the young officers who took him into custody at gunpoint after stopping him in Harlem. Shea declined to say whether Thomas had previously been on the department's radar.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the attack in the small town of Monsey, which followed days of anti-Semitic incidents in the New York City area, was an act of domestic terrorism. 
""These are people who intend to create mass harm, mass violence, generate fear based on race, color, creed,"" Cuomo told reporters after meeting with some of the victims.
President Donald Trump called it an horrific attack. 
""We must all come together to fight, confront, and eradicate the evil scourge of anti-Semitism,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.
Thomas, from Greenwood Lake, New York, is due to return to court in the town of Ramapo on Jan. 3 after he was arraigned on Sunday on five counts of attempted murder and ordered held on $5 million bail.
ORTHODOX ENCLAVE
According to Yossi Gestetner, co-founder of the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council, the attacker had his face partially covered with a scarf when he stabbed five people, two of whom were in critical condition.
""One of the rabbi's children was also stabbed,"" Gestetner told reporters.
One witness who was at the rabbi's home said he began praying for his life when he saw the assailant remove a large knife from a case.
""It was about the size of a broomstick,"" Aron Kohn told the New York Times. 
Roughly a third of the population of Rockland County is Jewish, including a large enclave of Orthodox Jews who live in secluded communities. 
Another attack took place in Monsey in November when a man walking to a synagogue was stabbed multiple times, according to media reports. 
The attack on the party, which was attended by dozens of people, followed a spate of anti-Semitic attacks in New York City and surrounding areas. 
New York City's police department said on Friday it was stepping up patrols in heavily Jewish neighborhoods. 
Shea told Sunday's news conference there had been a 21% increase in anti-Semitic hate crimes in the city this year.
'VICIOUS ATTACK'
Saturday's violence in Rockland County was at least the 10th anti-Semitic incident in the New York and New Jersey area in the last week, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish organization. 
They included a 65-year-old man who was reportedly punched and kicked by an assailant yelling an anti-Semitic slur in Manhattan on Monday, and attacks on two other men in Brooklyn on Tuesday.
Those incidents came after six people were killed during a shooting rampage at a kosher grocery store in northern New Jersey earlier this month.
Earlier this year, a gunman killed a female rabbi and wounded three people during Sabbath services at Congregation Chabad in Poway, near San Diego, on the last day of Passover in April 2019. 
Six months before that, a gunman killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned ""recent displays of antisemitism including the vicious attack at the home of a rabbi in Monsey,"" at the start of a weekly cabinet meeting.
The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah commemorates the 2nd century B.C. victory of Judah Maccabee and his followers in a revolt against armies of the Seleucid Empire.
The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council posted video on social media that showed the rabbi in Monsey and his followers continuing their celebrations at the synagogue next door, after the attack in his home. 

It gave a rough translation of the lyrics they sang: ""The grace of God did not end and his mercy did not leave us.""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.N. Security Council members are due to meet informally on Monday for a second round of negotiations on a Russian and Chinese proposal to lift a raft of sanctions on North Korea, a move that some diplomats say has little support.
China and Russia are convening negotiations a day before North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's deadline for the United States to show flexibility in stalled talks aimed at getting Pyongyang to give up its nuclear weapons program. North Korea has warned the United States could receive an unwanted ""Christmas gift"" if it fails.
A top White House official said on Sunday that the United States would be very disappointed if North Korea tested a long-range or nuclear missile and would take appropriate action as a leading military and economic power.
Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its missile and nuclear programs, which the Security Council has unanimously strengthened over the years. Though some diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, have warned that unity would be broken if Russia and China put their new plan to a vote.
Russia and China proposed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution earlier this month that would lift sanctions on industries that earned North Korea hundreds of millions of dollars. Those sanctions were imposed in 2016 and 2017 to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
In an attempt to preserve council unity on North Korea, diplomats said the United States put forward a draft press statement on the issue, but that move was dismissed by Russia and China. The pair have instead scheduled on Monday a second round of talks on their draft resolution, diplomats said.
One Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, accused Russia and China on Sunday of coordinating with North Korea on the draft resolution, including letting Pyongyang make its own additions to the text, before they engaged with the 15-member Security Council.
""China and Russia are pushing a sanctions-gutting resolution knowing full well from the beginning that they do not have the votes for the resolution to pass,"" said the council diplomat.
""The U.N. Security Council cannot support a resolution that subsidizes DPRK's ongoing development of weapons of mass destruction with sanctions relief, which is what the Chinese and Russian resolution would do,"" the diplomat said, referring to North Korea's official name - the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
Russia and China have said they hope lifting some sanctions could help break the deadlock and encourage talks between Washington and Pyongyang. But the United States, France and Britain said now is not the time to consider lifting sanctions. 
A Security Council resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, China, Russia, France and Britain. 
The Chinese and Russian proposal would lift a ban on North Korea exporting statues, seafood and textiles, and ease restrictions on infrastructure projects and North Koreans working overseas, according to the draft seen by Reuters."

The Fort Worth Fire Department said three people, including the person who they believed to be the shooter, were transported from the scene in critical condition. The scene was secure, they added.
Two of the people, including the shooter, died while en route to the hospital, and the third person was successfully resuscitated by paramedics, according to Macara Trusty, a spokeswoman for local emergency services MedStar. Two more people sustained minor injuries as they ducked for cover inside the church, she said.
The incident took place in White Settlement, a suburb northwest of Fort Worth, at the West Freeway Church of Christ.
White Settlement police chief J.P. Bevering said that the gunman was shot by two worshippers who were armed and returned fire. ""The threat is stopped based on the heroic actions of the two parishioners in the church,"" Bevering said.
Texas Governor Greg Abbott said in a statement: ""Places of worship are meant to be sacred, and I am grateful for the church members who acted quickly to take down the shooter and help prevent further loss of life."" 
The shooting was captured on video as the church service was apparently being streamed on YouTube, according to the New York Daily News. 
""You feel like your life is flashing before you. I was so worried about my little one,"" witness Isabel Arreola told CBS 11.
The shooting came a day after an assailant with a knife stabbed five people at a Hanukkah party in New York.

Russian news agencies cited the Federal Security Service (FSB) as saying that thanks to the information, two Russians were detained on Dec. 27 on suspicion of plotting attacks during New Year festivities in St. Petersburg.
The Kremlin said Putin passed on his gratitude to Trump during a phone call on Sunday for the tip from U.S. special services. It gave no more details.
Diplomatic ties between Washington and Moscow are fraught over disagreements from Ukraine to Syria and allegations of Russian meddling in the U.S. presidential election, but Trump and Putin have managed to keep personal lines open.

""When it comes to impeachment, the rule is that there are virtually no substantive rules,"" Kennedy told CNN's ""State of the Union."" As a result, he said, there were plenty of steps the Senate could take, including forming a committee to hear evidence in the case.
The Democratic-led House of Representatives impeached Republican Trump this month for abuse of power and obstruction of Congress charges stemming from his effort to get Ukraine to investigate political rival Joe Biden, a leading contender in the 2020 Democratic presidential race.
The majority-Republican Senate is expected to hold its impeachment trial early next year, once House Speaker Nancy Pelosi delivers the articles of impeachment to the chamber.
The U.S. Constitution has no detailed guidelines on the process, Kennedy said. ""It's not a criminal trial,"" Kennedy said, adding there were ""no standards of proof"" and ""no rules of evidence.""
Senators have not been able to agree whether to allow for witnesses. Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, where 51 votes are needed to pass a set of rules for the Trump trial, so Republicans cannot afford many defectors.
Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said he wanted to hear testimony and submit questions before deciding on whether to admit witnesses. McConnell said this month he was working in ""total coordination"" with the White House on Trump's impeachment, and has said he is ""not an impartial juror.""
Kennedy said the Senate had a number of options.
""I'm not recommending it, but it's possible for the Senate, through the presiding officer, the chief justice, to appoint a committee to hear additional evidence, if the Senate thinks it's necessary,"" he said.
Senators take an oath to ""do impartial justice according to the Constitution and laws"" ahead of an impeachment trial. Experts say that as a practical matter they can declare their allegiance without repercussions.
Last week, Republican U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski said she was disturbed by McConnell's approach, saying there should be distance between him and the White House."

1534,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 29, 2019 11:30AM ET</span>",Christianity Today's split with Trump highlights deeper issue in white evangelical America,"By Simon Lewis and Heather Timmons
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After evangelical publication Christianity Today published a blistering editorial on what it called Donald Trump's ""grossly immoral character"", some church leaders and the U.S. president himself denounced the criticism as elitist and out-of-touch.
The Dec. 19 editorial sparked a Christmas holiday debate over religion in U.S. politics, and posed new questions about the close alignment between white evangelical voters and Trump, who has given their beliefs strong political support. 
However, the coziness with the Republican president, who was impeached this month by the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives, is exacerbating a long-term crisis facing white evangelicalism, some Christians say - it is being abandoned by younger generations. 
There has been a big drop-off in white evangelical church participation among adults under 40, and publications such as Christianity Today and religious leaders are struggling to engage ""Gen Z,"" or those born after 1996. 
""One of the major factors is that the church is too tied up in right-wing politics,"" said Greg Carey, a professor at Lancaster Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania. Evangelical activism against gay rights is particularly repellant to many members of a generation where ""everyone has friends who are LGBTQ,"" Carey said.
Trump's presidency may make the age gap worse, some evangelical Christians believe. ""Having to go out and defend this guy day after day, as many of these Trump evangelicals are doing, they're just destroying their credibility,"" said Napp Nazworth, who until Monday was politics editor of another publication, the Christian Post.
Nazworth resigned over the Christian Post's plans to criticize Christianity Today for its anti-Trump editorial.
He told Reuters many younger evangelicals opposed Trump's immigration and asylum policies and were concerned about alleviating poverty, in contrast to older members of the faith. Evangelical leaders standing with Trump ""will have no moral authority to speak to moral issues of the day after defending him,"" Nazworth said.
'RELIGIOUSLY UNAFFILIATED'
Evangelicalism, like all forms of Christianity in the United States, is struggling to attract younger members, amid an unprecedented surge in recent years of the number of people identifying as religiously unaffiliated.
White evangelical protestants declined as a proportion of the U.S. population between 2006 and 2018, falling to 15% from 23%, according to analysis by the Public Religion Research Institute.
Higher-than-average voter turnout among evangelicals means the group still represents more than a quarter of the U.S. electorate, but a failure to draw young worshippers means their electoral heft is set to diminish, said Robert P. Jones, chief executive and founder of PRRI. 
(Chart: https://tmsnrt.rs/39jbIyP)
The median age of white evangelicals and white Christians overall is 55, according to PRRI data, compared with 44 for the overall white population. 
The evangelical church's ""singular focus"" on same sex marriage, relationships and abortion is failing to engage younger generations, said Randall Balmer, a professor of religion at Dartmouth College, and a former editor at Christianity Today. 
They are motivated by a broader set of issues, he said, adding ""in terms of sexual orientation the younger generation just shrugs about that."" 
'PARTISAN ATTACK' 
The perhaps unlikely alliance between conservative Christians and the twice-divorced New York real estate developer has been important for Trump in a country that is more religious than most other western democracies and where a president's spiritual life is closely examined.
White evangelical Christians overwhelmingly voted for Trump in 2016, when exit polls showed he won 81% of their votes. They have mostly stuck with him despite the controversies over his harsh attacks on political rivals and demeaning comments about women, thanks largely to Trump appointing scores of conservative judges who support restrictions on access to abortion.
Many U.S. evangelicals also strongly support conservatives in Israel, and hailed Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital and move the U.S. embassy there.
Trump, who describes himself as Presbyterian and whose advisors include evangelical figures such as Florida televangelist Paula White, dismissed Christianity Today as ""far left"".
A group of nearly 200 leaders from the conservative wing of evangelicalism defended him in a letter to the magazine, praising the president for seeking the advice of ""Bible-believing Christians and patriotic Americans"". 
Franklin Graham, son of the magazine's founder Billy Graham, who advised both Republican and Democratic presidents over several decades, said the editorial was a ""totally partisan attack.""
Meanwhile, other religious scholars and leaders have signed a petition https://www.change.org/p/christian-leaders-and-evangelical-leaders-affirm-christianity-today in support of Christianity Today, stating that the ""United States evangelical and Christian community is at a moral crossroads.""
Younger evangelicals are put off by church leaders' seemingly unconditional support for Trump despite his ""cruel"" treatment of migrants and deregulation that could damage the environment, said Marlena Graves, a Christian author on faith, culture and justice, who signed the petition.
""No political party embodies Jesus's teaching closely. You can't depend on government to do what Jesus says because, oftentimes, you have to go against the government,"" she said, citing evangelical believers who worked to abolish black slavery and Christians who resisted Nazism in Germany.
The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. It announced on Friday the Jan. 3 launch of ""Evangelicals for Trump"", a coalition to support the president in the November 2020 election. 

Trump will attend the launch at King Jesus International Ministry, a megachurch in a Miami suburb with a large Spanish-speaking congregation, according to a church official.

The Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council (OJPAC) said on Twitter an attacker wearing a scarf stabbed the victims at a house in Monsey, Rockland County, about 30 miles north of New York City.
All five victims were taken to hospitals, the council said, adding that two of the victims were critical, with one of them stabbed at least six times.
""The suspect fled the scene, but he is in custody at this time,"" the Ramapo Police Department said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post.
The police department confirmed that five people were stabbed and said that the investigation was going on. The department did not provide any more details.
An OJPAC official, Yossi Gestetner, told the New York Times the attack happened at around 10 p.m. during a Hanukkah celebration that was being attended by many dozens of people at the rabbi's home.
About a third of the population of Rockland County is Jewish, including a large enclave of Orthodox Jews who live in secluded communities. 
New York Attorney General Letitia James said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the events in Monsey. 
""There is zero tolerance for acts of hate of any kind and we will continue to monitor this horrific situation,"" she said in a Twitter post. 
New York City's police department said on Friday its officers were stepping up patrols in heavily Jewish neighborhoods following a spate of anti-Semitic attacks. 
""Hate doesn't have a home in our city,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio wrote on Twitter, calling the assaults attacks on all New Yorkers. 
In more deadly recent attacks, a gunman killed a female rabbi and wounded three people during Sabbath services at Congregation Chabad in Poway, near San Diego, on the last day of Passover in April 2019. 
Six months before that, a gunman killed 11 worshipers at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in the deadliest anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history. 

The Jewish holiday of Hanukkah commemorates the 2nd century B.C. victory of Judah Maccabee and his followers in a revolt against armies of the Seleucid Empire.

The priority targets were said to be ""vital and sensitive"" locations, Houthi military spokesman Yahya Saria said without giving more details, during a round-up of the group's activities during 2019 and outlook for 2020. 
The Houthis have repeatedly said they have targets in Saudi and the UAE in their sights and have carried out missile and drone strikes on civilian airports and oil infrastructure in Saudi, as well as on the capital Riyadh.
But in September the Houthis said they would stop attacking Saudi Arabia with missiles and drones if their adversaries attacking Yemen did the same. Since then, Riyadh has stepped up informal discussions with the Houthis on a ceasefire. 
Saria, in comments carried by the group's al-Masirah television, also said that any attacks against Yemen and its people would continue to meet an appropriate response from Houthi armed forces. 
The UAE is a leading partner in a Saudi-led coalition that intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to restore ousted President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government after it was toppled by the Houthis in late 2014. In July the UAE said it was withdrawing its troops from Yemen, but remained a part of the coalition.
The Houthis claimed to have carried out a large Sept. 14 attack on Saudi oil giant Aramco (SE:2222), but the United States, European powers and Saudi Arabia blamed the attack on Iran.

The plane also brought emergency medical staff and supplies, according to a tweet from the Turkish embassy, adding these had been transferred to a Turkish-run hospital in Mogadishu.
Somali Information Minister Mohamed Abdi Hayir Mareye told state media that 10 badly injured Somalis would be evacuated to Turkey. He added that Turkey had sent 24 doctors to treat those wounded who would not be evacuated.
Since a 2011 famine in Somalia, Turkey has been a leading aid provider to the country as Ankara seeks to boost its influence in the strategic Horn of Africa in competition with Gulf rivals like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.
Saturday’s blast, at a busy checkpoint during rush hour in Mogadishu, was the deadliest in war-torn Somalia in more than two years. . No-one immediately claimed responsibility, although the city’s mayor blamed al Qaeda-linked Islamist group al Shabaab.
The dead included many students from a university in the city, authorities said.
A Reuters witness at Mogadishu airport saw 10 injured Somalis and the bodies of two dead Turks loaded on the plane.
The bombing was the 20th vehicle-borne explosives attack of 2019 in Somalia and the year is ending with more deaths from such attacks than 2018, according to the Hiraal Institute, a Mogadishu-based security-think tank.
Grieving families on Sunday arranged burials and funerals for their loved ones, having endured the anguish of identifying charred corpses and body fragments at the blast site and at hospitals around the city.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - More than 1,000 people rallied in the rain in a park in Hong Kong's financial district on Sunday, chanting slogans for democracy as they huddled under a sea of umbrellas.
The crowd, a mix of young and elderly people, wore black and turquoise surgical masks to hide their identities as they listened to organizers speaking on a makeshift stage.
""There may be fewer people. We all know that no matter how many people come out or how many times, the government ignores you,"" said a 30-year-old woman in black clothing surnamed Wong, who works in the legal sector. 
""Hong Kongers will never stop. We see unfairness, injustice. It contradicts our fundamental beliefs,"" she said.
Hong Kong has been convulsed by more than six months of protests, triggered by a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
The demonstrations have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement and have again became more confrontational over recent days with police clashing with protesters at several shopping malls and busy tourist areas.
On Saturday, riot police arrested about a dozen protesters and used pepper spray to break up a gathering aimed at disrupting retail business near the border with mainland China.
More protests are planned in the next few days, including a countdown to New Year's Day and a march on Jan. 1 that could attract a big crowd.
Protesters are angry about what they see as increased meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest. 
A 20-year old university student who gave his name as Malcolm said it was becoming harder to remain optimistic about the prospect of change. 

""More realistic people know there's no way for us to win but now is not the time for us to be pessimistic,"" he said, adding that he would continue to push for full democracy for Hong Kong.

Wilders canceled a similar contest in August last year after police arrested a man who had threatened to kill him over his plan.
At the time, plans to hold the contest also prompted large demonstrations in Pakistan and Wilders said he felt the danger of violence against innocent people was too great.

KIEV/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Ukrainian government forces and pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine started a full prisoner swap on Sunday, driving all remaining detainees in the five-year conflict to a handover point and starting to unload them. 
The swap, at a checkpoint near the industrial town of Horlivka in the Donetsk region, was expected see Ukraine hand over 87 separatists in exchange for 55 pro-government Ukrainians, with armed troops from both sides looking on.
Ukrainian men and women dressed in civilian clothing got off a bus after being brought to the rendez-vous point by separatist forces and were then herded into a nearby tent. 
""The first 25 freed Ukrainians soon will be home,"" Ukraine's presidential office said. 
The exchange, scheduled to be completed later on Sunday, is likely to be hailed by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy as proof he is making good on a promise to bring captured Ukrainians home. 
But some in Ukraine are unhappy that riot police accused of opening fire on protesters against the country's Russia-friendly then-president Viktor Yanukovich in 2014 are among those expected to be handed over. 
And though the swap will help build confidence between the two sides who are wrangling over how to implement a 2014 peace deal, serious disagreements remain and full normalisation is a long way off. 
""Today’s prisoner exchange in #Donbass will bring relief to the persons involved and their families, but it will not bring the (peace) settlement any closer,"" Dmitri Trenin, head of the Moscow Carnegie Center and a former colonel in the Russian army, wrote on social media. 
""The... terms remain anathema in Kiev, and this won’t change. The conflict is much more likely to become frozen than resolved.""
Russian leader Vladimir Putin and Zelenskiy prepared the ground for the exchange at a summit in Paris earlier this month. 
Kiev's forces have been battling separatists in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine since 2014 in a conflict that has claimed more than 13,000 lives. Sporadic fighting continues despite a ceasefire agreement.
Relations between Ukraine and Russia collapsed following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula in 2014, and its subsequent support for separatists in eastern Ukraine. 
There have been several prisoner exchanges between Kiev and the separatists. In the last swap, conducted in December 2017, Ukraine handed over about 300 captives in exchange for around 70 people. 
Zelenskiy won a landslide election victory in April promising to end the conflict.
Widely criticized domestically for his plan to grant special status to Donbass to help end the five-year conflict, Zelenskiy's latest actions have given rise to cautious optimism in some quarters.
In September, after a carefully negotiated rapprochement, Russia and Ukraine swapped dozens of prisoners in a move that brought Western praise.
Relations between the two countries have shown signs of improving in other areas too, including in the gas sector where Kiev and Moscow are discussing a new transit contract.

Ukraine has repeatedly accused Russia of using gas supplies to put pressure on it, but last week the parties managed to agree on the main points of a new deal.

Turkey signed an accord with Libya's internationally recognized government last month that seeks to create an exclusive economic zone from Turkey's southern Mediterranean shore to Libya's northeast coast.
Greece and Cyprus, which have long had maritime and territorial disputes with Turkey, say the accord is void and violates the international law of the sea. They see it as a cynical resource-grab designed to scupper the development of East Mediterranean gas and destabilize rivals.
Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, in an interview with weekly newspaper 'To Vima', said his intention is for Greece and Turkey to discuss their differences about maritime zones in the Aegean and east Mediterranean on a political and diplomatic level.
""But we should say clearly that if we can't find a solution then we should agree that the one difference that Greece recognizes (over maritime zones) must be judged in an international body like the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in Hague.""
Earlier in December, Cyprus petitioned the ICJ to safeguard its offshore mineral rights. There has been no response so far from Turkey to that initiative.
Cyprus's internationally recognized government discovered offshore gas in 2011 but has been at loggerheads with Turkey over maritime zones around the island, where it has granted licenses to multinational companies for oil and gas research.
Turkey, which does not have diplomatic relations with Cyprus's government, says that some areas Nicosia operates in are either on the Turkish continental shelf, or in areas where the breakaway Turkish Cypriot state has rights over any finds. It has sent its own drill ships to the island.
The ICJ has the power to issue binding decisions."

At least 17 people died of acute respiratory infection and 33 from diarrhoea caused by rotavirus and other diseases across Bangladesh from Nov. 1 to Dec. 28, said Ayesha Akhter, a senior official of the government’s health directorate.
Hospitals have been crowded with people suffering from cold-related illnesses, such as influenza, dehydration and pneumonia, she said.

No claim of responsibility was made and Houthi media did not immediately comment on the blast or accusation.
The Security Belt forces are part of a southern separatist front in south Yemen. At the same time, they are backed by the United Arab Emirates in a fight against Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthi group.
Witnesses told Reuters that a blast occurred near a guest platform during the parade and that many were injured or killed. They reported seeing bodies at the scene. 
At least five people died and eight were injured, according to local health authority figures quoted by the Security Belt group and in a statement from the local media office of the forces which control al-Dhalea. 
A missile blast struck the military graduation parade area just after the ceremony involving Security Belt forces had finished, the statements said. 
Yemen has suffered from almost five years of conflict since the Houthi movement ousted President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi's government in late 2014. The coup drew military intervention in 2015 by a Saudi-led coalition, which includes the UAE, trying to restore Hadi's internationally recognized government.
The town of al-Dhalea is controlled by southern separatist forces. It lies on the main south-to-north road linking the southern port of Aden — controlled by Hadi's government — to the Houthi-controled capital, Sanaa. A contested frontline runs across al-Dhalea province.
In August the Houthis claimed responsibility for a missile and drone attack on a parade in Aden, the seat of the internationally recognized government, killing around 36 people including a prominent commander.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Citing a letter from a young Hong Konger appealing for people ""not to believe the Communists"", Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen said on Sunday the island's democratic way of life was at risk from the danger China posed to Taiwan.
The months of anti-government protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong have taken centre stage in Taiwan ahead of the Jan. 11 presidential and parliamentary elections, with Tsai in particular warning Taiwan would be next if it gives into Chinese pressure and accepts Beijing's rule.
Speaking at a televised presidential debate, Tsai read excerpts from a letter she said she received from a young person in Hong Kong. She did not name the person nor say when the letter was written.
Tsai read from the letter: ""'I ask that Taiwan's people not believe the Chinese Communists, don't believe any pro-Communist official, and don't fall into China's money trap.'""
Taiwan's people have been through their own traumas under martial law before adopting democracy and are now seeing ""the end of Hong Kong"", Tsai quoted the letter as saying.
Tsai said she wanted to read the letter to remind people of the significance of their vote next month.
""On Jan. 11, the vote in our hands can decide whether our democratic way of life of today can continue. The whole world is watching what Taiwan will do on Jan. 11.""
China claims Taiwan as its own territory, to be taken under its control by force if needed. Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its formal name.
China says it will run Taiwan under the ""one country, two systems"" model - the same as used in Hong Kong - granting it a high degree of autonomy.
Tsai and her main opponent Han Kuo-yu from the Kuomintang, which favors close relations with China, have both rejected this model, though Tsai has repeatedly portrayed Han as supporting it.
Han said Tsai was ""deceiving"" the people of Hong Kong by using their struggle to try and win votes.
""They are bleeding from fighting against China, while you are enjoying electoral gains. Your campaign is based on the blood of Hong Kong people. You are exploiting the values they uphold,"" he said, citing remarks from a Hong Kong student leader who later apologized for his criticism.
Han also reiterated what has become a frequent complaint, that senior members of Tsai's Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party and Tsai herself had previously been to China, accusing them of hypocrisy for denouncing a trip he made earlier this year.
""And you slam me for accepting 'one country, two systems' - this is really too much,"" Han said."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Residents and holidaymakers in part of the Australian state of Victoria were urged to leave on Sunday ahead of what is expected to be a day of extreme fire danger.
Authorities said temperatures of more than 40 Celsius (104 Fahrenheit), strong winds, thunderstorms and a wind change moving across the state meant Monday would be one of the most significant fire weather days in Victoria's history.
State Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp told both residents and tens of thousands of holidaymakers in the East Gippsland region to leave no later than Monday morning.
""What we are saying now, based on the conditions that will be confronting us tomorrow across the state, but in particular in East Gippsland, is that if you're holidaying in that part of the state, it's time that you left,"" Crisp said at a media conference on Sunday.

""You should not be there tomorrow and we want you to get out now.""
Earlier on Sunday, organizers of a music festival in the state canceled the event, citing the extreme weather expected on Monday.
""After consultation with local and regional fire authorities and other emergency stakeholders, it is clear that we have no other option,"" the organizers wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
The event was meant to run until New Year's Eve and some 9,000 people were already camping on site when the announcement was made.
The state of New South Wales (NSW) is also facing severe fire conditions over coming days, with temperatures expecting to peak on Tuesday.
""We've got some deteriorating weather conditions over the coming days, particularly Monday and worsening through to Tuesday,"" said the NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner, Shane Fitzsimmons.
'VERY PROLONGED'
The federal government said on Sunday it would compensate volunteer firefighters in NSW as they grappled with the intensity of this year's bushfire season.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said payments of up to A$6,000 ($4,186) would be available for eligible firefighters who had spent more than 10 days in the field this fire season.
""As this is a very prolonged fire season, this is putting additional demands on our firefighters,"" Morrison told a news conference.
""It means that the turn-outs and the call-outs have been far more extensive than in previous years, going well and beyond and above what is normally expected of those who are engaged in volunteer service.""
Morrison had previously said compensation for volunteers was not a priority, but he has faced increasing political pressure as the widespread fires burn.
On Tuesday, he announced government workers could get additional paid leave for volunteering.
While there are different rules across Australia's states, volunteers tend to negotiate time off directly with their employer.

Bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) in five states since September and eight deaths have been linked to the blazes.

Last week, President Tayyip Erdogan announced his government’s decision to seek a parliamentary consent to send troops to Libya to defend the U.N.-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli against General Khalifa Haftar forces which receives military support from Russia, Egypt and United Arab Emirates.
Haftar's fighters have failed to reach the center of Tripoli but have made small gains in recent weeks in some southern suburbs of the capital with the help of Russian and Sudanese fighters, as well as drones shipped by the UAE, diplomats say.
The Chinese-made drones have given Haftar ""local air superiority"" as they can carry over eight times the weight of explosives than the drones given to the GNA by Turkey and can also cover the whole of Libya, a United Nations report said in November.
Last month, Ankara signed two separate accords with the GNA, led by Fayez al-Serraj, one on security and military cooperation and another on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.
The GNA said on Sunday that a video circulating online purportedly showing Syrian fighters deployed by Turkey in Libya were false. It claimed the recording, which shows a number of men in military fatigues beside a fence, was actually shot in the Syrian province of Idlib. Reuters could not independently verify the footage."

BISSAU (Reuters) - Voters in Guinea-Bissau began casting ballots on Sunday in a run-off presidential election pitting two former prime ministers who both promise to bring stability to the turbulent West African nation.
Incumbent President Jose Mario Vaz failed to make it to the second round after a five-year term marred by regular high-level sackings, a barely functioning parliament and weeks of turmoil in the run-up to the first-round ballot. 
Both candidates in Sunday's showdown have said that if elected they will work to overcome a long-running political impasse and modernize the country of 1.6 million people, which has suffered nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974.
The ruling PAIGC party's Domingos Simoes Pereira, 56, is seen as the front-runner after winning the first round on Nov. 24 with 40%.
His opponent, Umaro Cissoko Embalo, 47, came second with 28% despite being a relative political newcomer, and political analysts say the run-off race could be close.
""Pereira has a slight advantage over his rival,"" said analyst Fode Mane, who is also rector of Amilcar Cabral University in the capital, Bissau.
Embalo's candidacy has won support from the main contenders who failed to reach the run-off, including Vaz, although Mane said that would not necessarily guarantee him more votes.
After the first round, Embalo questioned the result, saying the final tally between him and Pereira was much closer than official figures had shown.
MAJOR CHALLENGES
Polling stations opened at 0700 GMT and were due to close at 1700 GMT. The electoral commission is expected to announce the provisional result on Wednesday, Jan. 1. 
Guinea-Bissau's next president will inherit major challenges including widespread poverty and an unstable political system in which the majority party appoints the government but the president has the power to dismiss it.
There have been seven prime ministers since Vaz took over in 2014 and the political instability has hurt the economy, which depends heavily on volatile prices for cashew nuts, the main income source for over two-thirds of households.
Although his tenure was turbulent, Vaz is the first Guinea-Bissau president to have completed a full term.
Voters expressed hope that the post-election process would go smoothly so the winner could focus on bringing long-sought change.
""I voted to restore peace and tranquility in Guinea-Bissau, and to contribute to electing a president who is going to unite the whole country,"" said Caminho Injai, 65, a cleaning lady, after casting her ballot.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India's tourism industry has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government protests against a new citizenship law that have rocked several cities this month, with at least seven countries issuing travel warnings.
At least 25 people have been killed in clashes between police and protesters, and demonstrations against the law continue.
Officials estimate about 200,000 domestic and international tourists canceled or postponed their trip to the Taj Mahal in the past two weeks, one of the world's most popular tourist attractions.
""There has been a 60% decline in visitor footfalls in December this year,"" said Dinesh Kumar, a police inspector overseeing a special tourist police station near the Taj Mahal who has access to visitor data. He said the decline was compared to December last year.
""Indian and foreign tourists have been calling our control rooms to check security. We assure them protection, but many still decide to stay away,"" said Kumar.
The 17th century marble monument is in Uttar Pradesh, the northern state that has witnessed the highest number of deaths and intense bursts of violence in two weeks of unrest.
A group of European tourists traveling in a group across India said they now planned to cut short their 20 day trip.
""We are all retired folks, for us travel has to be slow and relaxing. The newspaper headlines have led to a sense of concern and we will leave sooner than we had planned,"" said Dave Millikin, a retired banker living on the outskirts of London, who spoke to Reuters from the capital New Delhi.
The Taj Mahal, situated in the town of Agra, attracts over 6.5 million tourists every year, generating nearly $14 million annually from entrance fees. A foreign tourist pays 1,100 rupees (about $15) to enter the grounds, although nationals from neighboring countries get a discount.
Managers in luxury hotels and guest houses around the Taj Mahal said last minute cancellations during the festive season have further dampened business sentiment at a time when the country's economic growth has slowed to 4.5%, its slowest pace in more than six years.
In a bid to clamp down on violence and unrest, authorities have suspended mobile internet services in Agra.
""Blocking the internet has affected travel and tourism in Agra by about 50-60%,"" said Sandeep Arora, president of the Agra Tourism Development Foundation that groups over 250 tour operators, hotels and guides.
The United States, Britain, Russia, Israel, Singapore, Canada and Taiwan have issued travel advisories asking their citizens to either refrain from visiting or to exercise caution when visiting regions embroiled in India's protests.
Jayanta Malla Baruah, the head of the Assam Tourism Development Corp., said the state, home to the world's largest concentration of one-horned rhinoceroses, is visited on average by 500,000 tourists during December.
""But this time, due to the ongoing protests and travel advisories by various countries, the number is down by 90% if not more.""

BLUE MOUNTAINS, Australia (Reuters) - The dirty, hot and dangerous work of battling bushfires might be physically exhausting for Raymond Lowe, but he is not stepping aside any time soon.
Lowe is part of a four-person crew from the Rural Fire Service (RFS) in New South Wales (NSW) state who are all in their 60s and have given up their time over Christmas to tackle some of Australia's fiercest fires, in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney.
Lowe is a volunteer and says that for him, the greatest reward is the fellowship among those fighting the fires.
""There's always going to be that desire to get out because it's the camaraderie that you find out here,"" said Lowe.
""It’s hard to describe the feeling and how genuine everyone is and just how good it is to be able to help.""
Lowe, a school administrator, is part of the biggest volunteer rural fire service in the world with more than 72,000 members who regularly work shifts of up to 14 hours to protect their communities and those around them.
Volunteer firefighting has long been Australia's primary defense against catastrophe but the intensity of this year's fire season sparked a political debate over whether firefighters should be compensated for their time.
The bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) across the country, dwarfing the terrain burnt by fierce fires in California during 2019.
There have also been eight deaths linked to the fires, including two firefighter volunteers.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday said volunteer firefighters in NSW would be compensated up to A$6,000 ($4,186) if they spent more than 10 days in the field this fire season.
Previously, Morrison had suggested that payment of firefighters was not a priority.
For another volunteer, Ian White, retirement has meant he has more time to help his community than full-time workers.
""Because I’m retired I can take the load off these younger blokes,"" White told Reuters.
""As long as I’m healthy enough I’ll keep doing it because that takes the pressure off them."""

Separately Brazil's government said in a statement it was processing asylum claims from five deserting Venezuelan soldiers it had picked up earlier in the week. The government did not mention the Dec. 22 raid, but a Brazilian military source said the soldiers were suspected of involvement in the attack.
One Venezuelan soldier died in the attack on the garrison in Bolivar state, near the Brazil border. Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said three suspects were detained on Saturday, after several arrests last week, and that the government recovered 111 of the 120 rifles and eight of the nine grenade launchers that were stolen.
Maduro initially accused Colombia, Peru and Brazil - all governed by fierce critics of his socialist government - of complicity with the attack, which all three countries denied. But he said on Saturday he expected Brazil would hand the five suspects over to ""comply with international law.""
""A military deserter who enters another country and is detained should be handed over immediately,"" Maduro said in a state television address. ""Sooner rather than later, these terrorists will be in the hands of Venezuelan justice.""
Venezuela is undergoing a deep economic crisis marked by high inflation, rolling blackouts and rising child malnutrition.
The government last week said it had detained a former national guard member in connection with the raid, who was among hundreds of soldiers who deserted to Colombia earlier this year during a failed effort by the opposition to bring in humanitarian aid. Some of those soldiers have said they are prepared to take up arms to bring down Maduro."

The Greens' Federal Congress, comprising various groups within the party including its national, local and European lawmakers, must sign off on any coalition deal, and it requires a week's notice to meet.
The meeting has been called for Jan. 4 and invitations were sent shortly before midnight, a Greens spokeswoman said.
Although a deal has not yet been struck between the Greens and Kurz's People's Party (OVP), which won the last parliamentary election on Sept. 29, calling the meeting indicates the Greens believe an agreement will be reached before then.
Kurz said on Friday as talks resumed after a short Christmas break that he aims to have a government sworn in by ""early to mid-January"". In contrast to the Greens, Kurz can sign off on the deal himself on behalf of his party.
Given the difficulty in keeping the deal confidential once it is put to the more than 250 members of the Federal Congress, the details are likely to be announced before it meets. Media reports overnight said that presentation was likely to happen on Jan. 2 or Jan. 3.
Few of those details have emerged so far, but Greens leader Werner Kogler has said he wants an investment package in environmental measures, and Kurz has said his priorities include continuing his hard line on illegal immigration and keeping a balanced budget.
There have also been reports the deal includes large investments in expanding Austria's rail network.
A deal would bring Kurz back to power as chancellor after his coalition with the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) collapsed in May over a video sting that felled FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache. A provisional government of civil servants is in place for the time being until a coalition is formed."

Ivory Coast's public prosecutor issued the warrant for Soro on Dec. 23 as part of an investigation into an alleged coup plot, forcing him to call off a planned homecoming for the first time since May and ahead of the October 2020 election.
Soro - who gave the interview to the Journal du Dimanche (JDD) in Paris on Dec. 26, and has been based in France for the past six months, according to the newspaper - said the warrant was politically motivated.
""This warrant is not based on the law, but has simply been issued to stop a candidate from trying to win office,"" Soro said.
He added that an audio recording being cited by prosecutors in their allegations was a manipulation and the result of a set-up. The warrant was issued for breaches of state security, receiving stolen public resources and money laundering.
The case involving Soro, who retains the loyalty of many former rebel commanders who now hold senior positions in the army, could significantly increase tensions ahead of the election, which is seen as a test of Ivory Coast's stability.
On Saturday, Ivory Coast President Alassane Ouattara said Soro was not above the law and would face justice for allegedly seeking to destabilize the country.
That came after a group of Ivory Coast opposition parties accused state authorities on Friday of trying to intimidate them before the presidential election, and denounced the warrant against Soro.
Soro said he had not had any contact with French President Emmanuel Macron's office during his time in France and had not asked for protection from French authorities. Macron visited Ivory Coast in late December, before the warrant emerged.
Soro said he would work on a form of political resistance from overseas for now.
""I am and remain a candidate for the presidency,"" he said."

In a post on Twitter late on Saturday, Wilders called on people to send in their Mohammad cartoons.
""Freedom of speech must prevail over violence and Islamic fatwa's"", the leader of the largest opposition party in the Dutch parliament wrote.
Wilders canceled a similar contest in August last year after police arrested a man who had threatened to kill him over his plan.
At the time, plans to hold the contest also prompted large demonstrations in Pakistan, organized by Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik, which called on Islamist countries to sever all ties with the Netherlands.
Images of the Prophet Mohammad are traditionally forbidden in Islam as idolatrous. Caricatures are regarded by most Muslims as highly offensive.
In 2005, Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published cartoons of Mohammad that sparked demonstrations across the Muslim world as well as several attempts to kill either its editor or cartoonist Kurt Westergaard.
Ten years later, a pair of Islamist gunmen killed 12 people at the offices of magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris, also known for publishing satirical cartoons of the Prophet."

Kim, chairman of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), guided the first-day session of the plenary meeting to discuss ""important matters arising in the party building and activities and in the building of the state and national defense,"" KCNA news agency said in a statement.
""The immediate orientation of the struggle of the WPK and the state and important policy issues for new victory in our revolution under the present situation were brought up as agendas of the plenary meeting,"" KCNA said.
KCNA did not provide further details of the meeting, but it said the meeting will be continued.
The North's party plenary meeting comes a week after Pyongyang held the ruling Workers' Party's Central Military Meeting to discuss boosting the country's military capability.
Earlier this month, North Korea said it would hold a plenary session of its ruling party sometime this month to discuss and decide on crucial issues due to the changed situation at home and abroad, without elaborating.
Pyongyang has repeatedly asked Washington to meet its year-end deadline and to offer a new initiative to iron out their differences over the North's nuclear weapons program. It warned Washington earlier this month that failure to meet Pyongyang's expectations could result in an unwanted ""Christmas gift.""
In the midst of heightened tensions between North Korea and the United States, North Korea conducted two ""crucial"" tests at a satellite launch site this month to bolster its strategic nuclear deterrence.
In response to the North's warning, U.S. President Donald Trump said last week the United States was ready to deal with any North Korea ""Christmas gift"" amid U.S. concerns Pyongyang might be preparing a long-range missile test."

Soro this week canceled plans to return to Ivory Coast after the authorities issued a warrant for his arrest as part of an investigation into an alleged coup plot that has seen more than 15 people close to him detained.
In his first comments on the case, Ouattara said at a news conference in Abidjan that anyone ""involved in destabilizing the country, must face the full force of the law"".
""The law will be applied in full to all Ivorian citizens regardless of whether they are outside Ivory Coast.""
Soro has denounced the investigation as politically motivated. His exact whereabouts are unclear, but he is believed to be in Europe.
On Friday, a group of opposition parties said the case showed that the authorities were seeking to stifle dissent ahead of next year's presidential election, seen as a test of the West African country's stability after two civil wars since the turn of the century."

MADRID (Reuters) - Mexico should stay out of Bolivian domestic affairs after the collapse last month of former leader Evo Morales's Socialist government, Bolivia's acting foreign minister Karen Longaric was quoted saying in an interview published on Saturday.
A dispute has been brewing for days between Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and Bolivia's interim leaders over Mexico's granting of asylum in its diplomatic facilities in La Paz to nine people, including allies of Morales who Bolivia wants to try for sedition and armed revolt. 
""We simply ask Lopez Obrador's government to stop meddling in our internal affairs and to respect Bolivian sovereignty,"" Longaric told Spain's El Pais newspaper.
""Bolivia is not a Mexican colony,"" added Longaric, who took up the ministry under interim President Jeanine Añez last month after Morales resigned and fled to Mexico City following allegations of electoral meddling. 
The interview was conducted before Mexico reported an incident at its ambassador's residence in La Paz on Friday, saying Bolivian police had impeded the departure of visiting Spanish officials from the premises.
Longaric said on Friday the officials had been stopped because they were accompanied by masked men deemed to be a security threat. She told El Pais the request for heightened surveillance at the compound had come from Mexican authorities.
Spain's Foreign Ministry said on Saturday it would send a mission to investigate the incident.
In a statement, the Spanish ministry said ""the objective of the visit ... was exclusively courtesy"", and added it ""roundly denies that (the visit) could have been aimed at facilitating the exit of the people granted asylum on the premises"". 
Lopez Obrador, a leftist, offered Morales asylum after a presidential election the Organization of American States said was rigged in his favor. Morales has since gone to Argentina. 
In Saturday's interview, Longaric asked what right Lopez Obrador had to question the decisions of the Bolivian people, alluding to what she called his ""ideological proximity"" to Morales.
""Bolivian interests are not the same as the interests of another country's president, who only wants to bring political benefit to his associate, his acolyte,"" she said.

Mexico says Bolivian authorities have harassed and intimidated its diplomatic staff, and has asked the International Court of Justice to mediate in the dispute.

French trade unions have spearheaded nationwide strikes since early December in an outcry over President Emmanuel Macron's pensions overhaul, disrupting schools, railways and roads, while lending support to regular protests.
On Saturday ""yellow vests"" - an anti-government movement that sprung up a year ago as a backlash against the high cost of living - joined a rally of several thousand people against the pensions shake-up.
Police used tear gas against protesters close to tourists hotspots like the Center Pompidou museum of modern art, where some demonstrators had tried to erect barricades and set fire to them, and smashed up a bus stop.
Clashes broke out at other points of the demonstration too, although the protest was dying down by the late afternoon.
Jerome Rodrigues, a prominent figure in the ""yellow vest"" movement, was hurt in the eye although it was not immediately clear how he had sustained the injury. Rodrigues was blinded in the same eye earlier this year during another demonstration.
France's transport network remained disrupted across the country and in Paris on the last weekend of the year, and rail and metro workers have so far insisted they will keep pressure on Macron to abandon his overhaul.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte named two new ministers on Saturday to replace his education minister who resigned this week and outlined an ambitious agenda for next year including reform of the justice system and state bureaucracy.
In a three-hour year-end news conference, Conte accused right-wing opposition leader Matteo Salvini of ""insidious"" political behavior and appealed for unity from the fractious coalition backing his own government.
""Politics doesn't need conflicts. Polemics and marking out our differences don't help us,"" Conte said in reference to the frequent bickering between the 5-Star Movement, the center-left Democratic Party (PD) and smaller centrist and leftist parties.
Filling the gap left after Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti from the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement quit on Wednesday complaining of insufficient funding, Conte said he was dividing the ministry into two.
He named Lucia Azzolina, also from 5-Star and previously Fioramonti's junior minister, as the new minister for schools, and named a non-party technocrat Gaetano Manfredi, the rector of Naples University, as minister for universities and research.
Three 5-Star senators quit this month to join Salvini's League party and some politicians say other lawmakers from the increasingly divided movement are ready to join a new parliamentary group led by Fioramonti but loyal to Conte.
The prime minister said if any such moves were afoot he disapproved of them and had nothing to do with them.
""I don't want parliamentarians using my name to form a new group that would only make the government less stable,"" he said.
Conte, an unaffiliated technocrat, was originally close to 5-Star but has received growing praise from the PD since the government was formed in September, and he is now sometimes tipped as a future center-left leader.
Conte said he would meet with the ruling parties in January to detail priorities for 2020, promising an overhaul of the state bureaucracy that was sure to meet with opposition but would make the system more efficient.
""A lot of people won't be happy,"" he said. ""When you tell a public department to do in 30 days what it has been doing in 60 this creates resistance.""
Among the government's first hurdles is a justice system reform, which sees Conte in the difficult role of arbiter between 5-Star and the PD.
A reform championed by 5-Star to relax time limits on the prosecution of crimes is due to kick in from January, but it is opposed by the PD which says defendants would face years of legal uncertainty while their trials continue interminably.
Conte said the dispute would be resolved thanks to new rules to be unveiled soon that would streamline the justice system and ""ensure trials are completed within a reasonable time."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden on Saturday said there would be ""no legal basis"" for Republicans to subpoena his testimony in President Donald Trump's impeachment trial, clarifying remarks from Friday that drew criticism.
""I want to clarify something I said yesterday. In my 40 years in public life, I have always complied with a lawful order and in my eight years as VP, my office — unlike Donald Trump and Mike Pence — cooperated with legitimate congressional oversight requests,"" Biden said on Twitter.
""But I am just not going to pretend that there is any legal basis for Republican subpoenas for my testimony in the impeachment trial,"" Biden added.
The statement came one day after Biden said in an interview with the Des Moines Register that he would not comply with a Senate subpoena because it would be a tactic by Trump to distract from the president's wrongdoing.
Some legal experts and commentators had criticized Biden for his remarks to the Iowa newspaper, noting that the White House's refusal to comply with congressional subpoenas was part of the reason why Trump had been impeached.
Trump was impeached on Dec. 18 by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on two charges over his pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation of Biden, a former vice president and a top contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Biden’s son. Trump has been charged with abuse of power and obstructing Congress’ investigation.
Trump has said he did nothing wrong.
A trial is anticipated in the Republican-controlled Senate to determine whether Trump should be removed from office. However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the upper chamber in a bid to pressure Republicans to reach an accord with the Democrats on trial rules.
Trump has raised unsubstantiated charges that Biden improperly tried to halt a Ukrainian probe of a company with ties to his son, and has said he wants Biden to testify in the impeachment trial.
Ross Garber, a Washington lawyer specializing in impeachment proceedings, said it was ""incredibly unlikely"" that Republican senators would back an effort to push for Biden's testimony."

The oilfield produces 90,000 barrels a day (bpd) of crude. Protesters chanted ""no homeland, no oil"", as they forced its closure, the sources said. 
Mass protests have gripped Iraq since Oct. 1 and protesters, most of them young, are demanding an overhaul of a political system they see as profoundly corrupt and keeping most Iraqis in poverty. More than 450 people have been killed.
The incident marks the first time protesters have shut an entire oilfield, though they have blocked entrances to refineries and ports in the past. Iraq's economy depends on oil exports which make up more than 90% of revenues for OPEC's second larger producer. No foreign companies operate at the oilfield.
Protesters are demanding the removal of the entire ruling elite seen as enriching itself off the state and serving foreign powers — above all Iran — as many Iraqis languish in poverty without jobs, healthcare or education - and the appointment of an premier with no party affiliation.
Iraqi President Barham Salih refused on Thursday to designate the nominee of an Iran-backed parliamentary bloc for prime minister, saying he would rather resign than appoint someone to the position who would be rejected by protesters, further extending weeks of political deadlock.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - At least 90 people were killed when a bomb-laden truck exploded at a busy checkpoint in the Somali capital Mogadishu on Saturday, an international organization working in the country said, in the deadliest attack in more than two years. 
The dead included many students and two Turkish nationals, Somalia's foreign minister said, adding that dozens were injured.
Saturday is a working day in the Muslim country and the explosion occurred during the morning rush hour. Rescuers carried bodies past the twisted wreckage of a vehicle and a minibus taxi smeared with blood. 
A report by the international organization, which did not want to be named, said the death toll was more than 90 and that university students and 17 police officers were among those killed. A Somali MP also tweeted that he had been told the death toll stands at more than 90.
Like other checkpoints in a city scarred by decades of conflict, traffic is often clogged at the Ex-Control Junction, where heavily armed security forces check vehicles for explosives and weapons and other officers direct traffic. There is also a government tax collection point at junction, officials said. 
No-one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast but the city's mayor blamed al Qaeda-linked Islamist group al Shabaab. 
The group regularly carries out such attacks in an attempt to undermine the government, which is backed by the United Nations and African Union peacekeeping troops. 
The most deadly attack blamed on al Shabaab was in October 2017 when a bomb-laden truck exploded next to a fuel tanker in Mogadishu, creating a fireball that killed nearly 600 people.
While al Shabaab carries out frequent attacks, the death tolls are often lower than in Saturday's blast. The group has sometimes not claimed responsibility for attacks that sparked a big public backlash, such as a 2009 suicide bombing of a graduation ceremony for medical students.
A number of attacks this year, including one in September on a base where U.S. special forces train Somali commandos, show the group maintains a strong intelligence network and can mount deadly and sometimes sophisticated operations, analysts say. 
Three witnesses told Reuters that a small team of Turkish engineers were present at the time of the blast, constructing a road into the city. 
Turkey's foreign ministry confirmed the death of two of its nationals.
Turkey has been a major donor to Somalia since a famine in 2011, and together with the government of Qatar is funding a number of infrastructure and medical projects in the country. Turkey opened a military base in Mogadishu in 2017 to train Somali soldiers.
'SCREAMING FOR HELP'
After the explosion, 55-year-old Sabdow Ali, who lives nearby, said he left his house and counted at least 13 people dead. 
""Dozens of injured people were screaming for help but the police immediately opened fire and I rushed back to my house,"" he told Reuters.
The injured were transported to Medina Hospital, where a Reuters witness saw dozens arriving by ambulance, and to other hospitals. 
A nurse at Medina, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the facility had received more than 100 wounded people. Weeping relatives gathered outside the entrance as they sought information on their loved ones. 
Speaking to reporters at the blast site, Mogadishu Mayor Omar Muhamoud said students were killed as they commuted to their studies, many of them to the capital's Banadir University.
Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Awad tweeted that many of the dead were ""students with ambition, and hardworking men and women."" 
The mayor blamed al Shabaab for the attack, without giving details.
Police officials were not immediately available for comment on casualty numbers.
AL SHABAAB'S STAYING POWER
Somalia has been riven by conflict since 1991, when clan warlords overthrew dictator Siad Barre and then turned on each other. 
Al Shabaab grew out of a political movement that used Islamic courts to try to impose order on the country. U.S.-backed Ethiopian soldiers defeated the Islamic Courts Union in 2006, but the movement's youth wing split off and launched an insurgency. Al Shabaab pledged loyalty to al Qaeda in 2012.
The AU peacekeeping force, in Somalia since 2007, has been gradually withdrawing its forces over the past several years. Somali forces are scheduled to assume responsibility for security next year, though the precise date of the withdrawal has repeatedly shifted.
""Somalia is not ready to take over control of security next year or the year after,"" said Hussein Sheikh-Ali, a former national security adviser and founder of the Hiraal Institute, a Mogadishu-based security think-tank. 
Saturday's attack was the 20th vehicle-borne explosives attack of 2019 and the year is ending with more deaths from such attacks than 2018, he said. 

Al Shabaab has also carried out attacks in east African countries such as Kenya and Uganda. It claimed responsibility for an attack in January on an upscale hotel and office complex in the Kenyan capital that killed 21 people.

1568,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2019 10:09AM ET</span>",Algeria names new prime minister,"ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's President Abdelmadjid Tebboune on Saturday named a university professor and former diplomat as prime minister as he builds a new government to handle political unrest and a looming economic challenge.
Abdelaziz Djerad, 65, served in the administration of a previous president in the 1990s, but was sidelined by president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who was ousted in April after two decades as head of state. 
The massive street protest movement that prompted Bouteflika to step down regarded Tebboune's election this month as illegitimate and it seems unlikely to accept any government he appoints. 
The protesters rejected any election that took place while the military stayed involved in politics and Bouteflika-era figures retained powerful positions. 
Algeria's authorities publicly welcomed the street protests, casting them as a patriotic movement aimed at refreshing Algerian politics and ending corruption. 
Djerad spoke several times on radio after the protests began, backing them and demanding that Bouteflika and his allies quit power. 
Tebboune, himself a former prime minister, was one of five former senior officials approved as candidates for the presidential race, and won 58% of votes on Dec. 12 amid protests and an electoral boycott that reduced turnout to 40%. 
The opposition say that despite Tebboune's election, ultimate power remains with the army, whose own chief, Ahmed Gaed Salah, died suddenly of a heart attack on Monday. 
It leaves Algeria with a new president, prime minister and army chief during its most acute political crisis in decades. Meanwhile the country faces a longer-term slide in its trade and fiscal balances after years of lower energy prices. 
With state coffers relying on energy exports for most annual revenue, the new government may be forced to make tough cuts in spending. The parliament and outgoing interim government have already agreed a 9% cut in public spending for 2020. 
Other members of the new government are expected to be named in the coming days.

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman plans to diversify the kingdom away from its reliance on oil exports and wants Riyadh to produce or assemble half its defense equipment locally, aiming to create 40,000 jobs for Saudis by 2030.
Saudi Arabia is among the top five defense spenders in the world. It is one of several U.S. allies to use Patriot, a ground to air missile system giving defense against ballistic missiles and other threats.
Ahmed al-Ohali, governor of Saudi Arabia's General Authority for Military Industries (GAMI), said the agreement with Raytheon reflected the authority's efforts to develop Saudi's military industries and its research and technology capabilities, state news agency SPA reported.
He did not say how many jobs would be involved, the value of the agreement, or the location of any work being moved or localized.

The move came unexpectedly after a court last week handed a 21-month jail sentence to Vazha Gaprindashvili, who colleagues said had been trying to reach a patient in South Ossetia, a region controlled by Moscow since a war in 2008.
""I did not expect my release today,"" Gaprindashvili, who is the president of Georgia's association of orthopedist and traumatologists, told reporters in the Georgian town of Gori.
""I want to thank everyone who worried about me, but especially my beautiful wife and wonderful children,"" he added.
Gaprindashvili was taken to South Ossetia's regional center Tskhinvali on Nov. 9 and held in custody awaiting trial by separatist authorities, who said the doctor had crossed illegally into the territory.
Georgian villagers living near the loosely guarded rural boundary are often detained on similar grounds, but the detention of the high-profile doctor drew international attention.
The U.S. embassy in Georgia, the parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe and rights group Amnesty International called for Gaprindashvili's immediate release and the reopening of all crossing points along the South Ossetia boundary.
Hundreds of Georgians, including politicians, staged a rally at the administrative boundary with South Ossetia earlier this month to demand his release.
Russia won a brief war against fellow former Soviet republic Georgia in 2008, after which Moscow recognized two Georgian breakaway regions, South Ossetia and Abkhazia, as independent and deployed troops there.

1571,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2019 07:55AM ET</span>",China scraps extra-judicial forced labor for sex workers,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's parliament abolished on Saturday an extra-judicial system of forced labor used to punish sex workers and their clients for up to two years, but it stressed that prostitution remains illegal.
China banned prostitution after the Communist revolution in 1949, but it returned with a vengeance after landmark economic reforms began in the late 1970s, despite periodic crackdowns.
The official Xinhua news agency said China's largely rubber-stamp legislature had voted to scrap the ""custody and education"" system. It said the decision would be effective from Sunday, when all those currently held in detention under the system would be released.
State media said the instruction to do away with the system had come from the Cabinet and parliament had recommended a review last year, noting that the program was increasingly not being applied in practice.
It had come in for criticism not only for its extra-judicial nature, as China seeks to promote a more law-based society, but also because of abuses such as the supposed rehabilitation facilities being run as profit-making ventures.
Xinhua said that when the system was instigated two decades ago it had ""played an important role in educating and rescuing those involved in prostitution and visiting prostitutes"".
But as the country continues to deepen legal reforms and the criminal system, the ""custody and education"" program was less and less appropriate, it added.
""The custody and education system's historical role had already been completed. This is an important manifestation of strengthening social management using rule of law thinking and methods,"" the news agency said.
Prostitution remains illegal, however, with punishments of up to 15 days in detention and fines of up to 5,000 yuan ($714.76), Xinhua said.
In 2013, China scrapped another controversial forced labor statute - the re-education through labor system.
That decision followed several high-profile miscarriages of justice, including a case where a woman was sent to a labor camp after demanding justice for her daughter who had been raped.
The re-education through labor system, which began in 1957, had empowered police to sentence petty criminals to up to four years in detention without going through the courts.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police arrested about a dozen protesters and used pepper spray on Saturday to break up a protest in a shopping mall aimed at disrupting retail businesses near the border with mainland China.
Demonstrators have been targeting malls across Hong Kong since earlier this week and more than a hundred protesters, many dressed in black with face masks, marched through a mall in Sheung Shui on Saturday, chanting ""Go back to China"".
Sheung Shui, which is just over the border from the Chinese city of Shenzhen, is popular with so-called parallel traders who buy large volumes of duty-free goods in Hong Kong and then sell them on the mainland.
The Chinese traders have become a target for protesters in Hong Kong, who are blame them for overcrowding and pushing up prices and rents.
""Our intention is to make shops close their gates. There are many parallel traders, we want to cast them out,"" said Kelly, a 17-year-old protester wearing mask.
Police wrestled one protester to the ground and pepper sprayed his face before handcuffing him. Many shops closed early and shoppers hurried out of the mall. 
The protests in Hong Kong began more than six months ago in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
The demonstrations have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement and became more confrontational over the festive season.
More protests are planned in the next few days, including a countdown to New Year's Day and a march on Jan. 1 organized by the civil human rights front that could attract thousands.  
Many protesters have been angered by what they see as the use of unnecessary force by police and have demanded an independent inquiry into the force's behavior.
Hong Kong police have earned a total of $17.3 million in meal and work-related allowances during the past six months of anti-government protests, government figures showed on Friday.
Demonstrators are also angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 
China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest. "
1573,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2019 06:52AM ET</span>",Hong Kong police paid $17 million in allowances related to protests,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong police have earned a total of HK$135 million in allowances during the past six months of anti-government protests, government figures show.
The meal and work-related allowances were on top of HK$950 million overtime pay that police have earned since the protests intensified in June, according to the figures released to city legislators on Friday.
The Chinese-ruled city has been convulsed by more than 900 often violent protests since June, the security bureau said earlier, as public opposition to a now-withdrawn extradition bill developed into demands for greater freedoms.
The protests have regularly featured ranks of riot police firing volleys of tear gas or baton-charging protesters, often in central business or tourist areas. Police in turn have been attacked with petrol bombs and other projectiles hurled by protesters, many of them masked.
In a written response to questions from pro-democracy lawmakers, the Civil Service Bureau said HK$50 million in meal allowances had been paid to front-line officers and back-end clerical staff who worked 12 hours or more within a day since the turmoil began.
Another HK$85 million was paid out for work-related allowances, it said. The bureau did not give a breakdown but the allowances could include those paid to police who worked undercover or in plainclothes for 30 days.
Hong Kong police were not immediately available for comment when contacted by Reuters.
There have been widespread complaints from protesters of police misconduct and public satisfaction with a force once held in great respect by the public has fallen to the lowest on record, according to a poll by the Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute.
Police loosened guidelines on the use of force in September, giving officers greater power to deal with protesters in difficult situations.
Many protesters are now demanding an independent inquiry into their complaints of police brutality. But police have described their action as restrained with an appropriate use of force to combat illegal acts.

1574,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 28, 2019 06:43AM ET</span>",Russia says it has deployed first hypersonic nuclear-capable missiles,"By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia deployed its first regiment of hypersonic nuclear-capable missiles on Friday, the Defence Ministry said, a move which President Vladimir Putin has boasted puts his country in a class of its own.
Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu has informed Putin of the deployment, according to a ministry statement that did not disclose where the missiles were located.
The new system, called Avangard, comprises a hypersonic glide vehicle designed to sit atop an intercontinental ballistic missile, one of several new types of weapons Putin has touted as ahead of their time.
Putin has said Russia's new generation of nuclear weapons can hit almost any point in the world and evade a U.S.-built missile shield. Some Western experts have questioned how advanced some of the weapons programs are.
The Pentagon said in a statement that it ""will not characterize the Russian claims"" about the Avangard's capabilities. The United States has been developing hypersonic weapons since the early 2000s, according to a Congressional Research Service report published in July. 
Russia said on Nov. 26 that U.S. experts had examined an Avangard under inspection rules of the 2010 New START treaty. A U.S. State Department official confirmed that inspectors examined an Avangard, but had no further comment. 
Putin said on Tuesday the Avangard system could penetrate both existing and any future missile defense systems.
""Today, we have a unique situation in our new and recent history. They (other countries) are trying to catch up with us. Not a single country possesses hypersonic weapons, let alone continental-range hypersonic weapons,"" said Putin. 
Hypersonic glide vehicles are boosted on a rocket to altitudes of between 40 km (25 miles) and 100 km (62 miles) before detaching to glide along the upper atmosphere toward their target, say researchers.
Control surfaces on glide vehicles mean they can steer an unpredictable course and maneuver sharply as they approach impact. They also follow a much flatter and lower trajectory than the high, arching path of a ballistic missile.
That makes them much harder to detect early with radar, giving missile defenses less time to respond, say researchers.
However, Jeffrey Lewis, an arms control expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California, said he doubted the claim that the Avangard can evade missile defenses.

“I remain skeptical that gliders will change the survivability of Russia’s nuclear forces since gliding results in slower speeds than traditional re-entry,” he said.

Nguyen Bac Son received the money to facilitate a deal in which MobiFone overpaid for a 95% stake in a loss-making pay television provider, the Ministry of Public Security said in a statement.
The court also sentenced another former information minister, Truong Minh Tuan, to 14 years in prison, accused of economic mismanagement and taking bribes in the same case, according to the statement.
MobiFone, one of Vietnam's three largest mobile carriers by subscription, bought the stake in Audio Visual Global JSC for nearly 8.9 trillion dong ($383.7 million) in late 2015.
The government suffered ""serious financial losses"" as a result of the transaction, the statement said.
The MobiFone case is the largest corruption investigation so far in Vietnam's anti-graft campaign that has already engulfed hundreds of government officials.
Audio Visual Global JSC Chairman Pham Nhat Vu was sentenced to three years in prison after being found guilty of paying the bribes to Son, Tuan, MobiFone executives and other government officials, the statement said.
The court also sentenced 11 other defendants to between two and 23 years in prison for their involvement in the case.
Reuters could not immediately reach their lawyers for comment.
A plan to sell a stake in MobiFone has long been touted as one of the most anticipated in Vietnam's drive to privatize state-owned companies, but it has never materialized.
The government said earlier it would sell a stake of up to 50% in MobiFone by the end of 2020.

President Rodrigo Duterte will impose visa requirements on U.S. nationals should any Philippine officials involved in the incarceration of Senator Leila de Lima be denied entry to the United States, as sought by U.S. senators Richard Durbin and Patrick Leahy. 
Duterte's move comes after the U.S. Congress approved a 2020 budget that contains a provision introduced by the senators against anyone involved in holding de Lima, who was charged with drug offenses in 2017 after she led an investigation into mass killings during Duterte's war on drugs.
""We will not sit idly if they continue to interfere with our processes as a sovereign state,"" Philippine presidential spokesman Salvador Panelo told a news conference.
The Philippines grants visa-free entry for up to 30 days to Americans, 792,000 of whom visited in the first nine months of 2019, nearly 13% of foreign arrivals. 
The U.S. embassy in Manila and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment, but Leahy’s spokesman David Carle called the charges against de Lima politically motivated, and added:
""This is about the right of Filipino citizens - and people everywhere - to freely express their opinions, including opinions that may be critical of government policies that involve the use of excessive force and the denial of due process.""
Panelo said travel restrictions over de Lima's detention were nonsense because she was not wrongfully imprisoned but detained pending trial for crimes. 
""The case of Senator de Lima is not one of persecution but of prosecution,"" he said.
Duterte makes no secret of his disdain for the United States and what he considers its hypocrisy and interference, though he admits that most Filipinos and his military have high regard for their country's former colonial ruler.
The United States is the Philippines biggest defense ally and millions of Filipinos have relatives who are U.S. citizens.
De Lima, a justice minister in a former administration, has won numerous awards from human rights groups, who consider her a prisoner of conscience.
She has called for an international investigation into Duterte's war on drugs, in which thousands of people have been killed. 

Police say those killed were drug dealers who resisted arrest, but activists say many of the killings were murders.

Police made the discovery in the wooden boat's stem around 9:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) on Saturday on Sado island, which is off the coast of Japan's northwestern prefecture of Niigata, Coast Guard official Kei Chinen said.
Police found the heads of two persons, as well as five bodies, Chinen said, adding that the cause of death is under investigation.
The official could not immediately confirm whether the heads belonged to the five bodies or were from two other people, saying that is being investigated.
The wooden boat had letters and numbers written in Korean on its outside, he added.
A police officer first spotted the wooden boat on Friday afternoon. Police waited until Saturday before entering it due to unstable weather.
The discovery on Saturday marks the second time since last month that a wooden boat has washed up on the shores of Sado island, Chinen said.
The grisly find adds to the troubles that Japan and South Korea have with their neighbor North Korea, as strained diplomatic ties over the North's nuclear arms program could make an investigation difficult to carry out.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has given the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over his country's nuclear arsenal and reducing tensions between the adversaries.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - The chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state has rebuffed accusations from rights groups of police abuses during protests against a new citizenship law, crediting his tough stand with restoring calm to the streets. 
The northern state has seen the most violent turmoil over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's citizenship law, which activists say is discriminatory towards the Muslim community, which makes up some 14% of India's population.
Out of at least 25 people who have been killed since the protests began this month, 19 were in Uttar Pradesh (UP), India's most populous state. 
The clashes in the state appear to have eased over the past week, however, although small-scale demonstrations are still taking place.
The state's chief minister, Yogi Adityanath, a hardline Hindu priest who belongs to Modi's Hindu-nationalist party, said his tough policies had ended the trouble.
""Every rioter is shocked. Every troublemaker is astonished. Looking at the strictness of the Yogi government, everyone is silent,"" one of Adityanath's verified official accounts on Twitter said late on Friday.
""Do whatever you want to, but the damages will be paid by those who cause damages,"" it added.
Last week, his government said it was demanding millions of rupees from more than 200 people, threatening to confiscate their property to pay for damage during the protests. 
Rights groups have decried what they say have been mass detentions and excessive force in the state, where officers have arrested more than 1,000 people. 
The citizenship legislation makes it easier for members of religious minorities from India's Muslim-majority neighbors - Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan - who settled in India before 2015 get citizenship but does not offer the same concession to Muslims. 
Critics say the law - and plans for a national citizenship register - discriminate against Muslims and are an attack on the secular constitution by Modi's government.
The government has said no citizen will be affected and there is no imminent plans for a register.
But a video circulating on social media is likely to compound the concerns of those worried about the plight of Muslims. It shows a senior UP police officer telling a demonstrator to ""go to Pakistan if you don't want to live here"".
The official, Akhilesh Narayan Singh, told Reuters that some protesters had been shouting pro-Pakistan slogans. 
""It is in this situation I told them to go to Pakistan,"" he said on Saturday.
Officials from the opposition Congress party were set to lead protests on Saturday under the slogan ""Save Constitution-Save India"".
""They can punish us, throw us in jail, siphon our property but they will not be able to stop us from continuing our protest,"" said Akhilesh Tomar, a student activist who has teamed up with the Congress to coordinate protests in four Muslim-dominated districts of UP.
Protests were also planned in the northeastern state of Assam, where migration has long been an emotive political issue, with protesters expecting increasing turnout in smaller towns. 
Meanwhile, Hindu activists associated with Modi's party were conducting workshops in slums in an effort to ease public discontent.

""We have to explain the facts to the common people who are being misled against the law by the opposition,"" said Ram Naresh Tanwar, a member of a group called the Hindu Jagran Samiti, or Hindu awareness committee, in New Delhi.

The figure was a sharp drop from the previous quarter and accompanied the progressive Democrats' slight slide in opinion polls in recent weeks in the Democratic contest to face Republican Donald Trump in the November 2020 election.
""We're only days away from the biggest fundraising deadline of the year, and we're at risk of missing our $20 million goal,"" Warren's campaign said on its website.

In the third quarter of 2019, Warren's campaign reported raising $24.6 million, slightly behind the $25.3 million raised by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the only other 2020 Democratic candidate to swear off big-money fundraisers.
Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has for months been polling in the top three of the crowded Democratic field, along with Sanders and former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.
Support for her White House bid has slid since she announced in November how she would finance her $20.5 trillion Medicare for All plan with new taxes on the wealthy and corporations but without raising middle-class taxes. The plan drew criticism from rivals who say it is unrealistic and from some voters concerned that it was too extreme.
Warren has been running on a populist message of fighting Washington corruption and Wall Street greed.

In the third quarter of 2019, Warren's campaign reported raising $24.6 million, slightly behind the $25.3 million raised by U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, the only other 2020 Democratic candidate to swear off big-money fundraisers.
Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, has for months been polling in the top three of the crowded Democratic field, along with Sanders and former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden.
Support for her White House bid has slid since she announced in November how she would finance her $20.5 trillion Medicare for All plan with new taxes on the wealthy and corporations but without raising middle-class taxes. The plan drew criticism from rivals who say it is unrealistic and from some voters concerned that it was too extreme.
Warren said in a Twitter post on Thursday that she would be calling grassroots donors to thank them and asked supporters to ""pitch in $3 tonight."" Her campaign on Friday offered to send donors a ""Tax the Ultra-Rich"" sticker.
Warren has been running on a populist message of fighting Washington corruption and Wall Street greed. 

In October, she vowed to abstain from high-dollar fundraisers if she becomes the Democratic nominee, extending to the general election her refusal to hold such events during the primary season.

1582,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 11:13PM ET</span>",China offers new pre-election inducement to Taiwan with revised law,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's largely rubber stamp parliament revised a law on Saturday to simplify investment procedures for Taiwan companies, in another attempt by Beijing to show goodwill to the Chinese-claimed island ahead of elections there on Jan. 11.
China, with its 1.3 billion people, is Taiwan's favorite investment destination with Taiwan companies investing more than $100 billion there since China began landmark economic reforms in the late 1970s, drawn by a common culture and low costs.
China has extended what it views as olive branches to Taiwan in the run-up to the election, including opening further sectors to Taiwanese investors, with the ultimate goal of enticing the island to accept Beijing's control.
Taiwan's government has warned against falling for China's inducements and has called on China instead to grant its own people democracy and freedom of speech. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control.
The revised law removes several layers of bureaucracy to simplify procedures for investment from Taiwan, with the aim of encouraging more of it.
Chinese commerce ministry official Jiang Chenghua told reporters the central government ""paid great attention"" to protecting and encouraging Taiwan investment and it had support from the highest levels, including President Xi Jinping.
""Although the revised clauses are not many, they are of great significance and are conducive to optimizing the investment environment for Taiwan compatriots in the mainland and to further expand economic and trade exchanges and cooperation between the two sides,"" Jiang added.
The revision is designed to dovetail with a new foreign investor law which comes into force on Jan. 1. Chinese Commerce Minister Zhong Shan said this week he wanted ""our Taiwan compatriots to share the benefit of this great change"".
Taiwan says China has been stepping up its efforts to sway electors and is planning an anti-infiltration law to counter Chinese influence efforts, which could pass next week.
Next month's elections pit President Tsai Ing-wen of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party against Han Kuo-yu of the main opposition party the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China.
China is Taiwan's top trading partner, with trade totaling $226 billion in 2018. Taiwan runs a large trade surplus with China.
Taiwan has been trying to wean itself off its reliance on China and to encourage Taiwan companies to come back home or to shift their investments to other parts of the world, notably Southeast Asia.
Taiwan's economy has benefited from its firms moving manufacturing back to the island to escape higher tariffs from the China-U.S. trade war, though the dispute has also caused some disruption for Taiwan's economy."

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian army stepped up patrols on the border with Venezuela on Friday, a day after picking up five deserting Venezuelan soldiers amid rising tensions between the two countries.
Brazil's defense ministry said in a statement that the unarmed soldiers were found on Thursday on an indigenous reservation on the Brazilian side of the border.
""They presented themselves as deserters and are being debriefed to see if they were involved in a recent attack on a base in Venezuela,"" a Brazilian military source with knowledge of the situation told Reuters.
The source said their motive for deserting had not been established yet but he suspected they had been involved in a Dec. 22 raid on an infantry garrison in southern Venezuela.
President Nicolas Maduro said on Monday that 11 people were arrested in connection with the raid on a remote military outpost in the southern state of Bolivar state on Sunday. He said some suspects fled across the border to Brazil with stolen weapons.
Venezuela accused Peru, Colombia and Brazil - adversaries of socialist Maduro which recognize opposition leader Juan Guaido as the rightful president - of complicity with the attack, in which one Venezuelan soldier was killed. All three countries' governments have denied involvement.
Hundreds of members of Venezuela's security forces have left their country in last few years, encouraged by Guaido to desert. Most have entered Colombia, but dozens have fled to Brazil where they have been received as refugees.
The Brazilian military, however, has tried to avoid conflict with its Venezuelan counterpart despite virulent criticism of Maduro's government by Brazil's far-right President Jair Bolsonaro."
1584,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 04:26PM ET</span>",Exclusive: FBI investigating British socialite and others who 'facilitated’ Epstein,"By Mark Hosenball
(Reuters) - The FBI is investigating British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell and several other people linked to U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, according to two law enforcement sources familiar with the investigation.
They said a principal focus of the FBI's investigation is Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein, and other ""people who facilitated"" Epstein's allegedly illegal behavior.
Maxwell has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. Her lawyers Jeffrey Pagliuca and Ty Gee did not respond to a request for comment.
The FBI also is following up on many leads received from women who contacted a hotline the agency set up at its New York field office in the wake of Epstein's arrest in July, the sources said. 
One of the sources said the probe remains at an early stage. 
The sources declined to give further details or identify the people they are looking at apart from Maxwell. However, they said the FBI has no current plans to interview Britain's Prince Andrew, a friend of Epstein's who stepped down from his public duties in November because of what he called his ""ill-judged"" association with the well-connected money manager.
A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment.
A representative for the British royal family said that whether the agency interviewed Andrew was ""a matter for the FBI."" 
Epstein’s suicide in August, at age 66, came a little over a month after he was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. Prosecutors said he recruited girls to give him massages, which became sexual in nature.
He had pleaded not guilty.
Following Epstein's arrest, the FBI urged anyone who had been victimized by Epstein or had additional information to call the agency's hotline. 
U.S. Attorney General William Barr vowed to carry on the case against anyone who was complicit with the financier.
""Any co-conspirators should not rest easy,"" he said in August. 
The sources said they had received numerous tips from the hotline, which they are looking into.
Maxwell, the daughter of late British media magnate Robert Maxwell, is an ex-girlfriend of Epstein who remained a member of his inner circle. She has largely disappeared from public view since 2016. 
Virginia Giuffre, one of Epstein's alleged victims, has said in a civil lawsuit that Maxwell recruited her into Epstein's circle, where she claims Epstein forced her to have sex with him and friends including Andrew. 
Maxwell has called Giuffre's allegations lies. Giuffre in response filed a defamation suit against Maxwell in 2015. 
Giuffre repeated the claims about the prince in a BBC interview that aired this month.
Andrew, 59, also categorically denies the accusations and has said he has no recollection of meeting Giuffre, who was previously named Virginia Roberts.

The two law enforcement sources said the FBI's principal focus is on people who facilitated Epstein and that Andrew does not fit into that category. They did not rule out the possibility that the FBI would seek to interview Andrew at a later date.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera, whose government has been rocked by riots over inequality, ignited a fresh wave of anger after claiming that ""many"" videos on social media of police abuse of demonstrators were ""fake news,"" and unrest was being fomented by foreign governments.
Pinera told CNN Chile in an interview that there had been a ""gigantic"" disinformation campaign with videos circulating on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Instagram and Twitter that had been ""filmed outside of Chile or misrepresented.""
""There has doubtless been some participation by foreign governments and institutions,"" he said.
Pinera's comments were first screened by CNN on Dec. 15, but only gained widespread renown on Thursday when they became the subject of intense debate.
Pinera has been blamed by the political opposition, human rights organizations and activist groups for failing to act more quickly on widespread claims of rights abuses by security forces policing the protests since they began over inequality on Oct. 18. With more than 26 people killed during the unrest and thousands more injured and arrested, Pinera's approval ratings have tumbled to as low as 10%.
The claims of foreign interference are not new: the U.S. State Department said it had seen indications of Russian “influence” on the unrest, “skewing it through the use and abuse of social media, trolling.”
However, Pinera´s claims were met with fury from both his political opponents and members of his own governing coalition, Chile Vamos.
Manuel Jose Ossandon, a senator for center-right party National Renewal, told La Tercera newspaper: ""Enough. Chile is living a decisive moment. These declarations don´t help, they divide.""
Sergio Micco, the head of Chile´s Human Rights Institute which has reviewed online content as part of an investigation into police handling of the protests, told a local radio station that while the group had seen misleading material, the ""immense majority"" was authentic.
And Jorge Abbott, Chile´s attorney general, said: ""At the moment, the images we have analyzed don´t fall in that category (of coming from abroad).""
On Thursday night, the president tweeted that he had not expressed himself ""clearly enough"" and said human rights abuses ""should always be condemned.""
The saga adds to an already uncomfortable week for the president. Last week, the government gave prosecutors a report it said had been sent to its intelligence agency by an undisclosed source that analyzed 5 million social media accounts tweeting at the peak of the unrest.
The report, the government confirmed, highlighted that one in five tweets about the unrest was generated outside of Chile, and among the most active accounts were fans of Korea's K-pop culture.
On Friday, Santiago residents were called to a ""K-Pop rally"" in the city´s central Plaza Italia with the ambitious promise of a closing concert by South Korean megaband BTS."

Suspected drug cartel hitmen shot dead the nine women and children from families of Mormon origin in Sonora state on Nov. 4, sparking outrage in Mexico and the United States.
Several Mexican media outlets reported that law enforcement agents arrested Fidel Alejandro Villegas, police chief of the municipality of Janos, which lies in the neighboring state of Chihuahua, on suspicion of involvement in the crime. The reports said he is suspected of having ties to organized crime, but details of his alleged role were not clear.
A federal official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the arrest of Villegas, which follows the detention of other suspects earlier in the investigation.
Mexican officials believe the women and children were killed after becoming caught up in a dispute between local drug cartels battling for control of the area.
Under pressure from the Trump administration, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador sought U.S. cooperation in the case, inviting the FBI to help in the investigation."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iran could carry out ""provocative actions"" in the Strait of Hormuz and elsewhere in that region in the future despite a period of relative calm, acting U.S. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said on Friday.
Tensions in the Gulf have mounted since attacks on oil tankers this summer, including off the coast of the United Arab Emirates, and a major strike on oil facilities in Saudi Arabia. Washington has blamed Iran, which has denied being behind the attacks.
""I think they're going to continue to perform provocative actions over there... and I think they'll look at every opportunity they can to do that,"" Modly told Reuters, without giving a timeline or details.
""There's nothing that suggests to me, short of a regime change there, that you have a different tone set from the leadership, that would suggest to me that they're going to stop doing what they've been doing,"" he added.
Since May, the Pentagon has sent 14,000 additional troops to the region to deter Iran, including an aircraft carrier.
Modly suggested that U.S. reactions to Iranian actions could take away from the Pentagon's focus toward priorities like countering China.
""As they start creating mischief over there... our reaction is we send an aircraft carrier over there for 10 months,"" he said.
""What does that do to our carrier readiness? It degrades readiness the longer it's over there.""
Modly's warning on future actions coincides with China, Iran and Russia beginning joint naval drills in the Indian Ocean and Gulf of Oman.
Waters around Iran have become a locus of international tension, with the United States exerting pressure for Iranian crude oil sales and other trade ties to be cut off, mainly through extensive sanctions.
The Gulf of Oman is a particularly sensitive waterway as it connects to the Strait of Hormuz - through which about a fifth of the world’s oil passes - which in turn connects to the Gulf.
Asked if he expected Iran to lash out in the region as a result of internal protests, Modly said he had not seen intelligence on that.
Demonstrations against a hike in fuel prices turned political last month in Iran, sparking the bloodiest crackdown in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic.
About 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest, three Iranian interior ministry officials told Reuters."

In the Dec. 22 attack, they told Reuters, militants posing as soldiers stopped a convoy of commercial vehicles traveling toward Maiduguri in northeastern Borno state and asked passengers in English to produce identification cards. 
The militants separated those who they determined worked for international aid groups, were Christian or worked with the police or the Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF), a coalition of civilian vigilante groups formed to fight Boko Haram jihadists. 
It opened fire on people associated with these three groups, killing 10, including four who witnesses said had identification cards associating them with humanitarian groups. 
""They asked those aid workers, and others, to move toward the north (side of the road) and started shooting at them sporadically, killing them,"" local witness Babagana Kachallah told Reuters. 
Kachallah said the militants took two women captive who it believed worked for international aid groups.
Two other witnesses, a family member of one of those shot dead and two sources who work with aid groups in Nigeria, confirmed the attack. 
It was not immediately clear whether the militants were associated with Boko Haram or another militant faction, Islamic State in West Africa Province (ISWAP). 
Nigeria announced in September that it would require anyone moving through the northeastern states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe to carry identification cards to help authorities root out members of Boko Haram and Islamic State. 
ISWAP said on Friday it had executed 11 Christian captives it had previously kidnapped in Borno state.

It was not immediately clear if there were any casualties. Security sources said security forces found a launchpad for Katyusha rockets inside an abandoned vehicle near the base.
No group claimed responsibility for the attack. 
Islamic State militants operate in the area and have turned to insurgency-style tactics aimed at bringing down the government in Baghdad ever since it retook all territory and declared victory against them in December 2017.
However, a senior U.S. military official said this month that attacks by Iranian-backed groups on bases hosting U.S. forces in Iraq were gathering pace and becoming more sophisticated, pushing all sides closer to an uncontrollable escalation.
His warning came two days after four Katyusha rockets struck a base near Baghdad international airport, wounding five members of Iraq's elite Counter-Terrorism Service, the latest in a spate of rocket strikes on bases hosting members of the U.S.-led coalition whose objective is to defeat Islamic State insurgents.
The K1 base, which lies 15 km (9 miles) northwest of Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, houses U.S. military forces alongside Iraqi forces from the Federal Police and Counter-Terrorism Service, security sources said.

A public prosecutor has said Guillaume Soro, a former rebel leader in Ivory Coast, could face life in prison for allegedly plotting a coup. Soro is believed to be in Europe although his exact whereabouts are unclear, but more than 15 people close to him have been arrested as part of an investigation.
""These actions are attempts to silence all criticism by the opposition of the government when we should be discussing how the 2020 election is being organized,"" politician Gnonzie Ouattara from the Coalition for Reconciliation, Democracy and Peace (CRDP), an alliance of 21 opposition parties including Soro's, told a news conference.
""Guillaume Soro is not guilty of anything,"" he said.
Soro has denounced the investigation as politically motivated.
The case has increased tensions ahead of the October 2020 vote, which is regarded as a test of Ivory Coast's stability after two civil wars since the turn of the century.
President Alassane Ouattara won re-election in 2015 but has been unclear about whether he will seek a third term, deepening uncertainty about the vote in Francophone West Africa's largest economy, also the world's biggest cocoa producer.

Soro retains the loyalty of many ex-rebel commanders who hold senior positions in the army. He served for several years as speaker of the National Assembly but has since fallen out with Ouattara.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Friday confirmed a Spanish priest as the new archbishop of Chile's capital Santiago, as the Vatican seeks to turn the page on a sexual abuse scandal that has shaken its standing and eroded support in the conservative Latin nation.
Celestino Aos, 74, was appointed apostolic administrator of Santiago in March this year after the Pope accepted the resignation of Cardinal Ricardo Ezzati, who faces multiple charges that he helped cover up sexual abuse of children.
Speaking shortly after his confirmation as the highest-ranking member of the Catholic Church in Chile, Aos promised to ""seek justice, the truth, help the whistleblowers, people who suffer"" but also said justice should not be ""driven by passion, the emotion of the moment.""
Aos was educated and trained in his native Spain but has spent 36 years working in Chile. He told an interviewer this year that the Pope´s declaration last year about a ""culture of cover-up"" of abuse in Chile had been ""painful and unfair"".
""There are some who have acted like this, and that is repugnant, but not everyone has,"" he told Catholic publication Crux in May. ""The Pope started a process... He told us that changing a person is not the solution. It needs short, mid- and long-term planning.""
To date, Chilean prosecutors have 159 open investigations into church abuse on their books, involving 271 victims. Prosecutors said they will submit a fresh request for access to Vatican abuse investigator Archbishop Charles Scicluna´s report into the church’s handling of abuse cases in Chile.
The new request follows a decision earlier this month in which Pope Francis abolished the rule https://www.reuters.com/article/us-pope-abuse-secrecy/pope-abolishes-pontifical-secrecy-for-sex-abuse-investigations-idUSKBN1YL177 of “pontifical secrecy” that covered internal Church proceedings, evidence and tribunal decisions including into cases of sexual abuse of minors.
Two documents issued by the pope back practices that have been in place in some countries, particularly the United States, such as reporting suspicion of sex abuse to civil authorities where required by law.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. federal appeals court on Friday ordered the resentencing of a Staten Island, New York man for attempting to provide material support to Islamic State and kill an FBI agent, saying his 17-year prison term was ""shockingly low.""
The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan said Fareed Mumuni's trial judge abused her discretion in imposing a term that was 80% below the 85 years recommended by federal guidelines, and even below the 18-year term for co-defendant Munther Omar Saleh, who was not accused of attempted murder.
In a 2-1 decision, the court said U.S. District Judge Margo Brodie improperly second-guessed whether Mumuni, 25, intended to kill FBI Special Agent Kevin Coughlin in June 2015 by stabbing him repeatedly with an 8-inch kitchen knife in Mumuni's home.
It also said Brodie gave too much weight to mitigating factors such as Mumuni's age, his lack of a prior criminal record and support from family and friends.
Such errors ""caused the district court to render a sentence that is shockingly low and unsupportable as a matter of law,"" Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes wrote for the majority.
Mumuni's lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue in Brooklyn, whose office appealed the sentence, declined to comment.
Coughlin survived the attack.
Federal sentencing guidelines are advisory, but judges must sufficiently justify major departures resulting in sentences that might appear unusually lenient or harsh.
Downward departures are more common, though an 80% reduction is larger than average, according to federal statistics.
Mumuni had pleaded guilty in Feb. 2017 to an indictment charging him with trying to aid Islamic state, attempted murder of federal officers, and assaulting federal officers.
Prosecutors said Mumuni pledged allegiance to Islamic State and tried to raise money to travel to areas it controlled, and had received permission from an ""attack facilitator"" for the group to use a pressure-cooker bomb against law enforcement officers.
Circuit Judge Peter Hall, who dissented, said he feared the majority ""would prefer to substitute its sentencing preference for that of the district court,"" but agreed that the case should be returned to Brodie so she could better explain her reasoning.

BEIRUT (Reuters) - The United Nations said 235,000 civilians had fled their homes in rebel-held northwestern Syria during a Russian-backed campaign of air strikes and shelling this month.
The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) said the exodus had taken place between Dec. 12 and 25.
Most people had fled the city of Maarat al-Numan, towns and villages in southern Idlib province, Idlib city, and camps along the Syrian-Turkish border, OCHA said.
""With the latest escalation of violence in northwest Syria, civilians in Idlib governorate are again suffering from the devastating consequences of hostilities,"" it said.
OCHA said Maarat al-Numan and the surrounding countryside ""are reportedly almost empty"".
Syrian forces are advancing on Maarat al-Numan.
Thousands of families were also reported to be too frightened to move, fearing air strikes and shelling.
Abu al-Majd Nasser, who fled to the border with his family from the town of Telmanas, said Russian President Vladimir Putin ""wants to kill every Syrian who opposes the regime"".
Moscow and Damascus deny claims of indiscriminate bombing of civilians, saying say they are fighting jihadist militants.
Rescue services and witnesses say hostilities have left many towns in ruins and knocked out dozens of medical centers.
U.S. President Donald Trump has spoken out against the ""carnage"" involving thousands of civilians in Syria.
""Russia, Syria, and Iran are killing, or on their way to killing, thousands of innocent civilians in Idlib province. Don't do it! Turkey is working hard to stop this carnage,"" Trump said on Twitter on Thursday.
The Syrian army said this week it had seized more than 300 km of territory in the assault to end ""terrorist"" control of Idlib, killing hundreds of ""terrorists"".
Taking Maarat al-Numan would take the Syrian army into densely populated rebel-held parts of Idlib province, where millions of people who fled fighting elsewhere in Syria have taken refuge.
The Russian and Syrian advance toward Idlib is also piling pressure on Turkey, which has a presence in the area and is seen by many civilians as a protector against Russian strikes.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Hundreds of people in Istanbul have signed petitions in the past two days opposing a massive canal project championed by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, which they say will wreak environmental havoc in the city. 
The proposed 45-km (28-mile) Kanal Istanbul on the western fringes of Turkey's largest city would connect the Black Sea to the north and the Marmara Sea to the south. 
Erdogan says it will ease traffic and prevent accidents on the natural Bosphorus strait, one of the world's busiest waterways, which cuts through the city.
Opposition lawmakers and ecologists say an environmental impact report on the canal, a key step for such massive infrastructure projects, does not adequately address all the problems that the canal could cause.
They have called on Turks to file petitions objecting to the report by Jan. 2. Queues of those waiting to submit petitions have spilled out of some provincial urbanization offices in Istanbul since Thursday.
Ahmet Kara, standing outside an office in the Besiktas neighborhood, said he was against the canal project because of the effects he fears it will have on Istanbul's water supply.
""Lack of water is the number one problem for human life,"" said the 32-year old computer technician.
Gulcan Erdogan Boyraz, a 56-year old former college instructor, said the project was aimed at profiteering and would destroy the city's future.

Erdogan has repeatedly said the construction would go ahead despite any opposition.
Cevahir Akcelik, of the Union of Chambers of Turkish Engineers and Architects, which has opposed the project, told Reuters the environmental impact report would likely be approved soon and work would be conducted to hold the tender.
""But during this objection process, we have seen that there is a large public opposition,"" he said.

The militant group posted the footage on its online Telegram news channel on Thursday, the day after Christmas, with Arabic captions but no audio.
The video showed men in beige uniforms and black masks lining up behind blindfolded captives, then shooting one and beheading the rest.
A previous video seen by Reuters said the captives had been taken from Maiduguri and Damaturu in Nigeria's northeast, where militants have been fighting for years to set up a separate Islamist state.
In that earlier video, the captives pleaded for the Christian Association of Nigeria and President Muhammadu Buhari to intervene to save them.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan ""urgently"" needs to pass a planned anti-infiltration law to face threats from China to penetrate the island, President Tsai Ing-wen said on Friday, denouncing China's opposition to it as illogical and hypocritical.
The legislation is part of a years-long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process, through illicit funding of politicians and the media and other underhand methods.
China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary. Taiwan says it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) has begun a renewed push for the legislation, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11. The bill is due for debate in parliament again on Tuesday, when it may pass into law.
In a televised policy address - on which formal debate is set for Sunday - Tsai said the bill was about a threat from China that is not as easy to see as the likes of the Chinese aircraft carrier which sailed through the Taiwan Strait on Thursday.
""I think that certainly there is an urgency in Taiwan society for the anti-infiltration law,"" Tsai said. ""I hope that we can as soon as possible examine it.""
Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China, has condemned the proposed legislation as a ""political tool"" of Tsai and her DPP to gain votes while trying to paint them as Chinese Communist Party agents.
They also say the bill will only criminalize normal exchanges with China, something Tsai and the DPP have denied.
China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated its opposition to the bill this week too, saying the DPP was trying to ""blatantly reverse over"" democracy and increase enmity.
Tsai said it was totally hypocritical of an autocratic China that lacks democracy, human rights or freedom of speech to use the language of democracy to criticize the bill.
""China has no democracy and yet it is criticizing Taiwan for reversing over democracy,"" she said. ""China has no democratic elections and interferes in Taiwan's democratic elections the whole day long. This is an absurd and laughable position.""
China has denied seeking to interfere in Taiwan's elections.
Tsai's main opponent, the Kuomintang's Han Kuo-yu, did not directly mention the bill, but again slammed senior DPP politicians for previous visits they have made to China. Han went to China earlier this year and met senior officials.
""Your exchanges are just exchanges, but our contacts are selling out Taiwan?"" Han said, holding up a picture of DPP officials meeting with Chinese counterparts."
1600,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 08:34AM ET</span>",Timeline: Vladimir Putin - 20 tumultuous years as Russian president or PM,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Vladimir Putin was named acting president on Dec. 31, 1999, by then-president Boris Yeltsin. He has been in office as president or prime minister ever since, a period spanning two decades.
Here are some highlights of Putin's 20 years in power:
Aug. 9, 1999 - During an economic crisis, President Yeltsin names little-known security chief Vladimir Putin as his fifth acting prime minister in less than a year, and says he wants Putin to succeed him as president. In the following weeks, bombings of apartment blocks across Russia kill more than 300 people, in attacks Putin blames on Chechen militants. His popularity is boosted by his tough response, which includes the aerial bombing of parts of Chechnya and an assault to recapture the breakaway southern province. Some Kremlin critics question if Chechen militants were really behind the apartment bombings. 
Dec. 31, 1999 - An ailing Yeltsin resigns and names Putin acting president.
March 26, 2000 - Putin wins his first presidential election. 
Aug. 12, 2000 - The Kursk nuclear-powered submarine sinks to the bottom of the Barents Sea, killing all 118 crew after an explosion onboard. Putin’s image suffers a jolt after he comments on the crisis only after four days.
2002 - Chechen militants take more than 800 people hostage at a Moscow theater. Special forces end the siege, but use a poison gas in the process which kills many of the hostages. 
2003 - Oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky is arrested and charged with fraud. He is later found guilty and jailed in a case his supporters say was punishment for his meddling in politics. He is only released in 2013 after Putin pardons him. 
March 2004 - Putin wins second term as president with more than 70 percent of the vote after oil prices fuel a consumer boom and raise living standards, a trend that continues for another four years. 
September 2004 - Islamist fighters seize more than 1,000 people in a school in Beslan, southern Russia, triggering a three-day siege that ends in gunfire. A total of 334 hostages are killed, more than half of them children. Some parents say the authorities botched the handling of the siege and blame Putin. 
December 2004 - Putin scraps direct elections for regional governors, effectively making them Kremlin appointees. Putin says the move is needed to keep Russia united. 
2005 - Putin describes the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union as the ""greatest geopolitical catastrophe"" of the 20th century.
2006 - Investigative journalist Anna Politkovskaya, a critic of rights abuses in Chechnya, is murdered in Moscow on Putin's birthday. Kremlin critic Alexander Litvinenko dies in London that same year after being poisoned with a radioactive substance. A British inquiry years later concludes he was killed by Russian agents. 
2007 - Putin gives a speech in Munich in which he lashes out at the United States, accusing Washington of the ""almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations"".
May 2008 - Constitutional limits on him serving more than two consecutive presidential terms see Putin become prime minister after his ally, Dmitry Medvedev, becomes president.
August 2008 - Russia fights and wins a short war with Georgia. Tbilisi loses control over two breakaway regions that are garrisoned with Russian troops. 
2012 - Putin returns to the presidency, winning re-election with over 60% of the vote after a decision to extend presidential terms to six from four years. Large anti-Putin protests take place before and after the vote, with critics alleging voter fraud. 
Feb. 7-23, 2014 - Russia hosts the winter Olympic games in the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
Feb. 27, 2014 - Russian forces start annexing Ukraine's Crimea region after Ukrainian protesters oust their country's Russia-friendly president Viktor Yanukovich. Russia incorporates Crimea the following month after a referendum condemned by the West. The United States and EU go on to impose sanctions on Moscow. 
April 2014 - A pro-Russian separatist revolt breaks out in eastern Ukraine which results in a conflict, still ongoing, which hands the rebels control of a vast swath of territory and leaves more than 13,000 people dead. Western nations accuse Russia of backing the revolt; Moscow denies direct involvement. 
Sept. 30, 2015 - Russia launches air strikes in Syria in its biggest Middle East intervention in decades, turning the tide of the conflict in President Bashar al-Assad's favor.
November 2016 - Donald Trump is elected president of the United States after promising to improve battered ties with Moscow. However, U.S. authorities determine Russia tried to interfere in the election in Trump's favor, casting a pall over U.S-Russia ties despite Moscow's denials. 
March 4, 2018 - A former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter are poisoned in England with a nerve agent. They survive but a woman who lives nearby dies after her partner brings home the poison found in a discarded perfume bottle. Britain accuses Russia, which denies involvement. 
March 19, 2018 - Putin wins a landslide re-election victory and a mandate to stay in office until 2024. 
June/July 2018 - Russia hosts the men's soccer FIFA World Cup. 
July 2019 - Protests break out in Moscow over a municipal election which the anti-Kremlin opposition says is unfair. Those protests grow into Moscow's biggest sustained protest movement in years before fizzling out.

December 2019 - Putin boasts of his country's lead in hypersonic weapons and says other countries are trying to catch up.

1601,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 08:13AM ET</span>","U.N. experts urge Pakistan to clear scholar of blasphemy, lift death sentence","GENEVA (Reuters) - United Nations human rights experts called on Pakistan's high court on Friday to clear liberal academic Junaid Hafeez of blasphemy charges and overturn his death sentence.
In a joint statement, they described Hafeez's condemnation by a lower court last week as a ""travesty of justice"" and said senior judges should acquit the former university lecturer on appeal.
""We urge Pakistan’s superior courts to promptly hear his appeal, overturn the death sentence and acquit him,” said the independent experts who include U.N. investigators on freedom of religion, unlawful killings and arbitrary detention.
In 2013 students at the university where Hafeez taught accused him of making blasphemous Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) posts. Insulting Islam’s Prophet Mohammad carries a mandatory death penalty in Pakistan, which is about 95% Muslim.
His lawyers say he was framed by students from a militant Islamist party because of his liberal and secular views. This month a U.S. religious freedom commission placed Hafeez on its list of global victims.
Hafeez's family and lawyers released a statement saying the trial had been marked by a ""wave of fear"" and intimidation after Hafeez’s initial defense lawyer, Rashid Rehman, was shot and killed in 2014 after agreeing to take on the case. No one has been charged with that murder.
The family and lawyers said they would file an appeal against the verdict in the high court.
International law permits the death penalty only in exceptional circumstances, and requires incontrovertible evidence of intentional murder, the U.N. experts said.
“The death sentence imposed on Mr. Hafeez has no basis in either law or evidence, and therefore contravenes international law. Carrying out the sentence would amount to an arbitrary killing,” they said.
  “We are seriously concerned that blasphemy charges are still being brought against people legitimately exercising their rights to freedom of thought, conscience, religion and expression,” they added."

Petty Officer Beiret Bureerak had been receiving treatment, but his condition worsened, the navy said in a statement.
Another rescuer, former navy diver Sergeant Saman Kuman, died during the rescue operation.
Wild Boars Academy’s coach Ekapol Chanthawong and 12 boys had gone to explore the Tham Luang caves in Chiang Rai province on June 23, 2018, when a rainy-season downpour flooded the cave system and trapped them underground.

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan has arrested five suspected al Qaeda militants planning an attack on security personnel, authorities in the eastern state of Punjab said on Friday.
The raid in Gujranwala city hit an important media cell and financing network for the jihadists, Punjab's counter-terrorism department said. Laptops with encrypted data, cell phones, a printing press, explosives, five Kalashnikov rifles, ammunition and cash were found.
For years militants have held sway in remote northwestern regions on the Afghan border but some have also established networks in Punjab, Pakistan's richest and most populous province.
""They were planning attack on law enforcement officials in Gujranwala,"" the police statement added, without giving more details on the plot.
The Gujranwala group recently relocated from Karachi and was running al Qaeda's media operations for the Indian subcontinent and sending funds to central leadership in Afghanistan, it added.
The Pakistan government says the number of militants in the country has decreased due to an army crackdown.
Al Qaeda founder Osama Bin Laden was killed in a U.S. operation in 2011 in Pakistan."

MEERUT/LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - India deployed thousands of police and shut down mobile internet services across many cities on Friday to control protests against a new citizenship law, with flashpoint Friday prayers passing largely peacefully.
Security was particularly tight in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where 19 people have been killed since the protests began on Dec. 12, out of at least 25 deaths nationwide.
Authorities had feared that large crowds could gather after the weekly Muslim congregational prayers. Demonstrations were held after Friday prayers in the cities of Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Mumbai, but there were no major reports of violence as of 1200 GMT.
In Meerut, where five people were killed after violence last Friday, there were no gatherings.
Nearly 3,000 police were deployed, four times more than last week, the city's police chief told Reuters. 
The legislation makes it easier for minorities from India's Muslim majority neighbors - Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan - who settled before 2015 to get citizenship but does not make the same concessions for Muslims. Critics say the law - and plans for a national citizenship register - discriminate against Muslims and are an attack on the country's secular constitution by the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The government has said no citizen will be affected and that there are no imminent plans for a register.
On Friday, mobile internet services were ordered shut in many parts of Utter Pradesh, including in the provincial capital Luck now, the state government said.
In the national capital New Delhi, police imposed an emergency law in some parts of the city, forbidding large gatherings, news channels reported. Such prohibitions have been in place in Uttar Pradesh for more than a week.
Thousands of demonstrators, waving Indian flags and holding placards rejecting the new law, protested peacefully in Bengaluru city amid a heavy police presence.
""I am here because the NRC is wrong,"" said Iqbal Ahmed, 42, a Muslim carpet seller and one of the protesters, referring to the register of citizens.
""This is our land and I am from here... Are we not Indian?""
Muslims, India's second biggest community by religion, account for about 14% of its 1.3 billion people.

Some parts of the country also saw rallies in favor of the new citizenship law but were outnumbered by demonstrations and protests against the legislation.

Ibro Cufurovic, from the northwestern town of Velika Kladusa, has been in custody since his extradition from Syria in April. He had previously been detained for about two years by a Kurdish militia in Syria.
The court cited mitigating circumstances while explaining its ruling on Cufurovic, who had used the name Abu Kasim Albosni during his five years in Syria, where he took part in militant activities alongside other Bosnians.
""The defendant admitted he was guilty,"" said Hasija Masovic, the court council's chairwoman. ""At the time when he made the decision to leave for Syria, the defendant was only 19"".
Masovic said Cufurovic had repeatedly expressed regret for his actions and had attempted to return to Bosnia, according to the defense and witnesses.
Hundreds of Bosnian citizens are believed to have left to fight for IS in Syria and Iraq. Many foreign nationals are now in detention camps waiting to be handed over to their countries of origin.
Last week, a group of 25 former IS fighters, women and children, some of them orphaned, returned to Bosnia.
Seven men were detained and questioned, while six women and 12 children, among them Cufurovic's wife and children, were taken to a reception center for further examination and medical assistance.
Cufurovic had told the court that he fought in Syria in 2014 and 2015, but that he was detained in 2016 while trying to escape to Turkey with his family, and imprisoned.
Bosnia's state court has tried and convicted 46 people who returned from Syria or Iraq over the past few years."

The six are accused of conspiring to receive 100 million Namibian dollars ($6.8 million) in kickbacks from subsidiaries of Iceland's biggest fishing company Samherji to secure quotas.
They sought to have the charges of fraud, laundering and tax evasion dismissed because of faulty process in their arrests, which they argued were unlawful and politically motivated.
“The Namibian constitution should not become subservient to the public as well as political pressures,” their lawyer Tembeka Ngcukaitobi had argued at the Windhoek High Court.
However, acting judge Kobus Miller ruled on Friday that the application did not meet requirements to be heard as an urgent matter due to delays in the request.
Former justice minister Sakeus Shanghala and fisheries minister Bernardt Esau, along with two former employees of South Africa's financial services firm Investec, have been in custody for a month awaiting trial.
The next hearing is scheduled for Feb. 20.
The scheme, exposed by Wikileaks, began in 2014 and included relatives of the ministers and officials, according to documents it posted online. It used a bilateral deal between Angola and Namibia to win Samherji quotas of tens of thousands of tonnes a year of horse mackerel, according to the documents.

ALMATY (Reuters) - A passenger plane carrying nearly 100 people crashed soon after take-off near the city of Almaty in Kazakhstan on Friday, slamming into a house in an accident that killed 12 people and injured dozens.
The Fokker 100 aircraft, operated by Bek Air, got into trouble shortly after departing from Almaty, the Central Asian country's commercial center, on a pre-dawn flight to the capital Nur-Sultan.
It lost altitude during take-off and broke through a concrete fence before hitting the two-storey building, Kazakhstan's Civil Aviation Committee said. It was not immediately clear what caused the crash.
""The plane tilted to the left, then to the right, then it started shaking while still trying to gain altitude,"" businessman Aslan Nazaraliyev, who survived the crash, told Reuters.
Investigators found scratch marks on the runway.
""Before crashing, the aircraft touched the runway with its tail twice, the gear was retracted,"" Deputy Prime Minister Roman Sklyar told reporters.
""A commission... will establish whether this was pilot error or technical issues. The runway was in an ideal condition.""
A Reuters reporter saw the battered remains of the front of the plane and other separate parts of the fuselage scattered around what was left of the house.
A survivor told news website Tengrinews she heard a ""terrifying sound"" before the plane started losing altitude.
""The plane was flying at a tilt. Everything was like in a movie: screaming, shouting, people crying,"" she said.
Almaty healthcare authorities initially put the death toll from the crash at 15 or more but later revised the figure down to 12. They said 49 people were in hospitals, some of them in a serious condition.
The plane had been carrying 93 passengers and five crew, and the interior ministry said the captain was among those killed.
The ministry said it was investigating a possible breach of flight operation and safety rules, a standard legal procedure. There was thick fog in the area at the time of the crash.
Kazakhstan's aviation committee said it was suspending all flights by carrier Bek Air and those of Fokker 100 aircraft pending the results of the investigation.
""MOANS AND SCREAMS""
Nazaraliyev said he had been seated next to an emergency exit in row 15 and all the rows in front of him were torn off when the plane broke in half on impact.
After the shaking started and before the crash ""I had enough time to put away my phone and fasten my seatbelt"", he said.
""We got out through the emergency exit ... I and other men started getting people out and away from the plane. Some were trapped by concrete debris from the building. There were moans and screams and it was dark.""
Authorities cordoned off the crash site in the village of Almerek, just beyond the end of the runway.
The airport remained operational with other planes taking off after the crash.
In the airport at Nur-Sultan, relatives of the passengers - some of whom were going to join their families for the holidays - were being briefed on their fate and offered flights to Almaty.
""Those responsible will face tough punishment in accordance with the law,"" Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev tweeted, expressing condolences to the victims and their families.
Tokayev declared Dec. 28 a national day of mourning and appointed Prime Minister Askar Mamin to head a commission to investigate the crash.

The plane involved in the crash was built in 1996, the government said, and its most recent flight certificate was issued in May 2019.

In January, police formed a fact-finding team to investigate the attack, but came up empty-handed. President Joko Widodo ordered that a new police chief, appointed in November, solve the case by the end of the year.

Under the law, religious communities in the tiny Adriatic state would need to prove property ownership from before 1918, when predominantly Orthodox Christian Montenegro joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the predecessor of the now-defunct Yugoslavia.
The pro-Serb Democratic Front (DF) and other critics of the legislation say it is an attempt to promote the small Montenegrin Orthodox Church, which is not recognized by other major churches, at the expense of the Serbian Orthodox Church, the dominant church in the country of 620,000 people.
They also accuse Montenegro's pro-Western president, Milo Djukanovic, and his ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of corruption, ties to organized crime and seeking to push the country further from Serbia, its much bigger neighbor.
The DF deputies brawled with their opponents just before the vote, which took place in the early hours of Friday after a lengthy late-night debate.
Police initially detained all 18 DF deputies but later released 15. Among the three who remained in detention pending charges was DF leader Andrija Mandic, the pro-government Pobjeda daily said.
""We have said we are ready to die for our church and we are demonstrating that,"" Mandic told reporters after the fracas.
Hundreds of opposition supporters backed by clergy had taken to the streets of the capital Podgorica on Thursday to rally against the law. Roads in the north of the country were also blocked for hours.
The Serbian Orthodox Church has around 12 million followers, mainly in Serbia, Bosnia and Montenegro. It owns 66 monasteries in Montenegro, most of them dating back to the Middle Ages, as well as dozens of churches and other real estate.
The Serbian Orthodox Church said its head, Patriarch Irinej, was ""deeply distressed"" by the developments in Montenegro.
""His holiness ... prays ... for peace and unity between Montenegrin state bodies and church dignitaries, for the benefit of all in Montenegro, regardless of religion and nationality,"" it said in a statement.
The Church suspects the Montenegrin state of planning to seize its assets, something the government denies. Djukanovic has accused the Church of promoting pro-Serbian policies with the aim of undermining Montenegrin statehood.
Montenegro peacefully split from its former federal partner in 2006. It is now a member of NATO and, like Serbia, a candidate for European Union membership."
1611,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 06:16AM ET</span>","South Korea’s top court dismisses ""comfort women"" petition against deal with Japan","By Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's Constitutional Court dismissed on Friday an appeal by a group of women forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels to strike down an agreement signed by the two countries to settle claims over the abuse.
The ruling is expected to have little impact on the 2015 agreement as it has been effectively abandoned by South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has called it seriously flawed and inadequate to resolve the issue that has been for many years a source of rancor between the neighbors.
Constitutional Court President Yoo Nam-seok said the agreement was a political one that tried to resolve the comfort women issue and, unlike a treaty between two countries, did not create legal responsibilities on the part of the governments.
Comfort women is a euphemism for the thousands of girls and women, most of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan's brothels before and during World War Two, when Japan occupied Korea.
""It cannot be said that the rights of the victims of the Japanese military were infringed upon by this agreement,"" Yoo said in the court's ruling.
Bitterness over Japan's occupation of the Korean peninsula is a major influence on their relations and has been at the heart of rancor this year that has seen their ties plunge to their worst in decades.
The 2015 agreement, reached by Moon's conservative predecessor, Park Geun-hye, and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, was welcomed by the United States at the time as an important step toward reconciliation.
But surviving comfort women saw it as unjust and the constitutional petition was brought by 29 of them, and 12 of their families.
They argued that it violated their rights as they were not consulted when the governments agreed to close the matter as ""irreversibly resolved"" with an apology by Japan and a 1 billion yen ($9 million) fund to compensate the women.
""This could have been an opportunity to address their pain,"" said Rhee Dong-joon, a lawyer representing the women.
""It is disappointing that the Constitutional Court failed to bring closure to their hurting.”
The ruling comes after Moon and Abe held talks for the first time in 15 months on Tuesday and stressed the need to improve ties, after the worst period of tension between the countries in decades when South Korean anger over Japans' wartime behavior spilled into the trade arena.
Last week, Japan partially eased curbs put in place in July on the export of a key high-tech material to South Korea. The trade restrictions were followed by the two countries removing each other from their list of favored trade partners.
No one knows how many Koreans were forced to work in Japan's military brothels.
South Korean activists say there may have been as many as 200,000 Korean victims, only a few of whom have ever told of the abuse they endured at the hands of Japanese forces.
Since the early 1990s, nearly 250 women came forward to talk about their experiences. Only 20 of them survive.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu easily won a vote to keep the Likud party helm, the party said on Friday, in a boost ahead of what is likely to be a hard-fought general election in March. 
Netanyahu won 72.5% of votes in Thursday's party ballot, against 27.5% for challenger Gideon Saar, who conceded, tweeting that he would now back the incumbent ""for the sake of a Likud victory in the (general) election"".
The challenge by Saar, a former education and interior minister, had added to pressures on the four-term premier, who is under indictment and fighting for political survival.
Netanyahu declared victory in a speech at Likud's campaign headquarters near Tel Aviv, telling supporters: ""The future is in our hands"".
""The sweeping decision in the primaries was a major expression of confidence in my path, in our path,"" Netanyahu said, adding: ""Now is the time to bring a sweeping victory to Likud and the right in the elections.""
In November, Netanyahu was charged with corruption in three criminal cases and he has twice failed to form a government in the wake of inconclusive national ballots in April and September. 
Netanyahu's rival in those elections, Benny Gantz of the Blue and White party, was also unable to form a coalition, leading to political deadlock and a third election on March 2.
Netanyahu has cast the legal case against him as a political witch-hunt by the media and an Israeli left hoping to oust him. 
Gantz, who will be Netanyahu's main challenger again in March, sought to draw a distinction between his centrist party and Likud under Netanyahu, who he said was ""seeking to break down the rule of law"". 
""As Likud continues to by led by a defendant in bribery, fraud and breach of trust, we will choose unity, statehood and reconciliation, leading Israel on a new path,"" Gantz said on Twitter. 
Though the troubles of ""King Bibi"", as his fans call him, do not seem to have dented the loyalty Netanyahu commands among his supporters, some Likud members have said it is time for fresh leadership. 

Netanyahu had played down Saar's challenge, talking up his own security credentials and international prowess. Saar had argued that Likud was unlikely to regain power in March unless Netanyhu steps aside.

Sozcu, long a pillar of Turkey's secularist establishment, described the verdict as a black mark in the history of free press. All eight defendants present at the final court hearing demanded acquittals, the newspaper said.
Ankara has cracked down on suspected followers of Fethullah Gulen, a U.S.-based Muslim cleric, since the July 2016 coup attempt in which some 250 people were killed. Operations against the network are still routine.
Prominent columnists Emin Colasan and Necati Dogru, as well as editors Mustafa Cetin and Metin Yilmaz were convicted of aiding the Gulenist network and each were sentenced to more than three years in jail, Sozcu said.
The court ruled to acquit video journalist Mediha Olgun, and it deferred a ruling on the paper's owner Burak Akbay, who was being tried in absentia.

1614,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 27, 2019 05:21AM ET</span>","With Uighur comic, Japanese manga artist aims to highlight everday 'suffering'","By Hideto Sakai
TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese artist whose manga comics about a Uighur woman went viral wants to use the simple power of her work to raise awareness of the ""daily suffering"" endured by the Chinese mostly Muslim minority, she told Reuters.
With ""What Has Happened to Me"", a manga comic that has been translated into 10 languages - including Mandarin, Uighur and English - and viewed more than 330,000 times online, artist Tomomi Shimizu has seized on an issue that many Western countries see as evidence of Beijing's abuse of human rights.
In panels of spare, black-and-white drawings, Shimizu tells the story of Mihrigul Tursun, a real Uighur woman who now lives in the United States and says she was beaten and detained in China for being a Uighur.
""The Uighur issue has been well known among people who are into politics. But little is known among the general public. The gap is staggering,"" Shimizu, 50, told Reuters in an interview.
""I decided to use manga for this purpose because I believe manga has power to convey things to people in an easy-to-understand way.""
Shimizu, who has penned another comic about Uighurs, appears to be no stranger to politics, having voiced support on her Twitter account for issues generally backed by Japan's right wing.
The United Nations and human rights groups estimate that between 1 million and 2 million people, most of them ethnic Uighur Muslims, have been detained in harsh conditions in the Xinjiang region of northwest China, as part of what Beijing calls an antiterrorism campaign.
China has said Xinjiang faces a threat from Islamist militants and separatists.
Beijing rejects accusations of mistreatment and denies mass internment, saying it is simply seeking to end extremism and violence in Xinjiang through education, and that it is offering Uighurs better employment prospects with vocational training.
The Chinese foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Chinese government has accused Tursun of spreading lies about her time in Xinjiang and strongly denied her accusations of mistreatment.
COMFORT WOMEN, 'HARDSHIP'
Shimizu has at times voiced opposition to China but says she is not trying to use the Uighur issue to smear China.
She has tweeted that China wants to see Japan's southern island of Okinawa become independent.
In 2015, she raised doubts about the grounds for criticism that China and South Korea level at Japan, describing former ""comfort women"" - a Japanese euphemism for the women, many of them Korean, who were forced to work in Japan's wartime military brothels - as ""lying"".
Shimizu told Reuters that while she felt truly sorry for those women who had been taken against their will, she found dubious some of the accounts told by former comfort women.
Shimizu based her manga story on what she learned from watching video-recorded testimony from Tursun.
In the comic, Tursun is detained by Chinese authorities despite having committed no crime. She is separated from her 45-day-old triplets and is tortured with electric rods.
She is paroled only to find out that one of her triplets died in government custody. Later, she is incarcerated again, in a room so crowded that detainees have to take turns to lie down.
After a third detention, she asks why she has to face so much hardship. An official says: ""It is because you are Uighur"".
""There are people who need help now, people who are going through hardship every day,"" Shimizu said.
She uploaded ""What Has Happened to Me"" on her Twitter account on Aug. 31. Soon, messages started pouring in ""like a waterfall"", and it was retweeted 8,000 times in a few hours.
""It is without doubt that Ms Shimizu's manga has played an invaluable role in letting the world know the Uighur issue,"" Japan Uyghur Association Chairman Ilham Mahmut said.
Lee Da-Ren, a Taiwanese living in Japan, volunteered to translate Shimizu's work into Mandarin.
""By taking the form of manga, the story is so easy to read, and yet so penetrating,"" Lee said."

KOCHI, India (Reuters) - A Norwegian woman on holiday in India's southern state of Kerala has been told to leave the country after she joined a protest against Prime Minister Narendra Modi's new citizenship law, authorities said on Friday.
At least 25 people have been killed in protests across the country since the law, seen by critics as discriminatory toward Muslims, was adopted on Dec. 11.
A German exchange student was told to leave the country this week after taking part in two rallies against the law.
""The Norwegian lady has participated in a protest in violation of her visa condition,"" said Anoop Krishna, the Foreigners' Regional Registration Officer at Kochi airport.
""She has been asked to leave the country as early as possible. The tourist visa on which she visited the country does not allow participation in any protests.""
The tourist, Janne-Mette Johansson, 71, declined to comment to Reuters.
There was no immediate response to a request for comment from India's Ministry of Home Affairs and the Norwegian Embassy in New Delhi.
Johansson posted on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page about a Dec. 23 protest in Kochi.
""No riots, just people determined ... lifting up their voices, saying what has to be said,"" she wrote alongside pictures of the march, including one of her brandishing a sign.
Johansson told the Times of India said she had first asked police if she could take part. ""I was given a verbal assurance that I could,"" she told the newspaper.
Opposition politicians decried the two expulsions.
""India's image as a tolerant democracy is taking a hit internationally due to the knee jerk reactions of PM #Modi & @AmitShah!"" tweeted Shama Mohamed, a Congress party spokeswoman, in reference to the prime minister and home minister.
The new law makes it easier for minorities from India's Muslim-majority neighbors - Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan - who settled in India before 2015 to get citizenship.
Critics say the exclusion of Muslims is discriminatory and that the award of citizenship based on religion violates India's secular constitution."

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia plans to revive a 'truth and reconciliation' commission to bring closure over past human rights violations, including the killing of hundreds of thousands of people in 1965, a senior minister told Reuters on Thursday.
A similar commission began work in 2004 to look into abuses such as those during the three decade rule of authoritarian ruler Suharto, whose fall in 1998 began a transition to democracy in the world's fourth most populous country.
But that commission was scrapped after a Constitutional Court ruling against its provision that not all cases would have to be tried in a court.
New chief security minister Mahfud MD told Reuters that a law was being drafted to revive the commission with a provision that the parliament would decide whether any case should go to trial. 
""The principle remains that human rights abuses need to be tried in court,"" he said.
Where there was insufficient evidence, there could still be reconciliation, he said.
Among 12 cases that would be reviewed would be the 1965 anti-communist pogrom, he said.
Historians and activists say at least 500,000 people were killed from late 1965 after then-general Suharto took power following an abortive communist coup. A million or more people were jailed, suspected of being communists.
Other cases to be investigated include conflict in West Papua in 2001 that left four killed and five missing, and the shooting of students in 1998 amid riots that brought about Suharto's fall.
""What's most important is that the law needs to bring closure. Don't let this drag,"" said Mahfud, a former top judge who joined President Joko Widodo's cabinet in October.
Hadi Sutjipto, coordinator for a group of victims of the 1965 pogrom or their families, welcomed the move as a step to reconciliation. 
""Many of the older victims have died or are starting to die. They don't harbor any vengeance, they just want their names to be restored,"" he said.
But retired civil servant Maria Catarina Sumarsih, whose son Wawan was shot dead in late 1998 while helping a wounded student, said justice mattered more than reconciliation.
""I don't think the perpetrators would want to show up to the truth and reconciliation commission to say that they committed violations, that they shot Wawan, for instance,"" Sumarsih said on Friday.

""I don't trust the government, I've been lied to for 21 years.""

(Reuters) - Donations to Kyoto Animation topped 3.3 billion yen ($30 million) to support survivors and bereaved families after an arson attack on the film studio in July killed over 30 people.
A spokesperson for the Kyoto prefecture government confirmed on Friday the total amount raised following the studio's decision this week to close the donation account. Kyodo News reported on the figure earlier.
The man suspected of torching the building had been convicted of robbery and carried out the attack because he believed his novel had been plagiarized, NHK and other media have said. Police have confirmed the identity of the suspect as Shinji Aoba, who doused the entrance of the building with petrol before setting it ablaze, media have said, citing police.
Tributes to the victims lit up social media after the attack, with world leaders and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Inc's chief executive offering condolences.
As shock spread over one of the worst cases of mass killing in Japan during the past two decades, the hashtag #PrayforKyoAni, as the studio is known among fans, became popular.
Kyoto Animation, in a quiet suburb about 20 minutes by train from the center of Kyoto, produces popular ""anime"" series such as the ""Sound! Euphonium"". It is also known for ""Violet Evergarden"", which has been shown on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX).
Kyoto Animation said earlier this week it would coordinate with a prefectural allocation committee to disperse the funds.
The studio is working on animated films to be released in the spring, aiming to deliver anime ""that fosters dreams, hope and excitement to people all over the world."""

Two people were killed in the city of Kanpur on Dec. 20 amid protests against a new citizenship law brought by the Hindu nationalist government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
Wajid Fazal told Reuters he had fixed the wedding of his niece, Zeenat, the next day and was inclined to cancel it because of the violence.
""I was in a dilemma thinking about the preparations we had done,"" Fazal said in a telephone interview. He said Hindu neighbors came forward and promised to remain at the venue to ensure nothing untoward happened.
""About 40 Hindu brothers were at my house until we bid farewell to my niece in the night,"" he said.
""I will never forget this favor.""
Many of the protesters opposing the law have been Muslims, because they say it discriminates against the minority community. They form the bulk of the 25 people killed in protests since the law was passed on Dec. 11.
Modi's government has followed a strong pro-Hindu agenda since it came to power in 2014. Anoop Tiwari, one of the men who helped organize the Hindu group at the wedding, is a member of Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
""The BJP never discriminates,"" he told Reuters. ""Zeenat is like my daughter and it was our responsibility to get the marriage done on the decided date, with the decided groom and the decided venue."""

The U.S. Geological Survey earlier said the quake had a magnitude of 5.1.
""Based on our assessment, fortunately there have been no casualties or damage. There are reports of cracks in some walls of homes, but no flattened houses,"" Jahangir Dehqani, the head of the provincial emergency department, was quoted as saying by state television.
A quake of 4.9 magnitude can cause moderate damage.
It was centered 53 km (33 miles) east of Bushehr, the site of a nuclear plant on Iran's southern coast on the Gulf and was relatively shallow - only 10 km deep according to Iranian media - which would have amplified the shaking.
In 2013 when a 6.3 magnitude quake that struck south of the plant killed at least 37 people, an official said the plant had been designed to withstand earthquakes of magnitudes above 8.0.
A report published in 2013 by U.S. think tanks the Carnegie Endowment and the Federation of American Scientists said the Bushehr reactor sat at the intersection of three tectonic plates and that warnings about the threat of earthquakes had ""fallen on deaf ears"".
Crisscrossed by major fault lines, Iran is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 quake in Kerman province killed 31,000 people and flattened the ancient city of Bam.
In 2017, a magnitude 7 earthquake that struck western Iran killed more than 600 people and injured more than 9,000.

Waters around Iran have become a focus for international tensions, with the United States exerting pressure for Iranian crude oil sales and other trade ties to be cut off.
""The message of this exercise is peace, friendship and lasting security through cooperation and unity... and its result will be to show that Iran cannot be isolated,"" Iranian flotilla admiral Gholamreza Tahani said on state television.
The broadcaster said the drills included rescuing ships on fire or vessels under attack by pirates and shooting exercises.
The Gulf of Oman is a particularly sensitive waterway as it connects to the Strait of Hormuz, through which about a fifth of the world's oil passes and which in turn connects to the Gulf.
Washington proposed a U.S.-led naval mission following several attacks in May and June on international merchant vessels, including Saudi tankers, in Gulf waters which the United States blamed on Iran. It denies the accusations.
President Donald Trump last year pulled the United States out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six nations and re-imposed sanctions on the country, crippling its economy.
Tension has risen in the region not only over Iran's disputed nuclear program but also over a September attack on Saudi oil facilities blamed on Iran by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Iran also denies involvement in that.
China said on Thursday it was sending a guided missile destroyer to the four-day drills, which it called a ""normal military exchange"" between the three armed forces.
""It is not necessarily connected with the regional situation,"" a Chinese defense ministry spokesman said.
China has close diplomatic, trade and energy ties with Iran, which has friendly ties with Russia.
Russia's Defence Ministry said on Friday it had sent three ships from its Baltic Fleet - a frigate, a tanker and a rescue tug boat - to take part in the drills, Red Star, the official newspaper of Russia's armed forces, reported.
The ministry was cited as saying that it was the first time that such drills were being held in such a format.
Both Russia and China also have good relations with Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese public broadcaster NHK on Friday sent a news bulletin that incorrectly reported North Korea had launched a missile that fell into waters east of the Japanese archipelago, issuing an apology explaining it was a media training alert.
The news alert came as the United States and its East Asian allies have been on tenterhooks after Pyongyang's warning this month of a possible ""Christmas gift"" for Washington in what experts took to mean a possible long-range missile test.
The NHK bulletin, sent out 22 minutes after midnight on its website, read: ""North Korean missile seen as having fallen into seas about 2,000 km east of Hokkaido's Cape Erimo"", suggesting a flight path over Japanese territory. The same information was also delivered to users' phones through NHK's apps. 
NHK corrected the information on those platforms, as well as on television and radio within half an hour, an NHK spokesman said. 
""We apologize to our viewers and the public,"" NHK said in a statement on its website, explaining the alert was for training purposes. It also said it would review its procedures to prevent a recurrence. 
Warning citizens about disasters and security threats is one of the mandates for the publicly funded broadcaster, whose news casters regularly and frequently hold drills for earthquakes and other disaster coverage.
When North Korea did launch missiles that flew over Cape Erimo in Japan's far north in 2017, warnings spread through sirens and government-issued ""J-alerts"" on millions of cell phones throughout Japan, jolting some out of sleep.
NHK had also sent an erroneous news alert about a North Korean missile in error in January of last year.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un had given the United States until the end of the year to propose new concessions in talks over his country's nuclear arsenal and reducing tensions between the adversaries.
Its last test of an intercontinental ballistic missile was in November 2017 when it fired a Hwasong-15, the largest missile it has ever tested. Pyongyang said the missile was capable of reaching all of the United States.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian authorities said on Friday they are focused on protecting water plants, pumping stations, pipes and other infrastructure from intense bushfires surrounding Sydney, the country's largest city.
Firefighters battling the blazes for weeks received a reprieve of slightly cooler, damper conditions over Christmas, but the respite is not expected to last long.
Temperatures in New South Wales (NSW) state are forecast to head back towards 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit) early next week, fuelling fires near Warragamba Dam, which provides water to about 80% of Sydney's 5 million residents.
""In recent days up to the cool change, the fires had been a potential threat to supply and assets, particularly in Warragamba and in the Blue Mountains,"" a spokesman for the state's water authority, WaterNSW, told Reuters.
""With the coming very hot conditions the fire situation may escalate in both those fronts and possibly elsewhere.""
Warragamba Dam is located 65km (40 miles) west of Sydney, catching water flowing from the mountains. 
It is at 44.8% capacity, down from almost being full less than three years ago, as a prolonged drought ravages the continent's east. 
Despite the widespread destruction, the state's water infrastructure network has not been damaged, the spokesman said.
There have been eight deaths, including two volunteer firefighters, linked to the blazes since they flared in spring.
With more than 40 dams across the state, WaterNSW supplies two-thirds of untreated water to the state's water utilities, which then treat and clean the resource to provide drinking water to cities and regional towns.
Large quantities of ash and burnt material could pose a threat to the quality of water in the dams if the fires are followed by heavy rain.
However, there is no significant rain forecast for NSW in the short-term and WaterNSW has put containment barriers to catch potential debris run-off, the water authority said.
VOLUNTEER FORCE
Australia's reliance on a large volunteer firefighting force has been tested during this fire season that still potentially has months to run through the southern hemisphere summer.
While conservative Prime Minister Scott Morrison previously said compensation for volunteers was not a priority, he said on Tuesday that government workers could receive additional paid leave for volunteering.
A senior government minister said on Friday the government was now looking into providing wider relief. [nL4N28Y0EW]
""The prime minister is looking at this issue further on how we can provide targeted support in these extreme circumstances so that our volunteers get the support they need to keep volunteering,"" Defence Minister Linda Reynolds told media in Perth. 
While there are different rules across Australia's states, volunteers tend to negotiate time off directly with their employer.
Morrison has been under intense political pressure after it was revealed he was holidaying in Hawaii shortly before Christmas while the country grappled with an emergency and two volunteers near the fire frontlines had been killed. [nL4N28Y0EW]
Fires are traveling immense distances through bushland before hitting towns and containment lines where volunteer firefighters concentrate their resources. 

The bushfires have destroyed more than 4 million hectares (9.9 million acres) across the country, dwarfing the terrain burnt by fierce fires in California during 2019.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will send a warship and patrol planes to protect Japanese ships in the Middle East as the situation in the region, from which it sources nearly 90% of its crude oil imports, remains volatile, Japan's top government spokesman said on Friday. 
Under the plan approved by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's cabinet, a helicopter-equipped destroyer and two P-3C patrol planes will be dispatched for information-gathering aimed at ensuring safe passage for Japanese vessels through the region.
If there are any emergencies, a special order would be issued by the Japanese defense minister to allow the forces to use weapons to protect ships in danger.
""Peace and stability in the Middle East is extremely important for the peace and prosperity of the international community including Japan,"" Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference.
""Also, it is very important to make sure Japan-related ships can sail safely in the Middle East, the world's major source of energy."" 
Friction between Iran and the United States has increased since last year, when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of a 2015 international nuclear deal with Iran and re-imposed sanctions on it, crippling its economy.
In May and June, there were several attacks on international merchant vessels in the region, including the Japanese-owned tanker Kokuka Courageous, which the United States blamed on Iran. Tehran denies the accusations.
Oil importers and refiners welcomed the government decision.
""The Middle East situation remains unpredictable ... We believe the decision, made against this backdrop, will benefit the safe passage of ships in the region,"" Petroleum Association of Japan President Takashi Tsukioka said in a statement. 
Japan, a U.S. ally that has maintained friendly ties with Iran, has opted to launch its own operation rather than join a U.S.-led mission to protect shipping in the region.
Abe last week briefed visiting Iranian President Hassan Rouhani on Tokyo's plan to send naval forces to the Gulf.
The planned operation is set to cover high seas in the Gulf of Oman, the northern Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Aden, but not the Strait of Hormuz. 
The Japanese government aims to start the operation of the patrol planes next month, while the destroyer will likely begin activities in the region in February, a defense ministry official said. 
The government decision is effective for one year through December 26, 2020. A fresh cabinet approval is necessary to extend the armed force's activities in the Middle East. 

A European operation to ensure safe shipping in the Gulf will also get underway next month, when a French warship starts patrolling there.

MEERUT, India (Reuters) - Zaheer Ahmed had just returned home from work in northern India last Friday afternoon and stepped out for a smoke before lunch.
Minutes later, he was dead, shot in the head.
His death, and the killing by gunfire of four other Muslim men the same afternoon in the mainly Muslim neighborhood, made it the most intense burst of violence in two weeks of protests.
India has been convulsed by the broadest unrest in at least seven years after Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government brought in a law that many see as discriminatory against Muslims, who make up 14% of the population.
All of the families of the five dead men say they were shot and killed by police as a protest flared against the new law. Reuters could not independently verify those accounts, and none of the more than 20 individuals Reuters interviewed saw police open fire.
Police say they used baton charges and teargas, and opened fire to control the crowd but did not kill anyone.
Police add that the men must have been killed by violent armed protesters whose shots went astray. An investigation into the violence is under way.
In the aftermath, distrust and anger between the Muslim community in the area where the deaths happened and security forces has deepened, as protests to the law enter their third week.
The clashes on Dec. 20 erupted around Lisari Gate after Friday afternoon's Muslim prayers.
Residents say police broke several CCTV cameras in the area before the violence began.
Reuters was unable to independently verify those accounts, but did review CCTV footage from two cameras on shops in the area. In both cases, the footage ends abruptly after a policeman waving a baton is seen trying to hit the cameras.
Akhilesh Singh, the police superintendent of the Meerut City zone, said police had not destroyed any cameras and that all of the victims were involved in what he called rioting.
""Obviously they must be in the midst of the violence. That's why they must have been killed,"" Singh told Reuters.
Police have cracked down on the demonstrations that have spread across India, but Uttar Pradesh state, where Meerut is located, has seen the worst violence. At least 19 of 25 deaths have taken place there.
Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state with roughly 200 million people, is ruled by a Hindu priest and has a history of deadly Hindu-Muslim clashes.
Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath said in a televised statement last week that he would take ""revenge"" against those behind the violence and make them pay for the public damage.
    
HOW ZAHEER DIED
Zaheer Ahmed's home lies in a jumble of lanes that make up the crowded Lisari Gate area. The 45-year-old, who sold cattle fodder for a living, had colored his hair that day for a family wedding, said his 22-year-old niece Shaheen.
When Zaheer returned from work, he told Shaheen that he wanted to smoke and stepped out to go to a small stall in the next lane that sold beedis, the small Indian cigarette.
Zaheer's friend Naseem Ahmed was standing in the lane across the beedi stall at the time, Naseem said. He described seeing Zaheer buy the beedi and sit down on a ledge next to the shop. 
Around that time, there was chaos on the main road beyond the lanes, Shaheen and several other residents said. They said they could hear the sound of people screaming and saw teargas clouds. Many men ran into the lanes, some followed by police.
""I suddenly saw Zaheer fall down,"" said Naseem, adding that he had seen some policemen rushing into the lane just before. ""I thought he fell unconscious. It all happened within minutes.""
Through the clouds of teargas, Shaheen said she heard someone scream that Zaheer had been shot.
Neighbors brought his body home.
""I don't know who engaged in the violence, but my husband didn't,"" said his wife Shahajahan. ""Why did they kill my innocent husband? How can they kill innocent people?""
The families of the other four men who died that day said the men were either out for work or prayers when they were hit by gunfire. None of them have received post-mortem reports.
According to their families, Mohammed Mohsin was buying fodder for cattle. Asif, a tire mechanic, had stepped out to fix tires at someone's home. Another man called Asif, a rickshaw-driver, was returning home after prayers. Aleem Ansari had gone to the restaurant where he worked making rotis, the Indian bread.
Many people in the impoverished area use just one name.
    
""DEADLY FORCE""
Thousands of people have taken to streets across India to demand the government rescind the Citizenship Amendment Act enacted by parliament on Dec. 11.
It gives minorities who migrated from three neighboring countries a path to citizenship, except for Muslims. Critics say it is an attack on India's secular foundations.
""He was shot dead by police. They shot him in the head and killed him,"" said Ansari's mother Saira. ""I swear if I find that policeman I will not spare him.""
Reuters reviewed a copy of a case report of the violence that day that police registered at the Lisari Gate police station.
The report dated Dec. 20 includes a police officer’s statement that a crowd of about 1,000 protesters armed with sticks charged down the main road at around 2:30 p.m.
Police asked them to disperse, saying the large gathering was not permitted, according to the police report. The officer who filed it, Ajay Kumar Sharma, did not immediately respond to calls for comment.
""Suddenly there was chaos when the crowd started pelting stones at us and firing at us,"" the report says. In response, police used batons and fired tear gas and rubber bullets, the statement says.
Singh, the Meerut police superintendent, said the police and paramilitary personnel around Lisari Gate that day were armed with AK-47 rifles, pistols and chilli bombs.
Human Rights Watch has said Indian police have used ""unnecessary, deadly force"" in controlling the protests.
At a hospital in Meerut, two paramilitary policemen being treated said they were injured when fired at by protesters last Friday. A doctor said they had been treated for bullet injuries on the leg and forearm.
When asked about civilians who had been shot and killed, one of them, Vidya Dhar Shukla, sat up on his bed. ""There was so much chaos, who knows where the damned people died?""

""If I had a gun I would fire at them that day,"" he said. ""India shouldn't harbor such snakes.""

Typhoon Phanfone hit late on Tuesday with winds of up to 120 kph (75 mph) and gusts of 150 kph, dumping sheets of uninterrupted rain on a string of islands, damaging hundreds of homes and causing flooding in eight areas.
It was the seventh typhoon to strike the Philippines this year and came as millions of people in the predominantly Catholic country were heading home to celebrate Christmas with families.
Some 43,000 people were in temporary shelters on Friday, among the 185,000 impacted by the typhoon, which destroyed 49 homes and partially damaged 2,000.
There was widespread travel disruption with 115 flights canceled and thousands of people stranded by the suspension of ferries due to storm surges.
It was unclear how the deaths occurred, but officials said some were hit by trees, electrocuted or drowned.
""People did not expect that the storm would be that devastating,"" said disaster agency spokesman Mark Timbal.
Though less powerful than other typhoons this year, Phanphone made landfall in some of the country's poorest and least-developed islands.
Among them was the island of Samar, which bore the brunt of Typhoon Haiyan in 2013, the Philippines' most powerful and deadliest storm on record. It killed more than 6,300 people.
Residents there were clearing debris, with wooden pillars and sheets of corrugated iron roof that were once homes, scattered across the ground. Men pulled tried to recover fishing boats with tangled or damaged outriggers.
Samar resident Virgilo Catayas, whose sibling was among those killed by Haiyan, said he lost another to hypertension when Phanphone hit.
""We can't really do much if that's what happened, we'll have to accept it,"" he told broadcaster ABS-CBN. ""The important thing is to stay strong,"" he said, sitting next to a casket.
Television showed minor damage to the airport at Kalibo, an alternative gateway to the holiday island of Boracay, while the disaster agency said 55 schools had suffered some damage.
The agriculture department estimated initial damages of 569 million pesos ($11.17 million) mostly to fish farms.

Rio Rancho police were called to the home late on Wednesday afternoon by a relative, police Captain Andrew Rodriguez said.
He said all four people appeared to have died from gunshots fired inside the home in the Northern Meadows subdivision of Rio Rancho, a mid-sized city that lies just north of Albuquerque.
The four were identified as Carlos Velasquez, 50; Marilyn Velasquez, 45; Roberto Velasquez, 22; and Adrian Velasquez, 14. Their precise relationships were not disclosed.
""We have not determined who the shooter is at this time, but no other people are suspected as being involved,"" Rodriguez told Reuters by telephone. ""No one else was injured. The deceased were the only occupants of the home.""
A relative, identified by local television station KRQE-TV as Rose Varona, said the family of four all lived at the house and they were up late celebrating on Christmas Eve.
When relatives did not hear from anyone in the Velasquez household on Christmas Day, another family member went to the house and discovered the deaths, the television station reported.
""We just try to draw the strength from God, even though we don't understand what's going on,"" Varona said.
Rodriguez said in a statement, ""This is a tragic event for the family and for the people in our communities. Our officers and detectives understand the impact this incident has on our entire city."""

Japan plans to fully decommission Tokyo Electric Power's Fukushima Daiichi plant, which was hit by a massive earthquake and tsunami which triggered meltdowns, in 30 to 40 years. Removing fuel rods and debris, as well as contaminated water, are among the main challenges.
While the decommissioning plan remains unchanged, the government said it now aims to begin removing spent fuel from the No. 2 reactor around 2024-2026, and from the No. 1 reactor around 2027-2028. It previously planned to begin both around 2023.
Fuel will be removed from all 6 of the Daiichi reactors by around 2031, it said.
Some experts have said that even a 40-year decommissioning target is too optimistic and that Japan may need to take an approach similar to Chernobyl, for example waiting until radioactivity naturally fades.
The Fukushima disaster led to a shutdown of the country's then-54 reactors, which once provided nearly a third of Japan's electricity. Some reactors have been restarted, but concerns about nuclear safety have persisted.
Worries that local food could be contaminated prompted plans by South Korea's Olympic committee to buy radiation detectors and ship homegrown ingredients to Japan ahead of next year's Tokyo Games."

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has repeatedly expressed concern to Washington over U.S. visa delays for officials from Russia and other countries, a U.N. spokesman said on Thursday after Moscow accused Guterres of turning a blind eye.
Moscow says Washington has deliberately delayed issuing visas to Russian officials traveling to the U.N. headquarters in New York, a move Russia has said could further damage strained relations.
The Russian Foreign Ministry on Wednesday accused Guterres of ignoring the U.S. visa delays.
""For many months, the Secretary-General and the United Nations Legal Counsel have repeatedly conveyed their concerns and the legal position of the Organization to senior representatives of the host country,"" U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said in a statement. 
Dujarric said Guterres and his team continued to follow the matter closely. 
The latest report from the U.N. committee on relations with the United States - as host of U.N. headquarters in New York - noted that other countries including China, North Korea, Iran, Syria and Cuba had also complained about U.S. visa delays.
According to the report, the United States said it takes its responsibilities as U.N. host country seriously but added that Washington ""reserved the right to exclude individuals in certain limited cases where there was clear and convincing evidence that the individual was traveling to the host country primarily for purposes that were outside the scope of United Nations business and were prejudicial to the host country's national security.""

1629,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 04:00PM ET</span>",Iraqi president threatens to quit in defiance of Iran's allies in parliament,"By Ahmed Rasheed
BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi President Barham Salih refused on Thursday to designate the nominee of an Iran-backed parliamentary bloc for prime minister, saying he would rather resign than appoint someone to the position who would be rejected by protesters.
The Bina bloc, led by Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, had nominated Basra Governor Asaad al-Edani to be the next prime minister following weeks of political deadlock.
But Salih said in a statement that appointing Edani would not placate protesters demanding an independent prime minister with no party affiliation or help calm the unrest that has rocked the country.
He said that because the constitution does not give him the right to reject nominees for the premiership, he was ready to quit.
""Out of my desire to stop blood and maintain peace, and with due respect to Asaad al-Edani, I refuse to nominate him,"" Salih said. ""Therefore I put my willingness to resign the post of president to members of parliament so that they decide as representatives of the people what they see fit.""
Salih's resignation may only complicate the deadlock, as lawmakers must first choose a replacement for him, and that person must then nominate a premier. According to the constitution, the speaker of parliament will first resume the presidency on an interim basis.
Mass protests have gripped Iraq since Oct. 1 and the mostly young protesters are demanding an overhaul of a system they see as profoundly corrupt and as keeping most Iraqis in poverty. More than 450 people have been killed.
Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi resigned last month as the protests continued but has remained in office in a caretaker capacity.
Sources in Salih's office said the president left Baghdad on Thursday for his hometown of Sulaimaniya in the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq and that he would deliver a televised speech later.
Infighting between political parties clinging to power has fueled the crisis and threatens to cause more unrest as protesters lose patience over the deadlock.
Two political blocs - Bina, backed by Iran, and Islah, led by populist cleric Moqtada al-Sadr - are closely involved in backroom deals to agree on a candidate.
A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE
Any agreement on thorny political issues looks unlikely. The protests have shaken the country out of two years of relative calm following the defeat of Islamic State insurgents.
""The president has found himself between the rock of the pro-Iran parties and the hard place of the people, but he chose to side with the protesters,"" said political analyst Ahmed Younis.
""By saying he is ready to resign he is responding to pressure from Iran and its allies, saying he would rather quit than be a scapegoat. He pulled the rug from under the pro-Iran parties and chose to stand with the protesters.""
Parliament approved a new electoral law on Tuesday, a key demand of protesters aimed at making elections fairer, but the political logjam threatens more unrest.
The protesters are also demanding an independent premier with no party affiliation and the removal of a ruling elite seen as enriching itself off the state and serving foreign powers — above all Iran — while many Iraqis languish in poverty without jobs, healthcare or education.
DERELICTION OF DUTY
Since Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003, power has been shared along ethno-sectarian lines among parties from Iraq's three largest communities.
The most powerful post, that of prime minister, is held by a Shi'ite Arab, the speaker of parliament by a Sunni Arab, and the presidency by a Kurd.
Pro-Iran factions saw Salih as shirking his duties and Bina lawmakers said it was grounds for impeachment.
""There are American pressures on President Barham Salih to prevent him from nominating the majority bloc nominee Edani,"" said Bina lawmaker Hamid al-Moussawi.
""The president threatening to resign is a dereliction of his constitutional duty and a dangerous step... Barham admitted he was violating the constitution, which gives us the right to hold him accountable in parliament and dismiss him.""
The United States and Iran - themselves longtime adversaries - are Iraq's two main allies. Protesters say the political elite are all loyal to foreign powers, chiefly Tehran and Washington, above the interests of everyday Iraqis.
Lawmakers from the party of Sadr, who presents himself as a nationalist, hailed Salih's decision and promised to back him.

""We are against any pressure on the president and stand with him. We will not accept his resignation,"" said Sadrist lawmaker Sabah al-Uqaili.

1630,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 03:41PM ET</span>","Exclusive: After Cabinet opposed Mexican cartel policy, Trump forged ahead","By Jonathan Landay, Ted Hesson and Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In the weeks before U.S. President Donald Trump’s declaration last month that he would forge ahead with designating Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, Cabinet members and top aides from across the government recommended against it, five people knowledgeable about the matter told Reuters.
The recommendations, which some of the sources described as unanimous, have not been reported previously. They were driven in part by concerns that such designations could harm U.S.-Mexico ties, potentially jeopardizing Mexico’s cooperation with Trump’s efforts to halt illegal immigration and drug trafficking across the border, said two sources, including a senior administration official.
Another key concern was that the designations could make it easier for migrants to win asylum in the United States by claiming they were fleeing terrorism, the senior administration official and two other sources said.
Stephen Miller, one of the most influential White House advisers and the architect of Trump's policies to stem immigration, was among the officials who voiced concerns during deliberations that preceded two high-level meetings resulting in recommendations to shelve the designation plan, according to two of the sources. 
The White House and Miller declined to comment on the record. All of the sources who spoke to Reuters requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the issue publicly.
Reuters could not determine whether the president had been briefed on the recommendations before announcing, during a Nov. 26 interview with conservative commentator Bill O’Reilly, that he was going forward with the plan.   
Less than two weeks a later, on Dec. 9, the president tweeted that he was temporarily delaying the plan at Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s request.
The senior administration official portrayed the president’s announcement not as a reversal but as a strategic move.
“Even the threat of designation was extremely useful leverage in terms of obtaining further cooperation” from Mexico, the official said.  
The official said that reviving the plan remains “a live possibility” depending on Mexico’s cooperation on such issues as sealing the border to narcotics trafficking and controlling immigration.
The Mexican government has argued that equating drug cartels with Islamic State and al Qaeda could open the door to U.S. military intervention.
In a meeting with Attorney General William Barr on Dec. 5, President Lopez Obrador expressed opposition to the designation plan, saying the Mexican constitution would not permit such foreign interference, a presidential spokesman told Reuters Tuesday. After the plan was delayed, Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard tweeted his appreciation of Trump's decision, saying ""there will be good results.""
CRACKDOWN HINGED ON COOPERATION
Trump has made halting illegal immigration and narcotics trafficking across the U.S.-Mexican border a signature issue of his first term and his 2020 re-election campaign.
Designating a group as a foreign terrorist organization, or FTO, is aimed at disrupting its finances through sanctions, including asset freezes and travel bans, on their members and associates. The State Department oversees the process.
The success of Trump’s immigration crackdown hinges, however, on Mexico’s cooperation. Earlier this year, Mexico agreed to deploy thousands of national guard troops to intercept migrants moving north toward the U.S. border after the American president threatened to impose escalating tariffs on Mexican goods.
In addition, Mexico has taken in tens of thousands of migrants sent back from the United States to await decisions on their U.S. asylum requests.
The senior administration official said Trump and many top aides have wanted to crack down on cartel trafficking in narcotics and illegal immigration for some time and were looking at novel approaches, including the FTO designation plan.
The president and senior officials believed that they needed “to have an extremely aggressive posture toward the cartels and to look at using tools that had not been used before,” he said.
Two Republican members of the U.S. House of Representatives introduced legislation in March that also would have established an FTO designation for cartels. 
The Trump administration began working on its plan in late August, Trump told O’Reilly in the Nov. 26 interview, before declaring that the cartels “will be designated” as FTOs.
   
UNANIMOUS OPPOSITION
A few weeks earlier, according to two former officials and another knowledgeable person, deputies to Cabinet members recommended in a meeting that the administration’s plan be shelved. The Nov. 8 meeting was held four days after nine American women and children died in an ambush linked to what Mexican officials asserted was a territorial dispute between rival gangs in northern Mexico. 
Miller attended the meeting and the decision was unanimous, according to one source. 
Participants at a Nov. 20 Cabinet-level meeting also advised against the proposal, according to four sources. That decision, too, was unanimous and Miller was there, two of the sources said.
The agencies represented at the meetings included the departments of State, Justice, Homeland Security, Defense, Treasury and Commerce, one administration official said.      
Numerous current and former U.S. officials and other experts say that designating Mexican cartels as FTOs would be counter-productive.
Several pointed out that a 1999 law allowing U.S. officials to designate foreign drug traffickers as narcotics kingpins already allows the imposition of sanctions similar to those authorized by an FTO designation. 
The senior administration official said that U.S. officials’ ability to use the 1999 law contributed to the decision to delay the FTO designation plan. 
A Dec. 19 report published by the conservative Heritage Foundation warned that designating cartels as FTOs would weaken Trump’s immigration policies.
“A terrorism designation could allow unintended numbers to apply for political asylum in the U.S.,” said the report. “The pool of applicants could logically extend beyond Mexico. While Mexican cartels’ territorial stronghold is within their own country, they have representatives on every continent except Antarctica.”
Jason Blazakis, who oversaw the designation process at the State Department’s Counter-Terrorism Bureau from 2008-2018, said that in addition to damaging U.S.-Mexican relations, the FTO designation could hurt Mexico’s economy by prompting foreign businesses to leave the country or reconsider investing there.
Asset freezes and bans on travel to the U.S. could affect Mexican officials, military commanders, and businessmen in league with the cartels. 
“You are blurring the lines between criminality and terrorism and that is extremely problematic,” said Blazakis, now a professor of now a professor of international relations at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California. 
He added: ""There are hundreds of Brazilian gangs eligible for the list. There are numerous Chinese and Russian criminal gangs eligible for the list. Where would you stop?”

ABIDJAN (Reuters) - Guillaume Soro, a former rebel leader in Ivory Coast and a candidate in next year's presidential election, could face life in prison over an alleged coup plot that involved amassing weapons, the country's public prosecutor said on Thursday.
The Ivorian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Soro on Monday, prompting him to call off a planned homecoming after months overseas.
The warrant is likely to increase tensions ahead of an October 2020 election that is seen as a test of Ivory Coast's stability after two civil wars since the turn of the century.
During a news conference, Prosecutor Richard Adou played a recording made by the Ivorian intelligence services in which Soro could allegedly be heard planning a coup.
""The penalty for attempting a plot against state security is a life sentence,"" Adou said, adding that the investigation was ongoing.
Soro's lawyer and spokeswoman Affoussy Bamba Lamine did not deny the authenticity of the recording presented by prosecutors but said it was from 2017 and incomplete. She said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday that Soro's team would release a full version of the audio soon.
Soro is believed to be in Europe although his exact whereabouts are unclear. He has denounced the case against him as being politically motivated.
""It is only in a dictatorship that an arrest warrant is issued against an electoral candidate,"" he said on Twitter on Wednesday.
So far, more than 15 people have been arrested in connection with the investigation, which includes charges of money-laundering and amassing illegal weapons, the prosecutor said.
""Searches of homes of the accused parties, including Soro, uncovered arms such as anti-tank missiles, RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades), Kalashnikovs, and ammunition.""
Soro, 47, led the rebels who failed to oust then-president Laurent Gbagbo in 2002. Soro's forces installed President Alassane Ouattara during a civil war that followed the 2010 election, in which both Gbagbo and Ouattara claimed victory.
Ouattara won re-election in 2015 but has given mixed signals about whether he will seek a third term, adding to uncertainty about the vote in Francophone West Africa's largest economy.

Soro retains the loyalty of many former rebel commanders who hold senior positions in the army. He served for several years as speaker of the National Assembly but has since fallen out with Ouattara.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - More than 245 homes have been destroyed and 700 people left destitute after a forest fire tore through a low-income area of the Chilean seaside city of Valparaiso on Christmas Eve.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Thursday during a tour of the affected zone that there was evidence the fire had been started deliberately. 
""There are indications, some evidence, that this could have been intentional,"" he said. ""That would be extremely serious.
""I deeply regret that what should have been a good night, a night of peace, should have been so profoundly altered by this tragedy.""
Valparaiso, known for its colorful wood-frame houses, is popular among tourists in the South American country.
The fire broke out on Tuesday in a forested area on the outskirts of the city and spread toward the coast, hitting the Rocuant and San Roque hills, a jumble of settlements that overlook the city. 
Inhabitants fled their homes just moments before sitting down to their Christmas Eve dinner, some losing all their belongings and even pets.
Chile´s forestry commission said the fire was only fully brought under control at midday on Thursday with the help of nine firefighting teams, five helicopters and two water trucks. A total of 132 hectares of vegetation were destroyed, it added. 
Agriculture Minister Antonio Walker said the high temperatures at the height of the southern hemisphere summer, which runs from December to March, and dry conditions caused by a historic drought currently blighting Chile had provided fertile ground for the fire.
He said that so far this season, there had already been a 300% increase in the area affected compared with the same period the previous year, with 2,378 fires recorded and 15,203 hectares consumed. The ministry has said that could reach 120,000 by the end of the summer.
He appealed to all Chileans to be vigilant for the outbreak of fires and report them immediately. 
Emergency shelters have been set up to host those left homeless, and national appeals for help for those affected are gaining traction. 
Valparaiso´s mayor, Jorge Sharp, said on Wednesday he had laid a criminal complaint with the courts against the authors of the fire, once they are identified. 

""That this fire was intentionally started is, from various indications, clear and we want to know who is responsible and why they would want to cause so much damage to Valparaíso,"" he said.

Mohamed Sekkaki, who has a popular following on YouTube, shared a video last month criticizing King Mohammed's speeches and calling the Moroccan people ""donkeys"" and ""stupid.""
A court in Settat, 135 km (84 miles) south of Rabat, sentenced him to four years in jail and a fine of 40,000 dirhams ($4,150) on charges that included insulting Moroccans and constitutional institutions. His lawyers said he would appeal the verdict.
Separately, rights activist Omar Radi was arrested in Casablanca on a charge of insulting a judge in a tweet, his lawyer Miloud Kandil said.
Moroccan rights groups are increasingly concerned at what they see as attacks on personal freedoms in the North African kingdom, including arrests in connection with political attacks on the authorities.
King Mohammed VI ceded some powers to an elected government after the Arab Spring protests in 2011, but he still has the final say on important issues. Demonstrations demanding social justice broke out in the Rif mountain region in 2016.
Radi criticized a judge for giving heavy prison sentences to leaders of the Rif protests, which focused on economic and social problems in a country where inequality is rampant.
He has been remanded in pre-trial custody, Kandil said, and his next hearing will be on Jan. 2. Radi also worked as a journalist and was an activist in the 2011 protests.
It comes a month after rapper Mohamed Mounir, known as Gnawi, was sentenced to a year in prison for insulting the police in a video on social media.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A Christmas Eve fire-bomb attack on offices of a comedy troupe that produced a ""gay Jesus"" Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) special is being investigated as an attempted homicide, police said on Thursday, a day after a shadowy group claimed responsibility in a video that included a far-right religious statement.
A group identifying itself as ""Popular Nationalist Insurgency Command of the Large Brazilian Integralist Family"" said in a video circulated on social media late on Christmas Day that it carried out the attack on the headquarters of the Porta dos Fundos comedy group in Rio de Janeiro. The men in the video wore masks, and the group does not list the identities of any leaders or members.
The video showed masked men throwing Molotov cocktails and reading a statement against the 46-minute comedy that Netflix released three weeks ago.
Entitled ""The First Temptation of Christ,"" the program depicts Jesus as a young man bringing home a boyfriend to meet the Holy Family. Around 2 million people petitioned the streaming service to remove the show, saying it offended Christians.
State police told a news conference in Rio they had verified the contents of the video showing three men in ski masks lighting Molotov cocktails and throwing them at a glass-fronted office that is the Porta dos Fundos' headquarters. 
No one was hurt in the incident and a security guard put out the blaze, according to a statement issued by Porta dos Fundos. 
Rio police said the incident was under investigation as attempted homicide and causing an explosion. They said they did not currently consider it a terrorist attack, though such a classification had not been discarded.
Police said a group with a similar name and symbol, the Brazilian Integralist Front, had denied any links to the video, so investigators were not certain the attackers in fact were part of the far-right group they claimed to belong to.
Police have images of four men involved in the attack but do not know their identities. Authorities said they have formed a task force to resolve the matter as quickly as possible before the group can act again.
The video claiming responsibility shows three men in black ski masks and dark green jumpsuits reading a statement in front of a flag bearing the Greek letter Sigma, the symbol of Brazil's integralist movement from the 1930s, inspired by European fascism. There was also an Imperial Flag of Brazil, the national symbol under Brazil's former monarchy but not used since the 1800s.
The statement, read in a sound-altered voice, criticizes the comedy as ""blasphemy"" perpetrated by left-wing Marxists seeking to weaken and divide the country, and criticizes Netflix for airing the special. 
Netflix did not respond to a request for comment about the video claiming responsibility for the attack.
Brazil's integralist movement from the 1930s stressed Christianity, traditional family values and authoritarian politics, and sought to suppress differences in society. 
Brazil is home to the world's largest Catholic population. There is also a rapidly growing Evangelical Christian community that supports the right-wing government of President Jair Bolsonaro, who once said he would rather have a dead son than a gay son.
Asked to respond to the video claiming responsibility, Porta dos Fundos repeated a previous statement that it hoped the perpetrators would be caught and punished and that Brazil ""will survive this storm of hatred.""
Juliano Medeiros, leader of opposition PSOL party, urged that those responsible be brought to justice. 
""If the authorities don't give a rapid and fierce response against these types of acts, Brazil could spiral into a state of even more violence,"" Medeiros said on Twitter.

Erdogan warned on Sunday that Turkey, which already hosts about 3.7 million Syrian refugees, would not be able to handle a new wave of migrants if Syrian-Russian attempts to retake rebel-held Idlib province sent more people fleeing.
A German government spokeswoman declined to confirm Sueddeutsche Zeitung's report on Thursday, saying only that Merkel's travel plans were always announced on the Friday of the preceding week.
The two leaders last met in December in London where they discussed the situation in Syria with French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Under the 2015 migration pact, Turkey hosts refugees heading for Europe in exchange for financial support. Few in the German government want to see a repeat of that year's migrant crisis, when Germany had to open its doors to over a million people, most seeking refuge from the Syrian conflict.
The migration wave, the largest Europe had seen since World War Two, transformed Germany's and Europe's politics, spurring far-right, anti-immigration politicians into legislatures across the continent and fuelling Britain's vote to leave the EU.
Migrant numbers have started to pick up again recently as Damascus and Moscow move to retake Idlib, the last significant rebel-held enclave in Syria, where up to 3 million people live. On Sunday, Erdogan said more than 80,000 were heading to Turkey.
""If the violence toward the people of Idlib does not stop, this number will increase even more. In that case, Turkey will not carry such a migrant burden on its own,"" Erdogan said.
Erdogan has previously threatened to ""open the gates"" for migrants to Europe unless Turkey received more support in hosting the refugees."

The images, which could not be verified by Reuters, showed one woman shouting ""Death to the dictator"" as people around her ran in the cemetery in the city of Karaj. Other videos showed a helicopter flying nearby and security forces around the cemetery.
Social media postings said some protesters were arrested at the ceremony for 27-year-old Pouya Bakhtiari but Reuters could not confirm that. Ceremonies also took place in a handful of other cities to honor those killed in recent protests, videos showed.
Demonstrations against a hike in fuel prices turned political last month, sparking the bloodiest crackdown in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic.
About 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest, three Iranian interior ministry officials told Reuters, though international rights groups put the figure much lower and Iran called the report ""fake news.""
Bakhtiari’s parents were arrested on Monday after refusing to call off the ceremony at the cemetery where he was buried, according to the Center for Human Rights in Iran (CHRI), a New York-based advocacy group. Bakhtiari died of a bullet wound to the head in Karaj on Nov. 16, it said.
In a report on Tuesday, the semi-official Mehr news agency noted that Bakhtiari had been “killed in a suspicious way”.
Iranian authorities had been on high alert for potential protests on Thursday and restricted mobile internet access in several provinces, an Iranian news agency reported on Wednesday.

The Paris landmark lost its roof and spire in the April 15 blaze, but the main bell towers, outer walls and much of the vaulted ceiling survived, along with religious relics and artworks.
After the first Christmas in more than two centuries without Notre-Dame services, work resumed on Thursday to prepare the site for years of rebuilding due to begin in 2021.
Engineering teams have brought in a 75-metre crane now towering over the partly destroyed cathedral.
Starting in February, their first delicate task will be the removal of 250 tonnes of damaged scaffolding installed for a renovation planned before the fire, without it falling onto the medieval vaulting.
""We don't know how that is going to affect the stability of the structure,"" said a spokeswoman for the Catholic Church's Paris diocese that includes Notre-Dame.
Supports are now being installed around the mangled scaffolding to mitigate the risk of collapse, and a second lattice structure suspended above it for access.
The edifice is monitored by dozens of sensors, crack detectors and lasers to pick up any first signs of instability, so that workers can be evacuated swiftly and damage minimized.
""We've known from the start that there's a certain amount of risk nobody can really quantify,"" the diocese spokeswoman said. ""A partial collapse of the vaulting is a possibility that can't yet be ruled out."""

While the turnout on Thursday was smaller than on the previous two days, riot police stepped up patrols at shopping centers on the Kowloon peninsula and in the rural New Territories.
Dozens of police with batons and shields surrounded and sealed off the Langham Place shopping mall in Kowloon's Tsim Sha Tsui district after black-clad, masked protesters occupied it.

The protests began more than six months ago in response to a now-withdrawn bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China, where courts are controlled by the Communist Party.
They have since evolved into a broader pro-democracy movement, and became more confrontational over the festive season. Earlier in December, after pro-democracy candidates overwhelmingly won district council elections, they had been largely peaceful.
Many protesters have been angered by what they see as the use of unnecessary force by the police, and demanded an independent inquiry into the force's behavior.
Police, who say they have used only minimum force to control the protests, on Thursday detained several people at a mall in rural Tai Po, north of the city's financial center, public broadcaster RTHK said.
Demonstrators are also angry at what they perceive as increased meddling by Beijing in freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering, saying it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time, and blames foreign forces for fomenting unrest. 
Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam condemned the protesters in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday, saying many Hong Kongers and tourists were disappointed their Christmas Eve celebrations had been ruined, while local businesses had also been hit.
On Thursday, some restaurants and stores pulled down their shutters in the malls as protesters, some wearing balaclavas and carrying black flags, marched by.
The government on Thursday criticized ""unprecedented violence"" by some protesters, but said that protecting freedoms and human rights remained a top priority.

1640,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 10:24AM ET</span>",Turkey to send troops to Libya at Tripoli's request: Erdogan,"By Ece Toksabay and Ali Kucukgocmen
ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will send troops to Libya at the request of Tripoli as soon as next month, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Thursday, putting the North African country's conflict at the center of wider regional frictions. 
Libya's internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) has been struggling to fend off General Khalifa Haftar's forces from eastern Libya, which have been supported by Russia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Jordan.
It was unclear what specific invitation Erdogan was referring to as the interior minister in the Tripoli-based government, Fathi Bashagha, suggested in comments to reporters in Tunis that no official request had yet been made.
""If the situation escalates and then we have the right to defend Tripoli and its residents ... we will submit an official request to the Turkish government to support us militarily so we expel the ghost of mercenary forces,"" Bashagha said on Thursday. 
Haftar's forces were not immediately available for comment. 
They have failed to reach the center of Tripoli but have made small gains in recent weeks in some southern suburbs of the capital with the help of Russian and Sudanese fighters, as well as drones shipped by the UAE, diplomats say.
The Chinese-made drones have given Haftar ""local air superiority"" as they can carry over eight times the weight of explosives than the drones given to the GNA by Turkey and can also cover the whole of Libya, a U.N. report said in November.
Last month, Ankara signed two separate accords with the GNA, led by Fayez al-Serraj, one on security and military cooperation and another on maritime boundaries in the eastern Mediterranean.
The maritime deal ends Turkey's isolation in the East Mediterranean as it ramps up offshore energy exploration that has alarmed Greece and some other neighbors. The military deal would preserve its lone ally in the region, Tripoli. 
""Since there is an invitation (from Libya) right now, we will accept it,"" Erdogan told members of his AK Party in a speech. ""We will put the bill on sending troops to Libya on the agenda as soon as parliament opens.""
The legislation would pass around Jan. 8-9, he said, opening the door to deployment. 
TENSION WITH RUSSIA
For weeks Ankara has flagged the possibility of a military mission in Libya, which would further stretch its armed forces less than three months after it launched an incursion into northeastern Syria against a Kurdish militia.
Turkey has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a U.N. report seen by Reuters last month. 
Erdogan visited Tunisia on Wednesday to discuss cooperation for a possible ceasefire in neighboring Libya. On Thursday, he said Turkey and Tunisia had agreed to support the GNA. 
Moscow has voiced concerns over a possible Turkish military deployment to Libya in support of the GNA. Erdogan has said Turkey will not stay silent over mercenaries from the Kremlin-linked Wagner group supporting Haftar.
""Russia is there with 2,000 Wagner (fighters),"" Erdogan said on Thursday, also referring to some 5,000 fighters from Sudan in Libya. ""Is the official government inviting them? No.""
""They are all helping a war baron (Haftar), whereas we are accepting an invitation from the legitimate government of the country. That is our difference,"" he said. 
Haftar's Libyan National Army has been trying since April to take Tripoli from the GNA, which was set up in 2016 following a U.N.-brokered deal. The UAE, Egypt and Jordan have for years provided military support for Haftar's forces, U.N. reports have said. None of the countries has confirmed this.
Russian mercenaries have put more pressure on the GNA and ""accelerated this quid pro quo between Tripoli and Ankara,"" said Sinan Ulgen, a former Turkish diplomat and chairman of the think-tank Center for Economics and Foreign Policy Studies.
""So the troop deployment must happen right away, but the risk is that Turkey is being sucked into a military game where the only path is more engagement and escalation,"" he said.
Turkish and Russian officials held talks in Moscow this week to seek a compromise on the issues of both Libya and Syria, where Russia backs President Bashar al-Assad.

In the Mediterranean, Turkey is at loggerheads with Greece, Cyprus, Egypt and Israel over rights to resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus. Athens says Ankara's maritime deal with Tripoli violates international law.

Ahead of a vote on the draft Law on Religious Freedoms, expected later on Thursday or on Friday, Serbian Orthodox clergy and believers held a service on a packed bridge near parliament, watched by police who had sealed off city center roads and approaches to the government building. 
The law envisages that religious communities in the tiny Adriatic state would need to prove property ownership from before 1918, when predominantly Orthodox Christian Montenegro joined the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the predecessor of the now-defunct Yugoslavia.
The Serbian Orthodox Church is the biggest church in Montenegro, a country of 620,000 people, while the much smaller Montenegrin Orthodox Church remains unrecognized by other major churches. Overall, the Serbian Orthodox Church has around 12 million followers, mostly in neighboring Serbia.
Despite the protests, the 81-seat parliament in which the ruling coalition led by the Democratic Party of Socialists of President Milo Djukanovic has a slim majority of three seats, has decided to start debating the law. 
Bishop Metodije of the Serbian Orthodox Church said the law was unconstitutional. 
""We will address all international institutions because of such brutal violations of religious freedoms,"" he told the crowd. 
The government of Montenegro, which is a European Union membership candidate and a NATO member, has denied it would strip any religious community of its property. 
The Serbian church in Montenegro, which owns 66 mainly medieval monasteries, dozens of churches and other real estate there, insists the state wants to impound its assets.
""This law would bring nothing good to anyone,"" Predrag Scepanovic, a priest, told protesters.
Montenegro peacefully split from its former federal partner and much larger Serbia in 2006.
Pro-Western Djukanovic, Montenegro's long-serving leader, has recently accused the Serbian church of promoting pro-Serb policies that are aimed at undermining Montenegrin statehood.

""Russia, Syria, and Iran are killing, or on their way to killing, thousands if innocent (sic) civilians in Idlib Province. Don’t do it! Turkey is working hard to stop this carnage,"" Trump said in a tweet.
Syrian and Russian forces have intensified their bombardment of targets in Idlib, the last significant rebel pocket of Syria. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has vowed to recapture it.
The leaders of Turkey, Russia and Iran agreed in Ankara in September to ""de-escalate"" conflict in Idlib after a months-long campaign that forced at least 500,000 civilians to flee. With diplomacy on a Syria peace settlement stalled, the de-escalation deal has been unravelling of late.
Turkish Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said on Tuesday that Russia will work to stop attacks in Idlib after talks with a Turkish delegation in Moscow.

Trump has sought a close relationship with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, even after Ankara's recent incursion against American Kurdish allies in Syria and Turkey's purchase of the Russian S-400 missile defence system.

China will send the Xining, a guided missile destroyer, to the drills, which will last until Monday and are meant to deepen cooperation between the three countries' navies, ministry spokesman Wu Qian told a monthly news briefing.
The drill was a ""normal military exchange"" between the three armed forces and was in line with international law and practices, Wu said.
""It is not necessarily connected with the regional situation,"" he said, without elaborating. 
The Gulf of Oman is a particularly sensitive waterway as it connects to the Strait of Hormuz - through which about a fifth of the world's oil passes - which in turn connects to the Gulf.
The drills are also coming at a time of fraught tensions between the United States and Iran.
Friction has increased since last year when U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with six nations and re-imposed sanctions on the country, crippling its economy.
Washington has proposed a U.S.-led naval mission after several attacks in May and June on international merchant vessels, including Saudi tankers, in Gulf waters which the United States blamed on Iran. It denies the accusations.
Tension has risen in the region not only over Iran's disputed nuclear program but also over a September attack on Saudi oil facilities blamed on Iran by the United States and Saudi Arabia. Iran also denies involvement. 
The Indian Ocean and Gulf of Oman are key areas for international trade and maintaining security in the waterways is an important task, Brigadier General Abolfazl Shekarchi, spokesman for Iran's armed forces, said on Wednesday, according to the official IRNA news agency.
""This drill will take place for supporting and increasing experience in the security of international trade in the region,"" he said.
China has close diplomatic, trade and energy ties with Iran.
But China also has good relations with Iran's regional rival Saudi Arabia, meaning it has long had to tread a fine line in a part of the world where it has traditionally exerted far less sway than the United States, Russia, France or Britain.
Chinese President Xi Jinping is likely to visit Saudi Arabia next year as it is the host of the 2020 G20 summit.

PHANG NGA, Thailand (Reuters) - Communities across Asia commemorated the more than 230,000 victims of the Indian Ocean tsunami on Thursday, the 15th anniversary of one of the world's most deadly disasters.
On the morning after Christmas Day in 2004, a 9.1 magnitude quake off northern Sumatra island triggered a tsunami with waves as high as 17.4 meters (57 feet) that swept over vulnerable coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other countries.
GRAPHIC: Waves of devastation - https://graphics.reuters.com/INDIANOCEAN-TSUNAMI-HISTORICAL/0100B4T42LZ/tsunami.jpg 
""It still haunts me … I can remember it all the time,"" said Suwannee Maliwan, 28, who lost both parents and five other relatives when the tsunami hit the Thai province of Phang Nga. 
""Sometimes I dream that a wave is coming. I'm still scared,"" she said. ""Sometimes I want to move somewhere else, but it's not possible because I was born here, my mom and dad passed away here.""
Memorials were scheduled in the Indonesian province of Aceh, where entire villages were flattened and more than 125,000 people perished in the giant waves. Since then, the area has been largely rebuilt, with some 25,600 residential, commercial, government and school buildings constructed inside a high-risk zone, that had suffered virtually total devastation in 2004.
In Thailand, where more than 5,300 people were killed, including tourists visiting resort islands in the Andaman Sea, officials held a memorial ceremony and called for more awareness and preparedness for disasters. 
""The government wants to lift safety standards... and build awareness across all sectors in preparing and protecting people against disasters,"" Deputy Interior Minister, Nipon Bunyamanee, said at an opening ceremony. He said Dec. 26 had been designated national accident prevention day. 
Officials later laid wreaths at a memorial center in Phang Nga province to pay tribute to King Maha Vajiralongkorn's nephew, Bhumi Jensen, who was last seen jet-skiing off the coast when the tsunami hit. 
An interfaith service for Muslim, Christian and Buddhist victims was also scheduled. 
Survivors from Ban Nam Khem, the worst hit Thai village, will hold a candlelight vigil in the evening. At least 1,400 people were killed when waves struck the fishing village.

In India, where more than 10,000 people died in the tsunami, survivors also were to hold memorial ceremonies. More than 35,000 people died in Sri Lanka.

For nearly 20 months, Palestinians have held weekly demonstrations dubbed the ""Great March of Return"", which have often turned violent as people throw rocks and firebombs at Israeli troops who respond by shooting with live fire.
Gaza medical officials say 214 Palestinians have been killed since the Friday protests began in March 2018. In that period, an Israeli soldier was shot dead by a Palestinian sniper on the border during the demonstrations.
However, the protests have tapered off in recent months. Analysts attribute the decline to diplomatic efforts by Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations to fend off a wider escalation between Israel and Hamas.
The Higher National Committee, a collection of Gaza-based factions and civil society organizations which organize the protests, said there will be a protest this Friday but that demonstrations thereafter would be held monthly and on national occasions.
The protesters have called for an end to a security blockade imposed on Gaza by Israel and Egypt, and for Palestinians to have the right to return to land from which their families fled or were forced to flee during Israel’s 1948 founding.
Israel rejects any such return, saying that would eliminate its Jewish majority.
Israel seized Gaza in a 1967 war and pulled out its settlers and troops in 2005. It says its blockade is necessary to stop weapons reaching Hamas, which fought three wars with Israel and fired thousands of rockets at it in the past decade."

JALPAN DE SERRA, Mexico (Reuters) - Poor Central American migrants who form caravans to fend off predatory gangs as they cross Mexico's interior en route to the United States have made global headlines and drawn the ire of President Donald Trump.
But last week in the Texan border city of Laredo a caravan of about 1,500 families made up of Mexican migrants and Americans of Mexican origin set out in the opposite direction - for their Christmas holidays.
Driving large cars laden with clothes, perfumes and other Christmas presents, the Mexicans, all with U.S. legal status, bore scant resemblance to the Central American migrants trudging north on foot, except for their shared fear of criminal gangs.
""There's a lot of extortion, corruption, many people have been attacked,"" said Jesus Mendoza, a 35-year-old painter who obtained U.S. legal residency in August and returned to Mexico for the first time this year since 2001.
About half of the 12 million Mexicans living in the United States have legal residency, and Mexico's Senate expected more than 3 million to return home this year.
But doing so by car poses a challenge as Mexico's northern border regions have been racked by a tide of drug-fueled violence that led to a record 29,000 murders last year.
With three young children and a wife he met on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), Mendoza was going back to a Mexico different to the one he left behind as a teenager before the country embarked on a so-called war on drugs in 2006 and violence spiraled.
""It's a sad thing that some don't want...to visit their family because of the situation,"" he told Reuters in Jalpan de Serra in central Mexico after arriving there on Dec. 16.
Trump has called migrant caravans bound for the United States ""invasions"" and has threatened to close the U.S. border with Mexico.
Car caravans moving south into Mexico have been rare over the past decade. But those who reached their family homes say safety in numbers is vital.

""It's sad that when I enter Mexico I don't feel safe,"" said Mariela Ramirez Palacios, a Mexico-born resident of Oklahoma. ""The caravan is safe.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian authorities raided the Moscow headquarters of opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Thursday, using power tools to gain entry before dragging Navalny out by force and confiscating technical equipment such as laptops. 
Navalny and his allies said the raid on his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) was carried out by the Federal Bailiffs Service and was connected to his refusal to delete a video investigation which leveled graft allegations against Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and billionaire businessman Alisher Usmanov.
The Federal Bailiffs Service told Reuters it was carrying out investigative activities at Navalny's foundation as part of a criminal investigation. It said it had not detained anyone during the raid. 
Usmanov brought and won a defamation lawsuit against Navalny in 2017. That case ended with a court ordering Navalny to delete within 10 days all references to the allegations in his video, which Medvedev and Usmanov said were utterly false. 
Navalny said on Thursday he would not delete the offending video, which has been watched over 32 million times on YouTube since it was first posted in March 2017. 
CCTV footage of Thursday's raid showed men using power tools to saw through the front door of Navalny's foundation. The men, some of them masked and wearing black uniforms, could then be seen searching the office before one of them covered a CCTV camera up with tape.
The raid occurred a day after Navalny said that the forcible military conscription of one of his allies to a remote air base in the Arctic amounted to kidnapping and illegal imprisonment. 
CRITIC OF PUTIN
Allies said Navalny, who was barred from running in a presidential election against Vladimir Putin last year, had been due to present his own show, which is critical of the authorities, on his online TV channel later on Thursday.
Navalny's foundation, which specializes in publishing exposes on the alleged corruption of state officials, is the subject of a separate criminal investigation into alleged money laundering.
Investigators opened the money laundering case in August after Navalny called for people to demonstrate in central Moscow over the exclusion of opposition candidates from a local election. 
Those protests grew into Moscow's biggest sustained protest movement in years before fizzling out. 
The Justice Ministry in October formally labeled Navalny's anti-corruption group a ""foreign agent"", meaning it can be subjected to spot checks and face bureaucratic scrutiny. 

Navalny has called that move and others part of a coordinated and trumped-up campaign to stifle the anti-Kremlin opposition's activities.

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - India's northern Uttar Pradesh state is demanding millions of rupees from over 200 people and threatening to confiscate their property as a penalty for damage done to public property during protests against the country's new citizenship law.
Uttar Pradesh, India's most populous state, has suffered some of the most violent protests against India's Citizenship Amendment Act, which gives minorities who have migrated from three neighboring countries a path to citizenship but doesn't make the same concessions for Muslims.
At least 15 of the 21 people killed in the protests have been in Uttar Pradesh, a state that has been a tinder box for tensions between the Hindu and Muslim communities.
At least 230 such notices have been issued, and most of the people they had been issued to were Muslims, state government officials said on Thursday. The claims are likely to run into tens of millions of rupees, they said.
It was unclear how many of them have been charged with rioting or other crimes, and none have been convicted. State officials have blamed much of the violence on Muslim mobs protesting against the law.
In the town of Rampur, the family of Mohammad Faheem, whose brother-in-law Mohammad Mehmood is in police custody, has received one such notice.
""Mehmood did not participate in a protest and was at home that day but police still arrested him,"" Faheem told Reuters.
Mehmood, sells spices on a cart and cannot even afford a lawyer to get bail, Faheem said.
""How will we pay the fine?"" he asked.
Authorities have followed the legal procedure in assessing damage to public property as well as in issuing the notices, said Mrityunjay Kumar, a spokesman for the Uttar Pradesh government.
Critics, however, said such notices are premature.
""You cannot be the complainant and the judge yourself,"" Vikram Singh, a former head of police in Uttar Pradesh, told Reuters, adding that the state needed to appoint a competent authority to asses the damage.
""Sending notices to 100, pursuing 50 and succeeding in two will do more harm than good.""
Hundreds of thousands of people across India, including university students, have joined protests against the law, posing the biggest challenge to Prime Minister Narendra Modi since he took office in 2014.
Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party controls the state government in Uttar Pradesh, and Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, a Hindu priest, is one of the leading lights in the Hindu nationalist party.
Students in several Indian cities have led the protests, making use of social media to wage a parallel battle online and teach people how to organize demonstrations.
India's army chief on Thursday criticized the role of students in the protests.
""Leaders are those who lead people in the right direction, leaders are not those who lead people in inappropriate directions as we are witnessing in a large number of university and college students, the way they are leading masses of crowds to carry out arson and violence in our cities and towns,"" General Bipin Rawat. ""This is not leadership.""

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China has sailed its new aircraft carrier into the Taiwan Strait, Taiwan's defense ministry said on Thursday, as a presidential election campaigning was in full swing on the island amid heighten tension with Beijing. 
Democratic Taiwan is claimed by China as a wayward province and is the Communist Party's most sensitive and important territorial issue. China has threatened to attack if Taiwan moves toward formal independence.
Taiwan holds a presidential vote on Jan. 11 with President Tsai Ing-wen hoping to win re-election. She has repeatedly mentioned what she sees as the threat of China as a warning to voters.
Tsai's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party is pro-independence, although she has said she wants to maintain the status quo with China but will defend Taiwan's security and democracy.
The Chinese carrier Shandong sailed north through the Strait, the Taiwan ministry said in a short statement, adding that the carrier group was accompanied by frigates. The ministry did not say exactly when the ships made their voyage.
""It's the responsibility and duty for the two sides across the strait to maintain peace and stability and strive for the well-being of the people,"" Taiwan's presidential office said in a statement. 
""Beijing should cherish peace and stability across the strait and in the region, which are not easy to come by.""
China's defense ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
A senior Taiwan official familiar with security planning said the Chinese navy patrol was the latest bid by Beijing to meddle in Taiwan's election.
""By flexing military muscles, China is trying to intimidate non-aligned voters,"" the official, who declined to be identified, told Reuters.
""Beijing understands that this could be a double-edged sword, but what worries China more is the possibility of a fiasco for pro-China forces in the election.""
China would prefer to the see the candidate of the main opposition Kuomintang party, which backs stronger ties, win the election.
The Chinese ministry's spokesman, Wu Qian, speaking earlier on Thursday at a monthly news briefing, said everything was going ""smoothly"" with the new carrier, though did not comment on its deployments.
""It will continue to conduct trials and training, and form a combat capability through training. We will make an overall consideration about its deployment according to the situation and task needs,"" Wu said.
He did not mention its sailing through the Taiwan Strait.
The carrier, China's second largest, entered service at a base in the South China Sea last week in a big step in the country's ambitious military modernization.
Last month, the ship, still unnamed at the time, sailed through the Taiwan Strait on its way to what China called routine exercises in the South China Sea, with Taiwan scrambling ships and aircraft to monitor the group.
President Xi Jinping said in January that China reserves the right to use force to bring Taiwan under its control but will strive to achieve peaceful ""reunification"".

Netanyahu, head of Likud for the past 14 years, is widely expected to retain the right-wing party's leadership.
However, the challenge has added to pressures that have mounted this year on the four-term premier, who is under indictment and fighting for political survival.
In November, Netanyahu was charged for corruption in three criminal cases and he has twice failed to form a government in the wake of two inconclusive national ballots, held in April and September. 
Netanyahu's centrist rival in those elections, Benny Gantz, was also unable to form a coalition government, which has led Israel to political deadlock and an unprecedented third election.
Netanyahu has cast the legal case against him as a political witch-hunt orchestrated by the media and the Israeli left in the hopes of ousting a popular right-wing leader. 
Though the troubles of 'King Bibi' as he is nicknamed by his fans, do not seem to have dented the loyalty Netanyahu commands among his supporters, some Likud members have said it is time for fresh leadership. 
His challenger in the party primaries, Gideon Saar, a former education and interior minister and a popular member of Likud, has said that the party is unlikely to regain power in the March 2 election unless Netanyahu steps aside. 
Netanyahu, who has served as prime minister for more than a decade, has dismissed Saar's challenges, talking up his security credentials and international prowess. 

Some 116,048 Likud members are eligible to vote in the party primary, though stormy weather could keep some of them at home. Results are expected by Friday morning.

Akimoto was up to last year a senior vice minister in the Cabinet Office who oversaw policy on casinos.
He is suspected of taking 3 million yen cash ($27,500) and a family holiday valued at $6,500 from three suspects despite knowing their company wanted help with a casino, prosecutors said. The three were also arrested.
Akimoto has denied wrongdoing.
Prosecutors did not name the company, but public broadcaster NHK and other Japanese media say it is Shenzhen, China-based 500.com. The online gambling firm had indicated interest in opening a casino in Japan, the Nikkei and other media reported.
New York-listed 500.Com has not responded to requests for comment.

WHAT'S AT STAKE?
The arrest is likely to be seen as another black mark against casinos, still a contentious issue after lawmakers last year finished legalizing them following years of debate.
Japan wants to allow several ""integrated resorts"", Las Vegas-style complexes that include casinos, shopping arcades and conference centers.
Hamstrung by a shrinking economy, population and tax base, Japan is pushing to boost overseas tourism, especially after the Tokyo Olympics end next year.
Some analysts say the casino market could be worth around $20 billion annually or more, thanks to an affluent population and the proximity to Asia's wealthy gamblers.
WHAT'S THE CASINO CONTROVERSY?
The casino development law is unpopular with the public, given concerns large-scale gambling centers could lead to a rise in addiction, along with crime and corruption. 
An opinion poll in October by Jiji news found 57.9% opposition to integrated resorts versus 26.6% support.
Gambling has a seedy image in Japan, with none of the glamor associated with spots like Las Vegas. Many Japanese identify gambling with the noisy, garishly lit pachinko pinball parlors that dot neighborhood shopping streets.
Many are skeptical of the benefits and argue it would create mostly part-time and low paid jobs. 
WHAT DOES THE SCANDAL MEAN FOR THE GOVERNMENT?
The government's chief spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, said Akimoto's arrest would not impact the process to select casino host cities.
Given Akimoto is no longer a member of the cabinet office, analysts say his arrest is unlikely to weigh on the process.
""If this involved a prominent politician, it would be an enormous problem, but you can't say he's that prominent, so the impact won't be that large,"" said Tomoaki Iwai, political science professor at Nihon University.
But Iwai said the scandal had worsened the image of the Liberal Democratic Party, which is also fending off allegations that Abe used party funds to sponsor a party for supporters.
WHERE WILL THE RESORTS BE BUILT?
The government has authorized licenses to build three resorts, and is expected to officially receive bids from interested localities in 2021.
Potential bidders include Tokyo, Yokohama and Osaka, Japan's three largest cities, and smaller ones including Nagasaki and Wakayama. Hokkaido had expressed an interest, but bowed out last month.
WHICH FIRMS ARE BIDDING?
MGM Resorts International has indicated its intention to develop a casino resort in Osaka.
Other global names including Las Vegas Sands Corp, Wynn Resorts (NASDAQ:WYNN) Ltd, and Galaxy Entertainment Group have indicated a preference to build in Yokohama.
Caesars Entertainment has said it will not pursue a license.

The Tokyo-based firm was under investigation for possible ties to ruling party lawmaker Tsukasa Akimoto, who was arrested on Wednesday on suspicion of accepting bribes when he oversaw the government's policy on casino development, broadcaster NHK said.
Without identifying the pachinko company that was raided, NHK said its accounts were being scrutinized for any transactions involving Akimoto, who in the past served as a consultant for a firm that had dealings with the pachinko operator.
Pachinko, a slot-cum-pinball form of gambling, is a national obsession though the number of players is declining as younger generations prefer to play games on their mobile phones.
Following Akimoto's high-profile arrest, media has reported that prosecutors have been expanding their investigation into whether he accepted cash and gifts from 500.com, an online gambling operator based in China interested in developing a casino in Japan.
Prosecutors have not named the company.
While Japan's top government spokesman insisted that Akimoto's arrest would not delay government plans to develop three casino resorts, the investigation will likely raise questions about the bidding process. 
Laws to legalize casinos in Japan have been met with public opposition because of concern about gambling addiction. 
Akimoto is accused of receiving about 3 million yen in cash and a family holiday from officials at 500.com's Japanese subsidiary, according to media reports. He has denied any wrongdoing.
The company has not responded to multiple requests for comment.
Prosecutors have arrested three other people suspected of bribery and raided the offices of a former member of parliament for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), Shigeaki Katsunuma, and current LDP lawmaker Takaki Shirasuka in connection with the case, media reported.
Las Vegas-style casino resorts are among Prime Minster Shinzo Abe's plans to attract foreign tourists.
Japan, which has a shrinking population and economy, is desperate to maintain growth in tourism, particularly after the Tokyo Olympics next year.
Some analysts have said the casino market could be worth about $20 billion a year or more, thanks to an affluent population and the proximity to Asia's wealthy gamblers. 
Analysts say that Akimoto's arrest may add to the negative images that many Japanese people have of casinos, and also weigh on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who is fighting allegations of using party funds to entertain supporters, which has hit his public approval rating.

A Turkish delegation traveled to Russia on Monday for talks on Syria, following reports that Russian-backed attacks there were forcing tens of thousands more Syrians to flee toward Turkey.
Turkish Presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said on Tuesday that Russia would work to stop attacks in the northwestern Syrian region of Idlib after talks with the Turkish delegation in Moscow and that Ankara expected this promise to be kept.
The two sides also discussed Libya after Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said last week his country would not remain silent in the face of ""mercenaries"" such as the Russian-backed Wagner group of private military contractors, supporting Khalifa Haftar's forces there.

Typhoon Phanfone hit the Philippines late on Tuesday with winds of up to 120 kph (75 mph) and gusts of 150 kph, heavy rain and flooding.
More than 58,000 people were evacuated from their homes before the storm, which caused widespread property damage, and more than 15,000 were stranded at ports when ferries were suspended. Scores of flights were canceled.
The fatalities were in the central provinces of Capiz, Iloilo and Leyte, including a 13-year-old boy who was electrocuted, a man killed by a tree branch and another killed in a car accident, the disaster agency said.
The typhoon left the Philippines on Wednesday night and was out over the South China Sea, moving west.

An average of 20 typhoons hit the Philippines each year, with storms becoming fiercer in recent years.

The man, Wei Wei, had committed the murders in mid-2003 with two accomplices who were also Chinese nationals, media reported.
The other two fled to China and were arrested there. One was executed in China in 2005 and the other received a life sentence, media said.
Japan is one of just two Group of Seven advanced nations to retain the death penalty - along with the United States - and an overwhelming majority of the public favors it.

1661,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 26, 2019 12:05AM ET</span>",Blindspot to backlash: India's Modi and party misread the mood,"By Rupam Jain
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government did not anticipate the protests against a new citizenship law that have raged across the country and is now scrambling to control the damage, members of his ruling party said.
In Modi's biggest challenge since taking office in 2014, hundreds of thousands have protested against the law offering citizenship to immigrants from non-Muslim minorities who have fled Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
At least 21 people have died in clashes with police. 
Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders were taken aback by the backlash, some party members told Reuters. They said they had been prepared for some anger from Muslims, but not the widespread protests that have convulsed most major cities for two weeks. 
Now the party and the government are reaching out for help in defusing the crisis to allies and opponents sidelined when the bill passed earlier this month, the sources said.
""I really did not see the protests coming ... not just me, other BJP lawmakers were also unable to predict this kind of anger,"" Sanjeev Balyan, a ruling party legislator and junior federal minister, told Reuters.
While there is no threat to his big parliamentary majority, the 69-year-old Modi's reputation as a master strategist with his finger on the pulse of the people has taken a hit.
Publicly, his government has prioritized development, seeking to make India a $5 trillion economy by 2025. 
But Modi's muscular pro-Hindu platform has also gone down well in a nation that is over 80% Hindu: he won back-to-back national elections with thumping majorities.
Outrage at the citizenship law has been fanned by resentment against the government for following a majoritarian agenda instead of addressing an economic slowdown and loss of jobs.
CITIES CONVULSED 
In a nation with a history pocked with sectarian bloodshed, many Muslims fear the new law - and a planned national citizenship register - could make the minority second-class citizens. 
Students, politicians and rights activists, both Hindus and Muslims, have also taken to the streets, saying Modi is jeopardizing India's secular constitution.
The government denies the citizenship register is imminent and says none of the changes will affect existing citizens.
Three other BJP lawmakers and two federal ministers, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they were mobilizing party supporters from all walks of life to start community dialogues and dispel discontent over the law and the register.
""I believe that the political math behind the clearance of this law was not taken into account,"" said one of the federal ministers, an apparent reference to lack of consultation with allies and opposition parties.
Home Minister Amit Shah, widely seen as the second most powerful man in the country, repeated in a television interview on Tuesday that Muslims had no cause for worry.
""We are all in damage control mode,"" said the other federal minister, adding that the BJP and hardline Hindu allies have launched a campaign to explain that the law is not discriminatory.
The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), which is the ideological parent of the BJP, has also launched a movement across urban slums to counter opposition to the bill.
""The violent protests are not because the people were not properly informed about the new law, but because they were intentionally wrongly informed by forces with vested interests,"" Manmohan Vaidya, a senior RSS leader, told Reuters.
""AUTOCRATIC STYLE""
Analysts say various reasons for discontent were coalescing.
""It's evident that people are protesting against the law and also venting against Modi's autocratic style of leadership,"" said Sanjay Kumar, director of research institute the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies.
""The economic crisis gives further incentive ... I don't see these protests fading very soon."" 
When Modi, a veteran politician and son of a tea seller, came to power five-and-a-half years ago, he promised growth, jobs and development. But he was criticized for haphazard tax reform and shock demonetization of high value currency notes in his first term - which contributed to an economic slowdown - as well as intolerance for dissent and ignoring anti-Muslim hate crimes.
Nevertheless, he was re-elected with an even stronger majority earlier this year after a strong response to a security standoff with old foe Pakistan.
In August, Modi's government withdrew semi-autonomous privileges for Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state, and downgraded it to a federally-ruled territory.
In November, the Supreme Court ruled that a Hindu temple could be built at a site where a right-wing mob tore down a 16th-century mosque in 1992, one of India's most divisive disputes. The government welcomed the decision. 
Then came the citizenship law.
""I feel they can't create jobs and hence they are passing such a disturbing law,"" said Ghanshyam Tiwari, a student protesting in the city of Lucknow this month. 
The protests are backed by the opposition Congress party, which has dominated Indian politics for most of the 72 years since independence but was soundly beaten in the last two national elections. It said the gloves were off between secular India and Modi's hardline Hindu agenda.

""For the first time in India's history a law has been framed on the basis of religion,"" Prithviraj Chavan, a senior Congress leader, told Reuters. ""The ruling party's strategy to make India a Hindu-first nation has backfired.""

Since Monday, Mexico has accused Bolivia of ramping up police presence outside its embassy and intimidating diplomats.
The spat follows a chill in relations after Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador last month gave political asylum to former Bolivian president Evo Morales, a fellow leftist. 
Mexico's Foreign Ministry said it called a meeting for Thursday so that the Bolivian charge d'affaires can ""explain the behavior of Bolivian authorities,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
It added that nine people are being housed in diplomatic facilities in Bolivia under Mexico's protection.
In a letter to Bolivia's Foreign Ministry dated Tuesday, the Mexican embassy said the number of police officers surrounding its facilities had been increasing since November and that it detected surveillance drones over diplomatic buildings.

""More than protecting these sites and Mexican diplomatic personnel... they intimidate those staff and disrupt the peace and dignity of this diplomatic representation,"" said the letter, released on Wednesday evening.

""Hong Kongers are more united this Christmas (than) in previous years,"" said Glory, the 31-year-old owner of Kwong Wing Catering, as he dished out noodles, fried chicken, and pasta from silver trays. 
""Actually there is no Christmas atmosphere (this year), but there is a strong sense of unity,"" he said. All of the food on offer on Wednesday was free and prepared by the restaurant or donated by several sponsors.
Outside the eatery, hundreds of customers, many of them off-duty protesters, waited in line as tourists and other shoppers crowded the popular Tsim Sha Tsui area.
Jeanette, a 22-year-old university student, slurped bubble tea and pudding with her friend Yoyo as they discussed their holiday plans.
They would normally spend Christmas with their families, but felt this year had to be different. Both women said they had been involved in peaceful protests since the summer.
""We're all family now,"" said Jeanette, looking around at all of the other supporters eating around her.
""We're here because we want to support this shop, which has supported so many teenagers and protesters on the front line,"" said Yoyo between mouthfuls of pudding.
Kwong Wing Catering is one of many businesses that are part of the so-called ""yellow economy"" across Hong Kong that are known for their support of the pro-democracy campaign. Colorful post-it notes with words of support from customers decorated the restaurant's windows.
One of the chefs scheduled to cook at the eatery became a sort of folk hero after cooking for besieged student protesters at Polytechnic University in November.
He was supposed to cook for his supporters on Wednesday, but was arrested by police earlier in the week, according to the restaurant's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. It was not immediately clear why the chef had been arrested.
Hong Kong has been embroiled in anti-government protests since June which show no signs of abating.
Black-clad protesters marched through Christmas-decorated shopping malls across Hong Kong on Wednesday as police fired tear gas and pepper spray to disperse crowds.
The protesters are angry about what they see as an encroachment by China on the wide ranging autonomy Hong Kong was guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" framework which governs the former British colony.
China rejects such complaints.
Ivan, a 20-year-old university student, said he waited for an hour and a half to receive his hot meal.
""I feel very comforted that someone is willing to cook a meal for us,"" he said, adding that Hong Kong still had a ""festive"" atmosphere despite the protests and clashes with police.
""I just got tear-gassed yesterday so I think it's very special."""

(Reuters) - Police in High Point, North Carolina, searched for clues and suspects on Wednesday in a spate of shootings that have left two people dead and seven others wounded over two days, including a Christmas Eve drive-by attack outside a strip mall.
Tuesday afternoon's burst of gunfire from a passing car on a group of about a dozen people gathered in a parking lot outside the shopping strip sent six men to the hospital, three of them initially listed in critical condition, police said.
By Wednesday, all six victims were listed in stable condition, but investigators had yet to identify any suspects or the vehicle involved, High Point Police Department Captain Chris Weisner told Reuters.
Even the gender of the two individuals in the car - a driver and passenger - remained uncertain, he said.
In addition, Weisner said, investigators were looking into the possibility that Wednesday's drive-by attack was connected to a separate shooting the night before in which one of two victims, a man aged 27, died the next day.
""There's no known connection, but they're looking to see if there is a link"" between the two shootings, the police captain said, adding that no arrests had been made in either incident.
A third shooting that killed an 18-year-old victim early on Christmas Eve is believed to be an isolated incident, according to Weisner. He said ""some arrests"" were made in that investigation on Wednesday but declined to give further details.
Weisner acknowledged that the flurry of gun violence was unusual in such ""a short time frame"" for High Point, a municipality of about 112,000 people that lies between Winston-Salem and Greensboro in the Piedmont Triad region of North Carolina.
High Point, long known as a manufacturing hub in the state's once-vibrant furniture industry, has been hit hard economically over the past two decades by competition from abroad and from elsewhere in the United States.

The Arakan Army rebels said Buthidaung National League for Democracy (NLD) Chairman Ye Thein, the most senior civilian official to die in the growing insurgency, was killed on Monday in an attack on the rebels by Myanmar's army. There was no independent confirmation.
The incident underscored the increasing loss of government control in a region which came to world attention when 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled to Bangladesh to escape an army crackdown on a different rebel group in 2017.
The Arakan Army said its positions had come under attack from Myanmar's army.
""Due to big explosions, some detainees died and some were wounded. The NLD chairman from Buthidaung, Ye Thein, died on scene,"" the Arakan Army said in the statement. It said he had been taken prisoner on Dec. 11.
Tens of thousands of people have been displaced in Rakhine since clashes between the Arakan Army and the army began around a year ago.
The insurgents, whose forces are from the largely Buddhist Rakhine people, are fighting for greater autonomy.
The say they have no links to the Rohingya rebel group whose attacks sparked the 2017 army crackdown that led to the accusations of genocide brought against Myanmar at the International Court of Justice by The Gambia.
The Arakan Army is among several ethnic armed factions that have said they support the case against Myanmar.
Suu Kyi, Myanmar's de facto ruler, personally led Myanmar's defense against the accusations at hearings in The Hague earlier this month.
The army made no comment on the report of the NLD official's death. NLD party spokesman Myo Nyunt said it was the responsibility of the Arakan Army."

Unauthorized public assemblies and protests over political situations in other countries are banned in Singapore.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski said she was ""disturbed"" by the Senate leader's approach to working with White House counsel on the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, saying there should be distance between the two.
The comments by the Alaska lawmaker come after Mitch McConnell, majority leader of the Republican-led Senate, said during a Fox News interview earlier this month that he was working in ""total coordination"" with the White House on the upcoming trial.
""To me it means that we have to take that step back from being hand-in-glove with the defense,"" Murkowski said in comments aired late on Tuesday during an interview with Alaska-based NBC news affiliate KTUU-TV. ""I heard what leader McConnell had said. I happened to think that has further confused the process.""
Murkowski, who says she remains undecided in how she will vote in the upcoming impeachment proceedings, cited the need for distance between the White House and the Senate on how the trial should be conducted.
Trump was impeached last week by the Democratic-led House of Representatives on two charges over his pressuring Ukraine to announce an investigation of former Vice President Joe Biden, one of the top contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Biden's son. He has been charged with abuse of power and obstructing Congress' investigation. 
Trump has said he did nothing wrong.
Republicans have a 53-seat majority in the Senate, where 51 votes are needed to pass a set of rules for the Trump trial. The actual impeachment trial in the Senate would need a two-thirds majority vote for a conviction.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has not yet transmitted the articles of impeachment to the Senate, a bid to pressure Senate Republicans to reach an accord with the Democrats in the chamber on trial rules. McConnell said the Senate could not take any action until it receives the articles.
Whether or not to call witnesses has been one of the main sticking points between the Democrats and the Republicans in drafting rules for the impeachment proceedings. McConnell on Monday said that Republicans had not ruled out hearing witnesses in the impeachment trial the Republican president.
However, McConnell made clear he would not accede to a Democratic request for the Senate to agree ahead of time to take testimony during the trial. 

There is little chance Trump will be convicted and removed from office through a trial in the Republican-led Senate, but the impeachment proceedings could resonate at the ballot box in November.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian Education Minister Lorenzo Fioramonti told Reuters on Wednesday he had resigned after failing to obtain from the government billions of euros he said were needed to improve the country's schools and universities.
The resignation is a blow to the embattled government, whose ruling parties are at odds on issues ranging from euro zone reform to migrant rights.
It also underscores the problems of the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, Fioramonti's party, which is trying to reorganize amid widespread internal dissatisfaction with its leader Luigi Di Maio. 
Fioramonti told Reuters he had tendered his ""irrevocable resignation"" to Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte in a letter on Dec. 23. 
This month three 5-Star senators jumped ship to join the right-wing League in opposition. 
Fioramonti said shortly after the government of 5-Star and the center-left Democratic Party was formed in September that he would quit unless education spending was raised by 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in the 2020 budget.
Few believed him, even as the budget continued its passage through parliament and it became clear the government had little intention of hiking taxes or cutting spending to find the funds he demanded. The budget was approved on Monday ahead of a Dec. 31 deadline.
""It shouldn't be a surprise to anyone that a minister keeps his word,"" Fioramonti told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday.
Fioramonti said he would still support the government in parliament, where he is a lower house deputy.
Italy spends 3.6% of gross domestic product on primary to university education, compared with an average of 5% among 32 countries in a report by the Organisation of Economic Cooperation and Development. As a proportion of public spending, Italy came bottom in the OECD.
Fioramonti, a former economics professor at South Africa's Pretoria University, has been one of Italy's most outspoken ministers during his three months in office.
His proposals for new taxes on airline tickets, plastic and sugary foods to raise funds for education were attacked by critics who said Italians were already over-taxed.
A vocal supporter of green policies, Fioramonti made headlines when he announced Italy would next year become the first country to make it compulsory for schoolchildren to study climate change and sustainable development.
Earlier this month he said Italian energy giant  ENI  (MI:ENI) should halt oil exploration and focus on renewable energy.
""I have sometimes felt I could have had more support from my own party over my proposals on the environment,"" Fioramonti said. 
""5-Star was born 10 years ago with a strongly green platform, but it seems to have got lost along the way.""

The Israeli military confirmed the launch against Ashkelon, which is 12 km (7.5 miles) from the coastal Palestinian enclave, and said the rocket was shot down by an Iron Dome air defense interceptor. 
There was no immediate claim of responsibility in Gaza, which is under the control of Hamas Islamists and where a smaller armed faction, Islamic Jihad, exchanged fire with Israel during a two-day surge of violence last month.
Israeli TV stations showed Netanyahu, who is campaigning to keep the helm of the conservative Likud party in an internal election on Thursday, being escorted off a stage by bodyguards. The reports said he was taken to a shelter after sirens sounded. 
It was the second such incident after a September appearance by Netanyahu in the nearby town of Ashdod was briefly disrupted by a rocket siren. 
Israel sparked the November fighting in Gaza by assassinating Baha Abu Al-Atta, an Islamic Jihad commander it accused of ordering the launch against Ashdod.
""He (Al-Atta) is no longer around,"" a video circulated on social media showed a smiling Netanyahu saying after he retook the stage in Ashkelon, to cheers from onlookers. 
In a veiled threat to retaliate for Wednesday's attack, he added: ""Whoever tried to make an impression just now should pack his bags."" 
While Netanyahu is widely expected to retain Likud's leadership, he faces a tough battle ahead of a March general election in Israel - its third in a year, after he and his centrist rival Benny Gantz failed to secure majorities in two previous ballots. Netanyahu's standing has been dented by an indictment on corruption charges that he denies.
Netanyahu's failure to stem attacks from Gaza has been invoked by his political rivals. 
""The situation in which Israeli citizens live at the mercy of terrorists and the prime minister of Israel is unable to tour parts of his country is a badge of shame on the security policy in the south - and a loss of deterrence that no sovereign country can accept,"" Gantz, a former military chief, said in a statement on Wednesday.

Moscow says Washington has deliberately delayed issuing visas to Russian officials traveling to the U.N. headquarters, a move Russia has said could further damage strained relations.
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement that some Defence Ministry officials who were due to travel to the U.N. secretariat had to wait ""months"" for visa clearance.

(Reuters) - Molotov cocktails were thrown at the headquarters of Brazilian comedy group Porta dos Fundos in Rio de Janeiro on Christmas Eve, weeks after the group launched a film on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) depicting Jesus as gay. 
The group's Christmas special, ""The First Temptation of Christ,"" a 46-minute comedy that portrays Jesus bringing home his presumed boyfriend Orlando to meet the Holy Family, prompted around 2 million people to sign a petition calling on the streaming service to remove the show because it offended Christians.
The sketch group said a security guard managed to contain the fire at its headquarters and no one was hurt.
State police in Rio did not immediately respond to a request for comments. Netflix declined to comment.
""In the early morning of December 24, on Christmas Eve, the headquarters of Porta dos Fundos was the victim of an attack. Molotov cocktails were thrown at our building,"" the comedy group, which won an International Emmy for its holiday special last year, said on Twitter.
""We will move on, more united, stronger, more inspired and confident that the country will survive this storm of hatred and love will prevail alongside freedom of speech,"" the comedians said, adding that video footage from security cameras had been handed to the authorities.
Brazil is home to the world's largest Catholic community as well as a fast-expanding evangelical community with increasing political influence.
President Jair Bolsonaro, who has described himself as a ""proud"" homophobe, once told an interviewer he would rather have a dead son than a gay son. Earlier this year he suspended funding for a series of films, including a handful with LGBT+ themes. The decision was later struck down by a federal court.
His son, Eduardo Bolsonaro, recently called Porta dos Funds' Christmas special ""garbage"" on his Twitter account, saying the filmmakers ""do not represent Brazilian society.""

The anti-crime package, which was approved by Brazil's Senate earlier this month, toughens laws to tackle corruption, organized crime and violent crime practiced by criminal gangs. It also simplifies sentencing in some cases.
The package was a major promise by Bolsonaro, a former army captain who surged to power last year on a campaign vowing to end years of corruption and spiraling violent crime. Brazil has the world's highest number of murders.
""The final text that has been sanctioned by the President brings progress to the anti-crime legislation in the country,"" Justice Minister Sergio Moro said in a statement early on Wednesday.
Moro, a former judge who made his name jailing scores of Brazil's business and political elite in the ""Operation Car Wash"" investigation during the past five years, said Bolsonaro adopted several vetoes suggested by the Ministry of Justice.
Among the vetoes by the right-wing president was a provision to triple the sentence when a crime is committed or displayed in social networks.
The bill eliminates the restriction on the collection of genetic material only in cases of willful crime committed against life, sexual freedom or sexual crime.
Bolsonaro, who ran on a law-and-order platform, won support from Brazilians tired of the warring drug gangs that have come to terrorize large swaths of the country."

Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, has kept a low profile since he stepped down from royal duties last month in the wake of a scandal over his friendship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
He was filmed walking along a path with his brother Prince Charles to St Mary Magdalene church near the Queen's estate in Sandringham, eastern England in time for a 9 a.m. service. 
He did not join other members of the family when they walked to the 11 a.m. service - one of the staples of the royal calendar.
British media reported that Andrew had made a personal decision to miss the main service and instead stayed in the house with his father, Prince Philip. Buckingham Palace declined to comment. 
Philip, 98, whose official title is the Duke of Edinburgh, was only discharged from hospital on Tuesday where he was being treated for what Buckingham Palace described as a pre-existing condition..
The queen attended both services, Sky News and other media outlets reported. Dressed in a bright red outfit, the queen arrived in a car accompanied by her daughter-in-law Camilla, the wife of Prince Charles, for the 11 a.m. service.
Palace staff say the 93-year-old queen will use her Christmas address to the nation later in the day to stress the value of harmony and reconciliation after a ""bumpy"" year for her own family.
Over the past 12 months, her husband received a police warning for his involvement in a car crash, grandsons Princes William and Harry publicly fell out and Andrew became more entangled in the furor over his links to Epstein.
Andrew has denied an accusation by a woman who said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including the prince, when she was 17.
Epstein, who had been charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls, committed suicide in jail in August.
Charles, 71, also attended the 11 a.m. service. 
Charles' elder son, Prince William was present with his wife Kate and two of their children - Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
After the service ended, the four stopped to talk to crowds who had gathered near the church. George, 6, and Charlotte, 4, who attended the Christmas Day service for the first time, received gifts from well wishers.

1677,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2019 09:49AM ET</span>",Turkey-Libya maritime deal rattles East Mediterranean,"By Luke Baker, Tuvan Gumrukcu and Michele Kambas
LONDON/ANKARA/ATHENS (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan paid a surprise visit to Tunisia on Wednesday to discuss cooperation for a possible ceasefire in neighboring Libya, where Ankara supports the internationally recognized government.
The visit comes after Turkey signed an accord with Libya's internationally recognized government last month that seeks to create an exclusive economic zone from Turkey's southern Mediterranean shore to Libya's northeast coast.
Ankara says the deal aims to protect its rights under international law, and that it is open to signing similar deals with other states on the basis of ""fair sharing"" of resources.
Greece and Cyprus, which have long had maritime and territorial disputes with Turkey, say the accord is void and violates the international law of the sea. They see it as a cynical resource-grab designed to scupper the development of East Mediterranean gas and destabilize rivals.
Greece has expelled Libya's ambassador to Athens and filed a complaint with the United Nations. Cyprus, where the northern part of the island is held by Turkey, has raised its own objections. At a Dec. 12 summit, EU leaders issued a statement ""unequivocally"" siding with member states Greece and Cyprus.
Egypt and Israel, which have invested heavily in energy exploration in the region, are alarmed by the Turkey-Libya move, which may threaten their ability to export gas to Europe. Egypt has called it ""illegal and not binding"", while Israel has said it could ""jeopardize peace and stability in the area"".
Following are some questions and answers looking at why Turkey and Libya struck their deal, the impact it could have on the region, and the shadow it casts over East Med gas.
WHAT'S THE MOTIVATION FOR TURKEY AND LIBYA?
Turkey has had disputes with Greece over islands in the Aegean for decades, and with the Republic of Cyprus over the island's maritime waters since 1974, when Turkish troops invaded the north after a brief Greek-Cypriot coup.
In striking the deal with Libya, analysts say Ankara has essentially put both Greece and Cyprus on immediate watch, showing it is prepared to act tough to get its way and/or force new negotiations over their long-standing disputes.
At the same time Turkey has thrown a spanner into the works of efforts by Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Egypt to develop East Mediterranean gas, putting a barrier across a proposed pipeline that would run from Israeli and Greek-Cypriot waters to the Greek island of Crete, on to the Greek mainland and into Europe's gas network via Italy. The $7-9 billion pipeline would have to cross the planned Turkey-Libya economic zone.
Analysts say Turkey has effectively sent a message that it will not be ignored in the East Mediterranean, isn't going to let EU members access what it sees as its maritime waters, and doesn't want energy exporters like Egypt and Israel gaining leverage over Turkey, a net energy importer and transit state.
For Libya, the motivation is mostly security. The accord was reached with Fayez al-Serraj, head of the Tripoli-based government, who is in conflict with a rival military force in eastern Libya under General Khalifa Haftar. Turkey has promised to step up military and other assistance to Serraj. Libya's eastern-based parliament, which is aligned with Haftar, has rejected the maritime accord.
WHAT DOES THE MOVE MEAN FOR EAST MEDITERRANEAN GAS?
The East Med basin is estimated to contain natural gas worth $700 billion, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. At one point it was regarded as a boon for the region, one that could deliver massive revenue, help forge a resolution to the Cyprus dispute and build closer ties between Israel and its neighbors.
But the key to unlocking the gas's value is exports and there's no easy way to do that. The proposed pipeline is costly and would run 3,000 meters deep in parts. The Turkey-Libya deal adds another obstacle to making it achievable. While there are precedents for pipelines crossing other countries' exclusive economic zones, Turkey won't make it easy. What's more, Ankara will use the deal to step up its claims to explore for energy in waters off Cyprus, where for months it has sent drilling ships, and in recent days flown exploration drones.
Analysts already had doubts about the viability of East Med gas because of the export difficulties and the price it would ultimately be delivered at, with Europe awash with cheaper gas from Russia and Qatar. The Turkey-Libya move only further complicates that difficult picture.
""In terms of geopolitics and East Mediterranean gas, this is a big deal,"" said Kadri Tastan, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. ""Turkey is making a big move to try to force negotiations on a number of issues. It's going to be very hard to resolve.""
WHAT ARE THE WIDER REPERCUSSIONS?
As well as putting Turkey on a collision course with Greece and Cyprus, it ratchets up tensions between Ankara and the EU, adding to ongoing disputes over migration policy and wider questions over Turkey's role in NATO.
It also raises the stakes with Egypt, which has been at odds with Turkey since the Egyptian military overthrew Islamist President Mohamed Mursi in 2013. Many of Mursi's Muslim Brotherhood backers now make their home in Turkey. In Libya, Egypt is more closely aligned with Haftar, meaning Cairo and Ankara are on opposite sides over the maritime deal.
Israel has been more circumspect over the Turkey-Libya move. One reason, analysts suggest, is that if the Israel-Cyprus-Greece-Italy pipeline becomes unviable, Israel may have to explore ways of exporting gas via Turkey instead. While Israel-Turkey relations have soured in recent years, trade remains strong and they regard each other as strategic partners. Israel will soon send some gas to Egypt to convert into Liquified Natural Gas for reexport, so relies less on Greece and Cyprus.
Russia is another piece in the puzzle. While it and Turkey are at odds over Syria, they coordinate on energy policy, and Moscow is keen for Turkey to transship energy. But the Turkey-Libya deal also puts them on opposite sides in Libya, where Russia leans towards Haftar. Russia and Turkey will discuss Libyan military support at a summit next month."

The visit comes as Turkey has ramped up efforts to strike deals with nations on the Mediterranean, where Ankara has been at odds with Greece over resources off the coast of the divided island of Cyprus. 
Last month, Turkey signed a maritime delimitation agreement with Libya's internationally recognized government, a move that enraged Greece. Athens says the deal violates international law, but Ankara says it aims to protect its rights in the region and is in full compliance with maritime laws.
In a statement, Erdogan's office said he was accompanied by his foreign and defense ministers, as well as his intelligence chief. It provided no further details on the content or purpose of the talks.
The visit is the first by a head of state to Tunisia since the election of President Kais Saied in October, after Tunisian parliamentary elections.
As part of its expanded cooperation with Tunisia's neighbor Libya, Ankara also signed a military-cooperation deal with Fayez al-Serraj's Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA).
Erdogan has said Turkey may deploy troops in support of the GNA, which has been fighting off a months-long offensive by Khalifa Haftar's forces to the east of the country.
On Tuesday, Presidential Spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said Turkey may need to draft a bill to send troops into Libya and added the parliament was currently working on it. Ankara's possible deployment into Libya has also alarmed Russia, which said it was very concerned by such a prospect.
Turkey has already sent military supplies to the GNA despite a United Nations arms embargo, according to a U.N. report seen by Reuters last month.

1679,By Reuters,"<span>Dec 25, 2019 08:20AM ET</span>","Anti-Kremlin activist forcibly conscripted to Arctic was kidnapped, say allies","By Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny said on Wednesday that the forcible military conscription of one of his allies to a remote air base in the Arctic amounted to kidnapping and illegal imprisonment.
Ruslan Shaveddinov, a project manager at Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, was detained at his Moscow flat on Monday after the door was broken down, the electricity cut, and the SIM card on his mobile phone remotely disabled.
On Tuesday evening, Shaveddinov resurfaced at a remote military base on Novaya Zemlya, a freezing archipelago in the Arctic Ocean some 2,000 km (1240 miles) north of Moscow and the location of a missile air defense unit.
Navalny said Shaveddinov, who had earlier tried to appeal his conscription on medical grounds, had managed to make one phone call on Wednesday using someone else's phone.
He said he had been told he would not be allowed to have a mobile phone during his one year of military service and said another soldier had been assigned to accompany him at all times to watch what he was doing.
Navalny said lawyers for Shaveddinov would be challenging his conscription and would argue he had been illegally kidnapped and imprisoned.
""Serving in the army has simply turned into a way of locking people up,"" Navalny wrote on social media.
Opposition activists likened Shaveddinov's treatment to the way in which Tsarist Russia and the former Soviet Union sent political opponents to far-off corners of what is the world's largest country by territory.
Shaveddinov was part of Navalny's unsuccessful campaign to run against Vladimir Putin for the presidency in 2018, worked as a TV presenter for Navalny's online channel, and helped manage projects at Navalny's foundation which specializes in publishing corruption investigations into state officials and managers.
Valentina Melnikova, head of the Union of Soldiers' Mothers' Committees, told Reuters she had serious doubts about the way Shaveddinov had been treated.
""This is definitely illegal,"" she said.
But Colonel Maxim (NASDAQ:MXIM) Loktev, the deputy military commissar for Moscow, told the TASS news agency that Shaveddinov had dodged mandatory conscription for a long time and that a court on Monday had ruled his conscription legal.
One year's military service is mandatory in Russia for all male citizens aged 18–27, with some narrow exceptions.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Shaveddinov's treatment looked legal if he'd been a draft dodger.

""If he evaded conscription, he broke the relevant law of the Russian Federation,"" said Peskov. ""If he dodged conscription and was conscripted in this way then everything was done strictly in accordance with the law.""

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Thousands of Algerians gathered on Wednesday for the funeral procession of the country's powerful army chief, who fought for independence from France as a young man and this year became the country's de facto leader. 
Lieutenant general Ahmed Gaed Salah died suddenly of a heart attack on Monday aged 79, having determined the secretive state's response to mass protests throughout this year calling for a wholesale change of the ruling elite.
""He did the right thing when he secured the millions who marched in the past 10 months demanding change,"" said Abdesselam Selami, 52, a telecoms worker speaking to Reuters by phone from the capital's Palais de Peuple. ""Zero killed."" 
As the protests reached their peak in April, Gaed Salah called for the veteran president, his longtime ally Abdelaziz Bouteflika, to step down, prompting his resignation soon after. 
Although an interim president was appointed, Gaed Salah was widely seen as holding the reins. He did not attempt to crush the peaceful protests with violence, but many demonstrators saw him as the main obstacle in their path. 
He pushed for an election to replace Bouteflika, a vote the protesters regarded as a charade as the real power would remain with the army.
They chanted ""A civilian state, not a military state"" and, as the protest wore on, demanded the resignation of Gaed Salah. 
After Abdelmadjid Tebboune was elected president, he brought Gaed Salah onto the stage where he was sworn in before embracing him and presenting him with an order of merit. 
The old general died four days later and Tebboune swiftly appointed Said Chengriha, head of the land forces and at 74 of the same generation as Gaed Salah, to replace him. 
Chengriha, like Gaed Salah and most of Algeria's other rulers since independence, is a veteran of the guerrilla war against French rule. 
Though protesters have demanded that the old guard of rulers quit power, they have also throughout their demonstrations painted themselves as the successors to the generation which won freedom for Algeria. 
Gaed Salah's body will be driven through the center of Algiers and buried in a main graveyard after Wednesday's noon prayer.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis urged the world to let the light of Christmas pierce the ""darkness in human hearts"" that leads to religious persecution, social injustice, armed conflicts and fear of migrants.
In his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) Christmas Day message, the 83-year-old pope called for peace in the Holy Land, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, Venezuela, Ukraine and several African countries caught up in conflicts. 
The common thread of his address to tens of thousands of people in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) and millions watching or listening around the world was that change starts in the hearts of individuals.
""There is darkness in human hearts, yet the light of Christ is greater still,"" Francis said, as he marked the seventh Christmas of his pontificate. 
""There is darkness in personal, family and social relationships, but the light of Christ is greater. There is darkness in economic, geopolitical and ecological conflicts, yet greater still is the light of Christ,"" he said.
Francis singled out the persecution of Christians by militant groups in Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, asking God to console those who suffer for their faith.
On Dec. 1, at least 14 people were shot dead in an attack on a church in eastern Burkina Faso, where an Islamist insurgency has ignited ethnic and religious tensions.
""BRIGHTEN THE DARKNESS""
Francis, who has been scorned by populist politicians because of his defense of refugees and migrants, dedicated a section of his address to their plight.
""It is injustice that makes them cross deserts and seas that become cemeteries. It is injustice that forces them to endure unspeakable forms of abuse, enslavement of every kind and torture in inhumane detention camps,"" Francis said.
This month, Francis called for the closing of migrant detention camps in Libya.
""It is injustice that turns them away from places where they might have hope for a dignified life, but instead find themselves before walls of indifference,"" he said.
Francis said that while there were many huge problems in the world, people did not have to look far to correct injustices. They could make a difference in their own communities as a start to healing all the ""suffering members of our human family"".
""May (God) soften our often stony and self-centered hearts, and make them channels of his love. May he bring his smile, through our poor faces, to all the children of the world: to those who are abandoned and those who suffer violence,"" Francis said.
To underscore his message, the two cardinals Francis chose to join him on the basilica's central balcony were Renato Martino, president emeritus of the Vatican's immigration office, and Konrad Krajewski, the papal almoner who distributes aid to Rome's poor and homeless. 
""Through our frail hands, may he clothe those who have nothing to wear, give bread to the hungry and heal the sick,"" he said, adding that through friendship, everyone could be close to the elderly, the lonely, migrants and marginalized people.

""On this joyful Christmas Day, may he bring his tenderness to all and brighten the darkness of this world,"" he said.

Massoud Bakhtawar, the deputy governor of Farah, said the activists were traveling with six cars from Herat to neighboring Farah on Tuesday evening when their convoy was stopped by the Taliban on a main highway and taken to an unknown location.
Bismillah Watandost, a member of the group, said the activists had planned to travel to various parts of Farah to call for peace and a ceasefire between the warring parties in Afghanistan.
The group, People's Peace Movement, was formed to protest violent attacks after a car bomb exploded at a sport stadium in southern Helmand province last year killing 17 civilians and wounding 50 others.
The Taliban insurgents fighting a Western-backed Kabul government now control more territory than at any time since their austere regime was toppled by U.S.-led forces in 2001. A representative for the insurgents was not immediately available to comment.
Since last year, the activists have traveled to various parts of the country, often marching through Taliban-controlled areas to demand peace and a ceasefire between the Taliban and Afghan government.
The Taliban have previously accused the activists of being financed by the Kabul government among others, which the group have denied.
Tens of thousands of Afghan civilians, members of security forces and 2,400 U.S. military personnel have been killed in fighting since 2001.

The complaint alleges the party's triangle logo resembles a symbol of the Illuminati, a secret society that conspiracy theorists believe seeks world domination.
The court gave the Future Forward Party 15 days to respond to separate allegations that it had violated laws governing political parties and accepting loans from its party leader.
The Future Forward Party, which came third in the elections, has emerged as the most outspoken voice against the coalition government headed by former military junta chief Prayuth Chan-ocha.
The Election Commission this month recommended the Constitutional Court dissolve the party for infringing laws relating to the government of political parties and accepting loans from its leader.
The party, founded by 41-year-old billionaire Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, borrowed 191.2 million baht ($6.34 million)from its leader to finance operations.
Thai political party law does not bar parties from taking loans, but forbids acceptance of money, assets or interests from questionable sources. Future Forward Party has previously made its loans public and said they will be paid back with interest.
Days after the election panel's recommendation, thousands participated in a rally in Bangkok in support of Future Forward, in the largest demonstration since the coup in 2014.
In November, the court disqualified Thanathorn as a member of parliament for violating election law.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese authorities arrested ruling party lawmaker Tsukasa Akimoto on Wednesday on suspicion of accepting bribes from a company interested in setting up a casino in Japan, Tokyo prosecutors said.
Hours later prosecutors searched the office of a second lawmaker from the ruling Liberal Democratic Party as part of the same investigation, Kyodo news and other Japanese media said, in what appeared to be a widening probe.
The high-profile arrest of a member of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's LDP could harden public opposition to casinos, which have been consistently unpopular despite the government's push to have them running by the early 2020s.
A senior vice minister in the Cabinet Office until October last year, Akimoto oversaw government policy on casinos. He is suspected of receiving 3 million yen ($27,500) in cash and a family holiday worth the equivalent of $6,500 from three suspects despite knowing that their company wanted help with a casino bid, prosecutors said.
The three suspects were also arrested on suspicion of bribery, prosecutors said. No one was available for comment at Akimoto's office, which was raided by prosecutors last week. The lawmaker has repeatedly denied doing anything illegal.
""I have absolutely not taken part in any wrongdoing,"" Akimoto wrote on his official Twitter account earlier on Wednesday, after media reported he was likely to be questioned. ""I will continue to emphasize this point.""
Hours later, prosecutors searched the office of lawmaker Takaki Shirasuka in Chiba, east of the capital, in connection with the probe into Akimoto, Kyodo and public broadcaster NHK said.
Prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment. Officials at Shirasuka's offices in Tokyo and Chiba could not immediately be reached.
NEGATIVE IMAGE
Prosecutors did not name the company whose three employees allegedly tried to influence Akimoto, but public broadcaster NHK and other local media identified it as Shenzhen, China-based 500.Com Ltd, an online sports lottery service provider.
Investor relations representatives for 500.Com did not respond to two requests for comment. The phone number and email for its media relations representative listed on its website did not work. No one was immediately available for comment at the company's main number or customer service departments.
Representatives of four opposition parties said they would submit a bill to abolish the casino in the next session of parliament, public broadcaster NHK said.
The government sees casinos anchoring ambitious ""integrated resorts"" that include shopping outlets and hotels and are aimed at bolstering tourism, tax revenue and local economies.
Japan, which has a shrinking population and economy, is desperate to maintain growth in tourism, particularly after the Tokyo Olympics end next year.
Some analysts have said the casino market could be worth around $20 billion a year or more, thanks to an affluent population and the proximity to Asia's wealthy gamblers. But critics have cited risks of increased gambling addiction and more organized crime.
Akimoto's arrest could add to the negative images the Japanese public holds of casinos, said Hidenori Suezawa, an analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities.
""It may be a blow to some local governments' ongoing campaign to attract casinos,"" he said.
Gambling has traditionally had a seedy image in Japan, with none of the glamor associated with spots like Las Vegas.
""This shakes the foundation of the government's integrated-resort policy,"" Kazuhiro Haraguchi, parliamentary affairs chief for the opposition Democratic Party For the People, told Kyodo.
""If a deputy minister in the Cabinet Office with authority (over the casino issue) used his position to get money, it would be outrageous.""

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis and two other religious leaders sent out an extraordinary Christmas appeal on Wednesday to the leaders of South Sudan to keep their promise to form at least a transitional unity government early next year.
The brief message was signed by Francis, worldwide Anglican leader Archbishop Justin Welby, and Rev. John Chalmers, former moderator of the Church of Scotland.
The country, the world's youngest, is mostly Christian, and a stable peace would allow the pope to visit, something which he has said he hopes to do next year.
In the message, the three religious leaders said they were praying for ""a renewed commitment to the path of reconciliation and fraternity"".
Last month, President Salva Kiir and former rebel leader Riek Machar delayed forming a unity government for 100 days beyond the Nov. 12 deadline, which itself was an extension of an original deadline last May.
They agreed to form a transitional unity government if they fail to resolve all their differences before the end of February.
The religious leaders said they wanted to show the political leaders ""our spiritual closeness as you strive for a swift implementation of the Peace Agreements"".
The message is extraordinary because on Christmas day, the pope usually combines peace appeals in his ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) address.
Last April, weeks before the original deadline, the religious leaders brought Kiir, Machar and other politicians to the Vatican for a retreat.
In a dramatic gesture on the last day of the retreat, Francis knelt at the feet of the previously warring leaders as he urged them not to return to a civil war that ended with a shaky peace deal in 2018.

Sudan, which is predominantly Muslim, and the mainly Christian south fought for decades before South Sudan gained independence in 2011.

The two turned themselves in on Dec. 20 and are now out on bail, Internal Security Operations Command spokesman Pramote Prom-in said. He gave no details about the victims.
""There will be an investigation and we will follow the legal procedures,"" he said.
The charges come months after a nationwide furor over the death in a separate case of Abdulloh Esormusor, a suspected insurgent who fell into a coma after interrogation at an army camp. The Thai military rejected allegations of torture and urged the public to wait for the result of an official inquiry.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen urged parliament on Wednesday to have more discussion on a proposed anti-infiltration bill which the government says is needed to combat Chinese influence and has been condemned by the main opposition and Beijing.
The legislation is part of a years-long effort to combat what many in Taiwan see as Chinese efforts to influence politics and the democratic process on the island. China claims Taiwan as its territory, to be brought under Beijing's control by force if necessary.
Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP) has begun a renewed push for the legislation, ahead of presidential and parliamentary elections on Jan. 11, and it could be passed before the end of the year.
Taiwan's main opposition party, the Kuomintang, which favors close ties with China, has condemned the proposed legislation as a ""political tool"" of Tsai and her DPP to gain votes while trying to paint them as Chinese Communist Party agents.
Speaking at a policy presentation on live television, Tsai said other democracies around the world had either already passed or were looking at passing such legislation to prevent Chinese interference in their internal affairs.
""Compared to these countries, Taiwan is more directly confronted with various threats and infiltration from China,"" said Tsai.
But some people at home think this ""democratic protection net"" is a provocation and akin to martial law, she added. 
""I think this is a very negative and undesirable view.""
Those who have concerns about the law need to detail exactly what those concerns are and not just sprout empty phrases against it, Tsai said.
People can have a thorough discussion on this in parliament, she added.
""I believe that in the Legislative Yuan, as long as everyone sits down and has a good talk, there will be plenty of time and space for everyone to have a thorough discussion.""
Speaking earlier in the day in Beijing, China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office reiterated its opposition to the bill, saying the DPP was trying to ""blatantly reverse over"" democracy and increase enmity.
China has repeatedly denied meddling in Taiwan politics.
The bill was drafted by the DPP and aims to prohibit political activities and funding from ""foreign hostile forces"" - generally viewed as a reference to China.
Parliament is scheduled to vote on the bill next week, a move that has attracted criticism, not only from the opposition Kuomintang. 

Terry Gou, founder of Apple (O:AAPL) supplier Foxconn (TW:2317) and Taiwan's richest man, told a Taiwan television station on Tuesday that he would protest himself outside parliament if the DPP rushes through the legislation.

Typhoon Phanfone, rated category 2 by Tropical Storm Risk, was packing maximum sustained winds of 120 km per hour (75 miles per hour) with gusts up to 150 kph when it made landfall in the eastern province of Samar on Tuesday, weather and disaster officials said.
More than 4,000 people have been evacuated in the Eastern Visayas region of the central Philippines, disaster officials said, although no deaths have been reported.
Images posted by Paul Cinco, a resident of Tanauan, Leyte province, showed strong gusts and damage caused overnight.
""The aftermath of course made us sad because it's Christmas Day, but it doesn't feel like Christmas, but we're blessed to be safe...no major devastation or casualties reported,"" he said.
More than 20,000 passengers and 157 vessels were stranded in ports on Wednesday, and at least 60 domestic flights have been canceled. Local media reported that 100 homes in the path of the storm were destroyed overnight.
An average of 20 typhoons cross the Philippines each year, with storms becoming fiercer in recent years. More than 6,000 people died and 200,000 homes destroyed when Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest-ever storm to make landfall in the Philippines, hit the central islands of Leyte and Samar six years ago.
Phanfone, which gained strength as it barreled through the central region, is expected to exit the country on Thursday."

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian firefighters used cooler conditions on Christmas Day to try and contain bushfires ahead of hot, dry weather later in the week, as leaders and communities thanked them for sacrificing time with their families over the holidays.
In the state of New South Wales (NSW), which saw entire towns devastated by fires over the weekend, state premier Gladys Berejiklian and the head of the NSW rural fire service, Shane Fitzsimmons, attended a breakfast organized by volunteers in the small town of Colo, 90km (55 miles) northwest of Sydney.
""Community volunteers provided food, company, conversation, wrapped presents & hampers to share for crews heading into the field,"" Fitzsimmons tweeted.
""It was just lovely & spirits were high.""
Christmas Day offered cooler conditions in many parts of the country as firefighters, many of them volunteers, spent the day trying to contain blazes.
Intense heat is forecast to return again by the weekend, especially in Australia's south, where temperatures are expected to exceed 40 degrees Celsius (104 Fahrenheit).
The last few months have seen more than 900 homes lost across the dry continent, according to authorities, even though the southern hemisphere summer has not yet reached its mid-point.
The fires have destroyed more than 3.7 million hectares (9.1 million acres) across five states and at least six people have died in NSW and two in South Australia during the bushfire emergency.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison used a Christmas message to thank volunteers for their willingness to spend the day away from their families.
""As we look forward to next year and as we celebrate this Christmas I want to thank all of those who serve our nation,"" Morrison said in a video shared on social media on Wednesday morning.
Morrison has faced sustained political pressure as the bushfires have raged, following his decision to take a family holiday to Hawaii last week and his conservative Liberal-National coalition government's climate policies."

DENVER (Reuters) - A man with a white beard was being held on $10,000 bond for allegedly robbing a Colorado bank and throwing the stolen cash into the air while shouting, “Merry Christmas” to passersby, police and local media reported on Tuesday.
David Wayne Oliver, 65, was arrested at a nearby Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) coffee shop after he held up the Academy Bank in Colorado Springs on Monday afternoon, according to a police report.
Police said the suspect had ""threatened the use of a weapon” and left the bank with an undisclosed amount of cash.
A police spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment, but Colorado Springs television station KKTV reported that eyewitness Dion Pascale recounted Oliver stepped outside the bank and tossed the money “all over the place.”
“He started throwing money out of the bag"" before yelling, ""Merry Christmas,” the TV station quoted Pascale as saying.
Pascale said bystanders retrieved some of the money and returned it to the bank as Oliver walked to the Starbucks, sat down and appeared to be waiting for police to arrest him, KKTV reported.
The Denver Post quoted police as saying “thousands of dollars” remained unaccounted for, adding there was no indication Oliver used a weapon in the heist.

Oliver, pictured in police mug shots with gray-and-white hair and a full white beard, is being held at the El Paso County jail and is set to make his first court appearance on Thursday, jail records showed. It was not clear from the records if he has an attorney.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis led the world's 1.3 billion Roman Catholics into Christmas on Tuesday, urging them not to let the Church's failings lead them away from accepting God's love.
Francis celebrated a solemn Christmas Eve Mass in St. Peter's Basilica for thousands of people as hundreds of others watched on large screens outside.
As is customary on Christmas Eve, the 83-year-old pope weaved his sermon around the spiritual and personal significance of the night that Jesus was born in Bethlehem.
""Christmas reminds us that God continues to love us all, even the worst of us,"" Francis, presiding at the seventh Christmas season of his pontificate, said in his sermon.
""You may have mistaken ideas, you may have made a complete mess of things, but the Lord continues to love you. How often do we think that God is good if we are good and punishes us if we are bad. Yet that is not how he is.""
Without mentioning them specifically, Francis also referred to recent Church troubles, including its attempts to come to grips with continuing sexual abuse scandals around the world and financial irregularities closer to home at the Vatican. 
""Let us contemplate the Child and let ourselves be caught up in his tender love. Then we have no further excuse for not letting ourselves be loved by him,"" Francis said. 
""Whatever goes wrong in our lives, whatever doesn't work in the Church, whatever problems there are in the world, will no longer serve as an excuse. It will become secondary, for faced with Jesus' extravagant love, a love of utter meekness and closeness, we have no excuse,"" he said.
In his latest attempt to confront a sexual abuse scandal, Francis last week announced sweeping changes to the way the Church deals with them, abolishing the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" that previously covered them.
Advocates for the victims of a scandal that has rocked the Church for nearly two decades applauded the move.
On Wednesday, Francis will deliver his twice-yearly ""Urbi et Orbi"" (to the city and the world) message and blessing from the central balcony of St. Peter's Basilica to thousands of people in the square below.

Unlike that on Christmas Eve, the Christmas day message is typically more about the significance of the Christmas message amidst the wars and conflicts of contemporary society.

TIJUANA, Mexico (Reuters) - On a cold rainy day in Tijuana, 30 children of families awaiting possible asylum in the United States piled into a bus for a morning of coloring, storytelling and some holiday cheer before Christmas eve.
The Yes We Can World Foundation mobile classroom provides bilingual education and emotional help as the children's families wait for their asylum cases to be heard - a process that can last months.
""We focus on happiness. We focus on the rights of children and we focus on having a welcoming, safe space where they can just be children,"" said Estefania Rebellon, founder and executive director of the Yes We Can World Foundation. Rebellon said she was overwhelmed when she saw migrant caravans arrive in Tijuana earlier this year and in 2018. Her own family had fled violence in Colombia.
""When I was 10 years old and our family had to migrate from Colombia to the United States and seek asylum... school was the only thing that helped me get through. I knew that school was... a survival mechanism for kids,"" Rebellon said.The mobile classroom stationed outside the Pro Amore Dei (For the Love of God) shelter serves migrant children between the ages of 5 and 15. It is the first of its kind along the southern border.
FRIENDS AND TEACHERS ""When they arrive here, they're a bit afraid. They don't know what to expect,"" said Sandra Rodriguez, one of the three teachers who started working at the school when the program started in July.A 10-year old boy named Jose told Reuters his Christmas wish was, ""I don't want my friends here to change and I want my teachers to be just the way they are.

A third bus will serve children in Ciudad Juarez on the Mexican side of the Texas border early in 2020.A Reuters analysis of government data in October found that since January, the Trump administration has ordered 16,000 migrants under 18 to wait with their families in Mexico for U.S. immigration court hearings.

President Roch Marc Kabore declared two days of national mourning in the west African country in response to the attack.
The incident followed an attack on a mining convoy in November killed nearly 40 people - victims of an Islamist insurgency that has ignited ethnic tensions and rendered large parts of the country ungovernable this year.
Militants attacked a military detachment in Soum province on Tuesday morning. After several hours, troops repelled them and seized a large number of weapons and motorbikes, the army said in a statement.
""As they fled, in a cowardly way the terrorists killed 35 civilians of whom 31 were women,"" the government said in separate statement. It said 80 militants and seven members of the security forces were killed in the earlier fighting.
Burkina was once a pocket of relative calm in the Sahel region, but its homegrown insurgency has been amplified by a spillover of jihadist violence and criminality from its chaotic northern neighbor Mali.
Attacks over the past year have killed hundreds and forced nearly a million people from their homes.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong riot police fired rounds of tear gas at thousands of protesters, many wearing masks and reindeer horns, after scuffles in shopping malls and in a prime tourist district as pro-democracy rallies escalated into Christmas Eve chaos.
Protesters inside the malls threw umbrellas and other objects at police who responded by beating some demonstrators with batons, with one pointing his gun at the crowd, but not firing. 
Some demonstrators occupied the main roads and blocked traffic outside the malls and nearby luxury hotels in the Tsim Sha Tsui tourist district of Kowloon. 
A man was shown on public broadcaster RTHK as falling from the second floor to the first floor of a mall in the rural Yuen Long district as he tried to evade police. He was conscious as he was taken away by paramedics.
There was a heavy police presence into the night in Tsim Sha Tsui with hundreds of officers standing guard on the roads as thousands of Christmas shoppers and tourists, some wearing Santa hats, looked on. A water canon and several armored police Jeeps were parked nearby.
Dozens of protesters started digging up bricks from the roads and set up barricades, as police said in a statement they would deploy ""minimum force to effect dispersal"" and arrest ""rioters"".
Many families with children had congregated in the area to view the Christmas lights along the promenade, the spectacular backdrop of Hong Kong island on the opposite side of the harbor.
The protests in Chinese-ruled Hong Kong, now in their seventh month, have lost some of the scale and intensity of earlier violent confrontations. A peaceful rally this month still drew 800,000 people, according to organizers, showing strong support for the movement.
Scores of black clad, mask wearing protesters chanted slogans including ""Revive Hong Kong, revolution of our time,"" and ""Hong Kong independence"" as they roamed the malls.
""Lots of people are shopping so it's a good opportunity to spread the message and tell people what we are fighting for."" said Ken, an 18-year-old student.
""We fight for freedom, we fight for our future.""
A bank branch of global banking group HSBC was vandalized in Mong Kok, according to television footage. The bank on Friday became embroiled in a saga involving an official crackdown on a fund-raising platform supporting protesters in need.
HSBC denied any link between a police clampdown on the platform, called Spark Alliance, and the earlier closure of an HSBC bank account tied to the group.
Protesters had nevertheless called for a boycott of the bank at its headquarters in the heart of Hong Kong's financial district.
Around 100 protesters also trashed a Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) inside a mall called Mira Place, breaking the glass counters displaying pastries and spraying graffiti on the walls.
The coffee shop chain has been a common target of protesters after the daughter of the founder of Maxim's Caterers, which owns the local franchise, condemned the protesters at a U.N. human rights council in Geneva.
Metro operator MTR Corp said it shut two stations, Mong Kok and Tsim Sha Tsui, early on Tuesday night due to protests in the area. Train services were meant to run overnight on Christmas Eve. 
The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organized some of the biggest marches involving more than a million people, has applied to stage another march on New Year's Day.
Police have arrested more than 6,000 people since the protests escalated in June, including a large number during a protracted, violent siege at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University in mid-November.
Many Hong Kong residents are angry at what they see as Beijing's meddling in the freedoms promised to the former British colony when it returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
China denies interfering and says it is committed to the ""one country, two systems"" formula put in place at that time and has blamed foreign forces for fomenting unrest.
In a video posted on her Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, Chief Executive Carrie Lam wished Hong Kong citizens ""a peaceful and safe Merry Christmas"".

Lam has so far refused to grant protesters' demands which include an independent inquiry into police behavior and the implementation of full universal suffrage.
