MANAGUA (Reuters) - During Nicaragua's devastating civil war in the 1980s, youthful revolutionary Daniel Ortega toured every town in the Central American nation, clad in his green Sandinista uniform.
Now in his second stint as president, the 74-year-old leftist leader has disappeared from public view for nearly a month, raising questions about his health and whereabouts as the world reels from the spread of the coronavirus. 
As in 2014, another time he dropped off the map, his absence has even prompted speculation he may have died.
The government did not respond to a request for comment on the reasons for Ortega's absence, his health or whether he is alive.
However, a government official close to Ortega said he was alive, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Over the years, the former guerilla has suffered two heart attacks and developed high cholesterol and other ailments, said the official. Since then, the president has been increasingly protective of his health, said the source.
Ortega's last public appearance was on March 12, in which he spoke briefly via video from a living room.
""He has always fled from problems; no wonder he is absent in the midst of the coronavirus crisis,"" said Dora Maria Tellez, a former minister in Ortega's first government in the 1980s who later broke with the president.
Ortega also disappeared for several weeks in 1998, after his adopted stepdaughter accused him of abuse, which he denied.
During his current absence, Vice President Rosario Murillo, his wife, has spoken publicly every day, fueling speculation that Ortega will eventually emerge to oversee a campaign to defeat the coronavirus.
So far, Nicaragua has not encouraged social distancing or other measures against the virus, even as neighboring Honduras and nearby El Salvador implement tight restrictions. 
Nicaragua has registered seven coronavirus cases and one related death, but experts question the numbers because the government has not revealed how many tests have been conducted.
Ortega's health has often been a closely guarded secret. Elected president in 1984, Ortega was voted out of office after a single five-year term as the economy floundered. He eventually won re-election and returned to office in 2007.

After orchestrating a constitutional change to allow for re-elections, his current term is due to end in 2022.

The small-scale drill featured infantry units firing mortars at a target, and is the latest in a month of exercises by the North Korean military. 
Some earlier exercises included short-range ballistic missiles, and went ahead despite stringent measures the country has taken to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. 
The drill was held ""to further fortify the country's defence capabilities,"" state news agency KCNA said in a report.
""Sky-high militant spirit and enthusiasm pervade all the sub-units and artillerymen as they took part in the firing drill under the direct guidance of the Supreme Leader,"" the outlet said.
The Supreme People's Assembly (SPA) is due to hold its annual meeting on Friday.
When the parliamentary meeting was announced last month, international observers said it was a sign of confidence by Kim's government that he could gather hundreds of the country's leaders in one place despite the pandemic.

North Korea claims it has no confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, but has said that it continues testing and has more than 500 people in quarantine, according to the World Health Organization.

VAN NUYS, Calif. (Reuters) - A pop-up food pantry in Southern (NYSE:SO) California on Thursday drew so many people that the line of cars waiting for free groceries stretched about a mile (1.6 km), a haunting sign of how the coronavirus pandemic has hurt the working poor.
Hundreds of other people, many wearing trash bags to shelter from the rain, arrived at the one-day grocery giveaway on foot, forming a blocks-long queue in Van Nuys, in the central San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles.
Organizers said they had enough groceries to hand out to more than 2,500 families, with each receiving a 36-pound (16-kg) box of rice, lentils and other staples as well as frozen chicken, oranges and other foods.
""I have six kids and it's difficult to eat. My husband was working in construction but now we can't pay the rent,"" said Juana Gomez, 50, of North Hollywood, as she waited for her turn.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shut down nonessential businesses across the United States, with more than 90% of Americans under some kind of stay-at-home order, depriving millions of a paycheck.
The northeast part of Los Angeles, home to many working poor Latino families, has been especially hard hit.
LA Regional Food Bank supplied the food donated outside Van Nuys City Hall. Its president, Michael Flood, said such giveaways were becoming an increasingly important way to help feed people in need, with ""one or two a day"" being held in different locations in Los Angeles County.
Thursday's food giveaway -- coordinated by Los Angeles City Council President Nury Martinez in partnership with the Los Angeles Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, the Los Angeles Regional Food Bank and Labor Community Services -- was open to anyone in need. 
""This food saves me money because my little income goes to my rent,"" said Daniel Jimenez, 40, an independent contractor for golf tournaments whose young children joined him to pick up food.
""I haven't been working for three weeks. I have a little money saved but I’m paying rent, gas, and cellphone bills. I don’t even know when we’re going back to work,"" he said.
As he spoke, volunteers shouted constant reminders to those who walked up to maintain social distancing. 
""For a lot of people, they are new to the situation of needing help and not knowing where to turn,"" Flood said, noting many people were now suddenly filing for unemployment and government food assistance programs. 

""But that may take some time for them to get those benefits. We want to do what we can to get food in the hands of families, just so they can eat,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iranian-backed militia pose a ""significant"" threat to U.S. forces in Iraq, the State Department's top diplomat for the Middle East said on Thursday, about a week after U.S. President Donald Trump warned of an attack by Iran or its proxies.
David Schenker, assistant secretary of Near Eastern Affairs, did not give details about the threat, but told reporters in a teleconference: ""It continues to be significant.""
Iran-backed paramilitary groups have regularly been shelling bases in Iraq that host U.S. forces, and the area around the U.S. embassy in Baghdad.
On Monday, three Katyusha rockets landed near a district in southern Iraq that houses workers for foreign oil companies, including U.S. oil service company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL). No casualties or damage were reported.
Last week, Trump said Iran or its proxies planned a sneak attack on U.S. targets in Iraq, and warned they would pay a ""very heavy price"" but gave no details.
U.S.-Iranian relations have been bitter since the Islamic Revolution toppled the U.S.-backed shah of Iran in 1979 and ushered in an era of theocratic rule.
While there was a detente with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, relations have deteriorated with Trump's decision nearly two years ago to abandon that international agreement and reimpose U.S. sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.
Worsening tensions, a Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force. It also killed Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who founded Iraq's Shi’ite Kataib Hezbollah militia after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion.
Earlier this week, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States proposed a 'Strategic Dialogue' with Iraq to be held in June, a bid to restore strained bilateral ties.
Schenker, who in March said Washington was ""enormously disappointed"" by Iraq's performance in protecting U.S.-led coalition forces, repeated Washington's concerns.
""It is on the Iraqis - if they value that relationship - to take certain steps and that includes providing protection to the coalition forces who are in Iraq, if they want those forces to remain,"" Schenker said.
On Thursday, Iraq's president named intelligence chief Mustafa al-Kadhimi as prime minister-designate, the third person tapped to lead Iraq in just 10 weeks as it struggles to replace a government that fell last year after months of deadly protests.
Schenker said of Kadhimi: ""If Kadhimi is an Iraqi nationalist, dedicated to pursuing a sovereign Iraq, if he is committed to fighting corruption, this would be great for Iraq, and we think it would be great for our bilateral relationship.""

4,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 05:55PM ET</span>","Canada lifting a freeze on arms exports to Saudi Arabia, opposition wants big deal scrapped","By David Ljunggren
OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada is lifting a freeze on weapons exports to Saudi Arabia and has renegotiated a much-criticized $14 billion contract to sell General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) armored vehicles to Riyadh, Ottawa said on Thursday.
The ""significant improvements"" to the contract would secure thousands of jobs at the U.S. firm's Canadian subsidiary, where the vehicles are being made, Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne said.
The announcement marks a retreat by the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, who said in December 2018 he was looking for a way out of the deal.
A month earlier the government had frozen new permits pending a review. Some exports though continued under permits which had already been issued. 
Human rights groups and political opponents, citing the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and Saudi Arabia's involvement in the Yemen war, had insisted Ottawa scrap a deal agreed by the previous Conservative government in 2014.
Champagne said that under the terms of the renegotiated agreement, Canada could delay or cancel permits without penalty if it discovered Saudi Arabia was not using the vehicles for their stated purpose. Ottawa would also boost its scrutiny of all proposed weapons sales, he added.
""This not a blank check to anyone who wants to export anything to Saudi Arabia,"" he told reporters.
Trudeau had said there would be huge penalties for scrapping the deal but gave no details. Champagne said the penalty clause had potentially been worth the entire value of the deal.
The opposition New Democrats said Ottawa was ""sending armored vehicles to an undemocratic authoritarian regime with a terrible human rights record"" and demanded the deal be scrapped.
""We are troubled by the human rights situation in Saudi Arabia, particularly with women's rights,"" Champagne said.
The agreement was signed despite a diplomatic dispute between the two nations which erupted in August 2018 after Canada criticized Saudi Arabia over human rights.
The General Dynamics plant is based in London, Ontario, an area of relatively high unemployment. The Saudi announcement came the same day Canada reported record job losses amid the coronavirus outbreak.
""As we enter a world of deep economic recession, countries - including Canada - will likely be even less willing to give weight to human rights considerations in decisions over arms exports,"" said Thomas Juneau, an assistant professor and Middle East expert at the University of Ottawa.

""Basically this is good money and we need it.""

5,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 05:15PM ET</span>",Bill would remove U.S. troops from Saudi Arabia in 30 days,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Republican U.S. senator introduced legislation on Thursday to remove American troops from Saudi Arabia, adding pressure on the kingdom to tighten its oil taps to reverse the crude price drop that has hurt domestic energy companies. 
The legislation from Senator Bill Cassidy, of oil-producing Louisiana, would remove U.S. troops 30 days after enactment, a full month faster than similar legislation introduced by two other Republican senators in March.
Cassidy introduced the bill as OPEC+, a production group including Saudi Arabia and others in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies including Russia, closed in on a deal to slash oil output by a record amount of about 15 million barrels, or 15% of global production.
The spread of the coronavirus has crushed crude demand at the same time that Saudi Arabia and Russia have pumped oil flat- out in a race for market share, pushing prices to 18-year lows. 
The extra oil from Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, has made it impossible for energy companies in the United States, the world's top oil and gas producer, to compete, Cassidy said. 
""Withdrawing troops placed to protect others recognizes that friendship and support is a two-way street,"" he said.
Cassidy's bill faces an uphill battle and would have to pass the Senate, the House of Representatives and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law. Still, it was a sign of how Congress could take action against Saudi Arabia if it does not stick to the plan to cut oil output. 
The bill would also place tariffs on imports of oil from Saudi Arabia within 10 days of enactment. The tariff would ensure that the price of oil imports from Saudi Arabia would not be less than $40 a barrel, the bill said. 
Trump has threatened tariffs on oil imports from Saudi Arabia and Russia but has not imposed them amid opposition from powerful energy interests, including the American Petroleum Institute lobbying group. 
The bill would not remove U.S. Patriot missiles or THAAD defense systems, as the previous legislation would.

Congress is out until at least April 20 and possibly longer due to the coronavirus outbreak.

6,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 03:59PM ET</span>","UK PM Johnson leaves intensive care, remains under observation","By Andy Bruce and William James
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson left intensive care on Thursday evening as he continues to recover from COVID-19, but he remains under close observation in hospital, his office said on Thursday. 
Johnson, 55, was admitted to St Thomas' Hospital on Sunday evening with a persistent high temperature and cough, and was rushed to intensive care on Monday where he spent three nights receiving treatment.
""The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery,"" a spokesman from his office said in an emailed statement.
""He is in extremely good spirits.""
Johnson was the first world leader to be hospitalised with the coronavirus, forcing him to hand control of the world's fifth-largest economy to foreign minister Dominic Raab just as Britain's outbreak approaches its most deadly peak.
Raab tweeted that the improvement in Johnson's condition was ""the news we all wanted to hear"". U.S. President Donald Trump described it as ""great news"".
Johnson's ongoing recovery prompted a small rise in the value of sterling against the dollar .
However, the government statement did not give any details on when Johnson may be able to resume leadership, and Raab - speaking before the latest announcement - had stressed the importance of allowing the prime minister to focus on recovery.
No further updates on Johnson's health were expected on Thursday.
Raab is deputising for Johnson during the most stringent shutdown in Britain's peacetime history. 
Earlier he told a news conference it was too early to end the lockdown because Britain had not reached the peak of the outbreak yet.
The UK death toll in hospitals from coronavirus now stands at 7,978, a rise of 881 on the day but a smaller increase than the 938 seen in Wednesday's data. 
GOVERNMENT SPENDING
With Johnson absent and the death toll still mounting, the British government is wrestling with two major issues - how to finance a vast increase in state spending to support the shuttered economy, and when to start easing lockdown measures.
With the economy facing potentially the worst hit since World War Two, the government said it had expanded its overdraft facility with the Bank of England.
The central bank has agreed temporarily to finance government borrowing in response to COVID-19 if funds cannot immediately be raised from debt markets, reviving a measure last widely used during the 2008 financial crisis.
The BoE said it was a short-term measure and both it and government said any borrowing from the Ways and Means facility - effectively the government's overdraft with the Bank - would be repaid by the end of the year.
The government has made pledges costing tens of billions of pounds to support businesses and workers hit by the virus. On Thursday, the government said an additional 1.2 million claims for welfare payments had been filed since March 16. 
Raab said the peak of the virus outbreak had yet to be reached and that the government would not be able to say more about the duration of the lockdown until late next week, once experts have had chance to analyse data on how well it is working. It was introduced last month.
""The measures will have to stay in place until we've got the evidence that clearly shows we've moved beyond the peak,"" he said.
While Johnson's condition was improving, the likely length of his recovery remained unknown, with some political commentators saying there was a power vacuum in his absence.
Raab said on Thursday he had the power to make ""necessary decisions"" in the prime minister's absence and that government will continue to follow the strategy set out by Johnson. He said cabinet could take decisions collectively.
The United Kingdom is entering what scientists say is the deadliest phase of the outbreak, with deaths expected to continue to rise over the Easter weekend.
But in a sign the shutdown measures were working, health officials have said the number of coronavirus infections and hospital admissions had begun to show signs of flattening.

Police said they would be taking tougher action to do just that before the four-day Easter holiday weekend because many people were continuing to ignore the ban on social gatherings.

""The situation is tragic. Hundreds of people, drained after a perilous 72-hour journey. They will spend the night on an overcrowded boat in tense circumstances,"" said Federico Soda, head of the International Organisation for Migration's Libya mission, in a statement.
It was not immediately which countries the migrants were from but Libya is a major way station for migrants attempting to travel from Africa to Europe. 
At least six boats have left Libya this month carrying about 500 people attempting the sea-crossing to Europe, though Italy has declared its ports unsafe due to the coronavirus epidemic.
Officials in Tripoli said the intensity of shelling on Thursday, some of which had previously targeted the port, meant it was not safe for disembarkation, IOM said. 
The IOM is providing them with water and food, it said. A curfew in Tripoli to help stop the spread of the coronavirus is also complicating efforts to bring them off the ship, it added.

8,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Michael Cohen, Trump’s former lawyer, in solitary confinement","By Aram Roston and Mark Hosenball
(Reuters) - Michael Cohen, U.S. President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, has been placed in solitary confinement at a federal prison in New York state where he is serving time for violating campaign finance laws, according to his lawyer and two sources familiar with the matter.
Cohen, 53, was transferred on Wednesday to a Special Housing Unit at Otisville Federal Correctional Institution, a disciplinary section of the prison, the sources said.
Until now, Cohen had been housed in a minimum-security camp at Otisville, which is about 70 miles (110 km) northwest of New York City.
One of the sources said Cohen was placed in solitary after another inmate complained about his internet use. 
“It is my understanding that a verbal dispute over phone use prompted a temporary placement to SHU pending an investigation. I do not however know who prompted the altercation, or if the action taken was factually/ regulatory appropriate,"" Cohen’s lawyer, Roger Adler, said in an email to Reuters. 
A former representative for Cohen, Lanny Davis, declined to comment.
The Federal Bureau of Prisons said it could not comment on the circumstances of individual inmates.
Cohen, who once said he would ""take a bullet"" for Trump, was sentenced to three years in prison in 2018 for directing hush payments to pornographic film star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, who claimed they had affairs with Trump. Trump has denied having the encounters.
In March, Cohen argued that he should be released from prison early because of the coronavirus outbreak and the risk of contracting COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory illness caused by the virus.
U.S. District Judge William Pauley in Manhattan rebuffed the request in a scathing order.
“Ten months into his prison term, it’s time that Cohen accept the consequences of his criminal convictions for serious crimes that had far reaching institutional harms,"" the judge wrote on March 23.
Adler said in an email that he had sent a letter on Tuesday requesting compassionate release for Cohen despite Pauley's order. 
Adler called the disciplinary action a “hiccup” in the process and said he was hopeful that Cohen would be returned to the prison's general population when ""all the facts are known.""

Cohen is eligible for release in November 2021.

9,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 03:10PM ET</span>",Syria dismisses report that it was behind chemical attacks,"AMMAN (Reuters) - Syria on Thursday dismissed a report by a global watchdog that said Syrian jets had carried out a series of chemical attacks on an opposition-held town, under orders from the top military command.
The report from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) said Syrian air force pilots flying Sukhoi Su-22 planes and a helicopter had dropped bombs containing toxic chlorine and sarin nerve gas on the village of Latameneh in the Hama region in March 2017.
Syria's foreign ministry said in a statement that the report, issued on Wednesday, was ""deceptive and included fabricated conclusions, the purpose of which was to distort truths and accuse the Syrian government"".
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and his military backer Russia have both repeatedly denied using chemical weapons, and accuse insurgents of staging attacks to implicate Syrian forces.
The OPCW's Investigation and Identification Team (IIT), whose formation was opposed by Moscow and Damascus, said more than 100 people had been affected by the attacks, carried out on March 24, 25 and 30, 2017.
It said the 50th Brigade of the 22nd Air Division of the Syrian Air Force had dropped M4000 bombs containing sarin on the town, and a cylinder containing chlorine on a hospital.
""Military operations of such a strategic nature as these three attacks only occur pursuant to orders from the highest levels of the Syrian Arab Armed Forces,"" the report added.
OPCW chief Fernando Arias said it was up to the watchdog's members, the U.N. Secretary General and the international community to take any action they deemed necessary.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the OPCW's findings confirmed Syria's continued use of chemical weapons ""and utter disregard for human life"".
""No amount of disinformation from Assad’s enablers in Russia and Iran can hide the fact that the Syrian regime is responsible for numerous #chemicalweapons attacks,"" he tweeted.
Chemical attacks on the Syrian towns of Douma and Khan Sheikhoun led U.S. President Donald Trump to carry out missile strikes on Syrian government targets in April 2018 with the backing of France and Britain. 
In 2013, chemical attacks on the opposition-held Ghouta suburbs around Damascus killed hundreds of civilians, many of them women and children, the deadliest use of chemical weapons in decades. The government denied it was behind the attacks.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - On the day he nearly lost his job for supporting strict social distancing measures, Brazil's health minister took another stand in defiance of President Jair Bolsonaro, refusing to endorse the use of hydroxychloroquine to treat the novel coronavirus.
Bolsonaro and U.S. President Donald Trump have touted the malaria drug as a potential silver bullet in treating the potentially deadly COVID-19 respiratory disease, despite a lack of scientific evidence and concerns about serious side effects.
However, Brazilian Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta is resisting pressure from Bolsonaro to approve the use of the drug for patients at the first signs of illness, including lobbying from outside doctors in the presidential palace. 
The pressure has mounted as public debate about appropriate use of the drug flares in Brazil and around the world. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published and then withdrew this week highly unusual guidance on how to prescribe the medicine in the wake of Trump's advice.
Like most health experts, Mandetta has said the drug should only be given by medical professionals to hospitalized patients, because clinical trials have not shown it is safe and effective against the coronavirus.
Yet on Monday, hours after surviving a combative Cabinet meeting where many expected him to lose his job, Mandetta said he was taken to a room to meet two doctors who favor a much broader use of the medicine.
""They wanted to draw up a protocol to implement the use of hydroxychloroquine by decree,"" Mandetta told a news conference. ""I told them that was super welcome ... but they should first debate the issue with their peers.""
Earlier in the day, Bolsonaro had lunch with the same doctors — immunologist and oncologist Nise Yamaguchi and anesthesiologist Luciano Dias Azevedo — to prepare guidelines for using the drug in mild cases, three government sources said.
At Bolsonaro's request, they presented their proposed guidelines to his chief of staff, who scheduled the meeting with Mandetta that day, said the people with knowledge of the matter, requesting anonymity because the deliberations were not public.
Mandetta refused to endorse the wider use of the drug outside of hospitals. On Tuesday, he said doctors could prescribe the drug for outpatients, but they would have to take responsibility for the risks of their decision.
With an expert consensus, the ministry and the Federal Council of Medicine, which regulates the profession, could then back the idea, but it remains too early to do so, he said.
The presidential press office did not respond to a request for comment for this story.
Bolsonaro said on Wednesday the anti-malaria drug, for which he has waived import taxes, was saving lives. 
'TOXIC' DRUG
Brazil's Federal Council of Medicine warned on March 20 there was nothing conclusive yet that proves the effectiveness and safety of using hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19.
The regulatory body recommended against the ""indiscriminate"" purchase and use of the drug, saying ""self-medication could be a serious health risk"" and lead to shortages of the drug for people it was meant for.
""What we have is a drug that is toxic ... and patients can't just go using it for whatever,"" said Dr. Lessandra  Michelin  (PA:MICP), an infection specialist in southern Brazil's Rio Grande do Sul state.
Michelin said patients at her hospital had been asking for the drug, but she was only using it on those in critical condition without other options. In the five cases she had given the drug, usually as they were put on ventilators, none had shown improvement from taking it.
Yamaguchi told Reuters she is calling, based on still unpublished findings, for hydroxychloroquine to be prescribed along with an antibiotic as soon as patients test positive or show symptoms of the coronavirus.
She said data pending publication on such early treatment by Prevent Senior, a Brazilian health plan focused on elderly care, will show that the drug can slow proliferation of the virus in the body and reduce the chances of death.

Still, she said hydroxychloroquine must be prescribed by a doctor who will take responsibility for the patient's condition and has proposed users sign a consent form due to the untested nature of the treatment and many unknowns about coronavirus.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis presided at a scaled-down Holy Thursday Mass in an empty St. Peter's Basilica, praising ordinary doctors, nurses and priests who risk their lives helping coronavirus victims as ""the saints next door"".
The Mass, which commemorates Jesus' Last Supper with his apostles on the night before he died, usually packs the basilica with up to 10,000 people, including cardinals, bishops, and ordinary faithful.
But because of the coronavirus restrictions, it was said from a secondary altar behind the main one Francis normally uses and attended by only two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir.
They all practiced social distancing - most with a pew to themselves - in Christendom's largest church. The service was broadcast live to the faithful on television and over the internet, which has become the new normal for Easter season services.
Even the traditional foot-washing ritual, which commemorates Jesus' gesture of humility towards his apostles, was eliminated to avoid the possible spread of the virus.
In his improvised homily, Francis praised those, including priests, who he said are risking their lives in helping victims of the coronavirus.
""These days more than 60 (priests) have died here in Italy while taking care of the sick, in hospitals,"" he said. ""Together with the doctors and nurses they are the saints next door."".
More than 18,000 people have died of the coronavirus in Italy, the highest death toll in the world. The number of confirmed cases has topped 143,000, the third highest global tally behind those of the United States and Spain.
More than 100 of the dead in Italy were doctors, according to their federation.
The diplomatic corps would have attended the Mass sitting in the front in full regalia to represent more than 180 countries that have relations with the Vatican.
They instead organized a fund to contribute to a drive by the Italian Bishops Conference to help hospitals in need, according to a statement by the Cypriot and Italian ambassadors.
The pope's scaled-down Holy Week events, which began last Sunday and culminate this Sunday on Easter, were being mirrored around the world in churches where services were also being held without public participation in most countries.

His traditional candlelight Good Friday ""Via Crucis"" (Way of the Cross) procession around Rome's ancient Colosseum also will not be held for the first time in decades. It will be replaced by a mini-version in the small atrium of St. Peter's Basilica.

12,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 02:40PM ET</span>",Child labor still prevalent in West Africa cocoa sector despite industry efforts: report,"By Ange Aboa and Aaron Ross
ABIDJAN (Reuters) - The use of child labor on cocoa farms in top producers Ivory Coast and Ghana has risen over the past decade despite industry promises to reduce it, according to a draft of a U.S. government-sponsored report seen by Reuters. 
More than 2 million children worked in the sector last season in the West African countries that produce about two-thirds of the world's cocoa, according to the draft of a report funded by the U.S. Department of Labor. It is expected to be published later this month.
The level of child labor is higher than in 2010 when companies including Mars, Hershey, Nestle and Cargill pledged to reduce the worst forms of child labor in their West African supply chains by 70% by 2020. 
In terms of the proportion of children from families working in the cocoa sector that are engaged in child labor, that increased to 46% in the 2018/19 season from 44% when the last survey was conducted in 2013/14, the U.S. report showed. The proportion engaged in hazardous labor, such as using sharp tools, stayed steady at 42%. 
Those figures are more than 10% higher than when the first survey was conducted during the 2008/09 season and reveal the difficulty of eradicating child labor from a growing and sprawling sector that provides much-needed livelihoods for thousands of poor communities. 
It may also add to pressure on cocoa traders and chocolate companies, who have faced criticism from U.S. lawmakers for failing to root out child labor from their supply chains. [nL8N2BC4SG]
""This report makes a strong case for understanding child labor and hazardous child labor in cocoa production as a complex problem requiring multiple complementary solutions,"" said the report. 
Elizabeth Akanbombire, the head of the child labor unit at Ghana's employment ministry, said she could not comment on the report since it was not yet public. 
The Ivorian government committee responsible for child labor issues said the numbers in the draft shouldn't be considered final because there were some issues with the methodology that have yet to be resolved to the government's satisfaction. 
Richard Scobey, the head of the World Cocoa Foundation (WCF), an industry group that represents companies including Nestle and Hershey, acknowledged that the industry was not on track to meet its target set in 2010. But he said the report was not complete and he could not yet comment. 
""Government and company programs to reduce child labor have shown significant success,"" he said, pointing to one initiative - the International Cocoa Initiative - that is backed by the chocolate and cocoa industries and civil society and says it has reduced child labor by half where it operates. 
""The challenge now is to scale up these interventions,"" Scobey said.
Nestle referred Reuters to the WCF. Mars and Hershey both said it was too early to discuss the report. Cargill did not immediately respond to requests for comment. 
The report, conducted by researchers at the University of Chicago, is the third in a series of surveys of cocoa farmers called for by an agreement between the industry and U.S. lawmakers first struck in 2001. It was based on a survey of more than 2,000 households. 
It estimated that approximately 2.1 million children in the two countries' cocoa sectors are engaged in child labor, which includes work by under-12s and by older children that is hazardous or exceeds a certain number of hours. 
That is similar to the estimate from the 2013/14 survey, but the report said those two numbers could not be compared because of methodological differences. 
It said rises in the proportion of children working in the sector could be due to increased cocoa prices and production, which have pushed farmers to grow cocoa. 
Cocoa output in Ivory Coast and Ghana rose to about 3 million tonnes last season from around 2.65 million tonnes in 2013/14.

GAZA (Reuters) - Hamas arrested a Palestinian in Gaza on Thursday, saying that he had taken part in a video conference with Israelis and describing his act as ""treason.""
The Gaza interior ministry identified the man as Rami Aman and said that some of his associates, whose details were not disclosed, had also been arrested.
Aman describes himself as a freelance journalist and member of a group called The Gaza Youth Committee on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. The meeting for which he was arrested was held on Monday on the Zoom video conference app. It appears to have been organized by Israeli peace activists, who could not be reached for comment.
An invitation link to a Zoom conference entitled 'Meet Gazan Activists' was posted on a Facebook event page that has since expired. It read: ""Finally, an opportunity to speak with Gazans who not only do not hate us but are working tirelessly to open channel of communication between Gazans and Israelis.""
It also named Rami Aman and his group as participants.
""Holding any activity or any contact with the Israeli occupation under any cover is a crime punishable by law and is treason to our people and their sacrifices,"" Interior Ministry spokesman Eyad al-Bozom said in a statement. 
Aman's family could not be reached for comment and two Gaza-based human rights groups contacted by Reuters said they have not been approached by relatives over his arrest.
Hamas seized control of Gaza in 2007 and has since fought three wars with Israel. Flare-ups along the shared border are relatively frequent. Israel regards Hamas as a terrorist group and keeps Gaza under blockade, saying its aim is to stop weapons from reaching militant groups.
Coronavirus lockdowns have driven a surge in the usage of Zoom in recent weeks because it is free, and users are attracted by its ease of use. But concerns have grown over its lack of end-to-end encryption of meeting sessions, routing of traffic through China and ""zoombombing,"" when uninvited guests crash meetings.
The incident triggered angry comments on social media by Palestinians in Gaza, with many praising Aman's arrest.

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will sing to a Milan cathedral bare of worshippers on Easter Sunday, hoping to bring together people isolated during the coronavirus lockdown in a livestreamed broadcast he said would not be a concert but a prayer.
Bocelli, one of the world's most famous tenors, with a wide appeal outside the traditional opera world, said the Easter event would not be a concert in the normal sense.
""The Duomo will be completely empty. This, on its own, already makes the situation abnormal,"" he told Reuters in an interview by Skype.
""But in this case, and I repeat, as this won't be a concert and it won't be a performance, it will be a prayer and as a consequence it will not be important who is present physically but rather who wants to be with me spiritually in that moment.""
Bocelli will be accompanied only by the cathedral organist, Emanuele Vianelli, playing one of world's largest pipe organs and performing a repertoire of sacred works including Pietro Mascagni's Sancta Maria.
The concert, organised at the invitation of the mayor of Milan and the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo, the body that looks after the development and conservation of the cathedral, will be streamed on Bocelli's YouTube channel at 1700 GMT on April 12.
Bocelli, whose personal foundation helps people struggling with poverty and illiteracy, said that, like everyone else, he was worried and uncertain about the future in a world turned on its head by the coronavirus.
""I'm not so worried about the present and I don't feel that concerned about the virus per se but about what will happen next,"" he said.
In a country like Italy, which already faced many economic difficulties before the major outbreak of the coronavirus in February, problems such as large scale unemployment were likely to get worse with business at a standstill.
""So, getting this country to bounce back will be a big problem. And we will have many people in difficulty. I hope I am wrong but I fear that's how it will be,"" he said.
""Certainly, we will all have to pitch in, each to his and her best ability, and we will need some wise and enlightened people to guide us, because if we don't, it will be very difficult,"" he said.
Bocelli said he had been asked by pop singer Lady Gaga to join other musicians joining livestreamed events to try to inspire a sense of hope.

""She called me and I couldn't but reply 'here I am, count me in'"" he said.

SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Lockdowns in Brazil's largest cities to slow the coronavirus outbreak are beginning to slip, according to new data this week seen and analyzed by Reuters, with more people leaving their homes as President Jair Bolsonaro continues to criticize the measures.
State governments in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo have expressed growing concern as their social isolation orders lose effectiveness, even as the outbreak spreads to nearly 16,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and 800 deaths. 
Cellular phone data, public transportation figures and interviews with taxi drivers in Rio and Sao Paulo point to rising traffic and footfall in Brazil's two largest cities.
Mayors and governors trying to keep Brazilians indoors have struggled against Bolsonaro's repeated attacks on the social distancing measures, which he described as ""poison"" that could kill more through economic hardship than the virus itself. 
In Sao Paulo state, Brazil's most populous and home to Latin America's largest city, anonymous cellular data gathered by the local government and passed to Reuters on Wednesday showed the number of people considered to be in ""social isolation"" reached its lowest point this week since the lockdown began on March 24. 
""Social isolation fell significantly in the past two to three days and that makes our challenge harder,"" Patricia Ellen, state secretary for economic development, told Reuters. ""We are concerned.""
On Wednesday, 49% of Sao Paulo residents were considered to be in ""social isolation,"" compared to a weekday-peak of 56% on March 30, according to a government analysis of cellular data collected from phone operators. The all-time peaks were on Sundays, when 59% remained in isolation. 
Sao Paulo Governor Joao Doria told reporters on Thursday that the state was targeting a 70% rate of compliance, which he said science showed was necessary for it to be properly effective. 
In the city of Sao Paulo, the number of passengers using public buses increased by 28% on Monday compared to the same day a week earlier, according to official figures. 
This week in Rio, the metro reported the highest weekday passenger numbers for a Monday and Tuesday since the lockdown there began on March 23. Trains and buses also saw an increase in ridership.
Luciano Ventura de Jesus, a 58-year-old taxi driver in Sao Paulo, said he has seen a jump in demand from passengers since last week.
He is now doing seven or eight trips per day, up from just two or three last week. On a normal day, before lockdown, he said he was doing 12 to 15 trips.
""People are becoming a bit more relaxed (about the lockdown),"" he said.

LISBON (Reuters) - Portugal's Prime Minister Antonio Costa said it was too soon to lift a lockdown to slow the novel coronavirus, even though the number of cases in the country is more than 10 times lower than in neighbouring Spain. 
""Prudence above all,"" Costa told a news conference on Thursday. ""The spread of the pandemic is slowing but we have not reached the day that we can lift measures restricting movement. We can only do it when the trasmission risk is under control.""
He said schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year, with classes to continue remotely. 
Portugal has 13,956 confirmed coronavirus cases and 409 fatalities, while in Spain more than 150,000 people have been diagnosed and 15,000 people have died. 
The massive gap in the number of cases and mortality rate between the neighbours sharing a 1,200-km border is hard to explain. Some experts and doctors have pointed to the fact that Portugal restricted movement of people early on, when cases were still in their hundreds and with just two deaths. 
""The admission rate of suspected and confirmed patients to our hospital has reduced compared to the first weeks,"" Fabio Costa Madeiros, a doctor at one of Lisbon's biggest hospitals, told Reuters. ""Undoubtedly, the confinement measures have contributed to control the spread of new cases and of admissions.""
There are only 241 infected in intensive care across the country, according to data by health authority DGS. 
Portugal only had around 642 confirmed cases and two deaths from coronavirus when a 15-day nationwide state of emergency was declared on March 18, shutting down all non-essential services. 
Even before that, the government closed all schools and nightclubs, banned gatherings of large groups, suspended flights to Italy and halted tourism with hard-hit Spain. 
On the other side of the border, Spain reported the first death on March 3 but only imposed the lockdown 11 days later. It took France even longer. The first death was reported on Feb. 15 but a lockdown to slow the spread of the disease was only imposed on March 17. 
""Portugal was very quick to implement measures. Others took longer. We had time to observe what other countries were going through,"" Ines Fronteira, a public health expert at Lisbon's Nova University, said.
But she also said it was too early to ease restrictions, which the public has very largely respected.

""I think we need to wait a bit longer for the curve to stabilise,"" she said. ""We have to be smart.""

Minas de Oro Nacional, a subsidiary of Canadian firm Alamos Gold Inc., said in a statement late on Wednesday that the robbery at the Mulatos mine in Sonora state occurred when a group of five ""heavily armed"" people assaulted security staff who were transferring bars of the precious metals onto a plane. 
Within 10 minutes, the robbers loaded the goods onto a separate plane that landed alongside. The aircraft, which appeared to be a Cessna 206, then took off towards a mountain range, Minas de Oro Nacional said. It did not detail the amount or value of the stolen bars.
The Miners' Association of Sonora (AMSAC) said the incident was the second recent robbery at a Sonora mine, after an armed group in late March stole from Mineria Penmont, a subsidiary of  Fresnillo  (LON:FRES). It called on law enforcement to work with mining companies to step up security amid broader instability due to the coronavirus crisis.

SOFIA (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boyko Borissov said on Thursday that Bulgaria's Orthodox churches and temples will be open for traditional Palm Sunday and Easter services despite the coronavirus outbreak, saying many people were desperate and in low spirits.
However, Borissov also urged Bulgarians to stay and pray in their homes. Services at major churches would be broadcast live on state television.
""A difficult decision but I am ready to bear the reproaches,"" Borisov told a news conference. ""The bishops told me that there are many people who are in low spirits, desperate. So I just cannot issue such an order (to close churches).""
Services on Palm Sunday and especially Easter normally draw thousands to churches all around the Balkan country.
Interior Minister Mladen Marinov said police will maintain a heavy presence around churches to keep order and ensure social distancing.
Bulgaria has declared a state of emergency until May 13 and imposed a ban on groups of more than two adults congregating together. As of Thursday, it had 611 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 24 deaths.
The Orthodox Church will not distribute willow branches, as it customarily does, on Palm Sunday, Lovech Metropolitan (Bishop) Gavriil said, describing the move as ""no small compromise"".
Large crowds of people usually go to churches to fetch the branches. 
Gavriil said Easter services will start outside churches and the Holy Synod, the church's top executive body, recommended that worshippers wear protective masks.
The Bulgarian Orthodox Church has been criticised on social media for keeping its houses of worship open in spite of the coronavirus crisis. 
Many Bulgarians also pointed fingers at the church for keeping the practices of people kissing icons in churches, and using shared spoons during communion services.
Valeri Simeonov, the head of a nationalist party which is part of the ruling coalition, said the church should stop communion services.
""Let's not pretend that it (the church) is holy. We are at war with with an invisible enemy,"" he said.
But many politicians have taken part in the Holy Communion, saying they are not afraid.
""Do not fear!"" said Gavriil. ""Where God's grace is, all microbes burn. There is no case of contagion being transmitted through Holy Communion.""

Germany said on Wednesday that it will accept 50 children and youths after the first coronavirus cases were confirmed among migrants last week in Greece.

22,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 09:11AM ET</span>",Pass the salt: The minute details that helped Germany build virus defences,"By Jörn Poltz and Paul Carrel
MUNICH (Reuters) - One January lunchtime in a car parts company, a worker turned to a colleague and asked to borrow the salt.
As well as the saltshaker, in that instant, they shared the new coronavirus, scientists have since concluded.
That their exchange was documented at all is the result of intense scrutiny, part of a rare success story in the global fight against the virus. 
The co-workers were early links in what was to be the first documented chain of multiple human-to-human transmissions outside Asia of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
They are based in Stockdorf, a German town of 4,000 near Munich in Bavaria, and they work at car parts supplier Webasto Group. The company was thrust under a global microscope after it disclosed that one of its employees, a Chinese woman, caught the virus and brought it to Webasto headquarters. There, it was passed to colleagues - including, scientists would learn, a person lunching in the canteen with whom the Chinese patient had no contact.
The Jan. 22 canteen scene was one of dozens of mundane incidents that scientists have logged in a medical manhunt to trace, test and isolate infected workers so that the regional government of Bavaria could stop the virus from spreading.
That hunt has helped Germany win crucial time to build its COVID-19 defences.
The time Germany bought may have saved lives, scientists say. Its first outbreak of locally transmitted COVID-19 began earlier than Italy's, but Germany has had many fewer deaths. Italy's first detected local transmission was on Feb. 21. By then Germany had kicked off a health ministry information campaign and a government strategy to tackle the virus which would hinge on widespread testing. In Germany so far, more than 2,100 people have died of COVID-19. In Italy, with a smaller population, the total exceeds 17,600.
CHART: Contrasting curves https://reut.rs/3c2UZA4 
""We learned that we must meticulously trace chains of infection in order to interrupt them,"" Clemens Wendtner, the doctor who treated the Munich patients, told Reuters.
Wendtner teamed up with some of Germany's top scientists to tackle what became known as the 'Munich cluster,' and they advised the Bavarian government on how to respond. Bavaria led the way with the lockdowns, which went nationwide on March 22.
Scientists including England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty have credited Germany's early, widespread testing with slowing the spread of the virus. ""'We all know Germany got ahead in terms of its ability to do testing for the virus and there's a lot to learn from that,'"" he said on TV earlier this week.
Christian Drosten, the top virologist at Berlin's Charite hospital, said Germany was helped by having a clear early cluster. ""Because we had this Munich cohort right at the start ... it became clear that with a big push we could inhibit this spreading further,"" he said in a daily podcast for NDR radio on the coronavirus. 
Drosten, who declined to be interviewed for this story, was one of more than 40 scientists involved in scrutiny of the cluster. Their work was documented in preliminary form in a working paper at the end of last month. The paper, not yet peer-reviewed, was shared on the NDR site. 
ELECTRONIC DIARIES
It was on Monday, Jan. 27, that Holger Engelmann, Webasto's CEO, told the authorities that one of his employees had tested positive for the new coronavirus. The woman, who was based in Shanghai, had facilitated several days of workshops and attended meetings at Webasto's HQ. 
The woman's parents, from Wuhan, had visited her before she travelled on Jan. 19 to Stockdorf, the paper said. While in Germany, she felt unusual chest and back aches and was tired for her whole stay. But she put the symptoms down to jet lag.
She became feverish on the return flight to China, tested positive after landing and was hospitalised. Her parents also later tested positive. She told her managers of the result and they emailed the CEO.
In Germany, Engelmann said he immediately set up a crisis team that alerted the medical authorities and started trying to trace staff members who had been in contact with their Chinese colleague.
The CEO himself was among them. ""Just four or five days before I received the news, I had shaken hands with her,"" he said.
Now known as Germany's ""Case #0,"" the Shanghai patient is a ""long-standing, proven employee from project management"" who Engelmann knows personally, he told Reuters. The company has not revealed her identity or that of others involved, saying anonymity has encouraged staff to co-operate in Germany's effort to contain the virus.
The task of finding who had contact with her was made easier by Webasto workers' electronic calendars – for the most part, all the doctors needed was to look at staff appointments.
""It was a stroke of luck,"" said Wendtner, the doctor who treated the Munich patients. ""We got all the information we needed from the staff to reconstruct the chains of infection.""
For example, case #1 - the first person in Germany to be infected by the Chinese woman - sat next to her in a meeting in a small room on Jan. 20, the scientists wrote.
Where calendar data was incomplete, the scientists said, they were often able to use whole genome sequencing, which analyses differences in the genetic code of the virus from different patients, to map its spread.
By following all these links, they discovered that case #4 had been in contact several times with the Shanghai patient. Then case #4 sat back-to-back with a colleague in the canteen. 
When that colleague turned to borrow the salt, the scientists deduced, the virus passed between them. The colleague became case #5. 
Webasto said on Jan. 28 it was temporarily closing its Stockdorf site. Between Jan. 27 and Feb. 11, a total of 16 COVID-19 cases were identified in the Munich cluster. All but one were to develop symptoms.
All those who tested positive were sent to hospital so they could be observed and doctors could learn from the disease.
Bavaria closed down public life in mid-March. Germany has since closed schools, shops, restaurants, playgrounds and sports facilities, and many companies have shut to aid the cause.
HAMMER AND DANCE
This is not to say Germany has defeated COVID-19.
Its coronavirus death rate of 1.9%, based on data collated by Reuters, is the lowest among the countries most affected and compares with 12.6% in Italy. But experts say more deaths in Germany are inevitable.
""The death rate will rise,"" said Lothar Wieler, president of Germany's Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.
The difference between Germany and Italy is partly statistical: Germany's rate seems so much lower because it has tested widely. Germany has carried out more than 1.3 million tests, according to the Robert Koch Institute. It is now carrying out up to 500,000 tests a week, Drosten said. Italy has conducted more than 807,000 tests since Feb. 21, according to its Civil Protection Agency. With a few local exceptions, Italy only tests people taken to hospital with clear and severe symptoms.
Germany's government is using the weeks gained by the Munich experience to double the number of intensive care beds from about 28,000. The country already has Europe's highest number of critical care beds per head of the population, according to a 2012 study.
Even that may not be enough, however. An Interior Ministry paper sent to other government departments on March 22 included a worst-case scenario with more than 1 million deaths. 
Another scenario saw 12,000 deaths - with more testing after partial relaxation of restrictions. That scenario was dubbed ""hammer and dance,"" a term coined by blogger Tomas Pueyo. It refers to the 'hammer' of quick aggressive measures for some weeks, including heavy social distancing, followed by the 'dance' of calibrating such measures depending on the transmission rate.
The German government paper argued that in the 'hammer and dance' scenario, the use of big data and location tracking is inevitable. Such monitoring is already proving controversial in Germany, where memories of the East German Stasi secret police and its informants are still fresh in the minds of many.
A subsequent draft action plan compiled by the government proposes the rapid tracing of infection chains, mandatory mask-wearing in public and limits on gatherings to help enable a phased return to normal life after Germany's lockdown. The government is backing the development of a smartphone app to help trace infections. 
Germany has said it will re-evaluate the lockdown after the Easter holiday; for the car parts maker at the heart of its first outbreak, the immediate crisis is over. Webasto's office has reopened. 
All 16 people who caught COVID-19 there have recovered.

“The announcement prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages at all shops … from April 10 to April 20,” Bangkok Metropolitan Administration spokesman Pongsakorn Kwanmuang told a news conference.
At supermarkets in downtown Bangkok, shoppers wearing facial masks crowded in to the alcohol section. 
“I don’t know how long the ban will take, so I bought a lot just in case it extended,” said 39-year-old Tanawat Ruenbanterng, who bought 30 bottles of beer. 
At Thai New Year, or Songkran, there are usually big water fights and people travel to visit their parents. Celebrations, often involving alcohol, have been scaled back to limit the spread of the coronavirus. 
Thailand has confirmed 2,423 coronavirus cases, with 32 fatalities. More than half the cases have been in Bangkok, where a mobile testing system is being rolled out. 
“The culture ministry has asked to stop all Songkran activities, traveling back to hometowns and pouring water for blessings with older family members,” said Taweesin Wisanuyothin, spokesman for the government's Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration. 
“Pay respect to elders from one to two meters … remember older people have the highest risk of dying,” he said.
The culture ministry also recommended calling home or using online methods to pay respects. 
Last week, the government imposed a nationwide curfew between 10 p.m – 4 a.m.

The number of confirmed infections of the novel coronavirus have exceeded 1.47 million globally and the death toll crossed 87,700, according to a Reuters tally as of 0200 GMT.

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech Republic is planning to roll out a system of quickly tracking and isolating contacts of people with coronavirus to eventually allow the lifting of blanket restrictions that are slowing the rise in infections but also crippling the economy.
Over the past five days, the average daily increase in new cases was 224, down from the previous five days despite more people being tested, and giving a total of 5,335 infections in the country of 10.7 million. The death toll stands at 104.
The slow-down in new infections is helping create the space to push ahead with a South Korea-inspired tracking system - with army testing teams and call centres using cellphone and bank card data to trace contacts of patients and get them into quarantine as well.
""The data available at this moment show that the epidemic has been stabilised, the growth is even somewhat slower than we had originally expected,"" Roman Prymula, in charge of Czech anti-coronavirus measures, told Reuters. 
""Blanket measures will be gradually replaced by measures targeted at individual people.""
He said he now expected around 10,000 cases by the end of the month, below previous estimates of 15,000. 
The aim of the plan, called ""smart quarantine"", is to identify the most at-risk contacts of those who have tested positive for the virus, for example those who were closest to them or spent the longest with them, and isolate them quickly to prevent them from passing on the infection. 
Given that the government believes an infected person infects about 0.4 other people per day, the target is to get the contacts quarantined within three days to not allow for an exponential rise in infections.
""We want this period to last three days maximum,"" Prymula said. ""Testing, getting the test results, then reaching the contacts.""
""It is not vital to test the contacts within three days but to get them into a home quarantine and only test them later so we are able to reveal the positivity through the first test, as testing on the first day would carry the risk that the test would be (falsely) negative.""
MOBILE DATA 
With several countries now looking for a path for businesses and families to return to some normality, without unleashing a new wave of infections, the World Health Organization on Tuesday urged countries not to lift restrictions prematurely.
The new Czech strategy is due to be rolled out gradually next week, after testing in one of the country's 14 regions. 
The authorities have not yet made public any assessment of the pilot programme, and it has run into criticism of slow progress, especially with regional public health officials not ready to handle the electronic elements of the workflow.
Health Minister Adam Vojtech told Reuters there were ""growing pains"" in the project but these were being solved on the go, including the focus on protecting individuals' data.
Depending on the wider results, the government has insisted it will proceed with caution on lifting restrictions on movement and travel, school closures, shopping and public gatherings that were among the strictest in Europe when imposed in mid-March. 
The economy has been hard hit, with hospitality, retail, services, transport and travel sectors crippled by restrictions, and manufacturing suffering from a drop in demand and supply chain disruptions. The Labour Ministry has said unemployment, now at 3%, may jump by 5 percentage points.
To roll out the plan, the army is creating 33 testing teams and providing staff to help track potentially infected people. The teams will be supported by medical students at call centres, location data from mobile operators and data on bank card transactions.
If people consent, all the data will be used to establish contacts at risk. The data will be erased after six hours. 
A mobile app based on Bluetooth technology that people will be encouraged to download will also help determine which phone numbers came in proximity with identified patients. This should be more precise than location data from mapping applications.

""You can imagine the phones recording numbers of phones in their proximity,"" said Jan Kulveit from the Future of Humanity Institute at Oxford University who is one of the two main strategists for the application developed by Covid19.cz, an ad-hoc group of developers and scientists working on the system.

""As far as dogs are concerned, along with the progress of human civilisation and the public concern and love for animal protection, dogs have been 'specialised' to become companion animals, and internationally are not considered to be livestock, and they will not be regulated as livestock in China,"" it said.
The coronavirus is widely believed to have originated in horseshoe bats, and could have been passed onto humans by intermediary species on sale in the markets of the city of Wuhan, where the pathogen was first identified.
China subsequently banned the breeding, trading and consumption of wildlife, and revoked all existing licenses. It has also promised to revise legislation to make the ban permanent.
The draft guidelines published on Wednesday, which have been opened to the public for consultation, listed 18 traditional livestock species - including cattle, pigs, poultry and camels. 
It also added 13 ""special"" species that would also be exempt from wild animal trading restrictions, including reindeer, alpaca, pheasants, ostriches and foxes.
Dog consumption has become increasingly unpopular in China, and the southern city of Shenzhen became the first to ban it last month.
However, the Humane Society International, an animal welfare group, estimated that around 10 million dogs a year are still killed in China for meat, including stolen pets. The city of Yulin in the region of Guangxi holds an annual dog meat festival in June. 

""This draft proposal could signal a game-changer moment for animal protection in China,"" said Wendy Higgins, a Humane Society International spokeswoman.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Driving to a factory in China's southeastern province of Fujian to meet a friend, Ye Jing was stopped by a security guard soon after returning from two months of lockdown in Hubei, the province hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak.
""His whole manner and actions changed,"" the shoe factory manager said, after the guard spotted her Hubei licence plate and asked where she was from.
""He immediately went to put on gloves and distanced himself from me. And he wouldn't let me in.""
Ye reassured the guard that she had tested negative for the virus, but he responded, ""I don't trust your test results.""
She added, then, ""I really felt sadness in my heart.""
Ye is just one of many people from the central province who say they face fear and rejection after its capital of Wuhan lifted on Wednesday a lockdown against the virus that had stretched more than two months.
The move allowed those with a green health code, a QR code that contains their health information, to leave the city. Curbs elsewhere in Hubei were lifted late last month. [nL4N2BW044].
But since leaving, say many Hubei residents, they have faced discrimination in the job search.
""When they see I'm from Hubei, they immediately say sorry, or they directly say you're not suitable,"" said a 25-year-old from the province, who would give only her last name, Li.
She said she had sent her resume online to nearly 50 firms since mid-March, after a job offer fell through during the outbreak, which has spread globally since emerging in China last year to infect 1.4 million and kill 83,400 worldwide.
News reports and social media posts reveal many instances of stricter treatment for Hubei people, whether landlords who refuse to rent to them or tougher quarantine measures. 
Li Guoqiang, a Hubei lawyer who offers free advice to those facing discrimination, said he understood employers' concerns, given the potential impact if staff caught the virus.
""If there's a single case in returning to work, then a whole company must stop,"" Li said.
'HUBEI PEOPLE ARE NOT A VIRUS'
Chinese state media have lauded people from Wuhan and Hubei as heroes. In late March, an anchor for state broadcaster CCTV hosted a segment urging people not to discriminate against those from Hubei but show them ""kindness and understanding"" instead.
""Hubei people are not a virus,"" was the phrase around which CCTV built a social media campaign.
As more people leave Hubei and China's economy returns to normal, many have recently become worried about the risk from ""silent carriers"", or those who don't show symptoms, cases that China only began reporting last week.
Ye Xiaotian, 25, who recently returned to the southern city of Xiamen from his hometown in Hubei said he waited 30 minutes to be interviewed for a job at an internet marketing firm, Xiamen Piaoxue Internet Technology Inc. on April 1.
Then he was told it was not accepting candidates from Hubei.
""They said the epidemic situation is quite severe and Hubei people are coming from a place where the epidemic is quite severe,"" Ye added.
Xiamen requires a virus test for arrivals from Hubei, which Ye had done at a central facility that cleared him to go about his daily activities. But that was not enough to allay the fears of those worried about test accuracy.
""He didn't tell us he was from Hubei,"" said a man who described himself as a project leader at the firm. 
""We would have told him immediately, don't come here now,"" the man, who gave his surname as Wang, told Reuters. ""If he came after 14 days, it would be OK.""

The protests, in which hundreds of thousands marched in Istanbul and across Turkey against plans to redevelop the central Istanbul park, posed a serious challenge to then-Prime Minister, now President Tayyip Erdogan.
The court case was condemned by Western allies and rights groups and after hours following his surprise acquittal on Feb. 18, prominent businessman Kavala was re-arrested in connection with an attempted military coup in 2016.
A 90-page document from the Istanbul chief prosecutor's office, dated April 8, called for the Gezi case acquittal rulings to be annulled and for the defendants to be convicted as charged.
It also called for a re-arrest order to be imposed on Kavala in connection with the Gezi case, even though he is already in custody. 
In the Gezi case, Kavala and two other defendants had been facing life sentences without parole, while the other defendants were accused of aiding them in trying to overthrow the government by organising the protests. They had denied the allegations.

Kavala has spent more than two years in jail. In December, the European Court of Human Right demanded his immediate release, saying there was a lack of reasonable suspicion that he had committed a crime.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hong Kong's Court of Appeal on Thursday ruled that a blanket government ban on face masks was unconstitutional, at a time when most Hong Kong people are wearing them in the hope of warding off the new coronavirus.
Partially overturning a lower court's ruling, a three-judge panel said that while the government had the right to ban the wearing of masks at unlawful assemblies, a ban on masks at legal public gatherings was unconstitutional.
In October, during the height of anti-government protests, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years that allowed her to enact a new regulation banning face masks.
At the time, many protesters wore masks to hide their identities from the authorities and also from their employers, particularly if they had close connections to Beijing.
Protesters also wore masks to protect themselves from tear gas.
The contentious ban on masks was ruled unconstitutional by the High Court in November, a decision that riled Beijing and led to an appeal.
""If the meeting and procession remain peaceful and orderly, it is difficult to see the justification for imposing a restriction on the freedom of demonstration by way of prohibition of wearing facial coverings,"" the Court of Appeal said.
Some democracy activists said the Thursday ruling created confusion and called on the government to repeal the law.
""It creates lots of fear and confusion, so there's only one solution, I call upon Chief Executive Carrie Lam to repeal this law,"" said pro-democracy lawmaker Dennis Kwok, adding that the priority now should be to focus on battling the coronavirus.
Hong Kong has had 974 cases of the coronavirus and four people have died of it in the city. 
Thursday's ruling also found that providing the police with powers to remove facial coverings was also unconstitutional.
But in a partial victory for the city government, the court said its overall right to invoke the Emergency Regulations Ordinance (ERO) was constitutional in time of ""public danger"", overruling critics who said the ERO was itself unconstitutional. 
The city's Department of Justice has five days to appeal against the ruling. 
Masks have long been common in Hong Kong for when people are sick, or fear getting sick in public. That has become even more pronounced this year with most of the city's 7.4 million people putting on surgical mask in the hope of protecting themselves from the coronavirus. 
Under the anti-mask law, it was illegal to wear a mask at both lawful and unlawful assemblies and offenders could be sentenced to one year in jail and a fine of HK$25,000.
People who need to wear face masks for health, religious or job-related reasons were exempt from the law, although critics of the ban said it was confusing.

Police were also given the power to order people to remove masks for identity verification. Those who refused to do so could be sentenced to six months in prison or a HK$10,000 fine.

ADEN (Reuters) - A nationwide ceasefire in response to the global coronavirus outbreak went into effect in Yemen on Thursday, stirring hope for an end to the five-year-old war that has pushed millions to the brink of famine.
A Saudi-led coalition fighting against Yemen's Houthi movement announced overnight it would halt military operations from 0900 GMT for two weeks in support of United Nations efforts to end the conflict that has killed more than 100,000 people.
The Houthi leadership has yet to announce whether the Iran-aligned movement, which controls the capital Sanaa and most major urban centres in Yemen, would follow suit in what would be the first major breakthrough in peace efforts since late 2018.
The coalition said its move aims to facilitate talks sponsored by U.N. envoy Martin Griffiths for a permanent truce, motivated in part to avoid a potential outbreak of the new coronavirus, though no cases have been reported so far in Yemen.
""We are tired of the war... We want it to stop for good,"" said 49-year-old Abd al-Basset Muhammad, who owns a juice shop in the southern port of Aden, interim headquarters of the Saudi-backed government.
""If the war hasn't already killed you, you are dying of hunger or disease,"" he told Reuters. 
The conflict, widely seen in the region as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran, has been in military stalemate for years. Riyadh last year took over most of the costly and unpopular military campaign after key coalition partner the United Arab Emirates significantly scaled down its presence.
A Houthi official said on Wednesday that the group had sent the United Nations a proposal calling for an end to the war and what it describes as a coalition blockade. The coalition, which patrols the coast, denies imposing a blockade and says it aims to halt import of weapons.
CORONAVIRUS FEARS
University student Amal Abd al-Rahman, 24, said Yemenis had suffered enough. ""We want to live to learn. If coronavirus appears, Yemen will be facing an unprecedented catastrophe"". 
The United Nations and Western allies have pointed to the threat of the coronavirus to push the combatants to restart talks to end the war, which has shattered Yemen's health system. 
The warring parties last held political negotiations at U.N.-sponsored talks in Sweden in 2018. They agreed a peace deal for the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah, but this has yet to be fully implemented due to deep mistrust among all sides.
""We cannot control a global pandemic amongst bombs and airstrikes,"" said Tamuna Sabedze, International Rescue Committee's Yemen country director, calling for a permanent ceasefire. 
""Two weeks is not enough time to prepare this country for the devastating impacts COVID-19 will have on the country, nor to reach those in need and alleviate their suffering,"" Sabedze said, referring to 24 million Yemenis reliant on aid. 
Yemen had witnessed a lull in hostilities after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks late last year. But there has been a recent spike in attacks, including Houthi missile launches at Saudi cities and retaliatory coalition air strikes. 
UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash said in a Twitter post on Thursday that he hoped the Houthis would ""rise to the occasion"".

Yemen, the Arab world's poorest country, has been mired in violence since the Houthis ousted the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi from power in Sanaa in late 2014, prompting the coalition to intervene in March 2015 to restore him. The Houthis say they are fighting a corrupt system.

The National Crime Agency (NCA) had sought Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs) against the companies which owned a London mansion in which Nurali Aliyev lived and two other properties to try to force them to explain where the money to buy them had come from. 
However, on Wednesday, the High Court ruled in favour of Aliyev and discharged the orders against the companies which owned the properties.
""The court's powerful judgment demonstrates the NCA obtained the orders on an inaccurate basis as part of a flawed investigation which was entirely without merit,"" Aliyev, the grandson of former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev, said in a statement.
""The NCA deliberately ignored the relevant information I voluntarily provided and pursued a groundless and vicious legal action, including making shocking slurs against me, my family and my country."" 
The case involved only the second time that Britain has used UWOs since they were introduced in 2018 in an attempt to stem the billions of dollars of dirty money flowing through the country each year.
The NCA wanted Aliyev to explain the source of funds used to buy the mansion in north London where he lived with his wife and children, which has an underground swimming pool and a cinema.
It had argued the money used to buy the house and two other properties, worth some 80 million pounds ($104 million) in total, was linked to Rakhat Aliyev - Nurali Aliyev's father and the former president's son-in-law - who was found hanged in an Austrian jail in 2015 after being charged with the murder of two bankers in 2007.
Lawyers for two offshore companies that own the properties said the case was ""tissue paper thin"" and that the funding had come from Aliyev's mother, Dariga Nazarbayeva, who was economically independent.
A spokesman for Dariga Nazarbayeva said that Wednesday's judgement ""entirely vindicated"" her. 
""It is frustrating and disappointing that she has had to take this action to fight these draconian proceedings and clear her name,"" the spokesman said.
The NCA said it would appeal the ruling.
""Unexplained Wealth Orders are new legislation and we always expected there would be significant legal challenge over their use,"" said Graeme Biggar, the NCA's Director General of the National Economic Crime Centre.
""These hearings will establish the case law on which future judgements will be based, so it is vital that we get this right.""
Duncan Hames, director of policy at Transparency International UK, said that the case ""has highlighted major weaknesses in the UK's defence against dirty money that should be addressed urgently.""
Britain's first UWOs were issued against a Knightsbridge house and a golf course belonging to Jahangir Hajiyeva, jailed in Azerbaijan for embezzlement from the state bank, and his wife, Zamira, who spent 16.3 million pounds in the London department store Harrods.

JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - African leaders have rallied around the Ethiopian head of the World Health Organization (WHO) after U.S. President Donald Trump criticised the United Nations agency and threatened to withhold his country's contribution to its budget.
Trump had on Tuesday accused the WHO of being too focused on China and of issuing bad advice on the COVID-19 pandemic.
South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, who chairs the African Union (AU), said in a statement late on Wednesday that WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had shown ""exceptional leadership ... from the very earliest stages of this unprecedented global health crisis.""
""The AU calls upon the international community to join hands to support the efforts of the DG and the entire WHO family as they lead global efforts to fight this pandemic,"" Ramaphosa added. 
""If there was a time for global unity, solidarity and cooperation, this is that time."" 
Posting on Twitter, Rwanda's Paul Kagame said the WHO chief ""has the full confidence and support of Africa,"" while AU Commission head Moussa Faki urged leaders to focus on fighting COVID-19 and said the time for accountability would come later.
Tedros, a former foreign minister of Ethiopia, has rejected Trump's suggestion that the WHO has been ""China-centric"" in its efforts to contain the spread of the new coronavirus.
""We are close to every nation, we are colour-blind,"" he said on Wednesday, adding the WHO had ""kept the world informed about the latest data, information and evidence.""
China has said Tedros had played an important role in promoting international cooperation to combat the pandemic, which has infected more than 1.47 million people and killed more than 87,000, according to the latest Reuters tally.
Africa accounts for a fraction of global cases of the disease, but its countries are feeling the impact with economies expected to contract, putting about 20 million jobs at risk.

""The window for containing the virus at the subnational and national level is closing in many countries,"" Tedros told diplomats in Geneva on Thursday. ""The infection numbers in Africa are relatively small now, but they are growing fast.""

32,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 09, 2020 06:06AM ET</span>",Pass the salt: The minute details that helped Germany build virus defences,"By Jörn Poltz and Paul Carrel
MUNICH (Reuters) - One January lunchtime in a car parts company, a worker turned to a colleague and asked to borrow the salt.
As well as the saltshaker, in that instant, they shared the new coronavirus, scientists have since concluded.
That their exchange was documented at all is the result of intense scrutiny, part of a rare success story in the global fight against the virus. 
The co-workers were early links in what was to be the first documented chain of multiple human-to-human transmissions outside Asia of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
They are based in Stockdorf, a German town of 4,000 near Munich in Bavaria, and they work at car parts supplier Webasto Group. The company was thrust under a global microscope after it disclosed that one of its employees, a Chinese woman, caught the virus and brought it to Webasto headquarters. There, it was passed to colleagues - including, scientists would learn, a person lunching in the canteen with whom the Chinese patient had no contact.
The Jan. 22 canteen scene was one of dozens of mundane incidents that scientists have logged in a medical manhunt to trace, test and isolate infected workers so that the regional government of Bavaria could stop the virus from spreading.
That hunt has helped Germany win crucial time to build its COVID-19 defences.
The time Germany bought may have saved lives, scientists say. Its first outbreak of locally transmitted COVID-19 began earlier than Italy's, but Germany has had many fewer deaths. Italy's first detected local transmission was on Feb. 21. By then Germany had kicked off a health ministry information campaign and a government strategy to tackle the virus which would hinge on widespread testing. In Germany so far, more than 2,100 people have died of COVID-19. In Italy, with a smaller population, the total exceeds 17,600.
CHART: Contrasting curves https://reut.rs/3c2UZA4 
""We learned that we must meticulously trace chains of infection in order to interrupt them,"" Clemens Wendtner, the doctor who treated the Munich patients, told Reuters.
Wendtner teamed up with some of Germany's top scientists to tackle what became known as the 'Munich cluster,' and they advised the Bavarian government on how to respond. Bavaria led the way with the lockdowns, which went nationwide on March 22.
Scientists including England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty have credited Germany's early, widespread testing with slowing the spread of the virus. ""'We all know Germany got ahead in terms of its ability to do testing for the virus and there's a lot to learn from that,'"" he said on TV earlier this week.
Christian Drosten, the top virologist at Berlin's Charite hospital, said Germany was helped by having a clear early cluster. ""Because we had this Munich cohort right at the start ... it became clear that with a big push we could inhibit this spreading further,"" he said in a daily podcast for NDR radio on the coronavirus. 
Drosten, who declined to be interviewed for this story, was one of more than 40 scientists involved in scrutiny of the cluster. Their work was documented in preliminary form in a working paper at the end of last month, intended for The Lancet. The paper, not yet peer-reviewed, was shared on the NDR site. 
ELECTRONIC DIARIES
It was on Monday, Jan. 27, that Holger Engelmann, Webasto's CEO, told the authorities that one of his employees had tested positive for the new coronavirus. The woman, who was based in Shanghai, had facilitated several days of workshops and attended meetings at Webasto's HQ. 
The woman's parents, from Wuhan, had visited her before she travelled on Jan. 19 to Stockdorf, the paper said. While in Germany, she felt unusual chest and back aches and was tired for her whole stay. But she put the symptoms down to jet lag.
She became feverish on the return flight to China, tested positive after landing and was hospitalised. Her parents also later tested positive. She told her managers of the result and they emailed the CEO.
In Germany, Engelmann said he immediately set up a crisis team that alerted the medical authorities and started trying to trace staff members who had been in contact with their Chinese colleague.
The CEO himself was among them. ""Just four or five days before I received the news, I had shaken hands with her,"" he said.
Now known as Germany's ""Case #0,"" the Shanghai patient is a ""long-standing, proven employee from project management"" who Engelmann knows personally, he told Reuters. The company has not revealed her identity or that of others involved, saying anonymity has encouraged staff to co-operate in Germany's effort to contain the virus.
The task of finding who had contact with her was made easier by Webasto workers' electronic calendars – for the most part, all the doctors needed was to look at staff appointments.
""It was a stroke of luck,"" said Wendtner, the doctor who treated the Munich patients. ""We got all the information we needed from the staff to reconstruct the chains of infection.""
For example, case #1 - the first person in Germany to be infected by the Chinese woman - sat next to her in a meeting in a small room on Jan. 20, the scientists wrote.
Where calendar data was incomplete, the scientists said, they were often able to use whole genome sequencing, which analyses differences in the genetic code of the virus from different patients, to map its spread.
By following all these links, they discovered that case #4 had been in contact several times with the Shanghai patient. Then case #4 sat back-to-back with a colleague in the canteen. 
When that colleague turned to borrow the salt, the scientists deduced, the virus passed between them. The colleague became case #5. 
Webasto said on Jan. 28 it was temporarily closing its Stockdorf site. Between Jan. 27 and Feb. 11, a total of 16 COVID-19 cases were identified in the Munich cluster. All but one were to develop symptoms.
All those who tested positive were sent to hospital so they could be observed and doctors could learn from the disease.
Bavaria closed down public life in mid-March. Germany has since closed schools, shops, restaurants, playgrounds and sports facilities, and many companies have shut to aid the cause.
HAMMER AND DANCE
This is not to say Germany has defeated COVID-19.
Its coronavirus death rate of 1.9%, based on data collated by Reuters, is the lowest among the countries most affected and compares with 12.6% in Italy. But experts say more deaths in Germany are inevitable.
""The death rate will rise,"" said Lothar Wieler, president of Germany's Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.
The difference between Germany and Italy is partly statistical: Germany's rate seems so much lower because it has tested widely. Germany has carried out more than 1.3 million tests, according to the Robert Koch Institute. It is now carrying out up to 500,000 tests a week, Drosten said. Italy has conducted more than 807,000 tests since Feb. 21, according to its Civil Protection Agency. With a few local exceptions, Italy only tests people taken to hospital with clear and severe symptoms.
Germany's government is using the weeks gained by the Munich experience to double the number of intensive care beds from about 28,000. The country already has Europe's highest number of critical care beds per head of the population, according to a 2012 study.
Even that may not be enough, however. An Interior Ministry paper sent to other government departments on March 22 included a worst-case scenario with more than 1 million deaths. 
Another scenario saw 12,000 deaths - with more testing after partial relaxation of restrictions. That scenario was dubbed ""hammer and dance,"" a term coined by blogger Tomas Pueyo. It refers to the 'hammer' of quick aggressive measures for some weeks, including heavy social distancing, followed by the 'dance' of calibrating such measures depending on the transmission rate.
The German government paper argued that in the 'hammer and dance' scenario, the use of big data and location tracking is inevitable. Such monitoring is already proving controversial in Germany, where memories of the East German Stasi secret police and its informants are still fresh in the minds of many.
A subsequent draft action plan compiled by the government proposes the rapid tracing of infection chains, mandatory mask-wearing in public and limits on gatherings to help enable a phased return to normal life after Germany's lockdown. The government is backing the development of a smartphone app to help trace infections. 
Germany has said it will re-evaluate the lockdown after the Easter holiday; for the car parts maker at the heart of its first outbreak, the immediate crisis is over. Webasto's office has reopened. 

All 16 people who caught COVID-19 there have recovered.

SAN LUCAS MOUNTAINS, Colombia (Reuters) - In a clearing around his modest smallholding, farmer Arcadio Barajas stands before a sea of coffee plants, cloaked in the shadow cast by a wall of verdant forest that covers the San Lucas mountains of northern Colombia. 
The San Lucas range is one of the most unexplored places in this South American nation, which is the world's second most biodiverse country after neighboring Brazil. From its towering Andean peaks to its tropical islands and dense Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) rainforest, Colombia is home to over 50,000 recorded species of animals and plants. 
Deforestation spiked after Colombia signed a peace deal in 2016 with its largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), as swathes of land became more accessible. Government data shows that in 2017, almost 220,000 hectares (543,620 acres) of forest were destroyed, compared with around 124,000 hectares (306,400 acres)in 2015.
The dense forests of San Lucas are a haven for rare predators like ocelots, pumas and spectacled bears - one of the region's most endangered species - and serve as a crossroads in migratory corridors used by jaguars, whose range stretches from Argentina to Mexico.
Yet this ecosystem is threatened by mining and drug cultivation. Not long ago, crops of coca, the chief ingredient in cocaine, were rooted where Barajas' coffee plants grow.
Now, Colombian environmental group WebConserva is leading a first-of-its kind project bringing together farmers in San Lucas and roasters across Colombia to produce coffee from plantations that build protective borders around forests to shield the biodiversity within. 
So far the project includes 10 families farming some 400 hectares (988 acres) of coffee, which the environmental group covers at a cost of around $77,000 a year. WebConserva hopes eventually to include 200 families, which could protect 20,000 hectares (49,420 acres) or more of virgin forest. 
In San Lucas, where Barajas is among the participants, newly planted coffee fields establish a barrier between wild predators and cattle farms, lessening the chance for conflict over cattle. 
A religious man, Barajas says tearing down the forest to plant coca and killing wildlife went against his faith but he - like his neighbors - was desperate for money. Now, he feels that growing coffee lets him be a good steward of his land. 
""I'm taking care of the environment, the forest and the animals, so that I don't end up ruined as well,"" he said. 
Globally more than 31,000 species are threatened with extinction, according to the Red List by the Switzerland-based International Union for Conservation of Nature, whose members include government and civil society. Of these, some 1,050 species are in Colombia, including 187 considered critically endangered. 
In San Lucas, the families pledge not to fell trees to expand their crops or to hunt the animals that depend on the forests for survival. Depending on the quality of the product, they receive around $250 to $300 per 125 kilos (275 pounds) of coffee, an enviable return in a country where prices regularly dip below production costs.
While profitability has improved as the peso has fallen against the dollar in recent months, the government doled out $77 million in aid to coffee farmers last year to help them deal with low prices. 
As of 2018, the San Lucas area was still carpeted with thousands of hectares of coca crops, according to the most recent government figures. 
LESS PROFITABLE, MORE SUSTAINABLE 
Gold mining - which drifts between illegality and informality - and farming continue to drive slash-and-burn practices in the region. 
Plumes of smoke rise lazily into the sky from multiple points across the mountain range, signaling fires started to clear more space. At the forest edge, patches of scorched earth serve as ugly reminders of human activity.
For the farmers, the switch to coffee from coca or mining is less profitable. Coca could fetch some $760 per kilo, at a time when low coffee prices caused thousands to abandon the industry. 
Many families came to rely on illicit activities to support their children, said Arnobis Romero, a former coca grower and miner. 
Like many people here, he turned to coffee amid aerial anti-coca spraying campaigns carried out by the government, which were halted in 2015 under then-President Juan Manuel Santos. But the idea of helping to protect the ecosystem and support from WebConserva boosts morale, Romero said.
""We feel really proud to look after this biodiversity and to leave it... for future generations,"" he said.
The South American country has designated some 16% of its land territory - some 18.6 million hectares (46 million acres), an area roughly the size of Washington state - as protected areas, but hundreds of thousands of hectares of land are destroyed each year. 
Though activists are campaigning for San Lucas to be protected with a national park designation, the process is slow.
In the meantime, WebConserva director Carlos Valderrama hopes the group's project can build a new system of sustainable production.
""It protects forests, biodiversity and ecosystems at the same time as (improving) coffee growers' quality of life,"" he said.
WebConserva, which acts as a go-between for the farmers and roasters, keeps tabs on the wildlife living in the forests with camera traps that take images when motion sensors are triggered. 
Coffee farmer Liseth Alfonso, 28, whose kitchen looks out over the forests below, said seeing photos and videos makes her proud.

""Many are close to extinction,"" Alfonso said. ""It helps us remember we are taking care of these animals.""

The attack comes weeks after Taliban militants and the United States reached a deal on the withdrawal of U.S.-led international troops in exchange for Taliban security guarantees. Islamic State militants have not been included in the pact.
""Five rockets were fired at Bagram airfield early this morning,"" the NATO-led mission, Resolute Support, said on Twitter, referring to the main U.S. air base in Afghanistan, north of Kabul.
""There were no casualties."" 
Islamic State said in a statement on social media that their fighters had targeted a helicopter landing pad at Bagram.
A Taliban spokesman said on Twitter that his group was not behind the attack.
The Afghan affiliate of Islamic State, known as Islamic State Khorasan (ISIS-K), after an old name for the region, first appeared in eastern Afghanistan in 2014, and has since made inroads into other areas, particularly the north.
The U.S. military estimates their strength at 2,000 fighters. Some Afghan officials estimated the number is higher.
IS militants, who battle foreign and Afghan government forces as well as the Taliban, have carried out some of the deadliest attacks in Afghanistan's urban centres in recent years.
The Taliban, as part of their agreement with the United States, have promised to open peace talks with the U.S.-backed Afghan government but little progress has been made.
The Afghan government has begun the release of Taliban prisoners from a jail near the Bagram base, as step to build confidence for the Taliban talks.
A hundred Taliban members are scheduled to be freed on Thursday from detention at a jail near the base, following the release on Wednesday of 100 Taliban members.
The prisoner exchange deal provides for the government to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners, with the Taliban releasing 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces in exchange.

Schools closed for most children three weeks ago to curb the spread of the virus but are still open to care for the children of people who work in hospitals for the National Health Service (NHS) and other key sectors. 
Holding up a picture to show the royal couple, one of the children told them that it was painting of his mother who worked for the NHS. 
""You should be very proud of her, they're doing an amazing job, all the NHS workers,"" Kate told the boy at the Casterton Primary Academy in Burnley, northern England. 
With the United Kingdom in its third week of lockdown, the royal family have finding ways to rally the British people, with William's father and heir to the throne Prince Charles, who himself has recovered from COVID-19, opening a new hospital last week by video link. 
Queen Elizabeth, William's grandmother, made a rare televised address on Sunday, saying that the coronavirus outbreak could be overcome if people stayed resolute in the face of lockdown and self-isolation.
William and Kate joked with the children and staff, who were all wearing bunny ears to celebrate Easter, saying that they wished that they had similar headware, as they thanked the staff caring for the children for their hardwork. 

""We just wanted to say a huge thank you to you guys and well done and keep it all going,"" William said.

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - A thick line of black tape obscures Cardinal George Pell's name on a board lauding ordained alumni of St Patrick's College in the Australian town of Ballarat as coloured ribbons flutter on doors and mailboxes.
The high school in Pell's home town has no immediate plans to remove the tape despite the former Vatican treasurer's acquittal this week of the sexual assault of two choirboys in Melbourne in the 1990s. 
The High Court's decision to overturn a lower court's ruling and clear 78-year-old Pell, releasing him from jail after serving just over a year of a six-year sentence, has stirred painful memories for child sex abuse survivors in Ballarat.
Belinda Coates, deputy mayor of the town that has the unfortunate distinction of being a hotspot of historic child sex abuse by Catholic clergy in Australia, said the decision was tough for survivors who have long feared the stigma and trauma of going public with allegations.
""There's been shock and disappointment here at the decision,"" Coates told Reuters in a telephone interview.
Pell not only grew up and went to school in the former gold mining town, located some 120 km (75 miles) west of Melbourne, but served there as parish priest from 1973 to 1983.
Hundreds of people have made claims against the Catholic church in the Ballarat diocese, a region covering the town and 51 surrounding parishes, over alleged incidents from the mid-1960s to mid-1990s. At least six priests and members of the Christian Brothers religious order have been jailed.
Allegations by former pupils at a children's home and three schools, all run by Christian Brothers, comprised an entire case study in a government-backed national inquiry into institutional child sex abuse.
After taking evidence from victims and clergy, the so-called Royal Commission found in a 2017 report there was a ""catastrophic failure in the leadership"" of the Ballarat Diocese. A climate of secrecy to minimise scandal and protect the Catholic Church saw priests accused of abuse quietly moved to other parishes, while records of allegations were destroyed, the commission said. 
Throughout both the Royal Commission hearings and Pell's legal case, coloured ribbons have sporadically adorned buildings in Ballarat as a mark of respect for the abuse victims. New ribbons appeared this week after Pell's conviction was overturned. 
""It demonstrates the groundswell of community support for those affected,"" said Coates, who travelled to Rome in 2016 with abuse survivors to hear Pell's testimony about the Ballarat Diocese to the Royal Commission.
Pell, who was not named as an alleged perpetrator at that inquiry, was called to give evidence about his knowledge of other priests’ conduct, and whether he was present when church leaders decided to move offenders between parishes.
Pell told the inquiry he was not aware of the abuse of children in Ballarat by another priest in the 1970s, but said the Church had made ""catastrophic"" choices in its response to complaints.
In a statement after the High Court's decision, Pell said he did not want his acquittal to ""add to the hurt and bitterness so many feel."" 
Paul Bird, the current bishop of Ballarat, acknowledged the case had been distressing for both those directly involved and others in the community, including victims of abuse and their families.
""Now that the highest court in the land has given a judgement, I hope this will bring some sense of resolution to all those affected by the proceedings,"" Bird said. 
ISOLATION
Pell, who grew up as the son of a publican before becoming archbishop of both Sydney and Melbourne on his way to the Vatican's inner circle, remains a polarising figure in Ballarat.
Phil Nagle, an abuse survivor who gave evidence to the Royal Commission, said the High Court's decision was particularly tough given it came as the town, like the rest of the country, is in virtual lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic.
""We'd all go out and have a beer and we can't even do that,"" Nagle said. ""Just because all these things don't stick, doesn't mean everyone loves Pell now.""
Pell's former Ballarat high school scratched his name from a building when he was convicted last year, as well as masking his name on the alumni board. St Patrick's this week said it would only consider reinstating Pell's naming honours after all of the findings of the Royal Commission had been released and assessed.
Large parts of the commission's 536-page report into the Ballarat Diocese were redacted ahead of Pell's trial. Australian Attorney General Christian Porter said this week he is inclined to publish the full findings if prosecutors agree that would not prejudice any anticipated legal proceedings. 
Catherine King, Ballarat's representative in Australia's parliament, said the ribbons decorating the town would remain a part of the landscape to carry a message of ""No More Silence"" until the unredacted report is released. Pell declined to comment on Thursday about the report.
Reflecting local anger, King honoured ""courageous survivors"" after Pell walked free.
""I think that many in the community feel very angry and hurt not just by one individual but the way in which our institutions failed so many children in our community and then compounded the harm by treating them so badly for decades.""

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan on Thursday condemned ""groundless"" accusations from the World Health Organization's (WHO) boss that racist slurs against him had come from the island, saying racism did not exist in Taiwan in an escalation of its feud with the body.
Taiwan's lack of membership of the WHO, due to pressure from China which claims the island as its own, has infuriated the Taipei government during the coronavirus outbreak. Taiwan says it has been unable to get timely information and that Taiwanese lives have become political pawns. The WHO denies this.
On Wednesday, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus rejected ""racist slurs"" against him, which he said had originated in Taiwan.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou said they ""strongly condemned and protested the groundless accusations"" which she labelled ""imaginary"".
""Taiwan is a mature and highly-accomplished advanced democratic country, and have absolutely not encouraged our people to personally attack the WHO's Director General, and what's more cannot have made any racist comments,"" Ou said.
Taiwan condemns any form of discrimination, and any attacks on the internet against the WHO's chief have nothing to do with Taiwan's Foreign Ministry nor have been instigated by it, she added.
Tedros' comments were irresponsible and he should clarify them and apologise to Taiwan, Ou said.
Taiwan is the one which has been ""politically discriminated against"" in the global health system, she added.
""The concept of racism does not exist in Taiwan. We do not have a problem of racism.""
Taiwan has been proud of its early and so far effective measures against the coronavirus, logging just 379 cases and five deaths to date, far lower than many of its neighbours.
The WHO, in a rare statement about Taiwan last month, said it was closely following the development of the coronavirus there, is learning lessons from how they are fighting it, and detailing how the WHO has been working with Taiwanese health experts. 
Taiwan says the WHO ignored its questions at the start of the coronavirus outbreak and has not shared with member states information Taiwan has provided on the coronavirus including details on its cases and prevention methods.
This is part of what it has long described as a pattern that puts it at risk because of Chinese pressure to exclude it from international bodies.
Under the slogan ""Taiwan can help"", the government last week announced the donation of 10 million faces masks to the United States, Europe and the 15 countries which still maintain formal diplomatic ties with the island.
Ou said Taiwan would donate another six million masks, to northern and eastern Europe, Latin America, Southeast Asia and U.S. states hardest hit by the pandemic.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's health minister said on Wednesday that the country's attempts to purchase thousands of ventilators from China to fight the coronavirus epidemic fell through and the government is now looking to Brazilian companies to build the devices.
""Practically all our purchases of equipment in China are not being confirmed,"" Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said at a news conference. 
An attempt to buy 15,000 ventilators in China failed and Brazil was making a new bid, he said, but the outcome is uncertain in the intense competition for medical supplies in the global pandemic.
Last week, Mandetta referred to being outbid for Chinese supplies and on Tuesday he noted ""difficulties"" in guaranteeing purchases.
In one positive sign for Brazil's supply crunch, a private company said it managed to buy 40 tonnes of masks and test kits from China, with the shipment arriving by cargo plane in Brasilia on Wednesday.
The purchase of 6 million masks and other protective equipment worth 160 million reais ($30 million) was undertaken by pharmaceutical and hospital equipment company Nutriex, based in Goiania, 220 km (138 miles) east of Brasilia. The firm plans to donate part of the order to medical institutions.
Health authorities began to sound the alarm this week over supply shortages as hospitals faced growing numbers of patients with COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus.
Confirmed cases of coronavirus infection in the country soared to 15,927 on Wednesday, with the death toll rising by 133 in just 24 hours to 800, the ministry said.
Rio de Janeiro reported the first deaths from coronavirus in the city's hillside slums, called favelas, alarming authorities who fear rapid contagion in these crowded communities that have limited access to medical care and often lack running water for hygiene.
Two of the six deaths occurred in Rocinha, one of the largest slums in South America. The virus has spread to 10 of Rio's favelas, potentially affecting 2 million people, the mayor's office said.
Mandetta reported the first case of coronavirus among the Yanomami people on the country's largest reservation for indigenous tribes and said the government plans to build a field hospital for tribes that are vulnerable to contagion. 
""We are extremely concerned about the indigenous communities,"" Mandetta said. 
Anthropologists and health experts warn that the epidemic could have a devastating impact on Brazil's 850,000 indigenous people whose lifestyle in tribal villages rules out social distancing.
President Jair Bolsonaro said in an address to the nation that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was saving lives of coronavirus patients and should be used in the initial stages of COVID-19. Due to the absence of scientific evidence on its effectiveness and safety, Brazil's health authorities limit its use to seriously ill patients who are in hospital.
Mandetta said Brazil has hired local unlisted medical equipment maker Magnamed to make 6,000 ventilators in 90 days. 

Pulp and paper companies Suzano SA and Klabin SA, planemaker Embraer SA, information technology provider Positivo Tecnologia SA and automaker Fiat Chrysler have also offered to help build ventilators, he said.

Kennedy was recovered from Chesapeake Bay off the Maryland coast on Wednesday, two days after he went missing with his mother while riding in a canoe, the New York Times reported.
The remains of 8-year-old Gideon McKean were found about 2,000 feet from where the body of his mother, Maeve Kennedy Townsend McKean, was discovered on Monday, the Times said. 
Both were last seen on Thursday getting into the canoe near a home where they were staying, owned by Townsend's mother. Townsend, 40, is the daughter of former Maryland Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and a granddaughter of Robert Kennedy, who was shot to death in 1969 while seeking the Democratic nomination for president.
Townsend's husband, David McKean, said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post this week that his wife and son had gotten into the canoe just to retrieve a ball that had been kicked into the cove, but were pulled by the wind or tide into the greater Chesapeake Bay.
""About 30 minutes later they were spotted by an onlooker from land, who saw them far out from shore, and called the police. After that last sighting, they were not seen again,"" McKean wrote.
The capsized canoe was recovered the following day, miles from where they entered the water, McKean said, and a rescue search by the U.S. Coast Guard and local authorities was called off after 24 hours.
In August 2019, a 22-year-old granddaughter of Robert Kennedy, Saorise Kennedy Hill, was found dead at the family's compound in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts, of what medical examiners determined was an accidental drug overdose.
Robert Kennedy's older brother, President John F. Kennedy, was assassinated in 1963. The president's son, John Jr., died with his wife and sister-in-law in 1999 when the plane he was piloting crashed in the Atlantic off Martha's Vineyard, not far from Hyannis Port.

(Reuters) - Women who say they were abused by deceased financier Jeffrey Epstein should not be required to sign broad liability waivers in order to get payouts from his estate, the attorney general of the U.S. Virgin Islands said on Wednesday.
The office of Attorney General Denise George said in a statement that the estate was demanding the ""broad releases,"" which would shield not only the estate but potentially other individuals from legal liability, as part of a proposed victim compensation fund.
A spokeswoman for George said people covered by the releases could include anyone linked to Epstein who was involved in trafficking or abusing girls.
""With this demand still in place, the Fund cannot ensure a fundamentally fair and legally sufficient process for victims who choose to participate,"" the attorney general said.
George's office has asked the Virgin Islands probate court, which is overseeing the estate, to resolve the dispute. The estate was valued at $636.1 million before the recent global market plunge.
Lawyers for the estate could not immediately be reached for comment.
Epstein was arrested last July on charges he abused and trafficked in women and girls from 2002 to 2005 in Manhattan and Florida and pleaded not guilty. He died on Aug. 10 last year at age 66, five weeks after his arrest and two days after signing his will, by hanging himself in his Manhattan jail cell.
George sued the estate in January, saying Epstein's sexual misconduct there stretched from 2001 to 2018 and included raping and trafficking in dozens of women and girls.
At least two dozen Epstein accusers have filed civil lawsuits against the estate. Some named Epstein's friend Ghislaine Maxwell and other alleged enablers of Epstein's abuses as defendants.
Ghislaine, whose whereabouts are currently unknown, has denied the allegations against her.

The compensation fund for Epstein's victims, which was set up by the estate, is overseen by Kenneth Feinberg and Jordana Feldman, who worked on a fund for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.

KINSHASA (Reuters) - Vital Kamerhe, the chief of staff to the president of Democratic Republic of Congo, was arrested on Wednesday after testifying in an investigation into the alleged misappropriation of public funds, police said. 
Kamerhe's arrest was a blow to President Felix Tshisekedi, who took power in January last year after campaigning on promises to clean up corruption, which watchdog groups said flourished under his long-serving predecessor, Joseph Kabila. 
Tshisekedi's spokesman, Kasongo Mwema, said: ""The president does not comment on the decisions of the justice system.""
The arrest followed hours of testimony at the public prosecutor's office. Outside, police used tear gas to disperse a large group of Kamerhe's supporters and enforce a ban on meetings of more than 20 people in response to the coronavirus pandemic. 
His supporters also protested in his hometown, Bukavu, in eastern Congo, where about 300 of them burned tyres and blocked the road outside his party headquarters.
After the testimony, Kamerhe was driven by police to the Makala prison, Sylvano Kasongo, the police chief of the capital, Kinshasa, told Reuters. 
It was not immediately clear how long Kamerhe would be held or whether he would be charged with a crime. Reuters was not immediately able to contact his lawyer. Kamerhe has denied all allegations of impropriety. 
Tshisekedi has touted his efforts to root out endemic corruption in Congo, but activists have criticised his government's spending on a $304 million public works programme as lacking transparency. 
Kamerhe, in particular, has faced scrutiny for his role in the spending on roads, bridges and social housing. 
Kamerhe's Union for the Congolese Nation (UNC) party joined forces with Tshesekedi's Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS) in the run-up to the December 2018 election. Tshisekedi promised to back the UNC's candidate in the next election in 2023.
The arrest could cause the collapse of the coalition, but that may have already been in the cards, said Jason Stearns, director of the Congo Research Group at New York University.
""The coalition was important ahead of the elections, but ever since he was inaugurated, there have been people around Tshisekedi pushing him to get rid of Vital,"" Stearns said.

DUBAI/RIYADH (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis said on Wednesday it was halting military operations nationwide in support of U.N. efforts to end a five-year war that has killed over 100,000 people and spread hunger and disease.
The move aims to facilitate talks sponsored by U.N. special envoy Martin Griffiths for a permanent ceasefire, and was decided in part to avoid a potential outbreak of the new coronavirus, though no cases have been reported so far, military coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said.
The ceasefire will go into effect at midday on Thursday for two weeks and is open to extension, he said in a statement.
The announcement is the first major breakthrough since the United Nations convened the warring parties in late 2018 in Sweden, where they signed a ceasefire in the Red Sea port city of Hodeidah.
But it is unclear if the armed Houthi movement will follow suit. Spokesman Mohammed Abdulsalam said they had sent the United Nations a comprehensive vision that includes an end to the war and to ""the blockade"" imposed on Yemen.
""(Our proposal) will lay the foundations for a political dialogue and a transitional period,"" he tweeted on Wednesday.
Hours after the coalition announcement, Yemen's information minister said the Houthis had targeted Hodeidah and the central city of Marib with missiles, while Houthi media said coalition strikes hit Hajja and Saada provinces.
Last week, U.N. envoy Griffiths sent a proposal to the internationally-recognised government, the Saudi-led coalition that supports it, and the Houthis - who control the capital Sanaa and most of northern Yemen.
Griffiths welcomed the ceasefire and called on warring parties to ""utilize this opportunity and cease immediately all hostilities with the utmost urgency, and make progress towards comprehensive and sustainable peace.""
CORONAVIRUS THREAT
The adversaries are expected to convene via video conference to discuss the proposal, which calls for halting all air, ground and naval hostilities.
A senior Saudi official, speaking to reporters in Washington, said Riyadh hoped during the next two weeks that the U.N. Security Council would help pressure the Houthis ""to stop the hostilities"", join the ceasefire ""and also to be serious in such engagement with the Yemeni government"".
The U.N. and Western allies have pointed to the threat of the coronavirus to push Yemen’s combatants to agree to fresh talks to end a war that has left millions vulnerable to disease. The United States and Britain have provided the coalition with arms, intelligence and logistics support.
Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis began back-channel talks late last year. But a recent spike in violence, including ballistic missiles fired towards Riyadh last month and retaliatory coalition air strikes, threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities.
Yemen, already the Arab world's poorest country, has been mired in violence since the Houthis ousted the government from power in Sanaa in late 2014. 
The conflict, largely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and regional arch-foe Iran, has unleashed an urgent humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the verge of famine, forced millions more to seek shelter in displacement camps and sparked outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria.
Saudi vice defence minister Prince Khalid bin Salman tweeted that the kingdom would contribute $500 million to the U.N. humanitarian response plan for Yemen in 2020 and another $25 million to help combat the spread of the coronavirus.
The United Nations appealed for more than $4 billion in 2019 for the humanitarian crisis and is expected to ask again for several billion dollars in 2020.

(Reuters) - Syrian Arab Air Force pilots flying Sukhoi Su-22 military planes and a helicopter dropped bombs containing poisonous chlorine and sarin nerve gas on a village in the country's western Hama region in March 2017, a new team at the global chemical weapons watchdog concluded in its first report.
The special investigative unit was established by members of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in 2018 to identify perpetrators of illegal attacks. Until now the OPCW had only been authorised to say whether chemical attacks occurred, not who perpetrated them.
Officials in the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and its military backer Russia have repeatedly denied using chemical weapons and accuse insurgents of staging attacks to implicate Syrian forces.
Syria’s mission to the United Nations in New York did not immediately respond to a request for comment and there was no immediate reaction from Damascus to the report. In Moscow the Russian Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement the United States concurred in the new report's findings, calling them ""the latest in a large and growing body of evidence that the Assad regime uses chemical weapons attacks in Syria as part of a deliberate campaign of violence against the Syrian people.""
Washington also assesses that Assad's government retains enough sarin and chlorine and expertise ""to use sarin, produce and deploy chlorine munitions and develop new CW (chemical weapons),"" Pompeo said. Damascus should immediately halt the production, stockpiling and use of such weapons, he said.
The OPCW Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) said more than 100 people were affected by the 2017 attacks, carried out on March 24, 25 and 30 in the town of Ltamenah.
According to the IIT report, the 50th Brigade of the 22nd Air Division of the Syrian Air Force dropped M4000 aerial bombs containing sarin on the town and a cylinder containing chlorine on a hospital. The raids were conducted from the Sharat and Hama air bases, it said. 
""Military operations of such a strategic nature as these three attacks only occur pursuant to orders from the highest levels of the Syrian Arab Armed Forces,"" it said.
While individuals were identified by the OPCW investigators, their names have been redacted from the report, which was to be circulated to the OPCW's 193 member states on Wednesday.
""There are reasonable grounds to believe that the perpetrators ... were individuals belonging to the Syrian Arab Air Force,"" OPCW team leader Santiago Onate-Laborde said.
The OPCW's identification team is not a judicial body and it will be up to OPCW's members, the U.N. Secretary General and the international community to ""take any further action they deem appropriate and necessary"", OPCW chief Fernando Arias said.
An attack on the Syrian town of Douma led U.S. President Donald Trump to carry out missile strikes on Syrian government targets in April 2018 with the backing of France and Britain.
Created in 1997, the OPCW was initially a technical body to enforce a global non-proliferation treaty. It has become the focus of diplomatic conflict between Syria and Russia on one side and the United States, France and Britain on the other.

""But now is not that time."" 
His statement came after U.S. President Donald Trump sharply criticized the World Health Organization on Tuesday, accusing it of being too focused on China and issuing bad advice during the new coronavirus outbreak. He also said Washington was considering putting a hold on its funding for the organization.

The centre-right parties, rivals who have alternated in power throughout the nation's history but have never formed a coalition together, need the support of at least one smaller party or eight independent lawmakers to reach a majority.
While a number of the 20 independents in the fractured 160-seat parliament are willing to join, the smaller parties being courted have so far refused to consider it. 
Acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and his acting finance minister, Paschal Donohoe, have said the participation of a third party is a precondition of Fine Gael continuing in office.
""We are working on an agreed position paper, we will have it published in the next day or so and we are hoping that, when it is published, it will attract other political parties to consider coming into government,"" acting Business Minister Heather Humphreys of Fine Gael told a news conference.
Fianna Fail justice spokesman Jim O'Callaghan gave a similar timeframe for the publication of the document in an interview with national broadcaster RTE.
Both parties steadfastly refuse to govern with the left-wing, pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein party, which surged to 37 seats in the February election, the same number held by Fianna Fail and two more than Fine Gael's 35.

Humphreys said the agreement with Fianna Fail will reflect the changed environment after the acting government has already committed close to 10 billion euros to support the economy through the coronavirus, almost as much spending as most parties based their election manifestos on for the next five years.

Differences over the prisoner release question have been complicating U.S. brokered attempts to create a lasting peace agreement to end more than 18 years of conflict in Afghanistan.
""The government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan released 100 Taliban prisoners today based on their health condition, age and length of remaining sentence, as part of our efforts for peace,"" said Javid Faisal, a spokesman for the Afghan National Security Council, which has been negotiating with the Taliban. 
A February pact between the United States and the Taliban, under which U.S.-led international forces will withdraw in phases in exchange for Taliban security guarantees, is the best chance to reduce U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan.
But peace hinges on talks between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the militants. A prisoner exchange is meant to build confidence on both sides for those talks.

Despite this week's setbacks over the prisoner releases, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said progress had been made since he visited Kabul on March 23 and also met Taliban officials in Qatar to iron out the differences.

GENEVA (Reuters) - World Health Organization officials on Wednesday denied that the body was ""China-centric"" and said that the acute phase of a pandemic was not the time to cut funding, after U.S. President Donald Trump said he may put contributions on hold.
The United States is the top donor to the Geneva-based body which Trump said had issued bad advice during the new coronavirus outbreak.
U.S. contributions to WHO in 2019 exceeded $400 million, almost double the 2nd largest country donor, according to figures from the U.S. State Department. China contributed $44 million, it said.
""We are still in the acute phase of a pandemic so now is not the time to cut back on funding,"" Dr Hans Kluge, WHO regional director for Europe, told a virtual briefing when asked about Trump's remarks.
Trump told a news conference on Tuesday that the United States was ""going to put a hold on money spent to the WHO,"" however, he appeared to backtrack later when in response to questions he said: ""We're going to look at it.""
It was not immediately clear how Trump could ""block"" funding for the organization. Under U.S. law, Congress, not the president, decides how federal funds are spent.
Dr Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the WHO Director-General, also defended the U.N. agency's relationship with China, saying its work with Beijing authorities was important to understand the outbreak which began in Wuhan in December.
""It was absolutely critical in the early part of this outbreak to have full access to everything possible, to get on the ground and work with the Chinese to understand this,"" he told reporters.
""This is what we did with every other hard-hit country like Spain and had nothing to do with China specifically.""
Aylward, who led a WHO expert mission to China in February, defended WHO recommendations to keep borders open, saying that China had worked ""very hard"" to identify and detect early cases and their contacts and ensure they did not travel.
""China worked very, hard very early on, once it understood what it was dealing with, to try and identify and detect all potential cases to make sure that they got tested to trace all the close contacts and make sure they were quarantined so they actually knew where the virus was, where the risk was,"" he said.
""Then they made it very clear that these people would not and could not travel within the country, let alone internationally,"" he added.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has been lavish in his praise of China from early in the outbreak, praising President Xi Jinping's ""rare leadership"".
David Heymann, a professor at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine who led WHO's response to the 2003 SARS outbreak, said that any U.S. funding cut would be a huge blow.

""If the WHO loses its funding it cannot continue to do its work. It works on a shoe-string budget already,"" Heymann said in London. ""Of course it would be disastrous for the WHO to lose funding.""

The victims, 31 men and boys and eight women whose ages ranged from 15 to 44, were discovered in October in a container at the back of a truck driven by Robinson to an industrial estate in Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (32 km) east of London.
Most were from Nghe An and Ha Tinh provinces in north-central Vietnam, where poor job prospects, environmental disasters and the promise of financial reward fuel migration.
Robinson, 25, had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing in November to charges of conspiring to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring cash which he knew or suspected came from criminal conduct.
At Wednesday's hearing at the Old Bailey, London's Central Criminal Court, a second man who was also charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, British-Romanian dual national Gheorghe Nica, pleaded not guilty, the BBC reported. 
Several others have been arrested and charged in both Vietnam and the United Kingdom, and other legal proceedings are ongoing.
Autopsies concluded that the provisional cause of death of the 39 Vietnamese people was a combination of hypoxia, or oxygen deprivation, and hyperthermia, or overheating, in an enclosed space.

57,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 10:52AM ET</span>","Israelis mark Passover, a celebration of freedom, in virtual isolation","By Rami Ayyub
JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The Jewish Passover holiday typically draws crowds of Israelis outside to burn heaps of leavened bread, commemorating the Biblical exodus from slavery in Egypt. 
But on Wednesday, a coronavirus lockdown meant the streets of Jerusalem and other cities were nearly empty on the first day of the week-long holiday, when they would normally be dotted with fires and columns of smoke.
Israel this week imposed holiday restrictions to try to halt the spread of the disease.
Jews may only celebrate the traditional ""seder"" meal that kicks off the April 8-15 holiday season with immediate family. Travel between cities is banned until Friday.
A full curfew took effect on Wednesday, just before the seder begins, and will last until Thursday, prompting a dash for last-minute shopping, which saw long lines of Israelis wearing face masks outside grocery stores.
Police have thrown up roadblocks and will deploy drones and helicopters to enforce curbs on movement throughout the lockdown, a spokesman said. 
But some areas found workarounds to keep festive traditions alive in a month that will also see Christians celebrate Easter and Muslims mark the beginning of the holy month of Ramadan. 
The Jerusalem municipality on Wednesday collected leavened products from designated dumpsters outside peoples' homes and took them away to be burned in a large open area on the city's outskirts. 
A rabbi accompanied by a firefighter tossed a long, fire-tipped stick onto a patch of flammable liquid leading to a pile of the leavened bread products, many still in plastic bags, engulfing the mound in smoke and flames. 
LEAVENED BREAD
One Jerusalem man, Daniel Arusti, disposed of a paper bread box in one of the dumpsters outside his house, instead of gathering with his ultra-Orthodox community to burn it in public. 
""Next year ... when there will hopefully be no (coronavirus) threat, we'll be able to come and redo public burning of chametz (leavened bread) together, as we should,"" Arusti said. 
Throughout Passover, Jews abide by special dietary laws which include eating unleavened bread known as matzo. The tradition marks a Book of Exodus tale that the Jews did not have time to prepare leavened bread before leaving for the promised land. 
But in the ultra-Orthodox Jerusalem neighbourhood of Mea Shearim, some Israelis flouted the restrictions and gathered in small groups or by themselves to burn leaven alongside the district's sandstone homes and concrete walls. 
Some ultra-Orthodox have heeded rabbis who, distrusting the state, spurned Health Ministry restrictions.
Unable to gather in person, other Israelis plan to hold the seder with friends and extended family online by video conferencing platforms. 
The holiday restrictions added to anti-virus measures that have seen Israelis largely confined to their homes, forcing many businesses to close and sending unemployment to 25%. 

Israel has reported more than 9,400 cases and at least 71 deaths from COVID-19, according to Health Ministry data.

58,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 08, 2020 09:31AM ET</span>",Trump holds support of political base in virus-prone states,"By Saundra Amrhein, Tim Reid, Julia Harte and Ryan McNeill
(Reuters) - Earl Kerr, a 57-year-old electrical contractor in Jacksonville, Florida, says he fears for his 80-year-old mother, who entered an assisted living facility just before the coronavirus pandemic hit the United States. And he says he worries that the tanking economy will sink his small business.
But he has faith in U.S. President Donald Trump to handle the crisis. He’s heard the widespread criticism that Trump initially didn’t take the pandemic seriously, that his administration failed to procure vital medical supplies and left overwhelmed states to fend for themselves. Kerr has a different take.
""He’s not God. He can’t foresee the future or see that the virus can do this or that,” said Kerr, who voted for Trump in 2016 and plans to again in November. “He’s doing the best he can with the information that he gets.”
Continued support from voters like Kerr could prove critical to Trump’s re-election bid - especially because the regions where the president has drawn support often overlap with those most vulnerable to the pandemic, a Reuters analysis shows. The analysis found one in five of Trump’s 2016 voters live in areas where health and economic factors heighten their risks from the coronavirus. Kerr is among 30 voters interviewed by Reuters who live in such at-risk metropolitan areas in Florida, Ohio and West Virginia and who voted for Trump in 2016 or support him now.
The interviews, along with the latest Reuters/Ipsos polling data, show stalwart support among Trump’s political base amid the worst public health crisis in a century, with a rising U.S. death toll that has now surpassed 12,700, predictions of an economic depression, and the U.S. stock market's biggest first-quarter loss in history. But neither has Trump enjoyed the dramatic gains in popularity that past presidents have sometimes seen during crises, when patriotism often runs high - illustrating a hardening of the bitter partisanship that has been the hallmark of his administration.
Before the pandemic, the president had trumpeted a soaring economy and record-low unemployment to woo the moderate and independent voters he needs to win the election - especially in key battleground states such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida. That pitch evaporated in the pandemic, making perceptions of his emergency response all the more crucial. Recent polls in Florida and Wisconsin showed Trump trailing Biden by between three and six points.
Perceptions of crisis response have had a pivotal impact on the popularity of past presidents. The experience of George W. Bush - the last Republican president, also a polarizing figure - provides a vivid example of partisanship breaking down in some of the nation’s darkest times. Bush’s approval rating soared to more than 90% after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, according to Gallup polling. But that figure fell below 40% after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and bottomed out at 25% during the 2008 financial crisis, helping Democrat Barack Obama beat Republican challenger John McCain in that year’s election.
Trump’s approval rating, by contrast, has remained steady throughout his presidency and has ranged between 40% and 44% since the onset of the U.S. coronavirus crisis in early March, buoyed by the support of 85% of Republicans, according to the latest April 6-7 Reuters/Ipsos poll. That job rating makes November’s election highly competitive, experts say, though the political landscape could shift as the pandemic continues to claim lives and jobs. (For a graphic of the poll results, see https://reut.rs/39TtJm4) 
Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said voters continue to support the president in part because he acted early, in late January, to restrict travel from China and appoint a coronavirus task force. ""He also has an optimistic view of America and wants to get us moving as soon as it is safe, while also listening to the medical experts,"" Murtaugh said.
The condemnation of Trump’s response is just as overwhelming among Democrats, nearly 89% of whom disapprove of his job performance, little changed from pre-crisis levels, the poll showed. Independents remain split, with 53% disapproving of the president’s performance and 42% approving.
Trump trails Joe Biden, the Democratic front-runner, even with the publicity advantage Trump now enjoys as he appears in daily briefings while Biden has isolated himself from the disease in his Delaware home, issuing little-noticed commentary. Registered voters supported Biden by 43% to 37%, according to the April 6-7 poll.
Kyle Kondik, a University of Virginia political analyst, said the hyper-partisan divide over Trump limits both his political upside and his downside in the crisis.
""People who predict this president will suffer long-term approval dips have been wrong throughout his presidency,"" he said.

‘IT’S NOT HIS FAULT’
Nearly all the Trump supporters interviewed by Reuters said the media and Democrats are unfairly blaming him for a problem that no one could have predicted.
Several still likened the new coronavirus to a seasonal flu - echoing Trump comments early in the crisis - even after the president’s own characterization of the outbreak had changed and his advisers said this virus is 10 times more fatal. The voters interviewed lauded Trump for the $2.2 trillion rescue package passed by Congress. They believe the pandemic's economic fall-out means that the country needs Trump - a businessman - more than ever to steer it out of doldrums.
Many said he's doing the best possible job in an impossible situation.
""It’s not his fault that this happened,"" Barbara Raccina, 76, of Jacksonville Beach, Florida, who voted for Trump in 2016 and will do so again in November. ""I think he’s trying to help as much as he can. The rest is up to us to stay indoors.""
Raccina and the other voters interviewed live in areas that supported Trump in 2016 and are now especially vulnerable to the pandemic. The Reuters analysis identified the areas through data from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Reuters examined the percentage of people who smoke, have asthma or other conditions that can raise the risk of dying from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The analysis also factored in economic data including unemployment and the percentage of the local workers in retail, who are likely to lose their paychecks in the pandemic as stores close.
John O’Neill, 61, lives in one of those vulnerable regions - Middletown, Ohio, a metropolitan area Trump won with 56% of the vote in 2016. Middletown has among the nation’s highest percentage of people who smoke, have the lung disease COPD, or have heart conditions, all thought to make COVID-19 more dangerous.
Currently unemployed, O'Neill hopes to find work in a warehouse - a setting with potentially high virus exposure - and has been diagnosed with COPD. He said he’s not concerned about the virus.
“We have 10,000 people die each year of the flu,” he said, “and they don’t shut businesses down.""
O’Neill said he takes comfort from the medical experts advising Trump, such as Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease official, who appears alongside the president at televised briefings. Fauci has become something of a cult hero - often praised by commentators with media outlets the president blasts as liberal-leaning because Fauci has publicly contradicted Trump’s assurances that the pandemic was under control.
O’Neill views Fauci as one of the president’s trusted advisors.
“If Fauci and them are telling him, ‘No, we shouldn’t be doing this,’ I’m sure Trump will listen to them,"" he said.

'TRYING TO GIVE US HOPE’
With the crisis still in its early days, Trump's supporters are mindful of the risk that supporters' confidence in his crisis response could fade if death tolls mount and stocks continue to tumble.
None of the voters who spoke to Reuters have yet lost a family member to the virus. Compared to other parts of the United States, there have been few confirmed cases in the parts of Florida, Ohio, and West Virginia that Reuters examined, in part because fewer tests are being taken in those areas.
Out of the 30 Trump voters, Reuters found only one whose support has been shaken by the president's pandemic response - a registered Republican in Cincinnati in his 30s, who asked not to be identified.
After the first U.S. case was reported in January, Trump repeatedly insisted it was nothing to worry about and would disappear ""like a miracle."" As recently as late March, Trump suggested scaling back coronavirus restrictions by Easter to revive the economy, before eventually extending social distancing guidelines through April.
The Cincinnati voter said he is considering voting for Biden in November.
Another voter who supported Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016, however, said she will back Trump this time. Amy Frasure, 32, of southern Ohio’s Lawrence County, runs an advertising agency across the border in West Virginia. She said it makes sense that Trump has provided a more upbeat assessment than state governors, who have to raise the alarm to effectively deal with public health and economic disasters on the front lines.
Trump’s job, she said, is “to make us more comfortable with the fact that there’s something crazy going on.”
Some of those who continue to support Trump said the president could have taken a more serious tone on the pandemic.
“It bothers me a little when (Trump) says everyone should be back to work by Easter, business booming, things like that,” said Mary Cogan, 52, vice-chair of the Republican Party in Lawrence County. “But then... I think he is probably just trying to give our nation hope.""
Cogan, who called Trump’s overall crisis response “awesome,” said every local Republican she knows remains steadfast in their Trump support. She expects the county, where 70% of voters supported Trump in 2016, to back him again.

“He will reign here in Lawrence County,” she said.

The 43-year-old died on Sunday from burns sustained in the incident a day earlier. Her death was reported by Indonesian media on Tuesday.
Police said on Wednesday they believed the suspects who set the fire had not burned her intentionally. They identified six suspects, three of whom had been arrested.
Budhi Herdi Susianto, the North Jakarta police chief, said the suspects had accused the woman of stealing and doused her with petrol. One of the suspects had lit a match, but did not intend to burn her, the police chief said.
The suspects could be charged with physical violence, carrying a maximum sentence of 12 years.
Usman Hamid, the Indonesian representative of Amnesty International, told Reuters it seemed too early for the police to conclude that there was no intent to set the woman on fire.
""The police need take investigative actions that are impartial and independent. They can't seem like the perpetrators' lawyers,"" he said.
Andreas Harsono, a researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the incident was indicative of a rise in hostility and vilification of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community.
""Her death should be a reminder to many Indonesians that transgender women deserve justice and equal rights,"" he said.
""Thousands of transgender women, gay men or lesbian women have been humiliated in Indonesia these past few years.""
Homosexuality is not regulated by law in Indonesia, except in Aceh province where same-sex relations are banned under sharia law. But growing social and religious conservatism has driven escalating vitriol toward sexual minorities in the world's most populous Muslim-majority country. 
Indonesia's transgender community is locally known as ""waria"" - a combination of the Indonesian words for ""woman"" and ""man.""

Founded in 1841, the title - often known as the JC - said the liquidation was expected to be finalised in the coming two to three weeks and it would make every effort to continue to publish over that time.
""Devastating news for us,"" said Stephen Pollard, editor of the Jewish Chronicle.
""I won't be saying anything beyond confirming that the paper will be out as usual next week, and we have every intention of avoiding any interruption,"" Pollard said.
The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has hammered marketing budgets, forcing media groups around the world to reduce staffing numbers, cut costs and halt publication of some titles. 
""Despite the heroic efforts of the editorial and production team at the newspaper, it has become clear that the Jewish Chronicle will not be able to survive the impact of the current coronavirus epidemic in its current form,"" the JC said in a statement. 
The Kessler Foundation, owners of the newspaper, said it was working to secure a future for the title after the liquidation.
The Guardian newspaper reported that staff had been told the parent company had run out of money during the lockdown. 
The London-based Jewish Chronicle says it strives to reflect a wide diversity of Jewish religious, social and political thought across the spectrum, both Orthodox and secular.
In one of the newspaper's most notable interviews, the JC in 1981 spoke to then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who described Israel's attack on an Iraqi nuclear plant as a step towards international anarchy.

The decision comes as a blow to Poland and its ruling euroskeptic Law and Justice party (PiS), which has been at odds with the EU's executive arm, over its judiciary reforms since it took power in 2015.
Critics say the disciplinary chamber is not sufficiently independent as its members were selected by a body chosen mostly by the parliament, in which Poland's ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has a majority.
The Commission - the guardian of EU law, which takes precedence over national law - asked the European Court of Justice in January to suspend the chamber. 
""Member State should ensure that the disciplinary regime applicable to judges of the national courts...complies with the principle of the independence of the judiciary,"" the European Court of Justice said in a statement justifying the decision.
""As a result, the Court grants the Commission's application for interim measures,"" it also said. 
A Polish government spokesman was not immediately available to comment. Poland has previously pushed back on accusations that the chamber is not sufficiently independent. 
""The ECJ does not have the competence to judge or to suspend constitutional national bodies of member states. Today's ruling is a usurping act that infringes on sovereignty,"" deputy justice minister Sebastian Kaleta said in a tweet reacting to the ECJ's decision.
Warsaw has already lost several cases in the EU’s top court brought by the Commission. The EU now wants to make Poland’s access to tens of billions of euros in the bloc’s next long-term budget conditional on observing the rule of law.
The disciplinary chamber was created in 2017, along with a disciplinary ombudsman who investigates and directs cases against judges to the chamber, after new legislation was introduced by the PiS-led parliament. 
Designed to be a new disciplinary regime for judges, the panel has the power to cut their salaries and suspend them from their work. Critics say it can be used to muzzle judges critical of the ruling party's reforms. 
A Polish judge, Pawel Juszczyszyn, was suspended earlier this year by the chamber in part for questioning the validity of judges in the National Judiciary Council, a body that critics say is not independent as it was appointed by parliament.
""The chamber functions in line with Polish law...EU treaties do not regulate at all the judiciary systems of particular member states,"" a government spokesman said in January.
PiS says its legislation is aimed at preventing chaos in the Polish judiciary.

The Berlin fire service said in a Tweet that smoke was coming from building materials and two bitumen boilers, adding that one person was injured and about 80 emergency services staff were on the scene.
A photograph posted by the fire service on Twitter showed black smoke rising in front of the entrance to the new palace from a construction area cordoned off from the main road.
Berlin police said on Twitter there was no indication that the fire was started deliberately but said investigators would look into the cause after the fire is extinguished.
Construction on the palace started in 2012. The building, which will house a museum and cultural centre, is due to open later this year. 
The costs for the building have risen to 644 million euros ($699 million)from an initially planned 552 million, with federal state funds meeting most of the bill.
Prussia’s Hohenzollern dynasty used the 18th century baroque palace as its winter residence until the end of World War One when Germany’s last emperor, Wilhelm II, was forced to abdicate.
It served as a museum under the Weimar Republic but was largely neglected by the Nazis.
Badly damaged in World War Two, the East German communists later demolished it to make way for a grand square and a new parliament building, the Palace of the Republic. That building was razed in 2008 after much heated debate.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's coveted 'AAA' credit rating came under threat on Wednesday as the country's parliament returned to pass an emergency A$130 billion ($80 billion) stimulus package to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus pandemic.
Australia's government and central bank have so far pledged A$320 billion in financial support as the coronavirus pandemic shuts companies and leaves many unemployed.
""The COVID-19 outbreak has dealt Australia a severe economic and fiscal shock,"" S&P said as it lowered the outlook on the country's 'AAA' sovereign rating to ""negative"" from ""stable"". 
""We expect the Australian economy to plunge into recession for the first time in almost 30 years, causing a substantial deterioration of the government's fiscal headroom at the 'AAA' rating level.""
A triple-A credit rating is given to only a select group of countries with the strongest finances in the world. The rating means a country can easily meet its financial commitments, has the lowest risk of default and can borrow money more cheaply. 
S&P's decision came as a pared back version of Australia's parliament votes on the government's third tranche of fiscal measures on Wednesday. Fewer than normal lawmakers were present for the one-day sitting to minimise the risk of the virus spreading. 
""When Australian lives and livelihoods are threatened, when they are under attack, our nation's sovereignty is put at risk, and we must respond,"" Prime Minister Scott Morrison said of the special sitting.
Citing the threat of a prolonged economic downturn, Morrison's government has promised to spend A$130 billion over the next six months to subsidise the wages of 6 million Australians.
Morrison had earlier promised one-off payments to small and medium-sized businesses and the opposition Labor Party has said it will back the stimulus packages.
But most economists predict the worst recession in Australia's history regardless, with the unemployment rate expected to double to near 10%. 
The Reserve Bank of Australia on Tuesday predicted a ""very large"" economic contraction in the current quarter as restrictions to slow the spread of coronavirus bite. 
HORRIBLE SITUATION
Australia has for weeks curtailed people's movements, limited social gatherings and forced many businesses in the hospitality, retail, transport and education sectors to shut. 
Those businesses that remain open face falling sales and increasing operational restrictions.
The restrictions have helped slow the spread of coronavirus in Australia. The number of new cases has grown by around 2% in recent days, well below the 25% daily growth that was being recorded last month.
Australia now has just shy of 6,000 cases, with 50 deaths.
Although the spread of the virus has slowed, authorities have warned against complacency.
""The virus doesn't take a holiday,"" Health Minister Greg Hunt told reporters in Canberra.
Hunt said Australia will distribute 11 million face masks that have been acquired to hospitals and local doctors, some of whom have complained about a lack of protective equipment.
The early success in controlling the spread of the virus has fanned speculation some of the mobility restrictions could be eased from the beginning of May.
The New South Wales (NSW) state premier Gladys Berejiklian said in a televised briefing in Sydney that ""there could be a chance, if the health experts deem it appropriate"".
However, she warned lifting restrictions could lead to a second wave of infections. NSW is the country's worst affected state accounting for almost half the total infections.

""Every time you relax a restriction, more people will get sick. More people will die. And it's a horrible situation to be in, but they're the choices and we need to be up-front about that.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A powerful tropical cyclone battered the South Pacific island nation of Fiji on Wednesday, witnesses said, destroying buildings and causing injuries in Suva, the capital, pressuring a population already bracing for the coronavirus outbreak.
Cyclone Harold, its strength ranked in the highest category of five, passed over Fiji's south at about midday, levelling homes and snapping communications links in the archipelago, which has adopted curbs on movement to rein in the virus.
""We've seen reports of injuries,"" Vasiti Soko, the director of the National Disaster Management Office, said by telephone.
""As to the number, as well as the intensity, of the injuries, that's yet to be ascertained.""
There were no immediate reports of deaths, but about 10 houses in Suva were reported destroyed, Soko added.
Flooded streets, wild winds and ruined buildings on the country's main island home to Suva featured in unverified video images and photographs circulated on social media. 
Emergency officials were scrambling to establish contact with the southern island of Kapavu, after the storm severed communications with it, Soko added.
The ferocious storm has cut a path through the Pacific, which is already on high alert for an outbreak of the flu-like virus that has infected 1.4 million people globally and killed 82,000.
Although Fiji has just 15 infections and no deaths, Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama has banned unnecessary gatherings of more than 20 people, among other curbs.
Bainimarama urged all Fijians to stay indoors unless told to evacuate.
""Our evacuation centres are safe, they are sanitised and monitored to ensure they do not surpass capacity,"" he said in In a social media posting on Wednesday.
""Those under quarantine due to the threat of coronavirus will not mix with others.""

The cyclone, which has killed dozens in the Solomon Islands before destroying buildings in Vanuatu, was expected to make its way to Tonga within days, weather forecasters said.

""I followed this process very closely. I'm concerned about free and fair elections and the quality of voting, of the legality and constitutionality of such a vote,"" she told the newspaper. 
Poland's parliament, where Poland's ruling nationalists, the Law and Justice (PiS) party, have a majority in alliance with two other parties, this week backed a plan to conduct the presidential election on May 10 by postal ballot to limit the risks of coronavirus transmission.
Critics accuse PiS of putting its political interests ahead of public health concerns. President Andrzej Duda, an ally of PiS who is seeking a fresh five-year term, is currently ahead in opinion polls.
""Postal voting is a huge change and such a method is being used for the first time, people aren't used to it,"" Jourova said.
She pointed to recommendations from the Council of Europe for countries not to carry out ""fundamental changes"" to electoral rules in the year leading up to elections. 
Winning the presidential election would enable PiS to cement its reforms of the judiciary, which the European Union has said subvert the rule of law. A president hostile to PiS could block its efforts.
The European Commission is still working on its reaction to a new Polish law that critics say is designed to muzzle judges who question court appointments under new rules, Jourova added.

Poland's overhaul of its judiciary constitutes “destruction” not reform, Jourova said earlier this year.

BEIJING (Reuters) - As the world grapples with the escalating coronavirus pandemic, China reopened the city of Wuhan on Wednesday, allowing its 11 million residents to leave for the first time in over two months, a milestone in its effort to combat the outbreak.
But while the operation to contain Wuhan's coronavirus outbreak has been hailed as a success by China and many international health experts, it didn't come easy.
Using virus case data, official reports and over a dozen interviews with officials, residents and scientists in Wuhan, Reuters has compiled a comprehensive account of how the military-style quarantine of the city unfolded.
SCIENTIST TOUR
Wuhan health authorities reported the first case of what turned out to be the new coronavirus in December, and the first known death linked to the virus in early January.
City officials insisted the situation was under control for the first two weeks of January, downplaying the possibility of human-to-human transmission as they focused on a seafood and wildlife market where the outbreak was believed to have started.
But troubling signs were emerging.
Hospital respiratory wards began reaching capacity by around Jan 12, and some people were being turned away, a half dozen Wuhan residents told Reuters. 
But at least up to Jan. 16, Wuhan's government said that no new cases of the disease had occurred for about two weeks, and the city continued as normal. Diners packed restaurants, shoppers flocked to commercial districts, and travellers headed to train stations and airports for their Lunar New Year holidays.
Minimal measures were put in place to take the temperatures of residents in public places, or encourage them to wear protective masks, residents said. 
""We ordinary people did not know that we needed to take protective measures,"" said Wang Wenjun, whose uncle died of the coronavirus on Jan 31.
But that changed after Jan 18, when a team of scientists sent by the central government in Beijing arrived in Wuhan.
Leading the group was 83-year-old Zhong Nanshan, an epidemiologist credited with raising the alarm in China about the spread of another coronavirus, SARS, in 2003. Over two days, the team investigated the source and scale of Wuhan's outbreak, inspecting the seafood and wildlife market and other sites.
As the scientists toured Wuhan, their mood darkened as the scale of the crisis became clear, said a source familiar with the trip.
A day before the scientists arrived, four new cases were confirmed in Wuhan, none of which had apparent links to the market.
That cast doubt over local authorities' previous assertions that there was no substantial evidence of human-to-human transmission, which would have required them to impose drastic containment measures on the city.
The scientists' visit was the third by an expert group since the end of December as suspicion in Beijing grew that the virus was transmissible and local officials had concealed the challenges they faced containing the disease, according to an academic on the Jan 18 trip and a scientist who visited on Jan 2. Another trip took place on Jan 8.
During the Jan 18 visit, the team made several discoveries that had been previously undisclosed to the public by local officials.
Over a dozen healthcare workers had been infected, efforts to track close contacts with other confirmed cases had dwindled, and hospitals had not conducted a single test before Jan. 16, Zhong and other experts on the team announced a few days after their trip to Wuhan.
On Jan 19, the group of about a half dozen scientists returned to Beijing, where they reported their findings to the National Health Commission, which formulates China's health policy.
The experts recommended that Wuhan be put under quarantine and that hospital capacity be rapidly expanded, according to two sources who were briefed on the discussions. Zhong himself had suggested the lockdown measures, they said. Zhong and the commission did not respond to requests for comment.
One of the sources said the proposal was initially rejected by Wuhan government officials because they feared the economic impact, but they were overruled by the central authorities.
On the evening of Jan 20, the central government set up a taskforce in Wuhan to spearhead the fight against the epidemic.
The lockdown of Wuhan had been put in motion.
Ye Qing, deputy chief of the statistics bureau in Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, said it was only when Zhong announced his findings that he began to realize the seriousness of this epidemic.
Wuhan officials, he said, reacted far too late. ""If the government had sent out a notice, if they had asked everyone to wear masks, to do temperature checks, maybe a lot fewer people would have died.""
He added: ""It's a painful lesson with blood and tears.""
Later tracing of virus patients showed that people confirmed to have the virus travelled from Wuhan to at least 25 provinces, municipalities and administrative regions across China before the lockdown plan went into action.
The Wuhan government and the National Health Commission in Beijing did not respond to requests for comment.
LOCKDOWN
The ripple effects of events in Beijing were soon felt in Wuhan.
On Jan 22, senior officials in Wuhan received a written government notice telling them not to leave the city, or report their whereabouts if they had, according to two local government sources.
The directive offered no further details, but at about 8 p.m. that night, some officials received notice by telephone that the city would be shut off the next morning, the sources said.
The lockdown was publicly announced at 2 a.m., sending thousands of Wuhan residents scrambling to find a way out.
But access into and out of the city was quickly closed off, with public transportation shut down and the use of private cars banned. Residents were soon after restricted to their homes.
Having seized control of the crisis, Beijing also removed a number of key officials from Wuhan and Hubei province.
Wuhan's mayor, Zhou Xianwang, who kept his job, made a frank admission in an interview with state media a few days later that party-reporting mechanisms had stifled early action.
""Information should have been released more quickly,"" he said. The process had been slowed by officials in Wuhan being ""obliged to seek permission"" before fully disclosing information to the public, he said.
'NEW NORMAL'
Almost two months after the lockdown was imposed, China has started allowing residents to leave the city, as well as permitting domestic flights and inter-city trains. Wuhan has reported just one new case in the past week, and around 93% of all cases have recovered, according to official data.
As other countries consider Wuhan-style quarantines, those numbers have come under increased scrutiny, however. U.S. President Donald Trump said last week that China's numbers were ""on the light side,"" drawing the ire of Beijing.
China has also only just begun reporting data on asymptomatic cases – those in which carriers can transmit the disease without feeling symptoms - in the past week. That followed a public backlash on social media in China that the key numbers had been omitted from the official tally, raising concerns that such cases could lead to a second wave of infections.
Xue Lan, a professor at Tsinghua University who is a member of a government coronavirus task force, said precautions put in place for the lockdown – like social distancing - would likely  become a part of life in the future in China.

""From now on our social lives will enter a new normal,"" Xue said.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A California appeals court on Tuesday threw out criminal charges including rape and human trafficking against the leader of a Mexico-based church, ruling he was denied his right to a speedy preliminary hearing in the high-profile case.The ruling appears to mean that Naason Joaquin Garcia, head and self-styled apostle of the Guadalajara-based evangelical church La Luz del Mundo (Light of the World), must be released from custody. 
A spokeswoman for the California Attorney General's Office, which filed the charges against Garcia, 50, and two co-defendants, said only that prosecutors were ""reviewing the court's decision."" 
The church referred questions from Reuters about the case to Garcia's attorney, who could not be reached for comment on Tuesday. The next hearing in the case is scheduled for May 8 in Los Angeles. 
La Luz del Mundo is the largest evangelical church in Mexico, dating back to 1920s. The church, which now has branches in 50 countries and boasts more than 5 million members, rejects a mainstream Christian doctrine of the Holy Trinity, adhering to what its leaders say are the earliest Christian teachings. 
The unusual ruling by the California Second District Court of Appeals stems from a string of delays in the case since the attorney general's office filed charges in June 2019 against Garcia, along with Alondra Ocampo and Susana Medina Oaxaca.
The three defendants were accused of committing 26 felony crimes in Southern (NYSE:SO) California between 2015 and 2018, listing three minors and a woman as victims of the sexual abuse. A fourth defendant, Azalea Rangel Melendez, remains a fugitive. There was no immediate indication whether the three co-defendants would also be released.
Following his arrest, Garcia was ordered held on $50 million bail, which prosecutors said reflected fears Garcia would flee to Mexico using church funds.
According to the appeals court's 33-page written ruling, a Los Angeles judge who postponed proceedings in the complex case several times failed to give Garcia his right to a speedy preliminary hearing and did not obtain a waiver of that right from the defendant.
In February, a 33-year-old U.S. woman, Sochil Martin, sued La Luz del Mundo church leaders, claiming they enslaved, sexually abused and trafficked her from childhood until she fled some three years ago.
""The (appeals court decision) does not judge Naason Joaquin Garcia for his guilt or innocence, but addresses a procedural technicality,"" Martin's attorney said in a written statement.
""It does nothing to change the fact that for years, as the leader of the La Luz del Mundo, he sexually, physically and emotionally abused hundreds of minors and adults.""

A former editor of The Times and the Sunday Times of London, Evans was knighted for services to journalism in 2004. Opinions expressed here are his own.)
By Harold Evans
NEW YORK (Reuters) - It's 1940. The winter evenings are getting colder. I'm huddled with my parents around the radio listening to future Queen Elizabeth calm us with her promise that ""the world of tomorrow will be a better and happier place."" It's much more effective than Neville Chamberlain's woeful announcement months before in 1939 that we were at war with Germany. ""He feels more sorry for himself than he does for us,"" said my mother at the time. Elizabeth cheers us.
We needed it. Just a few weeks earlier, one year and six days on from the start of Hitler's war to seize the whole of Europe, the sky above London had become clouded with German Heinkels. The dark line stretched on and on across the horizon. Royal Air Force Hurricanes and Spitfires scrambled to reach the German bombers screened by layers of yellow-nosed Messerschmitts, 617 of them to escort 348 raiders. A second wave arrived at 6 p.m. over a blazing dockland. At 8:07 p.m., British military command sent all units a one-word signal: Cromwell. It let them know the invasion was about to begin. Church bells rang. 
It was a false alarm; the invasion never came. But the devastation from the 337 tons of bombs was real. Some 448 Londoners died, 250,000 were made homeless, 170,000 were driven to sleep in underground stations. The blitz went on for 76 nights, but never broke the spirit expressed in the emblematic photograph of St Paul's cathedral, shining whole and undamaged amid the smoke and fires.
My family escaped much of that since at the time we were living in blissful ignorance 220 miles to the north in Manchester, home base for my father, a locomotive driver, who was out there in the blackness delivering truckloads of shells for anti-aircraft defenses. ""You'll see they won't want to bother us, we're too far north"" was the street wisdom, as if the Germans would fail to notice our great Manchester factories producing hundreds of bombers, including the legendary Lancaster (""dam buster"") bombers.
I concentrated on collecting every scrap of good news brought into the house by The Daily Express and still have the series of pages I pasted up to celebrate RAF raids against Germany and the sinking of U-boats. I ignored all our setbacks. I felt so passionately we should win the war. I devoured movies of adventure and heroism like ""Stagecoach"" and ""Custer's Last Stand,"" looking for ""can do"" stories of American resolution.
The ferocity was turned against us in Manchester in two nights, one marking Christmas Eve 1940. Minutes from dusk, the sound of the siren was no fake alarm. Mum bundled us into our air raid shelter (a curve of tin loaded with sods over our heads). They were unpopular, had little security and were often flooded. While we shivered in the cavernous shelter by candlelight, we could hear the scream of bombs descending and the rain of ""ack ack"" guns that aimed to stop them getting through.
Most still did. The German bombers killed 684 Manchester residents and wounded 2,300. One of the raids killed 11 people in a house, including an 11-year-old boy. The fire and smoke lingered when we came out of the shelter the next morning. My uncle's house had been burned to the ground. He'd been the one most confident we would get through it all unharmed. After all, as a merchant marine, he'd seen endless days at sea looking out for U-Boats and enemy destroyers.
The enemy that terrified us then, as now, was invisible. We had no idea till later that we were in the middle of the bombers' sights, our street clearly seen on the high-level reconnaissance photographs of targets made by the German planes. The pandemic, too, has descended seemingly out of thin air. We hide and wait for it to pass, hoping it will somehow miss us. Once again I find refuge in entertainment, but this time my wife and I consume medical dramas and prescient pandemic flicks like ""Contagion.""

So how comforting to hear the Queen's voice again, convincing in its resolve. This time, her quiet poise echoed out of YouTube, rather than an old radio. And her last allusion to the war-time anthem ""We'll Meet Again"" sung by World War Two sweetheart Vera Lynn instantly sent the vintage classic to number 22 on the iTunes chart. But the message is the same: Only united can we take on such a devastating challenge. Only then can we meet again.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials said on Tuesday they are considering releasing some detainees at high risk for coronavirus infection as detainees and workers have tested positive for the resulting COVID-19 illness.
In an email sent to lawmakers, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) said that it had instructed its offices around the country to consider the release of detainees with an increased risk of contracting the deadly respiratory disease. Among those whose cases are being reviewed are pregnant women and detainees ages 60 and older, according to the agency.
ICE said that it already had identified 600 detainees it considered vulnerable and released 160 people from custody. Those released will be required to wear ankle bracelets or be subject to other forms of monitoring. 
The decision comes after ICE announced last month that it would delay arresting some people suspected of violating immigration laws until after the coronavirus crisis, one of several emergency moves that could hamper President Donald Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
ICE has recorded 19 cases of detainees infected with COVID-19 and 71 cases of agency employees with the disease, including 11 who work in detention centers, according to figures posted on its website.
The tally of infected employees does not include contractors working at its facilities.
Several top House Democrats sent letters to ICE earlier in the day that called on the agency to release detainees who do not pose a threat to public safety.
In one of the letters, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler of New York and Representative Zoe Lofgren of California wrote that there was ""simply no reason"" ICE should not release such detainees, particularly those at high risk of contracting the disease.
Trump issued an executive order shortly after taking office in 2017 that called on federal immigration authorities to detain immigration law violators whenever possible. In February, his administration sought funding for 60,000 detention beds in its budget request. ICE currently detains roughly 36,000 people amid the pandemic.

Many detention centers are located in remote communities, far from hospitals that could handle a rush of patients with COVID-19, Reuters reported last week.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has removed from its website highly unusual guidance informing doctors on how to prescribe hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, drugs recommended by President Donald Trump to treat the coronavirus.
The move comes three days after Reuters reported that the CDC published key dosing information involving the two antimalarial drugs based on unattributed anecdotes rather than peer-reviewed science.
Reuters also reported that the original guidance was crafted by the CDC after President Trump personally pressed federal regulatory and health officials to make the malaria drugs more widely available to treat the novel coronavirus, though the drugs in question had been untested for COVID-19.
Initially, the CDC webpage, titled Information for Clinicians on Therapeutic Options for Patients with COVID-19, had said: “Although optimal dosing and duration of hydroxychloroquine for treatment of COVID-19 are unknown, some U.S. clinicians have reported anecdotally” on several ways to prescribe the medication of COVID-19.
Medical specialists had told Reuters they were surprised by that language. “Why would CDC be publishing anecdotes?” asked Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute School of Public Health at George Washington University. “That doesn’t make sense. This is very unusual.”
Doctors and other health experts had further criticized the guidance as suggesting that doctors might prescribe the medications when it isn't established whether or not they are effective or harmful.
Now the CDC website no longer includes that information. Instead, its first sentence says: “There are no drugs or other therapeutics approved by the US Food and Drug Administration to prevent or treat COVID-19.”
The updated, and shortened, guidance adds that “Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are under investigation in clinical trials” for use on coronavirus patients.
To read the new CDC guidance, click https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/therapeutic-options.html
The CDC did not immediately respond to questions about the removal of the original guidance. In a statement, it had originally told Reuters it had crafted the guidance for doctors at the request of a coronavirus task force, which urged prompt action.
Jeffrey Flier, a former dean of Harvard Medical School who had criticized the original guidance, applauded the updated version, calling it “substantially improved.”
“It states the facts without in effect recommending that physicians prescribe the drugs despite a lack of adequate evidence,” Flier said.

The hydroxychloroquine debate has heated up and become more political as President Trump this weekend said he might want to take the drug himself.

Correa, who was in office from 2007 to 2017, left Ecuador three years ago and now lives in Belgium. He and 19 others, including his vice president who is in prison for another corruption case, were accused of accepting $7.5 million in bribes in exchange for public contracts to finance his party's electoral campaigns between 2012 and 2016.
The court also banned Correa from participating in politics for 25 years.
The prosecution accused Correa of heading a ""criminal structure"" and asked for the maximum sentence.

""Well, this is what they were looking for: using justice to achieve what they never could at the ballot box. I am fine. I am concerned about my colleagues,"" Correa said on his Twitter account.

SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela - Thousands of Venezuelan migrants who have returned to their country this month amid the coronavirus epidemic have been ordered into quarantine in makeshift shelters along the border, according to officials and rights activists.
Last week, Venezuelans who had fled the country's economic collapse began returning home as neighboring Colombia restricted economic activity to prevent the continued spread of the virus, leaving many migrants without money to buy food or pay rent. 
However, the influx presents a threat to Venezuela's medical system, which has decayed during six years of economic collapse, and medical experts warn could be quickly overwhelmed should the coronavirus quickly spread.
Hospitals frequently lack medicine, water and equipment and have lost huge numbers of medical professionals to mass migration. However, right activists and lawmakers have raised concerns about the precarious conditions in centers being used to house hundreds of returnees. 
Over 2,100 migrants returning from Colombia to the Venezuelan border state of Tachira have been ordered to remain in schools and unused government buildings near the border that lack sanitary conditions to prevent the virus from spreading, lawmakers said.
""We denounce the precarious conditions of overcrowding,"" said opposition legislator Gaby Arellano. ""They are without water, without food ... there are children and elderly... who are not allowed to leave.""
Gen. Angel Moronta, who heads the state military command, told a crowd of hundreds of people gathered at a bus terminal in border city of San Antonio that authorities would provide transit after 15 days of quarantine, according to a video distributed by local officials. 
""Everything was improvised. They brought mats for the women and the men to sleep on the floor,"" said a woman, who asked not to be identified, who has been sheltered in a school along with 500 other travellers for the past two days. 
""The bathrooms are filthy. We clean the classrooms."" 
She added that a limited amount of food is being brought in at irregular intervals, and that water brought by trucks was being provided in large cisterns. 
Venezuela's information ministry did not respond to a request for comment. Reuters was not able to independently verify the conditions in the quarantine centers.
In the past two weeks, some 625 Venezuelans have also crossed into the country from Brazil, according to officials in the eastern border state of Bolivar, where they have been sent to makeshift shelters in local motels and government buildings. 
The government expects around 15,000 Venezuelans to return, President Nicolas Maduro said on Sunday night. All those returning are given rapid COVID-19 tests, officials say. 
With just 165 cases and seven deaths, Venezuela has one of the lowest official infection rates in South America. Colombia has confirmed 1,579 cases and 46 deaths, while Ecuador has registered 3,747 cases and 191 deaths. 
Before Saturday, those returning from Colombia had been bused on to their home states, where some initial quarantine conditions were inadequate. 
On March 25, soldiers locked some 90 Venezuelans, most who had crossed from Colombia, inside an apartment complex in the city of Barquisimeto for two days, according to a woman who was part of the group. 
Guards began to bring them meals and toiletries after a local rights group denounced the situation, she said.
Consulted about the issue, officials in Barquisimeto said they were providing three daily meals, drinking water, personal hygiene items and toys for those in quarantine.

79,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Taliban recalls negotiators after suspending prisoner exchange talks,"By Abdul Qadir Sediqi and Jonathan Landay
KABUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Taliban on Tuesday recalled the group's negotiators from Kabul hours after they suspended talks on a prisoner exchange process with the Afghan government, a spokesman for the hard-line Islamist group said in a tweet.
Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for Taliban's political office in Qatar, said ""the intentional delays in the release of our prisoners violates the peace agreement, therefore we call back our technical team back from Kabul"".
Early on Tuesday the militant group broke off talks with the Afghan government on a prisoner exchange by calling it a series of ""fruitless meetings"" that were seen as crucial steps in peace talks being brokered by the United States after it agreed on a troop withdrawal pact with the militants.
Their decision represented the latest setback for the U.S.-led effort to end America's longest war and decades of strife in Afghanistan that also has been hampered by violence and a leadership feud between the country's top politicians.
The February pact between the United States and the Taliban, under which U.S.-led international forces will withdraw in phases in exchange for Taliban security guarantees, is the best chance yet of ending the 18-year U.S. military involvement in Afghanistan.
But peace hinges on talks between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the militants. A prisoner exchange is meant to build confidence on both sides for those talks.
A spokesman for the government said it would continue working on the prisoner release plan.
""We ask the Taliban to not sabotage the process by making excuses now,"" said Javid Faisal, a spokesman for the National Security Council in Kabul.
The Taliban suspension of the talks could lead to an escalation of violence, which in turn could threaten the plan to withdraw U.S. troops, a major objective of U.S. President Donald Trump.
A three-member Taliban team had arrived in Kabul last month to begin the prisoner exchange process. It was not clear whether the delegation members came from Qatar or travelled to Kabul from provinces in Afghanistan.
Last week, Afghan officials said they would release 100 Taliban prisoners who were sick or over the age of 50.
In exchange, the Taliban were expected to free 20 members of the Afghan security forces. Ultimately both sides would aim to release the 6,000 prisoners they are holding.
But the Taliban, according to the Afghan officials wanted 15 commanders accused of carrying out brutal attacks to be released this week, a demand rejected by the Afghan government. 
Despite the setback over the prisoner releases, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday said progress had been made since he visited Kabul on March 23 to press Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah to end a feud over the results of a disputed September election.
""We've made some progress, but we see them posturing in the media, we see statements that come out,"" he told a State Department news conference.
While the feud has persisted, Pompeo's visit and his announcement of a $1 billion cut in U.S. aid to Afghanistan appeared to have an impact, with Ghani on March 26 announcing a delegation for peace talks with the Taliban that won Abdullah's endorsement.
Pompeo reiterated a call for those negotiations to start.
""I'm confident in the days ahead we'll have things that look like steps backward, but I'm also hopeful that all the parties are sincere and wanting what's good for the Afghan people,"" he said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The U.S. ambassador to Brazil on Tuesday denied reports that the U.S. government took over Chinese supplies of medical equipment that were ordered by Brazil to fight the coronavirus pandemic.
Brazilian Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta said last week China had ditched some Brazilian equipment orders when the U.S. government sent more than 20 cargo planes to the country to buy the same products.
Local media also reported that a shipment of supplies destined for the Brazilian state of Bahia was diverted for use in the United States during a stopover in Miami after suppliers were offered higher prices.
""The U.S. government did not buy or block any material destined for Brazil. Those reports are false. We have investigated this,"" Ambassador Todd Chapman told reporters in a conference call.
Chapman, a career diplomat who arrived in Brasilia last week, said suppliers around the world were taking advantage of the huge demand for medical equipment such as personal protective equipment, gloves and masks.
Mandetta said last week Brazilian states are well stocked for now, but Brazil had to turn to several countries before it could find a taker - China - for its 1.2 billion reais ($228 million) order to restock.
Brazil's education minister has also accused Chinese suppliers of profiteering on the pandemic, and mocked Chinese accents.
The minister later said he would apologize if China agreed to sell Brazil 1,000 ventilators.
While the United States has rapidly become the epicenter of the global pandemic, the number of confirmed cases of the disease caused by the new coronavirus, COVID-19, in Brazil has doubled in the last six days to 12,056, with 553 related deaths.
Chapman, who served as deputy head of the U.S. embassy in Brasilia from 2011-2014, said the Trump administration is considering suspending all flights to Brazil, but no decision has been taken yet.
""It is important to protect our country and it is important for Brazil too. We are evaluating this constantly in talks with Brazilian authorities,"" he said.

U.S. airlines have drastically cut back operations in Latin America, but Chapman said there are still 16 flights a week to Brazil. Brazilian authorities last week banned entry of U.S. citizens who are not residents in Brazil.

81,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 07, 2020 02:02PM ET</span>",Special Report: How federal snafus slowed testing at a top U.S. hospital,"By Peter Eisler and Chad Terhune
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia (Reuters) - The lab directors at the University of Virginia Medical Center felt powerless.
In early March, people began arriving with symptoms of COVID-19. One complained of a cough and had just returned from Wuhan, the Chinese city where the outbreak erupted. An elderly patient, already on end-of-life care, had a mysterious respiratory infection. Another, struggling to breathe, had come from a nursing home.
Each needed a test for the coronavirus. The hospital had none to offer.
“Testing is so critical,” said Amy Mathers, an infectious disease physician at the hospital and associate director of its clinical laboratory. “Everybody was just hounding me, and I could see how not having in-house testing was getting worse and worse and worse for the patients and the staff.”
Federal authorities had promised for weeks to provide tests for public health labs. They also pledged to quickly approve additional diagnostic tests developed by hospitals and private companies.
UVA’s medical center, part of a top-flight medical school, had banked on those assurances in developing a strategy and backup plans to ensure it could test patients for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. But its efforts were stymied at almost every turn by federal health agencies, the rapid collapse of medical supply chains, and the slow pace of test development by commercial labs and companies. Hospitals in Seattle, Sacramento, Pittsburgh and elsewhere ran into some of the same obstacles.
Even so, within about two weeks of seeing its first coronavirus patients, the Virginia hospital was able to build a robust, in-house testing operation. The medical center now is analyzing scores of samples a day for itself and more than a dozen other hospitals across the state that still lack enough tests to offer the sick. Its capacity exceeds some state labs around the country that relied solely on tests supplied by the federal government.
The path there, however, cost the hospital and caregivers precious time and resources. It left patients in limbo and endangered doctors and nurses, who were unable to diagnose the disease or properly allocate scarce protective gear, let alone assess and contain the threat.
While patients continued to arrive at the medical center with COVID-19 symptoms, hospital staff at UVA spent days scrambling to meet federal requirements for conducting tests in-house. They scoured university labs to satisfy obscure equipment requirements, and they begged colleagues at other institutions for specimens of the virus that were in frustratingly short supply. 
The hospital’s travails in developing its own testing capabilities demonstrate the challenges for health systems frustrated by the U.S. government's inability to provide emergency supplies and equipment to battle the coronavirus. Its struggles also offer an inside look at a regulatory system that slowed America’s early response.
“It felt like it took three months to get through those two weeks,” said Melinda Poulter, a clinical microbiologist and director of the UVA hospital lab. “It felt like a constant uphill battle with people throwing rocks at you from the top of the hill.”
The two federal agencies that oversaw testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration, have cast blame on the other for delays in testing.
CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes acknowledged that “this process has not gone as smoothly as we would have liked.”
FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn defended his agency’s work at ensuring tests produced accurate results. “The FDA’s regulations have not hindered or been a roadblock to the rollout of tests during this pandemic,” Hahn said in a statement.
Public health specialists and doctors say the United States lost valuable time as CDC and FDA officials clung to standard procedures for too long while hospitals such as UVA’s stood ready to help limit the spread of the virus. 
“We could have saved probably tens of thousands of lives by doing testing early and really isolating and quarantining all known cases,” said Lawrence Gostin, a professor and director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University. “But that window of opportunity is gone.”
More than 370,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the United States as of Tuesday, including 11,000 virus-related deaths. 
THE ""RECIPE""
As cases of COVID-19 emerged in the United States in late January, the UVA lab team wasn’t immediately concerned about having tests ready.
Genetic tests for the coronavirus had been developed quickly in China, and the World Health Organization had made a similar testing protocol available to any country that wanted it. In the United States, the CDC opted to develop its own protocol, as it typically does when new viruses emerge. It would serve as a template that labs around the country could use to set up their own testing operations.
Poulter and Mathers were confident they could make the CDC protocol work in their lab, which routinely develops genetic tests to diagnose patients for flu and other viruses. Besides, commercial test manufacturers were assuring hospitals that they would have tests available that could promptly process large numbers of samples.
By mid-February, Poulter and Mathers had settled on a plan: develop a test using the CDC protocol and have it ready “early on, while our patient volumes are still low,” Poulter said. Later, when caseloads climbed, “we expected the commercial vendors would have higher throughput options available.”
That plan unraveled on both fronts. 
The CDC’s test was issued first to public labs at the state and local level in early February. Problems surfaced within days. The CDC test was unreliable, and the agency began to work on a fix. 
As they awaited more details from the CDC, Poulter and Mathers considered starting from scratch on their own test – a process well within the UVA lab’s capabilities. But that would have required getting FDA approval, a notoriously slow, complex process they had little experience navigating.
Typically, hospital labs have broad leeway under federal law to develop in-house diagnostic tests. But because the Trump administration had declared the virus a national emergency, tougher regulatory rules were in effect. 
The emergency declaration gave drugmakers more flexibility to develop vaccines and antiviral treatments for COVID-19. But it also put new restrictions on diagnostic tests developed by individual labs. Those tests now required FDA approval for even slight deviations from the CDC protocol.
Poulter decided to bank on the CDC’s test.
“I said, ‘You know what? This is going to be a whole lot faster,’” Poulter recalled. “And I was wrong about that.”
The CDC didn’t have its updated test kit to public health labs until February 28, and revised instructions for any lab using the government test were posted on the FDA website several days later.
The CDC protocol involves a number of steps: First, a mucus sample is taken from a patient, usually by nasal swab. The next step involves chemically extracting genetic material, known as RNA, and converting it to its DNA equivalent. Then, the DNA is run through a process called polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, in which analytic equipment determines whether the sample contains the genetic fingerprint of the virus.
The CDC protocol was specific in the types of chemicals and equipment that labs were required to use. Almost immediately, hospitals were pitted against one another as they sought the needed supplies. 
“It’s like the CDC had a recipe and you had to use the exact brand of olive oil, the exact brand of pasta,” Mathers said. “And because there was only one pathway for every lab to do this, everyone was trying to get those brands, so the shelves were bare. And then you had to cook it all on a very specific stove, and those stoves are back ordered by six to eight weeks.”
BACKUP PLAN
As Mathers shopped for supplies, the pressure to expand testing continued to grow. 
Early U.S. coronavirus cases mostly involved people who had traveled to China or other places where the virus was prevalent. But on Feb. 26, the CDC announced that a California woman had contracted the virus despite having no recent travel history or contact with anyone known to be infected. 
It was an inflection point: the first reported U.S. case of “community transmission,” a term used to describe the spread of the virus when the source is unknown. And there was no telling where the virus was moving elsewhere.
Absent a test they could run themselves, most hospitals had limited options: send samples to the CDC in Atlanta or to a state lab and wait days for results. With limited capacity, the CDC and its state counterparts set stringent criteria. Patients experiencing symptoms such as fever or difficulty breathing could only be tested if they were linked to another confirmed case or had traveled to China or other hot spots.
By early March, the pressure to develop an in-house test “was becoming more urgent,” Mathers said. Patients with COVID-like symptoms were starting to show up at the hospital, and few met the strict rules for government testing. 
As Poulter and Mathers struggled to find the supplies to adopt the CDC testing protocol, they turned to their backup plan: purchasing ready-to-use tests from medical companies.
But when Poulter checked with vendors, the response was invariably the same: They still were waiting for their own tests to get FDA approval. “All they could tell you was, it was under review,” she said. “It became clear it wasn’t going to happen in time, that we were going to have to do something on our own first.”
Under increasing pressure to expand testing, FDA officials had removed some bureaucratic obstacles. They were working with numerous firms developing tests for sale as well as large commercial labs looking to test hospital samples shipped to their facilities. But it took until mid-March for a company to win agency approval. Hahn, the FDA commissioner, had expressed concern about sacrificing reliability for speed, noting that wildly inaccurate results would be worse than having no tests at all. 
“It’s important to remember that false negatives or positives can be detrimental to making sure we are treating patients early, without delay, and also not quarantining healthy individuals,” Hahn said on March 7.
FRANTIC SEARCH
Poulter and Mathers continued to contact one supplier after another for the chemicals and equipment needed to set up the CDC testing protocol, and each offered the same answer: out of stock.
Mathers called the university’s finance department to get an inventory of all lab equipment on campus. Then she began walking from lab to lab. She found two with the type of PCR analyzer required for the CDC test. But there was a catch. They were slightly different models geared more toward research than clinical use. The hospital would have to verify that those machines delivered accurate results and submit that information to the FDA. 
“That took at least a day,” Poulter said. “And that was just one little piece of what we had to do.”
As soon as that hurdle was cleared, “I just went back to the labs with a cart and took them,” Mathers said. The researchers using them for academic work were crushed. “I felt so badly for them, but it was our only option.”
While Poulter continued to search for the chemicals needed to run the CDC test, she and Mathers finally got some promising news. 
Laboratory Corporation of America (NYSE:LH) Holdings, a chain of commercial labs, had a test ready to go – and the company promised that samples sent in by the hospital would be tested within 72 hours. The UVA lab signed up immediately.
On March 10, the medical center sent LabCorp its first samples, prioritizing elderly patients and those with pre-existing conditions – the groups at greatest risk of dying. Two days later, the hospital got its first results.
“Then,” Poulter said, “it all fell apart.”
""BEHIND THE EIGHT BALL""
After quickly acting on that first batch of samples, LabCorp began taking more time to turn around results, Poulter said. It went from two days to four days, then five days and six, and ultimately as many as 11 days from when samples were submitted.
Mike Geller, a spokesman for LabCorp, said “we are aware that some test results are taking longer than the expected timeframe and we are working around the clock to complete those tests.” He said results are available in four to five days in most cases.
As frustration mounted at the UVA hospital, the back-ordered chemicals needed to run the CDC test finally arrived at the lab. With their scavenged PCR analyzers, Poulter and Mathers were ready to begin validating their in-house testing operation. But they faced one more obstacle: They needed a genetic sample of the coronavirus as a control to confirm the accuracy of their new test, and none was available.
Mathers began reaching out to labs nationwide for help. She struck gold with a cold call to a researcher at the University of Washington in Seattle. The area was a hotspot for the coronavirus; the researcher was willing to send samples.
On March 18, the UVA hospital lab finally began its own testing.
In just the first day, Mathers said, the lab had completed upwards of 20 tests, and had more results than it had received in days of waiting for government labs and LabCorp to test. “We’ve been testing nonstop ever since, but it never should have taken so long,” she said. “The additional regulation in the throes of an emergency outbreak really hamstrung the labs.”
Roger Klein, a physician and former adviser to the federal government on clinical laboratory issues, said the FDA should have turned sooner to academic medical centers with plenty of testing experience. “These aren’t fly-by-night people selling a test on the street corner,” he said.
Hahn, the FDA commissioner, said his agency has provided “unprecedented flexibility” to labs and test manufacturers during this pandemic.
“The FDA has been extremely proactive and supportive of test development by all comers – laboratories, and large and small commercial manufacturers – offering our expertise and support to speed development and to quickly authorize tests that the science supports,” Hahn said in a statement.
Last week at the White House, Hahn joined President Donald Trump and other administration officials to celebrate a milestone: more than 1 million samples tested nationwide.
Hahn also unveiled a new on-site test from  Abbott Laboratories  (NYSE:ABT) that can deliver results within 15 minutes at a hospital or doctor’s office. Trump unboxed the toaster-sized machine in the Rose Garden.
“That’s something that’s a game changer,” Trump said of the Abbott test. “Our testing is also better than any country in the world.”
Many hospitals and state officials disagree. The level of virus testing remains low in many states, and doctors and patients are left waiting days for results. The governors of Ohio and Illinois both complained in recent days about substantial delays in getting results from private labs.
On Monday, the U.S. Health and Human Services Inspector General’s Office published a survey of 323 hospitals and found severe shortages of testing supplies and delays in getting results remained a significant problem.
“When patient stays were extended while awaiting test results, this strained bed availability, personal protective equipment supplies and staffing,” according to the inspector general’s report. 
And shortages of key components – from chemicals to swabs – continue to slow the expansion of testing across the country. Hospitals and private labs have been forced to hunt for scarce supplies without much help from the federal government, said Krutika Kuppalli, a physician with expertise in infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness.
“We have been behind the eight ball every step of the way during this pandemic. Our government wasn’t thinking ahead,” she said.
By late March, the UVA lab had built more than enough testing capacity to meet its needs, using not only the CDC protocol but also a high-volume commercial test that became available after the lab got its own test up and running. So it began offering to test samples sent by other hospitals in the region. 
The hospital said it was still one of a few in the state with its own testing capacity. By Monday morning, it had run more than 1,500 tests, nearly 30% of them for other hospitals that lack the materials or capability to do their own testing. 

“We want to offer this to everybody,” Mathers said. “We’re all in this together. There’s never been a better example of that.”

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada needs to do more to persuade Washington not to block medical supplies from flowing across the border, even though U.S. officials have allowed the export of 500,000 masks, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday.
Trudeau told a briefing that the N95 surgical masks from Saint Paul, Minnesota-based 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co - part of a batch of four million ordered by the province of Ontario to help fight the coronavirus - should arrive on Wednesday. 
Canadian officials pressed their U.S. counterparts after Ontario complained the shipment had been blocked. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order last week to stop personal protective equipment from being exported.
""We have had constructive and productive conversations that have assured that this particular shipment comes through but we recognize there is still more work to do,"" Trudeau said.
""We are going to continue to highlight to the American administration the point to which healthcare supplies and services go back and forth across that border,"" he continued.
3M said late on Monday that it had reached a deal with the Trump administration allowing exports to Canada to continue.
The Canadian death toll from the outbreak rose to 345 from 293 on Monday, chief medical officer Theresa Tam told a daily briefing. The total number of cases is 17,063, compared to 15,822 a day earlier.
Tam said she was worried that the disease was spreading quickly among vulnerable sectors such as seniors' homes, prisons and remote aboriginal communities, where healthcare resources are already stretched.
Ontario, the most populous of Canada's 10 provinces, says it is running out of personal protection equipment.
Canadian officials complain the market for medical equipment is like the ""Wild West,"" and say they cannot guarantee the masks, gowns and gloves they have ordered will arrive.
Procurement Minister Anita Anand said Canada had commitments to companies around the world to buy more than 230 million face masks, of which more than 16 million had been delivered. It has also ordered 75 million N95 surgical masks and expects to have 2.3 million by end of the week.
""We will not rest until these supplies are in Canada,"" she told the briefing, adding that officials were being aggressive as they tracked down potential suppliers.

The provinces are also worried about a lack of ventilators. Trudeau said Ottawa was working with domestic firms to produce up to 30,000 ventilators.

Last week, Israel linked any future coronavirus aid to Gaza on progress in efforts to recover two soldiers who went missing in the 2014 war and two civilians who separately slipped into the enclave. Hamas holds all four.
The Islamist group has never stated whether the two soldiers are dead or alive, but neither has it provided a sign of life, as it has done in a previous similar case.
It has said that returning the four would require negotiating a prisoner swap and would not be done in exchange for humanitarian aid.
In a statement on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said his national security team ""stands ready to take constructive action with the goal of returning the fallen and the missing and of ending the affair, and are calling for an immediate dialogue via mediators"".
In past rounds of talks, Egypt, Qatar and the United Nations have served as intermediaries. 
Yehya al-Sinwar, Hamas chief in Gaza, has rejected the linkage to coronavirus aid but on Thursday said he saw ""a possible initiative to revive this issue"" of the Israelis held in the territory if Israel frees jailed Palestinians.
""A prisoner swap will exact a big price"" from Israel, he told Hamas's Al-Aqsa TV, saying that were it to start by releasing sick, old and female prisoners ""we may offer something partial in return"".
Hamas, hoping to head off a contagion it says has so far caused 13 cases in blockaded Gaza, wants Israel to ease economic conditions. Israel is also loathe to deal with a new humanitarian crisis on its border with Gaza, now sealed by both sides.
Israel in the past has freed hundreds of jailed Palestinians, including many militants, in exchange for the recovery of dead or captive Israelis.

But rightists in Netanyahu's ent coalition government, including Defence Minister Naftali Bennett, opppose any further releases of Palestinian militants.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey's parliament discussed a prisoner release law on Tuesday which aims to ease overcrowding in jails and protect detainees from the coronavirus, but which critics slam for excluding people jailed on terrorism charges in a post-coup crackdown.
The bill, proposed by President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party, would temporarily free around 45,000 prisoners to address the immediate threat of coronavirus spreading in jails. A similar number would be released permanently under plans prepared last year to reduce chronic prison overcrowding. 
Together the measures would cut the prison population by one third, but they do not cover those convicted of terrorism charges - excluding many thousands caught up in a purge following the 2016 failed military coup against Erdogan.
Tens of thousands of civil servants, judiciary officials, military personnel, journalists and politicians have been jailed in the crackdown. 
Around 50,000 people, including the former head of the second-largest opposition party, a prominent journalist and a philanthropist, are excluded from the new law because they are charged with or convicted on terrorism charges, according to an opposition parliamentarian.
Selahattin Demirtas, former head of the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), has been in jail for some 3-1/2 years, accused of leading a terrorist organisation.
His lawyer said Demirtas, 46, is at high risk from COVID-19 because he has high blood pressure and has undergone surgery for respiratory problems.
Lawyer Mahsuni Karaman also said the definition of terrorism was vague and subjective.
""Millions of people see Demirtas as a hero, a political leader, but another side sees him as a terrorist,"" he said.
Other prominent detainees including writer Ahmet Altan and civil rights campaigner Osman Kavala, both over 60, faced the same situation, he said. ""Combined with the pandemic, they are being left for dead,"" Karaman said.
Demirtas was hospitalised in December, days after losing consciousness following chest pains. Last week, his lawyers applied for his release on health grounds.
The crackdown since 2016 saw the number of prisoners swell to nearly 300,000 - the second-largest prison population in Europe and the most over-crowded prison system, according to data from the Council of Europe.
65 AND OVER
Turkey also has the highest number of inmates aged 65 and over, with 3,521 people in January 2019, the data showed. Turkey has imposed a stay-at-home order for those over 65, given that they are the highest risk group from the coronavirus.
Altan, a 70-year-old prominent journalist, was jailed for life in 2018 on charges of aiding a terrorist group. The sentence was later overturned and he was released, only to be jailed again the following week. 
His lawyer, Figen Calikusu, said the law should allow the temporary release of those not yet convicted. 
""There aren't any measures he can take to protect himself,"" Calikusu said of Altan, who shares a cell with another inmate and is contact with prison personnel who each interact with many other prisoners. 
Kavala, a 62-year-old prominent businessman and philanthropist, was acquitted in February on charges related to nationwide protests in 2013, only to be arrested again the following day on charges related to the 2016 coup attempt.
The independence of Turkey's judiciary has been hotly debated in recent years, with critics saying court rulings are influenced by politicians. Erdogan and his AK Party say the judiciary makes its decisions independently.
Asked whether he believed Demirtas' request for release would be granted, lawyer Karaman said his client was a ""political hostage"".
""Demirtas' case is always on the radar of the honourable president. A positive decision cannot be made on the release request without his knowledge,"" he said.

Last month, Iran temporarily freed about 85,000 people from jail, including political prisoners, in response to the pandemic, a judiciary spokesman said.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's highest court acquitted former Vatican treasurer George Pell on Tuesday of sexually assaulting two teenaged choirboys in the 1990s, freeing the 78-year-old cardinal after 404 days in jail.
The Vatican welcomed the decision and praised Pell for having ""waited for the truth to be ascertained"".
In a statement it said it always had confidence in Australian justice, that Pell had always maintained his innocence and that the Holy See reaffirmed its ""commitment to preventing and pursuing all cases of abuse against minors"".
The High Court, ruling from Brisbane, ordered Pell's convictions be quashed and verdicts of acquittal be entered in their place, ending the most high profile case of alleged historical sex abuse to rock the Roman Catholic Church.
The seven judges of the High Court agreed unanimously that the jury in the cardinal's trial ""ought to have entertained a doubt"" about his guilt. Pell, who has maintained his innocence throughout the lengthy court process, cannot be retried on the charges.
""I hold no ill will toward my accuser, I do not want my acquittal to add to the hurt and bitterness so many feel; there is certainly hurt and bitterness enough,"" Pell said in a statement shortly before he was driven away from the maximum security Barwon Prison near Melbourne.
The verdict comes in the middle of Holy Week, the period leading up to Easter, the most important day in the Christian calendar. 
A few hours after Pell's acquittal, Pope Francis offered his morning Mass for those who suffer from unjust sentences. Francis did not mention Pell by name.
""I would like to pray today for all those people who suffer unjust sentences resulting from intransigence (against them),"" Francis said, speaking extemporaneously at the start of the Mass.
An investigation of Pell by the Vatican was mooted but never formally begun. 
The pope appointed Pell to overhaul the Vatican's vast finances in 2014 and has withheld comment on the case throughout the trial and appeals. 
The Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP) said it was ""dismayed and heartbroken"" by the verdict.
""This is a disappointing ruling that only exacerbates the mistrust survivors feel,"" SNAP Australia said in a statement.
Pell, a polarising figure in Australia for his conservative views, remained a cardinal but lost his treasurer role last year when he became the highest ranked Catholic official worldwide to be jailed for child sex offences.
He was serving a six-year sentence on one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and four charges of an indecent act with a child under 16, which the plaintiff said took place when Pell was archbishop of the city of Melbourne.
DID NOT TAKE STAND
Pell's first trial ended in a hung jury. The jury at his second trial in 2018 unanimously found him guilty. Pell did not take the stand at either trial. 
A lower appeal court had upheld Pell's conviction, but the High Court found it had failed to properly consider evidence that should have raised doubt that he was guilty.
Pell's accuser, one of two boys the archbishop was alleged to have assaulted, had said the offences took place shortly after Sunday masses, in the priests' sacristy and corridor of St. Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne, while Pell was robed.
The High Court judges pointed to unchallenged evidence from church officials at Pell's trial that he typically spent time talking to congregants on the church steps after mass, he was always accompanied by a priest while robed, and the sacristy was usually a hive of activity after mass.
The lower appeals court and the trial jury watched a video of his accuser's testimony, described by the prosecutor as ""powerful and persuasive"". The High Court did not view it and said it should not have been necessary for the appeal court to have viewed it. 
""FURIOUS"" AND ""HEARTBROKEN""
The second alleged victim in the case died in 2014 of a drug overdose. His father, who is pursuing a civil case against Pell, said through his lawyer Lisa Flynn he was ""in shock"" and ""furious"" a conviction by a unanimous jury had been overturned. 
""Our client says he is heartbroken for (his son's friend, the accuser in the case) who stuck his neck out by coming forward to tell his story,"" Flynn of Shine Lawyers said.
Vivian Waller, a lawyer for the accuser, said her client would make a statement on Wednesday.
While the trial and appeals were held in courtrooms packed with media and supporters for both sides, Tuesday's decision was delivered to a largely empty courtroom in Brisbane because of national restrictions on travel and public gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The Australian Catholic Bishops Conference said the acquittal would be welcomed by many and ""devastating for others.""

""The result today does not change the Church’s unwavering commitment to child safety and to a just and compassionate response to survivors and victims of child sexual abuse,"" said Archbishop Mark Coleridge, president of the conference.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's 21-day lockdown is set to end next week but several state leaders have called for an extension or only a partial lifting of restrictions, saying is the only way to avoid a coronavirus epidemic that will be difficult to tackle. 
India has so far escaped a big surge in cases after Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked its 1.3 billion people to stay indoors in the world's biggest lockdown last month that authorities have enforced tightly. 
But shuttering down the $2.9 trillion economy has left millions of people without work and forced those who live on daily wages to flee to their homes in the countryside for food and shelter.
The chief minister of the southern state of Telangana which has been hit by a rash of cases tied to a Muslim religious gathering in Delhi said the country could take the hit to the economy and that it was more important to save lives.
""I am for the lockdown of the country further more after April 15. Because, we can recover from the economic problem. But, we cannot get back lives,"" K. Chandrasekhar Rao told reporters.
India has 4,421 coronavirus cases and 115 deaths, comparatively less than some countries such as the United States where fatalities from the respiratory disease has topped 10,000.
Modi, who has faced criticism for ordering the lockdown with barely four hours' notice is due to make a decision this week about whether to extend it. 
The leaders of the eastern states of Assam and Chhattigarh said they would like to keep the state borders closed or allow only restricted entry while they dealt with the infections.
""As and when the lockdown is withdrawn, we have to regulate those wanting to come to Assam,"" said Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma.
BANGLADESH, NEPAL EXPECTING SURGE
Across South Asia, home to one fifth of the world's population, there are growing concerns that it won't escape the surge seen in other parts of the world. Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina warned of a big outbreak this month. 
""We have got some reports, which said there will be a massive hike in cases in Bangladesh. So, we have to be very careful to overcome the crisis,"" Hasina told government officials. 
She said the garment industry will also have to remain shut as part of the lockdown till April 14 even though businesses had asked for an exemption for the country's top export earner.
So far, the densely packed country of 160 million has had 123 cases including 12 deaths. 
Nepal Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli said risks to the landlocked country sandwiched between India and China were rising because people were not following quarantine properly.
""The coming two weeks will be of additional challenge for us. This is the high risk period for the spread of the coronavirus,"" he said in an address to the country.
Following are government figures on the spread of the coronavirus in South Asia:
* India has 4,421 cases, including 115 deaths
* Pakistan has 3,840 cases, including 54 deaths
* Afghanistan has 423 cases, including 10 deaths
* Sri Lanka has 180 cases, including 6 deaths
* Bangladesh has 123 cases, including 12 deaths
* Maldives has 19 cases and no deaths
* Nepal has nine cases and no deaths
* Bhutan has five cases and no deaths

LAGOS/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - In a dark ground-floor room in Lagos, dressmaker Kemi Adepoju gazes at a pile of dresses she has made but which cannot be collected due to the lockdown in force to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
""This lockdown came upon us suddenly. I used all my money to buy fabric. If I had known, I would have ... used it to buy food instead,"" said the mother-of-two, who runs her business from a room she rents in the Iwaya suburb of Nigeria's largest city.
Like millions in Africa, Adepoju works in the informal sector, which accounts for more than 85% of employment across the continent and will be largely bypassed by meagre economic support measures that cash-strapped governments are rolling out.
The International Monetary Fund said in a blog on the outbreak's impact on Africa last month that ""social distancing"" was not realistic for the most vulnerable, and the notion of working from home was only possible for the few.
""The very measures that are crucial to slowing the spread of the virus will have a direct cost on local economies,"" it said. ""The disruption to people's daily lives means less paid work, less income, less spending, and fewer jobs.""
Lockdowns, initially slated to last 14 days, began in Lagos and the capital, Abuja, on March 30. 
The government of Africa's most populous country has announced a repayment moratorium for government loans made to small businesses ranging from market traders to farmers, and has said it will offer similar relief to large companies.
MONEY 'WON'T TRICKLE DOWN'
Muda Yusuf, director general of the Lagos Chamber of Commerce, said the self-employed in cities would not benefit from these measures because they are aimed mainly at rural areas and no relief has been offered on commercial loan repayments.
""These measures are not likely to trickle down to people in the informal sector,"" he said.
The government says it has begun making cash transfers to the country's poorest households, but many hawkers and other informal traders do not have bank or mobile money accounts to pay into even if they were eligible.
Some 60% of Nigerians do not have a bank account, according to the World Bank. 
There is a danger that government support will not reach those who need it most, said Tunde Ajileye, a partner at risk consultancy SBM Intelligence. 
""Until people can be found and tracked centrally and matched to their financial records, operations like these will at best be informed guesswork and fraught with corruption,"" he said. 
The coronavirus crisis has piled more pressure on the Nigerian government's finances at a time when it was already struggling with a slump in the price of oil, the mainstay of the economy.
DEFYING THE LOCKDOWN 
Even South Africa, the continent's most developed economy, has not been able to promise a massive fiscal stimulus to cushion the coronavirus blow, with the economy already in recession and unemployment hovering around 30%.
It has announced tax relief for small businesses worth 500 rand ($26.50) per month for each worker for four months, and will permit businesses with revenue of 50 million rand ($2.66 million) or less to delay paying 20% of their employee tax liabilities over four months.
But no support has been offered so far to the informal economy, which provides employment to 25-30% of South African workers, according to the World Bank.
For many, all they can do is hunker down for a 21-day national lockdown to end, and hope business will pick up again.
""I work in a public space, which puts me at risk,"" said Natasha Mbayo, a hairdresser in Johannesburg's inner city. ""Once everything is fine, I can get back to earning money.""
Others are defying the lockdown to survive.
""I know I am not supposed to be sitting here selling, but I don't have a choice,"" said 69-year-old Lucy Malimele, who was selling spinach at a quieter-than-usual market in the crowded township of Soweto one day last week.
""If I didn't come, I would not have had money for these two loaves of bread.""
Malimele has sold fruit and vegetables at the Kliptown market since 1983, relying on the trade to feed her family, including eight grandchildren.
""These kids don't have parents, but I can't just leave them. I have to make a plan to feed them,"" said Malimele, who on a good day before the lockdown could earn up to 300 rand ($16.00).
""I can't tell whether the government is wrong or right to do this, but it seems like only those who have money will survive.""

Minutes later, police and soldiers arrived at the market and gave vendors five minutes to disperse or face arrest. Malimele stuffed her spinach into a large canvas bag and dragged it away.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Despite stay-at-home orders aiming to protect people from the new coronavirus, many of Rio de Janeiro's famous beaches have been buzzing with surfers seeking to catch the season's first big swell.
That has thrown surfers such as Guilherme Faria headlong into a public debate about the legal limits on outdoor sports - in his case, a question that will be soon be decided by a judge.
The 22-year-old said he was catching 9-foot curlers on Copacabana Beach on Sunday morning when a policeman with a whistle between his teeth hauled him out of the water and down to the station.
""Unfortunately, surfing is now a crime,"" said Faria, who received a court summons - seen by Reuters - after his booking. ""I hope I don't end up with a criminal record for something as silly as that.""
A few hours later, even with the threat of a fine, Faria and his board were back in the Copacabana surf.
Like thousands of Rio's famously sporty locals, Faria could not resist the call of the outdoors. The esplanade lining the city shore is packed with joggers. Groups of spandex-clad bicyclists zip up and down the city's serpentine mountain roads.
On March 17, city and state officials implored residents to stay at home, nominally closing beaches and city parks as the coronavirus pandemic tears through Latin America's third-largest city. 
Rio is Brazil's second-most infected state, according to the Health Ministry, which reported 12,056 confirmed coronavirus cases across the country as of Monday.
Some athletes have complied, citing the danger of spreading the disease en route to beaches. Many argue that sports-related injuries could divert vital medical resources away from the coronavirus fight. The debate has also roiled other solo sports, from skiing to climbing.
""There are different opinions among different sports associations. New guidelines come out every week,"" said Ana Carolina Corte, the official doctor for the Brazilian Olympic Committee. She added that some sports could still be done ""alone, without crowds, without running alongside other people.""
Even legal decrees have been subject to debate.
The governor of Rio state, for instance, banned ""spending time at beaches,"" as some might describe a surfer bobbing in the water, but not a roller skater gliding past.
Yet some surfers have argued they merely cross over the sand to enter the ocean or even enter the water via rocky outcroppings.
Still, many athletes acknowledge their concerns pale next to the challenge Brazil faces. State governors, including those in Rio de Janeiro, have warned that underfunded public healthcare systems could soon collapse.
Bruno Bocayuva, a surfing journalist in Rio, has given up surfing for weeks in favor of jumping rope, doing push-ups and keeping in shape any way he can.
""I'm really missing that sensation of being in the water, of paddling, of catching a wave, of connecting with nature through surf, which provides such an intimate connection. But I know this is the moment to think of the collective good,"" he said. 
""I'm letting this wave pass, to surf the next one in the near future.""
BITTER DEBATE
Perhaps due to its high visibility or anti-establishment vibes, surfing has emerged as unique target of ire across the region. 
In Costa Rica, a video on social media last week showed a police officer apparently firing a gun in the direction of 28-year-old law student Rafael Villavicencio as he left the water.
Reuters could not verify the video's authenticity. The head of the Costa Rican police said they had opened an investigation into the incident.
""Although it's true that the surfers weren't following orders, that doesn't mean an official should act in that way,"" said Villavicencio's lawyer, Rafael Brenes. 
Argentina's media heaped scorn on one surfer for entering the country from Brazil with boards on the roof of his car. The man later violated a mandatory quarantine, according to police. 
Argentine President Alberto Fernandez called him ""an idiot"" on national television.
Similarly, Peruvian authorities raised eyebrows when they nabbed two surfers in a highly publicized operation involving a police helicopter.
In Brazil, a surf-crazed nation where urban beaches are often clogged before and after work, the debate has taken an acrimonious and even political turn.
President Jair Bolsonaro has berated Rio Governor Wilson Witzel for closing beaches, calling the move ""dictatorial.""
Bolsonaro's son Eduardo, a congressman from Sao Paulo state, just down the coast, argued in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Thursday for a decree to allow surfing that conforms with social distancing.
With or without a decree, many surfers are simply doing what they can to dodge attention - and each other.
""I came early to avoid this total isolation controversy,"" said Ricardo Bacão, a 65-year-old surfer from Rio's Ipanema neighborhood, as he exited the water on Sunday morning.

""In the same way that people run, they hike, they ride bikes, somebody can grab a board, leave the house, go directly to the water, paddle and go home.""

""I want to thank all those working in the healthcare profession for your selfless commitment and diligence as you undertake vitally important roles to protect and improve the health and well-being of people,"" the queen said.
The queen's words were shown on a video released by the royal family's Twitter account, which featured images of the queen and other members of her family visiting hospitals and meeting healthcare workers.
Included in the video were three of the queen's children: Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Princess Anne, and Prince Edward. The queen's grandson Prince William and his wife Kate Middleton were also pictured.
""In testing times, we often observe that the best of the human spirit comes to the fore; the dedication to service of countless nurses, midwives and other health workers, in these most challenging of circumstances, is an example to us all,"" she said.
""My family and I send our enduring appreciation and good wishes,"" the queen said.
The 93-year-old monarch is staying at her Windsor Castle home with her husband Prince Philip, 98.
On Sunday, in a rare televised address, the queen told the British people that they would overcome the coronavirus outbreak if they stayed resolute in the face of lockdown and self-isolation.
She invoked the wartime spirit by saying ""we will meet again"" - a direct reference to the most famous British song from the war years of the 1940s.

Prince Charles, 71, has recovered after suffering mild symptoms of the virus and opened a new field hospital in London via video link from his home in Scotland on Friday.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Li Xiaoli has been hard at work in recent days at the car dealership she owns in Wuhan, making sure she has enough sanitizer and protective gear for the company's long-awaited reopening. 
The 49-year-old's home city will on Wednesday finally start to lift a lockdown that has trapped millions for more than two months after the Chinese industrial powerhouse became the epicentre of a global coronavirus pandemic. 
People will be allowed to leave the city via road, rail and air, and more non-essential businesses will open their doors again, providing the first glimpse of what life could be like after a lockdown.
But conversations with residents like Li and others suggest that it is far from simple. Many are still coming to terms with the scars of an outbreak that saw Wuhan account for 61% of the 81,708 reported cases in China. 
Some are counting the costs of lengthy business shutdowns, while others still fear infection, especially from asymptomatic patients, and are reluctant to leave their homes. 
It is also unclear what the Chinese government plans to do to rejuvenate the city, how it will commemorate what residents now describe as a ""great calamity"", and whether more will be done to hold the city government accountable for the outbreak's severity. The Wuhan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
""When I heard about the lifting of the lockdown, I didn't feel particularly happy,"" said Guo Jing, a resident who runs a hotline for women facing workplace discrimination. ""I actually felt very anxious. There are many issues that we are not sure can be resolved: employment, will patients continue to experience long-term effects, and for those who died, how will we remember them?""
'THREAT OF EXTINCTION'
Reminders that Wuhan's virus fight is far from over are everywhere. 
Tall barriers surround many housing compounds, with signs plastered at gateways asking people to display green mobile phone health codes or present documents showing a valid reason to go out. There is little evidence those restrictions will be loosened soon. 
Although shops and restaurants have started reopening across much of China, thousands remain shut in Wuhan. 
""There are big pressures of course,"" Li said, adding that she counts herself lucky that she was able to continue paying wages throughout the shutdown. 
A letter published online last week by more than 160 hospitality firms asked the Wuhan government for rental rebates, loan assistance and wage support, saying the virus and its after effects posed ""the threat of extinction,"" to more than 80,000 businesses. 
Cancellations across the city for the traditional reunion dinner, which took place just after the Jan. 23 lockdown on the eve of the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, amounted to about 1 billion yuan in losses in a single day, the letter said. 
Consumer confidence will take a long time to recover, the letter said. It was a sentiment many in Wuhan echoed.
English teacher Kuang Li said he planned to stay home long beyond Wednesday, until he is asked to return to work. 
""Personally I'm still scared of the virus, and I feel that the outdoors still isn't safe,"" Kuang said.
TRAUMA JUST BEGINNING
The mental toll and social stigma faced by recovered patients and Wuhan residents are also lingering questions.
Many people Reuters interviewed on Wuhan's streets over the past week wept while recounting their experience.
Residents sought to cope with the lockdown in different ways, some by immersing themselves in hobbies like cooking, others by engaging in daily prayer meetings online. Panic, fear and helplessness were common emotions. 
Du Mingjun, who set up a 24-hour mental health hotline when the lockdown started, said it had received roughly 2,300 calls, some from medical workers, but most from ordinary citizens who had been quarantined or were trying to adjust. She plans to carry on the hotline's work for a while longer. 
""Even though the epidemic might be ending, for some groups of people the trauma might be just starting,"" she said.

Finland has followed with mounting concern neighbouring Sweden's liberal pandemic strategy, fearing cross-border commuters could speed up the spread of the virus in northern parts of Finland with an ageing population and limited intensive care resources. 
""The government's aim is to further reduce movement in the inherent commute area across the borders with Sweden and Norway,"" Finland's government said in a statement.
Finland had recorded 2,176 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 27 deaths by Tuesday, while neighbouring Sweden's numbers stood at 7,206 and 477 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. 
Hundreds of healthcare employees living in Finland cross the northern border to Sweden daily and are vital for the border area's services in Sweden. 
""Finland considers it indispensable that Sweden instructs its healthcare personnel to better protection and increases testing of these groups,"" the government said.
The Finnish government had already restricted travel across its northern borders to commuters but now only the most essential workers will be allowed to cross with proof of their importance from their employers.
""Finns who commute to Sweden and Norway across Finland's borders must remain in quarantine-like conditions when they are in Finland,"" the government said.
Nordic countries gave up passport controls between themselves in 1952 and have a long tradition of unrestricted cross-border working.
The Finnish government also recommended that shipping companies stop all passenger ticket sales from Sweden, Estonia and Germany to Finland until the restrictions are lifted.
""Spreading of the epidemic really has slowed down (in Finland),"" interior minister Maria Ohisalo told a news conference, adding that the government would be giving more details in the coming days about a so-called exit strategy to gradually lift the restrictions.

The province of Sana sits on the biggest of Vanuatu's 80 islands and is home to its second-most populous city, Luganville, where photos circulated on social media purported to show buildings flattened by the storm.
The winds blew roofs off houses, tore down trees and destroyed a council building in Luganville, which has a population of 16,000, according to a Radio New Zealand report. 
Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office said in a social media post that officials were expected to survey the area later in the day to assess the damage.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Police in India lodged a case this week against an unknown online fraudster who tried selling the world's largest statue for $4 billion, claiming the proceeds would be used to help the Gujarat state government fund its fight against the coronavirus.
While the plot to sell the 'Statue of Unity"", a monument that is nearly twice the height of New York's Statue of Liberty, is among the most brazen cases, police say cybercrimes have surged since the health scare gripped the country.
With scams ranging from free mobile recharges, to offers of free Netflix subscriptions, federal home ministry officials say there has been 86% percent rise in cyber crime in the past four weeks.
Police and internal security officials said scammers have created fake versions of the flagship 'PM CARES Fund' payments interface that look deceptively similar to the original and many Indians and Non-Residents Indians (NRIs) have fallen prey. 
""We have received over 8,300 complaints from individuals across India and NRIs who have donated thousands of dollars into fake accounts,"" said a senior home ministry official, adding the retrieval process is a complex task. 
""We have already blocked all handles with permutations and combinations of the 'PM Cares Fund' that were illegitimate and we are being watchful and ensuring that the handles for donations get verified,"" said Dilip Asbe, CEO of National Payments Corporation of India, an umbrella organisation for retail payments. 
Police have registered cases against fake offers that  Reliance Industries  (NS:RELI) telecom arm Jio and streaming service Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) were offering discounted services at a time when over 1.3 billion people were forced to live indoors for 21 days to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Officials at Netflix and Jio declined to comment on the fraud conducted under their company's name.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - While most people in the Chinese city of Wuhan were hunkered down in their homes at the height of the country's coronavirus outbreak, Lin Wenhua was out on the empty streets in his car, driving toward the next person or task on his list. 
Sometimes it would be a request to take a doctor to the hospital, the 38-year-old filmmaker recalled. Once, he was asked to help drive a pet-sitter to a friend's house. 
Other times, he found himself delivering boxes of Kaletra, a drug usually used to treat HIV and AIDS, to coronavirus patients or their relatives, sent by an acquaintance who was giving them away for free. 
Residents say volunteers like Lin have been crucial to keeping Wuhan supplied and running after it became the epicenter of China's outbreak, especially in the epidemic's chaotic early days from late January to early February. Back then, surging cases strained government and medical services in the city of 11 million to the breaking point.
With public transit shut down and taxis and ride-hailing operations suspended, thousands of volunteers have shuttled medical staff, delivered supplies and checked in on vulnerable residents. 
They have kept going throughout the outbreak, though some of the pressure has been alleviated in recent weeks as the city experiences a sharp fall in locally transmitted cases, giving way to the restart of services such as public transport.
""The entire city was facing the danger of an epidemic,"" he told Reuters in an interview, recounting how he decided to volunteer after the city was sealed off from the rest of China on Jan. 23. 
He estimates that he has driven about 4,000 kilometres since, adding that there were many other volunteers who more than doubled that.
""Medical workers are very important and we needed to safeguard their ability to work,"" he said. ""If they were able to work normally, that would in turn safeguard our lives.""
Lin documented his trips and life in locked-down Wuhan regularly on his Twitter-like Weibo account, 'Spider Monkey Bread', where he posted diary-style videos to 5 million followers. 
His most unique volunteer role, as a medicine courier, begun after a friend put him in touch with ""Brother Squirrel"", one of several HIV patients who were inundated with requests for Kaletra after they offered to give pills away. China began testing the drug as a treatment for coronavirus symptoms in January.
""When I first heard about sending medicine to patients, I did hesitate. But I thought to myself, to these patients this medicine represents a hope for survival,"" he said. 
He ended up making deliveries to about 30 people, stopping after patients could get treatment directly from newly built makeshift hospitals in late February, when Wuhan started took further, aggressive steps to treat and quarantine stricken people. 
Demand for his other services has also fallen in recent weeks amid China's improving epidemic situation, leaving him to focus more on his work as a freelance filmmaker, mostly for advertising agencies. Still, the experience has been an emotional rollercoaster. 

""This situation has gone on for way too long. During this very long period, we have gone through many types of feelings,"" he said. March, however, was a turning point. ""We finally saw the situation improve, victory's light of dawn.""

Suhail Shaheen, a spokesman for the Islamist insurgent group's political office in Qatar, said on Twitter a technical team would not participate in ""fruitless meetings"" and the release of their prisoners was being ""delayed under one pretext or another"".
The late February pact between the United States and the Taliban, under which U.S.-led international forces will withdraw in exchange for Taliban security guarantees, is the best chance yet of ending the 18-year war.
But peace hinges on talks between the U.S.-backed Afghan government and the militants. A prisoner exchange is meant to build confidence on both sides for those talks.
A spokesman for the government said it would maintain its work on the prisoner release plan.
""We ask the Taliban to not sabotage the process by making excuses now,"" said Javid Faisal, a spokesman for the National Security Council in Kabul.
The Taliban suspension of the talks could lead to an escalation of violence, which in turn could threaten the plan to withdraw U.S. troops, a major objective of President Donald Trump.
A three-member Taliban team arrived in Kabul last month from Qatar to begin the prisoner exchange process. Last week, Afghan officials said they would release 100 Taliban prisoners who were sick or over the age of 50.
In exchange, the Taliban were expected to free 20 members of the Afghan security forces. Ultimately both sides would aim to release the 6,000 prisoners they are holding.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo welcomed the arrival in Kabul of the Taliban team as good news.
Despite the coronavirus pandemic, Pompeo last month travelled to Kabul and the Qatari capital of Doha in a bid to nudge the prisoner process forward.
Afghan government officials have said the Taliban were demanding the release of senior commanders involved in some of the most violent attacks in recent years.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada's most populous province on Monday complained the United States had blocked the export of more than three million face masks it bought to fight the coronavirus outbreak, while Ottawa said it was pressuring Washington to release the gear.
Ontario Premier Doug Ford told reporters his province had ordered almost 4 million medical masks from manufacturer 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co but they had not been allowed to leave the company's plant in South Dakota. Speaking earlier to Global News, he called the incident ""absolutely unacceptable."" 
Ford, a populist conservative, told reporters that after the Ontario and Canadian governments complained, he had been assured 500,000 of the masks would soon be released. He did not say what would happen to the rest.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order last week to stop personal protective equipment from being exported, and Ford said it was ""absolutely critical"" Canada be exempted.
Ford said he would be calling U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer later on Monday to press home the point.
Ontario, which has the second-highest number of coronavirus cases among the 10 Canadian provinces, will run out of personal protective equipment in a week, he added. More than 14 million people live in the province.
Allies of the United States are complaining about what they call its ""Wild West"" tactics in outbidding or blocking shipments to buyers who have already signed deals for medical equipment to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
Separately, Canadian medical health officials said the death toll in the country from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, had risen to 293 from 258 on Sunday. The number of positive cases is now 15,822.
Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that Ottawa was aware of ""some difficulties"" shipping the masks across the border.
""We are working intensely with the United States to ensure that all the masks that have been bought can be exported to Canada,"" she said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke to Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne on Monday and ""reiterated the U.S. desire"" to work with Canada to ensure the viability of international supply chains for medical supplies and personnel, a Pompeo spokeswoman said.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Saturday he would not retaliate over Trump's order limiting exports, while noting that some Canadian health professionals living along the U.S. border work at American hospitals.

""Both countries would lose out if hurdles were to be put in the way of that flow of healthcare support between our two countries. We made that point in repeated conversations,"" Freeland said on Monday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Monday designated the ultranationalist Russian Imperial Movement (RIM) group as a terrorist organization, in what the State Department called the first such move against a white supremacist group.
""These designations are unprecedented,"" Nathan Sales, Coordinator for U.S. Counter Terrorism, said in a statement.
""RIM is still very much in the business of providing training to like-minded Neo-Nazis and white supremacists across Europe. We know that they have recruited individuals from other countries in Europe and continue to do so,"" he said in a teleconference with reporters.
The move freezes any assets that RIM may have in the United States and it denies it any access to the U.S. financial system, Sales said and added that the measure would not be just a symbolic one even if the group may not have any assets in the U.S. because these measures have a 'significant crippling effect' on such groups' ability to move money internationally.
Monday's measure comes after the State Department in its latest annual terrorism report last November said ethnically and racially driven terrorism had risen alarmingly in 2018 both worldwide and in the United States.
Russian Imperial Movement's members cast themselves as Russian Orthodox nationalists who favor restoring the monarchy and privileging the interests of ethnic Russians, Ukrainians and Belarussians.
Russian Imperial Movement, Sales said, had ""innocent blood on its hands"" and cited a series of attacks from late 2016 in the Swedish city of Gothenburg carried out by two members of RIM who Sales said had received paramilitary-style training in Russia.
Swedish authorities arrested, tried and convicted the attackers, Sales said. ""The prosecutor who handled their case blamed RIM for radicalizing them and providing the training that enabled the attacks,"" he said.
Sales declined to say whether or not Monday's designation was communicated to the Russian government ahead of time. He also did not say whether or not Washington believes the Russian government is linked to the group. 
""We encourage the Russian federation to live up to the commitments it has made to countering terrorism,"" he said. 
The State Department was aware of public reports that RIM was among the forces that fought in Ukraine on behalf of pro-Russian separatists, Sales said, but did not elaborate further apart from repeating the U.S. stance that Washington has supported Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
The State Department is also specifically blacklisting three people - Stanislav Anatolyevich Vorobyev, Denis Valliullovich Gariev and Denis Valliullovich Gariev - deemed as leaders of the group.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - It is ""highly probable"" the government of Syria or its allies carried out attacks on three healthcare facilities, a school and a refuge for children in northwest Syria last year, according to a summary of an internal United Nations inquiry seen by Reuters on Monday.
The inquiry also found it ""probable"" that a deadly attack on a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria's Aleppo was carried out either by armed opposition groups or by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadist alliance formerly known as Nusra Front.
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, backed by Russia, began an offensive early last year on the last major insurgent stronghold in northwest Syria. Russia and Syria have said their forces do not target civilians or civilian infrastructure.
The Russian and Syrian missions to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the summary of the U.N. report, which Secretary-General Antonio Guterres submitted to the 15-member Security Council on Monday. 
""The impact of the hostilities on civilian and humanitarian sites in north-west Syria is a clear reminder of the importance for all parties to the conflict to observe and ensure respect for international humanitarian law,"" Guterres wrote in a letter to the council. 
""According to numerous reports, the parties have failed to do this,"" he said. 
Under pressure from two-thirds of the Security Council, Guterres announced in August that the world body would investigate attacks on U.N.-supported facilities and other humanitarian sites in northwest Syria.
The locations of the U.N.-supported facilities and other humanitarian sites had been shared with the warring parties in a bid to protect them. However, the United Nations has questioned whether it made them a target. 
Guterres noted that the members of the board of inquiry were unable to visit Syria to investigate as the government of Syria did not respond to repeated requested for visas. The attacks investigated by the board took place in April, May and July. 
Fighting has calmed in the northwestern region after Turkey, which backs rebels opposed to Assad and ramped up its deployment earlier this year, agreed on a ceasefire with Russia a month ago. The fighting has displaced nearly 1 million people in Idlib. 

A crackdown by Assad on pro-democracy protesters in 2011 led to Syria's civil war.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear a religious rights dispute brought by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Washington against the Washington area transit authority over its policy barring advertisements in its stations and on buses and trains on divisive issues including religion.
The conservative-majority court, usually receptive to religious rights claims, declined to review the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority's 2015 policy that bars political, religious and advocacy advertisements in the transportation system that serves the U.S. capital region.
One of the nine justices, conservative Brett Kavanaugh, would not have been able to participate due to his prior service on a court that previously dealt with the case. That means the Supreme Court could have turned out to be split 4-4 between its liberal and conservative justices, leaving the conservative majority unable to ensure a victory in the case. 
""Because the full court is unable to hear this case, it makes a poor candidate for our review,"" conservative Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in a statement regarding the court's action.
If Kavanaugh had participated ""our intervention and a reversal would be warranted,"" Gorsuch added. 
A federal judge in Washington declined to impose an injunction blocking the advertisement policy. The decision was upheld in 2019 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, which ruled that the policy did not discriminate against religious entities.
Archdiocese officials argued that the transit agency's policy violated religious and free speech rights guaranteed under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment as well as a federal law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that protects religious rights.
The legal fight stemmed from the archdiocese's unsuccessful attempt to buy advertisements in 2017 just before Christmas. The proposed advertisement, to be placed on the side of buses, featured an image of three shepherds and a shining star in a reference to events surrounding the birth of Jesus Christ as described in the Bible.
Archdiocese officials did not deny that the advertisements were of a religious nature, saying they were intended to spread a Christian message.

Archdiocese lawyers argued that the transit agency applied the policy inconsistently, noting that the agency approved advertisements promoting Christmas shopping placed by commercial entities.

BRATISLAVA (Reuters) - A Slovak court on Monday sentenced former soldier Miroslav Marcek to 23 years in prison for shooting and killing investigative journalist Jan Kuciak and his fiancée Martina Kusnirova in February 2018.
Marcek, 37, who was not present at the sentencing, had admitted guilt in the case, which led to nationwide protests and eventually brought down the Slovak government.
""It was cold-blooded and malicious. Victims did not have a chance to defend themselves,"" presiding judge Ruzena Szabova of the Specialised Criminal Court said at the hearing in Pezinok, north of Bratislava. ""His confession was a mitigating circumstance."" 
Prosecutor Juraj Novocky, who asked for a 25-year sentence, appealed against the sentence.
Kuciak had covered corruption and the links of influential businessmen to political, judicial and police leaders.
Businessman Marian Kocner, who was a target of Kuciak's reporting, is standing trial with two others in separate hearings on charges of procuring the murder.

(Reuters) - The Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, also known as the Mormon church, plans to open its first temple in mainland China at a time when Beijing has been clamping down steadily on religious freedoms.
The temple in the eastern Chinese city of Shanghai will help fill a gap left by renovation work since last July at the church's temple in Hong Kong, Russell M. Nelson, president of the church, announced on Sunday.
He also said seven other temples would open, including one in Dubai, its first in the Middle East.
""In Shanghai, a modest, multipurpose meeting place will provide a way for Chinese members to continue to participate in ordinances of the temple,"" Nelson said. 
""Because we respect the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China, the Church does not send proselytizing missionaries there; nor will we do so now,"" he said.
A former cardiac surgeon, Nelson has spent time in China, studied Mandarin and was granted an honorary professorship by China's Shandong University School of Medicine.
In January, the church sent two planeloads of protective medical equipment to the Children's Medical Center in Shanghai to help manage the coronavirus outbreak. 
No official figure is available for the number of Mormons in China. 
China's constitution guarantees religious freedom but under President Xi, Jinping Beijing has tightened restrictions on religions seen as a challenge to the authority of the ruling Communist Party.
The government has cracked down on underground churches, both Protestant and Catholic, and has rolled out legislation to increase oversight of religious education and practices.
Chinese law requires that places of worship register and submit to government oversight, but some have declined to register and are known as ""house"" or ""underground"" churches.
The Chinese government formally recognizes five religions: Buddhism, Taoism, Islam, Catholicism and Protestantism.
""Expatriate and Chinese congregations will continue to meet separately. The Church's legal status there remains unchanged,"" Nelson said. 
""In an initial phase of facility use, entry will be by appointment only. The Shanghai Temple will not be a temple for tourists from other countries,"" he said.

In 2018, the Vatican and China signed an agreement on the appointment of Roman Catholic bishops, a breakthrough on an issue that for decades fuelled tensions between the Holy See and Beijing and thwarted efforts toward diplomatic relations.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Brown-robed Franciscans stride through a shuttered and deserted Jerusalem to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the global focus of the most important festival in the Christian calendar - but in a city bereft of Easter pilgrims.
Among them is Father Francesco Patton, 56, the custodian of the Holy Land for the Roman Catholic church, responsible for protecting its sacred sites. 
""We are living in strange days. Usually at this time the Old City was full of ...pilgrims coming for Holy Week,"" he said after his group prayed outside the locked door of the church that is their base.
The Franciscans' ceremonial walk along the Via Dolorosa marks the journey that Christians believe Jesus took to his crucifixion and resurrection.
This Easter the route bears new bronze reliefs depicting that journey, a gift from Verona sculpted by Italian artist Alessandro Mutto. But there is no-one to see them.
""Now it is a little bit sad to see that ...nobody is able to walk (it). But we know that at this moment so many people are walking a personal Via Dolorosa, when I think of those who are in the hospital and in their houses fighting with coronavirus,"" Patton said.
COVID-19 has infected more than 8,600 in Israel, with 52 fatalities. Residents are locked down in their homes for all but essential activities, which do not include religious ceremonies.
So the Christian denominations that share custody of the Holy Sepulchre face closures unprecedented in living memory, as do Jewish and Muslim leaders in a city that has sites sacred to all three faiths. Passover, Easter and Ramadan all fall this month, with Catholics celebrating Easter on April 12.
Like other clergy, Patton's Franciscans conform with social distancing guidelines as they say prayers along the Via Dolorosa, stopping at the 14 Stations of the Cross that mark events leading up to Jesus' burial.
When they arrive at the Sepulchre, they pray for the sick and the dying around the world, and the medical staff treating them - as Patton's predecessors treated the sick in medieval times.
""A small Franciscan community started to live in the Holy Sepulchre in 1333, so you can imagine what it means for us, this place,"" Patton said.
""...The responsibility to pray in the place in which Jesus conquered death, to pray for all those who are, in this moment, very (much) in the face of death.""

BASRA, Iraq (Reuters) - Rockets landed near a district that houses foreign workers in Iraq's oil industry early on Monday, including U.S. oil service company Halliburton (NYSE:HAL), but caused no damage or casualties, oil and police sources said.
Police said three Katyusha rockets were launched around 3 a.m. local time and hit the Burjesia residential and operations headquarters west of Iraq's main southern city, Basra. A launcher and 11 unfired rockets were found nearby and dismantled by security forces, according to the statement.
An Iraqi employee working with Halliburton said the rockets fell far from the site. The district houses foreign oil workers and offices of both foreign and Iraqi oil companies, but has been largely empty in recent weeks after nearly all foreign personnel were evacuated because of the coronavirus pandemic.
Two officials with state-run Basra Oil Co., which oversees oil operation in the south, said the attack had not affected production and export operations.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack. Police said they deployed additional forces to search the area.
Iran-backed paramilitary groups have regularly been rocketing and shelling bases in Iraq that host U.S. forces and the area around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

AL UBEIDIYA, West Bank (Reuters) - Bedouin herders in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, already isolated by virtue of their nomadic lifestyle, have become more cut off than ever from ordinary Palestinian life since the coronavirus outbreak began.
That isolation is a double-edged sword. They say their mobility makes them less vulnerable to catching the infection, but a territory-wide lockdown imposed to slow the spread of the disease means they are no longer able to sell their farm produce in local villages.
Some 30,000 Palestinians live in the pastoral encampments scattered across the West Bank, where sheep are herded along uninhabited hills and rocky valleys. 
They have largely been spared the restrictions imposed in towns and villages, where 240 cases of COVID-19 and one fatality have been documented.
""This is why the Bedouin lifestyle is better than the cities,"" said Salameh Safi, 75, a shepherd on a donkey tending his flock near Bethlehem and sporting a red-and-white keffiyeh to shield his eyes from the early spring sun. 
But Mohammad Ishak, 53, a Bedouin near Jericho in the Jordan Valley, said he could no longer gain access to nearby communities to sell cheese and other sheep products. 
""We will suffer losses because the farming sector has taken a hit,"" he said. 
""We can’t reach Ramallah or any other city to sell,"" added Sulaiman al-Zaher, 65, another Bedouin near Jericho.
Ali Abed Rabbo, general director of preventive medicine at the Palestinian Health Ministry, told Reuters the herders' lifestyle might put them at an advantage in terms of not catching the virus - ""but on condition none of them mixes with residents of the cities and the villages.""

Sweden has so far taken a low-key approach to containing the virus. Unlike most of Europe, which is in virtual lockdown, Swedes can still go to the gym and eat at restaurants, while primary and secondary schools remain open.
The Social Democrat-led coalition says it lacks a sufficient legal mandate to be able to react rapidly to the pandemic, which has killed more than 400 people in Sweden and nearly 65,000 globally.
""We have seen how quickly the situation in Sweden and Europe can change and we see a need for more possibilities to be able to react quickly if the situation demands it,"" Health and Social Affairs Minister Lena Hallengren said in a statement.
Many governments around the world have adopted extraordinary powers to fight the virus, raising fears that the democratic process could be undermined.
Sweden's government said parliament would be given the chance to approve individual measures, ""as soon as possible"" after they were imposed. It also said the new legislation would not give it the power to declare martial law.
The government is asking parliament to grant it wider executive powers for three months.
The Health Ministry did not immediately respond to requests for comment and it was not clear when parliament would vote on the bill.

The government has banned meetings of more than 50 people and closed homes for the elderly to visitors, while students in higher education are studying on line.

The attack took place on Saturday in the northeastern province of Ituri, which borders Uganda and South Sudan, Xinhua said, without naming the mine in question or the company operating it. ""Three Chinese citizens were unfortunately killed,"" it added.
The DRC is the world's biggest producer of mined cobalt - a key ingredient in batteries for electric vehicles - and one of Africa's biggest copper producers, although its key copper-cobalt producing region is in the southwest, far from the site of the attack. 
The country has attracted billions of dollars in investment from Chinese miners in recent years despite security risks. Canadian gold miner Banro, which owns mines in Maniema, a DRC province south of Ituri, suspended operations last year after several of its mines were overrun by armed rebels.
The Chinese embassy has asked the Congolese government to ""take effective measures to protect the lives and property of Chinese citizens"" in the DRC, as well as to expedite an investigation into the killings, Xinhua said, noting that the embassy had repeatedly advised Chinese citizens against travel to Ituri due to the presence of armed groups.
The embassy did not immediately respond to an e-mailed request for comment on Monday, a public holiday in China.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - A powerful tropical cyclone made landfall on the South Pacific island nation of Vanuatu on Monday, witnesses said, levelling buildings in a country already in a state of emergency due to concerns about the coronavirus.
Cyclone Harold approached Sanma province, an island north of the capital Port Vila, with winds of up to 215 km (133 miles) per hour about 1 pm local time (0200 GMT), as the country of 276,000 people bunkered down.
There were no immediate reports of injuries. The cyclone was upgraded to a Category 5 as it approached, the highest category.
""There is lots of damage in Sanma, they lost lots of buildings,"" said Jacqueline de Gaillande, CEO of Vanuatu Red Cross, by telephone from the capital Port Vila where the cyclone was expected to hit overnight.
The province of Sanmar sits on the biggest of Vanuatu's 80 islands and is home to its second-most populous city, Luganville, where photos circulated on social media purported to show buildings flattened by the storm.
""We don't know if we can provide any supports to the island because we are not allowed to travel inter-island and we are waiting for the government to make that decision,"" added de Gaillande, referring to travel restrictions associated with the coronavirus.
Vanuatu has reported no cases of the new coronavirus but has nonetheless declared a state of emergency, banned most international and domestic air travel and limited public gatherings to five people as it tries to prevent a local outbreak of the flu-like illness that has infected nearly 1.3 million people and resulted in about 70,000 deaths globally.
The Pacific region has recorded about 60 confirmed cases of the illness and one death, in Guam, according to media reports.
The Australian Broadcasting Corp reported that Vanuatu officials had relaxed social distancing rules over the weekend because of concern about the cyclone. Vanuatu's National Disaster Management Office was not immediately available for comment on Monday.
A day earlier, Solomon Islands police said they retrieved five bodies in their search for 27 people who were swept off a ferry by the cyclone as it passed over the country.
The MV Taimareho set sail early on Friday in strong winds with 738 passengers including crew and the captain on board. Police said the missing were believed to have fallen off during heavy seas.
Vanuatu, and the province of Sanma in particular, was hit hard in 2015 by the Category 5 Cyclone Pam that pummelled the capital Port Vila and other islands.

TOKYO (Reuters) - As Japan faces a fresh wave of coronavirus infections and the government prepares for a state of emergency, medical staff say a shortage of beds and a rise in cases linked to hospitals are pushing Tokyo's medical system to the brink of collapse.
The crisis has already arrived at Eiju General Hospital, a pink, 10-storey building in central Tokyo, which has reported 140 cases of COVID-19 in the past two weeks. Of those, at least 44 are doctors, nurses and other medical staff. 
On a recent weekday, the glass doors of Eiju General were plastered with posters saying the hospital was closed until further notice. 
More than 60 patients with the virus are still being treated inside. One person who was transferred to another hospital infected others, according to health officials in Tokyo's Taito ward.
Japan has only a small fraction of the number of cases reported by its neighbours China and South Korea. Yet scenarios similar to that at Eiju General are playing out across Tokyo, as a dozen doctors and nurses in the city told Reuters there is a shortage of gear and staff even as infections surge.
""We could empty out an entire ward and use it just for corona patients, but that means those patients (with other illnesses) will have to go elsewhere,"" said a doctor specialising in infectious diseases at a major hospital in the greater Tokyo area. ""If we can't do that, it will lead to the virus spreading all through the hospital and lead to a collapse of our medical system.""
Official data tell a similar story. Tokyo's government said that as of Sunday, 951 people with COVID-19 were hospitalised; in a live YouTube address Sunday night, Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike said there were about 1,000 beds allocated for coronavirus patients in the city.
Even as other countries have locked down borders and ramped up testing, Japan appeared to have side-stepped the kind of mass infections seen elsewhere - an effect some experts say was mostly due to a lack of testing. In the early stages of the epidemic, Japan was also weighing whether to postpone the Summer Olympics, a decision that eventually came in late March. 
Since mid-January, Japan has tested 39,446 people, while the United Kingdom has tested 173,784 and South Korea has conducted 443,273 tests, according to data from Oxford University. 
Authorities have tried to test and track in a way that avoided overwhelming Japan's hospitals, said Hitoshi Oshitani, an infectious disease specialist on the government panel shaping the country's coronavirus policy. 
Despite that, the total number of positive cases nationwide nearly doubled in the last seven days to 3,654. Tokyo is now the largest hub for COVID-19 in Japan, with more than 1,000 confirmed cases. 
With cases surging, officials said, some who tested positive have had to briefly wait at home or in outpatient sections of hospitals until beds became available. Koike said on Sunday that to ease the burden on medical staff, Tokyo would transfer people with mild symptoms into hotels and other accommodations starting Tuesday.
Hiroshi Nishiura, a Hokkaido University professor and member of a panel advising the government on its coronavirus response, said Eiju General, like many Tokyo hospitals, has no infectious disease department. That meant coronavirus patients were initially treated alongside everyone else, allowing the virus to spread.
    ""We have not been able to clearly contain the contagion from the first wave,"" Nishiura said, referring to Eiju General. A spokesman from the hospital declined to comment on Monday. 
On Friday, another hospital in Tokyo said three nurses and one doctor had been infected while treating patients. The next day, Tokyo saw its daily coronavirus cases top 100 for the first time, and on Sunday 143 people tested positive.
A representative for the Tokyo government said Monday that ""the medical system remains secure,"" adding that Tokyo was continuing to urge residents to avoid all unnecessary outings. 
SCRAMBLE FOR BEDS 
Contagion is an enormous risk in dense Tokyo, a city of nearly 14 million people. Japan also has one of world's oldest populations, with nearly a third of the country - 36 million people - older than 65. 
According to Japan's health ministry, there are some 1.5 million hospital beds nationwide, but beds in negative-pressure rooms reserved for infectious diseases excluding tuberculosis have dwindled to just 1,882, with only 145 in Tokyo. 
Though people with COVID-19 do not all need such rooms, they still must be kept apart from other patients.
In recent days, Tokyo officials have been scrambling to secure 4,000 beds for coronavirus patients, asking hospitals to free up space in ordinary wards and even offering financial incentives, said one city official with direct knowledge of the planning. He declined to be named as he was not authorised to speak to media.
""There isn't that much capacity (of hospital beds) left in Tokyo, so a (medical collapse) is no longer unforeseeable,"" said Satoshi Kamayachi, an executive board member of the Japan Medical Association, which has pushed Japan to call for a state of emergency. ""The number of patients is clearly rising, so the situation is becoming more urgent.""
    
JAPAN'S RESPONSE
Even after Japan drew fire for how it handled patients on the cruise ship Diamond Princess, it did little to step up testing and preparations, some critics say.
Tokyo assemblyman Akihiro Suzuki wrote to Koike on Jan. 31, asking her to set up a medical and consultation system for coronavirus cases. 
    ""The response was slow and even now it's (too) slow,"" he said. Suzuki has submitted 10 requests since then asking for a range of measures, from procuring more ventilators to clarifying Tokyo's policy on treating critical patients.
A representative for the Tokyo metropolitan government said the city had been preparing ""specific medical measures"" since March 23 for a possible increase in cases, including securing more beds. 
A half-dozen nurses working at clinics and mid-sized Tokyo hospitals said that they had been told to reuse masks and were concerned about having enough staff to deal with a surge. Several doctors said they had been told not to discuss the capacity of their hospitals with the media.
Nurses told Reuters they were not sure whether their hospitals had enough advanced personal protective equipment like N95 masks and plastic gowns. 
""The other day I saw a news report that a nurse wearing a trash bag as protective gear died in New York and I wondered if that'll be me in the future,"" one nurse in her 30s told Reuters. Like many other medical workers, she declined to be named because she is not allowed to speak to the media. 
Kasumi Matsuda, who works for the Japan Federation of Medical Workers' Unions and was a nurse for 13 years, said many of its 170,000 members had also reported a lack of protective gear.
""I think the system is already beginning to fall apart,"" she said.
As the number of cases rises in Tokyo, the Japan Medical Association and Tokyo governor Koike have asked the central government to quickly declare a state of emergency to reduce the rate of infections. 
Such a declaration empowers governors to close public facilities and ""name and shame"" companies that refuse official requests. But it cannot force companies to comply. 
Media reports on Monday indicated that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was preparing to declare a state of emergency this week after days of saying such a decision would be premature. 
On Friday, a non-profit organisation that offers developmental aid abroad, said it would build a makeshift hospital with 1,200 beds by the end of April in a bayside shopping district of Tokyo. 

The beds will be set up under tents in a parking lot of a museum of maritime science, a building shaped like a docked ship.

MELBOURNE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Carnival Corp's (N:CCL) troubled Ruby Princess cruise liner, the biggest single source of coronavirus infections in Australia, docked south of Sydney on Monday to get help for sick crew members requiring urgent medical treatment.
The Ruby Princess, now the target of a criminal investigation led by the homicide squad in the state of New South Wales (NSW), has more than 1,000 crew still on board, after passengers disembarked in mid-March without health checks.
There have been at least 360 COVID-19 cases, including passengers and staff, associated with the vessel, which includes at least six deaths.
As a popular Pacific port destination, Australia is among numerous countries around the world negotiating arrangements with cruise ships unable to find somewhere to dock.
NSW Police said in a statement on Monday that the vessel may remain in place for up to 10 days, but the crew will not disembark unless approved by state authorities.
Sick crew members were being treated on board or transferred to hospital, police said, and the vessel will be refuelled in preparation for departure.
Australia has more than 5,700 confirmed COVID-19 cases and its death toll rose to 39 on Monday after four additional deaths were recorded overnight.
An investigation into Ruby Princess protocols will focus on communications and actions that led to the docking and disembarking of the ship's 2,700 passengers on March 19 at Sydney Harbour to see whether biosecurity laws or state laws were broken, authorities said.
State health authorities had classed the ship as low risk, and the Australian Border Force issued a notice allowing the passengers to travel home freely. They were required to self-isolate for 14 days.
A Carnival Australia spokesman said on Monday the company would cooperate with the probe.
""In addition to willingly participating in the investigation, Carnival Australia will vigorously respond to any allegations of which there must now be full disclosure and the basis for them,"" the spokesman said in emailed comments.
The ship has remained in Australian waters and on Monday docked at Port Kembla, with the remaining crew from 50 different countries on board to stay in isolation.
The government banned cruise ships from docking except for emergencies as of mid-March and has sent off most of the cruise ships that remained in Australian waters over the past week. 
Australia has seen a sharp drop off in the rate of new cases after the country imposed tight new measures limiting public gatherings to two people, shutting pubs, restaurants, and gyms, closing state borders and quarantining people off all incoming flights in hotels for 14 days.
""We are seeing some early positive signs as a result of the restrictions we're putting in place,"" NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian told reporters on Monday.
Pacific nations have so far avoided some of the more devastating effects of COVID-19 suffered in China, parts of Europe and the United States.
New Zealand, which has been in lock-down since March 25, has recorded just over 1,100 confirmed cases. It has suffered one death linked to the virus.

New Zealand's Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said on Monday that the rate of increase in COVID-19 cases was ""levelling off"".

The United States puts 60 to 90 migrants on each of up to three flights a day to Guatemala, which has become a key part of President Donald Trump's plan to curb the flow of migrants.
Sunday's request comes after two deported migrants, who arrived without virus symptoms, were hospitalised in recent weeks after testing positive. 
""We are requesting that...to safeguard the health of the country,"" Monroy told a news conference, adding that 25 people set to arrive on a flight on Monday were certified healthy after 15 days of monitoring in the United States prior to deportation.
Guatemala would accept only deportees who hail from the area around its capital, to rein in the disease as most Guatemalan migrants in the United States were from rural areas, Monroy added.
Guatemala has recorded 70 infections and three deaths from the virus.

The Libyan national army (LNA) commanded by Khalifa Haftar, whose forces have been trying to take the Tripoli for a year, said its cargo plane was hit at Tarhouna, a town south of Tripoli which the LNA controls and uses as a main forward base.
LNA spokesman Ahmed Mismari said the plane was carrying medical supplies to fight the coronavirus outbreak, while the Tripoli forces said it had been carrying ammunition.
The UAE has been supporting the LNA, supplying them with Chinese-made Wing Loong drones that long gave them an aerial advantage over less powerful Turkish drones used by their rivals, according to U.N. experts, diplomats and analysts.
However, Turkey has recently been sending reinforcements to the GNA, which include air defense systems and new drones as well as military advisors, analysts say.
The LNA has been trying since last year to capture the capital Tripoli, seat of the internationally recognised Government of National Accord (GNA).
An escalation in the fighting could spell disaster for Libya's already fragmented and badly stretched health system in handling the coronavirus, after authorities confirmed the first case of the disease in late March.

121,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2020 08:32AM ET</span>","No parties, no problem: Introverts don't mind sheltering at home","By Sharon Bernstein
(Reuters) - With her painting, baking and near-constant gardening, Stephanie Hollowell kept busy at home even before efforts to stem the coronavirus pandemic meant she had to stay inside the Dallas, Texas house she calls her little kingdom. 
She didn't invite people to come taste her prizewinning cookies, or sample the sweet ground cherries that she grows. A proud introvert, public health orders to stay put suited her just fine.
""So many people are experiencing the painful aspects of this,"" said Hollowell, an air traffic controller who took early retirement five years ago, when she was 50. ""But basically my life has not changed one single bit.""
In the weeks since millions of people worldwide have been ordered to stay at home except for essential errands, the number of calls to psychiatrists has gone up as depression and anxiety wrack patients who lack social contact, and cannot even come in for an in-person therapy session.
But for those who are more used to solitary pursuits, the time alone can be rejuvenating - and a relief from the distress brought on by news of the coronavirus and its ravages.
Cynthia Burrell, a massage therapist whose home-based Seattle business has been shuttered, said despite the loss of work she has enjoyed the quieter time with her husband. The couple, avid birders, miss their outings with the local Audubon group, but have been amazed to watch a Bewick's wren gather up their cat's fur to line its nest. They have seen black-capped chickadees at one neighbor's house, she said, and chestnut-backed chickadees at another. 
Gardening, sketching and watching birds in her yard has eased the near-crippling anxiety she had felt about coronavirus in the weeks leading up to her state's shelter-at-home order.
""It is almost like an introvert's dream,"" said Burrell, 52. ""You can't have a social life. You have to stay home on a Friday or Saturday night. ... It's honestly a huge relief to have less to do.""
SCI-FI AND NETFLIX
The American Psychological Association defines introversion as a personality trait in which people are more inwardly than outwardly focused, and relatively more reserved. The trait dwells along a continuum that culminates with extroversion, an outwardly oriented approach that includes people who are more outgoing and gregarious.
Because introverts tend to have fewer social interactions during the regular course of their days than extroverts, they may be better positioned to weather enforced time at home than extroverts - at least initially, said Matthias Mehl, a research psychologist at the University of Arizona, Tucson.
But all humans require social connections, even those who are more reclusive. So if quarantines or ""shelter-at-home"" orders last a long time, introverts will eventually need to find ways to step up their own interactions with others, Mehl said.
Jim Noh, a software engineer from Vancouver, Washington, works from home during the day, attending multiple meetings via video conferencing software, and spends most of the rest of his time on indoor pursuits such as reading science fiction novels and streaming shows on Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) and other services.
He and his girlfriend, also an introvert, have found projects to do in their apartment, putting together a hydroponic garden and fixing a wobbly bench. When the public health restrictions forced him to put off a trip to Seattle to visit a friend, it was actually something of a relief not to have the anticipatory anxiety that often precedes social interactions - even those he is looking forward to - Noh said.
But he said the discussions during the regular video chat meetings organized by his employer, a health care startup, have taken a turn for the personal, as colleagues feel the need to connect more, albeit electronically.
""I have noticed people are a little more social, a little more chatty,"" said Noh, 36. ""They're more likely to ask, 'How's it going?'""
LIVING WITH EXTROVERTS
Marylin Bardet does not view herself as an introvert, but after a lifetime of community activism and involvement in her local community of Benicia, California, the 72-year-old is happy to immerse herself in painting, reading and other quiet activities at a time when a simple errand like going to the grocery store has become fraught with fear and worry.
""I am comfortable because I can read, I listen to music and go to the studio,"" she said. ""I can paint uninterruptedly.""
Hours stretching into quiet hours were also the dream of Emily Adelsohn Corngold, 77. The stay-at-home order meant she did not have to agree to every social invitation she receives at the Pasadena, California, retirement community where she lives with her husband. She said she was looking forward to working on editing a friend's memoir.
But she did not take into account her gregarious husband, a retired professor who could no longer go into his nearby office at the California Institute of Technology (CalTech).

""He's very social and he wants to talk,"" Corngold said. ""We now have to talk through almost everything.""

France, like other countries, has confined its residents to home since March 17 to curb the spread of the virus. The measures have been extended until April 15, and are likely to be extended again. 
Several guests on Sunday televisions shows, including doctors, were alarmed by images of many Parisians out and about along the banks of the river Seine and on car-less streets and sidewalks, jogging, strolling and enjoying the sunny weather.
""When we see some of these images, when we see some of these attitudes, it is true that it is totally incomprehensible,"" Jean Rottner, head of the Grand Est region, where the outbreak first took hold, said on BFM TV. 
The situation is still too serious in Paris to start thinking of lifting the confinement, Rottner's counterpart Valerie Pecresse, head of the greater Paris region, said on the same channel.
""Do not cede to the temptation, even if it is the holidays and the weather is good. Stay at home as much as possible,"" she said. ""Our health system is saturated, nothing would be worse than a semi-confinement.""
Two high-speed TGV trains transferred a new batch of patients needing intensive care from the Paris region to hospitals in Brittany on Sunday to ease the pressure on healthcare facilities that have been overwhelmed by the epidemic.
The director general of France's health ministry Jerome Salomon said in a daily briefing on Saturday that 566 patients have been moved across various regions of France to ease the pressure on areas that have been badly hit by the outbreak.

France had a total of 89,953 confirmed or suspected cases in hospitals and nursing homes as of Saturday, according to health ministry data.

One of the friars used a loud-hailer in the streets of the walled Old City to summon people to their front doors and windows, where they received branches and blessings.
The beginning of the Holy Week leading to Easter, Palm Sunday commemorates Jesus' arrival in Jerusalem. Scripture speaks of his supporters scattering palm fronds in his path, an act often replicated today with branches of other native trees.

Jerusalem's churches, like Muslim and Jewish places of worship, are closed to the public. That has prompted the faithful to find alternatives to group prayer in a month in which the festivals of Passover, Easter and Ramadan will be marked in close succession.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis marked a surreal Palm Sunday in an empty St. Peter's Basilica, urging people living through the coronavirus pandemic not to be so concerned with what they lack but how they can ease the suffering of others.
The service, kicking off Holy Week events leading to Easter, usually attracts tens of thousands of people to a St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) bedecked with olive and palm trees. The service normally includes a long procession of cardinals, priests and faithful carrying palm fronds.
This time, it was held from a secondary altar behind the main one Francis normally uses and attended by only about two dozen people, including a few aides, nuns and a scaled-down choir, all practicing social distancing. 
The symbolic procession was only several meters long and a few potted olive trees were brought in.
The Mass was broadcast on television and over the internet to many millions. Churches in countries around the world were holding similar, virtual services this week because of restrictions on gatherings.
Cutting a solitary figure, Francis listened as three priests read the gospel account of Jesus' entry into Jerusalem and being hailed as the messiah.
Holy Week marks the period when Christians commemorate events surrounding the key tenets of their faith - that Jesus was betrayed, crucified and rose from the dead.
In his sermon, Francis urged his listeners to turn to God ""in the tragedy of a pandemic, in the face of the many false securities that have now crumbled, in the face of so many hopes betrayed, in the sense of abandonment that weighs upon our hearts"".
The pandemic could help transform fear into service, he said.
The Vatican has been in its own lockdown, mostly mirroring that in Italy, where more than 15,500 people have died since the outbreak of the new coronavirus epidemic in northern Italy on Feb. 21.
There are nearly 125,000 cases of the virus in Italy and seven in the Vatican. The pope and his closest aides have tested negative.
""The tragedy we are experiencing summons us to take seriously the things that are serious, and not to be caught up in those that matter less; to rediscover that life is of no use if not used to serve others. For life is measured by love,"" Francis said on Sunday.
""May we reach out to those who are suffering and those most in need. May we not be concerned about what we lack, but what good we can do for others,"" he said.
All of the pope's Holy Week services, which normally draw tens of thousands of pilgrims and tourists to Rome, will take place in the empty basilica in a scaled-down version.

The Good Friday Via Crucis (Way of the Cross) procession, which normally takes place around Rome's Colosseum, will instead be held in the relatively small atrium of the basilica.

NEW DELHI/DHAKA (Reuters) - India is restricting the export of most diagnostic testing kits, as coronavirus cases in the South Asian nation topped 3,350 on Sunday despite a three-week nationwide lockdown to slow the spread of the respiratory disease.
India, which in recent weeks already banned the export of certain drugs, along with ventilators, masks and other protective gear needed by both patients and medical staff, issued the latest directive on Saturday.
The move comes even as U.S. President Donald Trump urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a phone call on Saturday, to release supplies of anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which is being tested as a possible treatment for patients with COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus.
""The two leaders agreed to remain in touch on the issue of global supply chains for critical pharmaceuticals and medical supplies and to ensure they continue to function as smoothly as possible during the global health crisis,"" White House spokesman Judd Deere, said in a tweet on Saturday.

The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in South Asia, home to roughly 1.9 billion people, climbed close to 7,000 on Sunday, even as the death toll from the respiratory disease in the Indian subcontinent rose to 143. 
While the figures are relatively low in comparison with the United States, China, Italy and Spain, health experts fear that the spread of the pandemic in South Asia would overwhelm already weak public health systems in the region.
Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on Sunday unveiled a 727.50 billion taka ($8.56 billion) stimulus package to help the economy overcome the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.
""The amount is equivalent to 2.52 percent of gross domestic product,"" Hasina said in a televised address.
Reuters earlier this month reported that Bangladesh, the second-largest apparel producer after China, is set to lose roughly $6 billion in export revenue this financial year amid order cancellations from some of the world's largest brands and retailers.

127,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 05, 2020 06:15AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Planned $1 billion U.S. aid cut would hit Afghan security force funds: sources,"By Jonathan Landay, Arshad Mohammed and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A planned $1 billion cut in U.S. aid to Afghanistan would come from funds for Afghan security forces, according to three U.S. sources, a step experts said would undercut both Kabul's ability to fight the Taliban and its leverage to negotiate a peace deal with them.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the reduction on March 23 and threatened to slash the same amount next year to try to force Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his political rival Abdullah Abdullah to end a feud that has helped stall U.S.-led peace-making efforts in Afghanistan.
After nearly 20 years of fighting the Taliban, the United States is looking for a way to extricate itself and to achieve peace between the U.S.-backed government and the militant group, which controls more than 40% of Afghan territory.
Pompeo and other U.S. officials have declined to publicly detail how the cut would be made. The State Department declined to comment on its plans.
Two U.S. congressional aides, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said State Department officials told Congress the $1 billion would come from a $4.2 billion Pentagon fund that underwrites about three quarters of the Afghan security forces' annual budget.
""The idea they would cut security forces funding goes against U.S. national security interests,"" said one aide, arguing the money is needed to maintain the U.S.-backed government's ability to fight the Taliban while preserving its bargaining power in peace talks.
Most of the fund pays for salaries, food, fuel, equipment and infrastructure to support Afghan troops and national police.
Congress appropriated at least $86.4 billion for Afghan security assistance between fiscal years 2002 and 2019, according to a March 11 Congressional Research Service report.
""That's the only fund large enough to support a $1 billion cut,"" said the third source, a former U.S. military official who also requested anonymity.
U.S. civilian aid is far lower, with the State Department requesting $532.8 million this year, mainly for general economic support as well as for counter-narcotics and law enforcement. 
[[ GRAPHIC-U.S. security and other aid to Afghanistan: https://tmsnrt.rs/2JEbypR ]]
Pompeo announced the cut as he flew home from Kabul after failing to persuade Ghani and Abdullah to end a dispute over Afghanistan's September 2019 presidential election. 
Both men claim they won and have held rival inaugurations.
Pompeo said the cut could be reversed if the two resolved their dispute, which had stymied naming an Afghan delegation to negotiate peace with the Taliban after decades of war.
His threat appears to have had some impact.
On March 26, Ghani announced a negotiating team including Abdullah allies and Abdullah endorsed the slate on March 31.
Government and Taliban officials have also agreed to start prisoner releases as a prelude to peace talks envisaged under a Feb. 29 U.S.-Taliban deal for a phased U.S. troop withdrawal.
Laurel Miller, a former State Department official handling Afghanistan policy, said a $1 billion cut would take time to be felt but would hurt Afghan security operations and morale.
It would also allow the Taliban to start peace talks ""riding high,"" said Miller, now at the International Crisis Group think tank.
In the meantime, the Ghani-Abdullah dispute has persisted.
'THEY WILL BE TOAST'
A U.S. defense official, who said the administration was still weighing where to make the cut, described ""huge concern"" within the Pentagon about slashing funding for Afghan forces.
""We really don't want to have to do this,"" said the official on condition of anonymity, while acknowledging it made sense to target those funds because of the leverage it gave Washington.
""That is the pain point. That is what they care about a lot,"" said the official, adding that there were internal talks about whether enough progress has been made for Pompeo to withdraw the threatened cut.
The former U.S. military official said the proposed cut reflects U.S. President Donald Trump's determination to bring U.S. forces home from the longest conflict in American history.

Asked what $1 billion U.S. aid cuts this year and next would do to Afghan security forces' ability to fight the Taliban, he replied: ""They will be toast.""

The oil ministry of the internationally-recognized, Saudi-backed government in Yemen said on Sunday the Iran-aligned Houthi group had targeted the station, according to the Saudi state news agency (SPA). 
Hussein al-Ezzi, an official in the Houthi-controlled government based in the capital Sanaa since 2014, said Saudi-led coalition forces had attacked the Kofel pumping station in what he described as a dangerous escalation. 
Both sides gave no details of the reported attack.
The pipeline is operated by the Yemeni government-owned Safer oil company but no oil has been pumped through it for years. 
Yemen's oil output has collapsed since 2015 when a Saudi-led military coalition intervened in the war to try to restore the government of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi to power after it was ousted by Houthi forces in Sanaa.
The United Nations and Western powers hope the threat posed by the global coronavirus pandemic will push Yemen's combatants into fresh talks to end a largely stalemated war that has left millions vulnerable to disease and starvation.

Iran has been struggling to curb the spread of the highly infectious respiratory disease known as COVID-19 but authorities are also concerned that measures to limit public life to contain the virus could wreck an already sanctions-battered economy.
""Under the supervision of the health ministry, all those low-risk economic activities will resume from Saturday,"" President Hassan Rouhani said in a televised meeting, adding that ""those activities will resume in Tehran from April 18"".
""Two thirds of all Iranian government employees will work out of the office from Saturday...The decision does not contradict stay at home advice by the health authorities.""

Iranian officials have repeatedly complained that many Iranians ignored appeals to stay at home and cancel travel plans for the New Year holidays that began on March 20.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian health officials said on Sunday they were cautiously optimistic about the slowing spread of the coronavirus in the country but warned social distancing restrictions are to stay in place for months.
Confirmed cases rose by 139 during the 24-hour period to Sunday afternoon, bringing the national total to 5,687, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said. The death toll from COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, rose to 34.
This suggests the daily rate of infections was below 5%, about a fifth of what Australia saw in mid-March. 
""We are increasingly confident that if people continue to adhere to what we've been asking them to do we can prevent a situation like we've seen in many other countries in the world,"" Murphy said in a televised briefing.
Australia has barred people from leaving homes for anything but the most necessary activities and limited public gatherings to just two people. State borders, cafes, clubs, parks and gyms have been closed. 
Several states have also given police the power to enforce the rules via hefty on-the-spot fines and potential jail terms. Only on Saturday, Victoria's police issued 142 fines for breaking social distancing rules, according to officials. 
Health Minister Greg Hunt warned over the weekend, however, that despite the good signs, Australians will still have to keep their distance from others for a ""difficult"" six-month period.
""Some other countries or some other individuals may talk about the fact that we could magically stop everything for two weeks and it will all go away: that's not an honest assessment in our view,"" Hunt said on Sky News Australia.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews said on Sunday while there has been some ""wonderful success"" in slowing coronavirus spread, Australians ""have a long way to go"".
Nearly a third of Australia's deaths have been attributed to a Carnival (NYSE:CCL) Corp's Ruby Princess cruise ship, which was last month allowed to disembark passengers in Sydney, many of whom later tested positive for COVID-19. 
New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said on Sunday a criminal investigation will be launched into the case.
The South Pacific nation of Fiji recorded on Saturday five new cases of coronavirus, bringing the total to 12, according to the government. 
In New Zealand, which was fast to introduce strict restrictions that have ordered more people to stay home, trips to retail and recreation facilities, such as restaurants, cafes or shopping centers were down 91 percent, according to Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL).
New Zealand recorded 48 new cases on Sunday, bringing the total to 872. One person has died so far of the flu-like respiratory disease, according to the health ministry data. 
Premier Jacinda Ardern said on Sunday that ""going hard and going early"" seems to be working.
""While compliance has been generally strong, there are still some I would charitably describe as idiots,"" Ardern said in a televised briefing.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican tequila makers have sought to dispel concerns that their exports to the United States will dry up, after two large brewers in the country suspended production to comply with government rules put in place due to the new coronavirus.
""Neither in the United States nor in Canada are there restrictions on manufacturing and selling alcoholic beverages,"" the president of the Mexican tequila chamber, Rodolfo Gonzalez, said in an interview.
This week, Heineken and Grupo Modelo both said they would halt production in Mexico after the government declared a health emergency and ordered suspension of non-essential economic activity. 
It caused a storm on social media and large lines in some local supermarkets as Mexicans sought to stock up on beer. 
Mexican tequila makers, however, interpret the newly imposed rules differently. 
Gonzalez said the sector was still expecting growth rates of between 4% and 5% for this year - even as the new coronavirus is denting sales to bars, restaurants and hotels worldwide.
The United States and Canada are the largest export markets for the emblematic Mexican alcoholic beverage, with the chamber reporting about $2 billion in sales revenues across 118 countries every year. 
Gonzalez said the labor-intensive harvest of the prized agave plant would continue because agricultural production is considered an essential economic activity, even if the production of alcoholic beverages is not. 
Gonzalez said stopping crop production would have severe consequences for tequila makers. 

""We have to finish planting all the agave for the 2020 cycle by next month,"" Gonzalez added. ""If we were to suspend our activities it would cause irreversible damage.""

MILAN (Reuters) - Italy has seen a sharp fall in official reports of domestic violence as it approaches a month under coronavirus lockdown, raising concern among some support groups that forced confinement is leaving victims struggling to seek help.
Citing official data, a parliamentary committee into violence against women said last week that reports to police of domestic abuse dropped to 652 in the first 22 days of March, when Italy went into lockdown, from 1,157 in the same period of 2019.
Telefono Rosa, Italy's largest domestic violence helpline, said calls fell 55% to 496 in the first two weeks of March from 1,104 in the same period last year. Other help groups said they had seen similar declines.
The parliamentary committee's report said the trend did not mean a decline in violence against women but was rather a signal that ""victims of violence risk being even more exposed to control and aggression by a partner who mistreats them.""
""There are a lot of problems in this situation, maybe not the least of them is the difficulty of asking for help when everyone is obliged to stay at home,"" said Alessandra Simone, director of the police criminal division in Milan.
Successive Italian governments have passed reforms aimed at improving protections, but 13.6% of women have suffered violence from a partner or ex-partner, according to national statistics bureau Istat. 
The country has seen more than 100,000 cases of COVID-19 and accounts for almost a third of worldwide deaths. It was the first European nation to go into lockdown.
""We're seeing a drastic fall in calls by women because they have less freedom in this situation of forced confinement,"" said Chiara Sainaghi, who manages five anti-violence centers in and around Milan for the Fondazione Somaschi, a social assistance foundation. She said calls to her group had fallen by as much as 70%.
Some help groups and the authorities say they have tried to launch other forms of contact, including messaging services like WhatsApp, whose use has surged during lockdowns in many countries. Users in Italy are placing 20% more calls and sending 20% more messages on WhatsApp compared to a year ago, the company said in mid-March. 
Italian police have in recent days adapted an app originally designed to allow young people to report bullying and drug dealing near their schools to report domestic violence by sending messages or pictures without alerting their partner.
In Spain, where police said they had also seen a fall in calls for help, authorities launched a WhatsApp service for women trapped at home which the Equality Ministry said had seen a 270% increase in consultations since the lockdown began.
Valeria Valente, the senator who chairs the Italian parliamentary committee, said cultural and social factors in Italy already made it hard for many to report domestic violence.
But she said the shutdown appeared to be leading some women who might otherwise try to leave their partners to stick it out.

""How is a woman who wants to report violence supposed to move? With the lockdown (she) can only contact the anti-violence centers when she goes to the pharmacy or buys food,"" Valente said.

The nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party wants to hold elections on May 10 despite the pandemic, and has proposed legislation to introduce postal ballots to replace physical voting. 
A more liberal junior coalition partner, Accord, said it was unrealistic for the election to proceed and proposed a postponement of two years.
""This solution (postal voting) was used a few days ago in Bavaria,"" Duda told the Catholic daily newspaper Nasz Dziennik.
""We can also introduce this idea here ... Postal voting would be something new in Poland, but the situation is unusual.""
Asked when elections should take place if not on May 10, Duda said the vote should be held when it is safe to do so.
In a sign of the party's determination to implement postal voting, PiS on Friday replaced the head of the post office with Tomasz Zdzikot, who will leave his post as a Deputy Defense Minister.
Polish daily Rzeczpospolita quoted a source with knowledge of the matter as saying PiS wanted a trusted official as head of the post office at such a critical time.
Poland has imposed sweeping restrictions on public life to stop the spread of the virus, including closing schools, parks, forests and hotels and banning gatherings outside of more than two people, excluding families.
As of Saturday, it had reported 3,503 cases of the coronavirus and 73 deaths.
Duda criticized the European Commission in the interview for a lack of support over the pandemic.
""As a country we have not received any extra financial help from Brussels,"" he said.
""You can't see any great engagement from European institutions...concerning the activity of the European Commission, I must say it looks pretty poor,"" he said.

LAUSANNE (Reuters) - In Lausanne, a Swiss city on the shores of lake Geneva, the coronavirus outbreak has revived a tradition of centuries past: The cathedral watchman climbs the 153 stone steps to his tower at night, puts on a black hat, lights a lantern and rings the ""La Clemence"" bell to stir residents' solidarity and courage. 
It's a practice dating back to the Middle Ages, when watchmen at Lausanne Cathedral kept a vigil over the city and rang the bell if they spotted a fire.  
""We can compare this pandemic to a worldwide fire that has spread at lightning speed on all continents,"" Renato Hausler, one of the last cathedral watchmen in Europe, told Reuters.
""It was also considered an encouragement, more than a distress signal, everybody was hearing it and it brought unity with residents fighting the fire.""
Since last week Hausler has been ringing ""La Clemence"", the 16th-century bell, nearly every night, and calling out the hours from 10pm to 2am.
Switzerland's death toll from the novel virus has risen to nearly 500 and the total confirmed infections approach 20,000. 

Hausler wants to ""keep people awake with regards to what is happening, to stay focused"".

HANOI (Reuters) - Vietnam has lodged an official protest with China following the sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat it said had been rammed by a Chinese maritime surveillance vessel near islands in the disputed South China Sea.
The Vietnamese fishing vessel, with eight fishermen onboard, was fishing near the Paracel Islands on Thursday when it was rammed and sunk by the Chinese vessel, Vietnam's foreign ministry said in a statement posted on a government website on Saturday.
All the fishermen were picked up by the Chinese vessel alive and were transferred to two other Vietnamese fishing vessels operating nearby, the Vietnam Fisheries Society said in a statement posted to its website.
""The Chinese vessel committed an act that violated Vietnam's sovereignty over the Hoang Sa archipelago and threatened the lives and damaged the property and legitimate interests of Vietnamese fishermen,"" the foreign ministry said in its statement, referring to the Paracel Islands by its Vietnamese name.
Vietnam and China have for years been embroiled in a dispute over the potentially energy-rich stretch of water, called the East Sea by Vietnam.
The Vietnamese boat illegally entered the area to fish and refused to leave, the Chinese coast guard said late on Friday. 
After making some dangerous maneuvers, the boat collided with a Chinese patrol vessel and sank, the Chinese coast guard said in a statement on its social media account. 
The Chinese coast guard also said it had made solemn representations with the Vietnamese side. 
The incident marks the second time in less than a year a Vietnamese fishing vessel has been reportedly sunk by a Chinese vessel near the China-controlled Paracels.
A Chinese oil survey vessel conducted operations in Vietnamese-controlled waters for more than three months last year, causing a tense standoff between vessels from the two countries.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Embattled Chilean President Sebastian Pinera sparked outrage on Friday by posing for photographs at the plaza that was the centre of anti-government protests before it was put under quarantine to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. 
Photographs of Pinera in the now empty Plaza Italia on Friday afternoon, sitting in shirtsleeves on the steps of a monument plastered with graffiti calling for his resignation, went viral on social media. 
At least 31 people died, 3,000 were injured, and 30,000 were detained in the protests, which started in October over a hike in public transport rates and broadened to include grievances over pensions, healthcare, education and elitism.
The area around Plaza Italia is covered by a strict quarantine covering large parts of Santiago that prevents people from leaving their homes without specific permission from the authorities. Chile has 3,737 confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far, and 22 people have died. 
The centre-right president`s actions were ""divisive at a time when the country needs unity,"" said Heraldo Munoz, president of the center-left Christian Democratic Party.
""President Pinera goes walking in Plaza Italia while the government is asking people to stay at home - this is a provocation, improper for a head of state in the midst of a pandemic,"" he wrote on Twitter.
Pinera said the visit had been a spontaneous decision on his way home from work. 
""I took a photo and continued on my way. I regret if this could have been misinterpreted,"" he said on Twitter. 
Illapu, one of Chile`s best-loved bands, said Pinera´s actions risked sparking further protests once the coronavirus crisis is over.

""The square belongs to the people. We will come back with more force and we will be millions,"" the band tweeted.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordan confined its 10 million inhabitants to their homes in a sweeping one-day curfew on Friday that brought public life to a complete stop in a stepped-up bid to stem the spread of the coronavirus, witnesses and officials said.
The government said the 24-hour curfew that began Thursday at midnight, with a shutdown that encompassed shops, bakeries and even pharmacies and left open only hospitals and emergency services, was needed if Jordan was to avert a major outbreak.
""We sought through a complete curfew today to gauge our ability and to prepare ourselves for the worse, God forbid,"" Prime Minister Omar Razzaz told state television.
""The pandemic if it spreads will be difficult to control and we have to prepare for a period that is not short,"" Razzaz added, saying it would take Jordan a while to recover from the damaging impact of the crisis on its debt-laden economy.
The kingdom has seen a spike of coronavirus cases since announcing the first early last month, and now has a total of 310 with five deaths. 
The government announced a curfew two weeks ago after the monarch enacted an emergency law that gave Razzaz sweeping powers that restrict civil and political rights.
Tens of thousands of army troops and police have been deployed across the country. Movement has also been banned between governates and the capital.
The army has confiscated dozens of cars that violated the ban on vehicles with drivers facing a year in prison and heavy penalties.
The army also sealed the country's second largest city of Irbid near the Syrian border last week, placing 2 million inhabitants in a tight lockdown. It cordoned off several villages around the city after discovering many coronavirus cases caused by the spread during a mass wedding.
Even government ministers on Friday were confined to their homes, and police detained two deputies who broke the curfew in the toughest moves so far to restrict people's movements.
Twenty-two Muslim worshippers who went to pray in a mosque in the working-class district of Russaifa near Amman, the capital, were arrested for violating a strict ban on public prayers in mosques, security sources said.
The government said it would relax the curfew on Saturday to allow movement by foot for people to buy goods from local groceries and bakeries during daytime. The ban on vehicles and the night curfew will remain in place until further notice.

SOPO, Colombia (Reuters) - Carrying small children in their arms or lugging suitcases, the Venezuelan migrants trudged along the shoulder of the highway that runs northeast out of Colombia's capital Bogota, the first steps on a long and unexpected journey home.
Hundreds of poor Venezuelans are heading back to their economically-devastated country on foot - chased out of their adopted home by a coronavirus quarantine that makes it impossible for them to earn a living.
Colombia has become the top destination for Venezuelans fleeing their country's crisis - some 1.8 million have arrived in recent years - but a 19-day nationwide lockdown has halted the informal sector where many work, plunging them into poverty and prompting an abrupt reversal in migratory flows.
Despite hardships in Venezuela, which is gripped by hyperinflation and a six-year recession, many migrants said that at least in their homeland they will not have to pay rent or utilities and will be reunited with family.
""There are thousands who want to return to Venezuela,"" said Johnny Antonio Madronedo, 34, who used to make a living collecting items to recycle on Bogota's streets but no longer has money to keep a roof over his head. ""I can't live on the street with my family.""
The Venezuelan border is about 550 kms (340 miles) from the Colombian capital, which sits high in the Andes Mountains. Long-distance bus services have been halted because of the quarantine, so migrants said they have no choice but to walk. 
The journey takes between two and three weeks.
Madronedo said the hardest part would be passing through Colombia's cold, high-altitude wetlands: ""We'll have to wrap up and look for transport.""
For many, Colombia had seemed almost a paradise after widespread shortages in Venezuela. Yet migrants who worked selling candy, food or other items on the streets, dropping off deliveries, waiting tables or in construction have seen work dry up as Colombians retreated to their homes under government orders.
Empty streets and shuttered businesses also mean fewer passersby to ask for change, leaving migrants hungry or unable to pay daily rent for their modest accommodation.
""With coronavirus it's not the same,"" said 23-year-old migrant Paul Regales, who used to sell trash bags on the streets of Bogota. ""We make our living from people being on the streets, and if there's no one how do we work?""
Regales, who walks on crutches after his right leg was amputated, said he was evicted from his rented room because he could not pay the $3.60 daily fee.
He arrived in Bogota 18 months ago but was heading home to the Venezuelan city of Valencia on Thursday.
""It's not that it will be easy, but we don't pay rent there, we'll be with family,"" said Regales. ""If we're together it's better.""
With fear of coronavirus raging in Venezuela, where many hospitals lack running water and medical equipment, the migrants face an uncertain welcome. Some people returning from Colombia told Reuters they had been bused to cities in Venezuela and then forcibly quarantined in dire conditions.
In the Venezuelan border state of Tachira, all returnees will be required to quarantine, officials have said.
LONG WALK HOME
Commercial trucks plying the highway outside Bogota, allowed to operate during the lockdown, had in the past sometimes let migrants hitch a ride. Now the drivers pull over less often, migrants said, amid fears of contagion.
Many migrants expressed hope Colombia's government might provide transport, food and water, or that Venezuela would send buses to take them to their hometowns. 
But with the border officially closed and both governments scrambling to respond to the pandemic, help looked unlikely. 
A U.N. report this week said informal border crossings continue to function and thousands of Venezuelan migrants are slipping across covertly.
""We can't work because everyone reproaches us, ignores us. We don't sell anything,"" said 28-year-old Yosbeli Quintero, as she cradled her 9-month-old son.
Quintero, her husband, some cousins and friends are making their way back to the small town of Cambural, near the city of Barquisimeto in northern Venezuela.
Francy Florez, who owns a restaurant in Sopo, on the highway about 40 kms outside Bogota, told Reuters she sees at least 150 migrants walk past in small groups every day.
Some migrants said they had heard of Venezuelans beginning to walk home from Ecuador, southwest of Colombia, but Reuters was not able to independently verify that claim.
""Some are returning to their country of origin, in some cases because the pandemic means we are all returning home,"" Juan Francisco Espinosa, the director of Colombia's migration agency, told Reuters. ""The borders are closed and we cannot do entrances or exits.""
Only crossings for ""humanitarian"" reasons such as medical emergencies will be allowed, Espinosa said.

ROME (Reuters) - Russian criticism of an Italian newspaper was ""inappropriate"", Italy's foreign and defence ministries said on Friday, in a case that has cast a cloud over Moscow's efforts to help Rome cope with the coronavirus crisis.
Russia has sent doctors, nurses and medical equipment to disease-stricken Italy in a goodwill operation that Moscow has dubbed ""From Russia with love"".
While the Italian government has warmly thanked Russia, La Stampa, one of the country's oldest newspapers, has questioned the help. In one article it quoted anonymous political sources as saying 80% of the equipment was of little or no use. 
It also suggested the activity could lead to a security breach because of the large number of military involved.
The spokesman of Russia's Defence Ministry, Major General Igor Konashenkov, took to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Thursday to denounce the article, accusing La Stampa of besmirching a ""noble mission"", whipping up anti-Russian sentiment and spreading fake news.
He added that the paper should learn a Roman proverb ""He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it.""
The comment was widely denounced on Twitter by Italian journalists as a veiled threat on the life of the reporter who wrote the stories and an attack on press freedom.
Wading into the row on Friday, Italy's foreign and defence ministries issued a joint statement thanking Russia for its aid effort, but taking Konashenkov to task for his Facebook post.
""SORRY AND SURPRISED""
""In being grateful for this concrete manifestation of support, one cannot, at the same time, not condemn (Konashenkov's) inappropriate tone,"" the statement said.
""Freedom of expression and the right of criticism are fundamental values of our country, as is the right of reply,"" it added. ""At this time of global emergency, the role of the free press to check and analyse remains more essential than ever.""
There was no immediate comment from the Russian defence ministry in Moscow.
La Stampa itself said it was ""sorry and surprised"" that its coverage of the Russian mission had upset Moscow, adding it hoped ties between the two nations would not be hurt by Konashenkov's ""blatant disrespect"" for the right to report.
Italy has registered almost 120,000 cases of coronavirus over the past six weeks and 14,681 deaths - more fatalities than any country in the world. Russia has recorded 34 deaths to date and 4,149 infections.
The statement by the Italian ministries said the Russians had sent 32 health workers to Bergamo - the hardest-hit city in the country where thousands have died of coronavirus. 
Russian planes have also flown in, amongst other things, 150 ventilators, 330,000 masks, 1,000 protective suits, an analysis laboratory and three sanitisation units, it added.
""Our country, the object of such solidarity, can only be grateful,"" the statement said.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - The popularity of Brazil Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta has soared to 76% over his handling of the coronavirus crisis, more than double the slipping approval rating of President Jair Bolsonaro, a new poll showed on Friday.
Mandetta has insisted on reinforcing social distancing to slow the spread of the highly contagious virus that has killed 300 people in Brazil in two weeks, contradicting the president and raising fears that Bolsonaro might fire him.
According to Datafolha, 33% of those polled approve of Bolsonaro's response to the public health crisis, down from 35% last month.
Bolsonaro has shocked health experts around the world by persistently playing down the gravity of the pandemic, calling COVID-19 ""a little cold"" exaggerated by the media and his opponents - even after his political idol U.S. President Donald Trump walked back his own skepticism about the outbreak. His stance has isolated him politically in Brazil.
An earlier poll released on Friday by XP Investimentos showed that Brazilians overwhelmingly favor social distancing measures taken by state governors and advocated by the minister to fight the epidemic.
The government's approval rating has fallen to 28%, the lowest since Bolsonaro took office last year, while its negative ""bad and terrible"" rating has risen to 42% of the people surveyed in the Ipespe/XP Investimentos poll.
Approval of governors who took steps to shut down businesses and public events and get people to stay at home jumped to 44% from 26% last month, while 69% in that poll said Mandetta is doing a good job.
Bolsonaro said on Friday that Brazilian society will not be able to stand two or three months of economic shutdowns to fight the coronavirus, denouncing social distancing measures enforced by states and municipalities across the country.
""You know my stance. It will bring massive unemployment,"" he told supporters outside the presidential residence in Brasilia.
The Ipespe poll commissioned by XP Investimentos confirmed that most Brazilians - 59% - agree with the governors, whom Bolsonaro has called ""job-killers"" due to the rising unemployment the economic standstill has brought.
Datafolha polled 1,511 people by phone April 1-3. Its poll has a margin of error of 3 percentage points either way. Ipespe surveyed 1,000 people March 30 to April 1, with a margin of error of 3.2 percentage points up or down.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Even as he is hailed as a hero by his crew, the fired commander of a coronavirus-stricken U.S. aircraft carrier is being reassigned while investigators consider whether he should face disciplinary action, acting U.S. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly told Reuters on Friday.
Captain Brett Crozier was relieved of his command of the Theodore Roosevelt on Thursday after a scathing letter in which he called on the Navy for stronger action to halt the spread of the virus aboard the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier was leaked to the media.
Modly said in an interview that the letter was shared too widely and leaked before even he could see it.
But the backlash to Modly's decision to fire Crozier has been intense. In videos posted online, sailors on the Theodore Roosevelt applauded Crozier and hailed him as a hero, out to defend his crew - even at great personal cost to his career.
""And that's how you send out one of the greatest captains you ever had,"" exclaimed one sailor in a video post, amid thunderous applause and cheering for Crozier as he left the carrier and its 5,000 crew members in Guam.
Modly did not suggest that Crozier's career was over, saying he thought everyone deserved a chance at ""redemption."" 
""He'll get reassigned, he's not thrown out of the Navy,"" Modly said. 
But Modly said he did not know if Crozier would face disciplinary action, telling Reuters it would be up to a probe that will look into issues surrounding ""communications"" and the chain of command that led to the incident.
""I'm not going to direct them to do anything (other) than to investigate the facts to the best of their ability. I cannot exercise undue command influence over that investigation,"" he said. Crozier's firing has become a lightning-rod political issue at a time when the Trump administration is facing intense criticism over its handling of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 6,000 people across the country, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. 
Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden, accused the Trump administration of poor judgment and said Modly ""shot the messenger."" 
The dismissal, two days after the captain's letter leaked, demonstrated how the coronavirus has challenged all manner of U.S. institutions, even those accustomed to dangerous and complex missions like the military.
His removal could have a chilling effect on others in the Navy seeking to draw attention to difficulties surrounding coronavirus outbreaks at a time when the Pentagon is withholding some detailed data about infections to avoid undermining the perception of U.S. military readiness for a crisis or conflict.
Reuters first reported last week that the U.S. armed forces would start keeping from the public some data about infections within its ranks.
'DECISIVE ACTION'
In his four-page letter, Crozier, who took command in November, described a bleak situation aboard the carrier as more of his crew began falling ill.
He called for ""decisive action"": removing more than 4,000 sailors from the ship and isolating them, and wrote that unless the Navy acted immediately it would be failing to properly safeguard ""our most trusted asset - our sailors.""
The letter put the Pentagon on the defensive and alarmed the families of those on the vessel, whose home port is in San Diego.
President Donald Trump, when asked about the captain during a White House news conference on Thursday, disputed the notion that Crozier appeared to have been disciplined for trying to save the lives of sailors.
""I don't agree with that at all. Not at all. Not even a little bit,"" Trump said.
The outbreak aboard the Theodore Roosevelt is just the latest example of the spread of the COVID-19 respiratory virus within the U.S. military. Navy officials say sailors on a number of ships have tested positive, including an amphibious assault vessel in San Diego.
Modly said that for now the Navy was not considering an operational pause to stem the spread of coronavirus.
""Generally speaking, we have to keep these ships ready just in case they're needed,"" Modly said.
As of Friday, 978 active-duty service members had tested positive for the virus, with more than 250 of them in the Navy. 
'WE WANT OUR CAPTAIN BACK'
Modly said that he had relayed a message to the ship's crew and it was ""extremely well received when it was explained to them.""
But sailors on the ship and their family members have expressed frustration, even anger, at the Navy's move.
""Our captain did what he could to protect us and our health,"" a sailor on board the carrier told Reuters, while speaking on condition of anonymity.
""With them firing our (commanding officer) it feels like they are saying they don’t care about us,"" the sailor added.
""We are really disappointed in how they handled it and we want our captain back.""

The pandemic has claimed the lives of 5,307 in France. Almost 60,000 people there been diagnosed with the illness, including almost 6,400 on life-support machines, which has put the health system under pressure and overwhelmed hospitals in the Paris and eastern regions.
The government imposed a lockdown on the 67 million population on March 17 and has extended it until April 15 to slow the spread of the highly infectious respiratory disease. 
The number of people entering intensive care units has fallen over the last three days and the daily death toll in hospitals stabilised, offering a cautious note of optimism. 
Healthcare professionals hope that the first positive results of the confinement could emerge this weekend because the incubation period for the virus is around two weeks.
""We are waiting for impact of the confinement. For now there is still uncertainty on when the flow of those entering hospitals will fall,"" said Bruno Riou, who heads up the Paris hospitals' crisis team.
""The important point will be when we reach that plateau.""
Officials insist that any break in confinement could spell disaster. The government has already indicated the lockdown could go beyond mid-April.
""We will be extremely severe. Those who are hospitalised today and are on life-support are those who didn't respect the confinement at the start,"" Paris police chief Didier Lallement said on Friday at a control point in the capital.
""It's a very simple correlation. If you don't respect the confinement, you will be fined and you're putting yourself and your loved ones in danger and at risk of being in intensive care.""
The warnings have not deterred everybody. At Paris' Montparnasse train station, some people still sought to get away.
Edgad Ngono, a Parisian businessman, said he hoped to get on a train to join his family in the western city of Rennes. 
""I think it's a way to recharge ourselves because the air in the country is better than in Paris,"" he said, adding that he planned to garden and take it easy. 
He was turned away by police a few minutes later because he did not have the correct documentation allowing him leave.

148,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 10:05AM ET</span>",Sweden's liberal pandemic strategy questioned as Stockholm death toll mounts,"By Johan Ahlander and Philip O'Connor
STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A spike in novel coronavirus infections and deaths in Stockholm has raised questions about Sweden's decision to fight the outbreak without resorting to the lockdowns that have left much of Europe at a standstill.
Governments across Europe have closed schools and taken draconian measures to limit exposure to possible carriers with Germany for example enforcing bans on more than two people meeting in public.
Among Sweden's Nordic neighbours, Denmark has closed its borders and shut its schools, as has Norway, while Finland has isolated its main urban region. 
Yet Swedes are able to go to restaurants, get a haircut and send their children to school even as the number of confirmed cases and deaths have mounted, above all in Stockholm which accounts for more than half the fatalities.
An analysis of smartphone location data showed that while visits to public places has fallen steeply in most European countries, Sweden is bucking the trend.
But Sweden's liberal approach, which aims to minimise disruption to social and economic life, is coming under fire as the epidemic spreads in the capital.
""We don't have a choice, we have to close Stockholm right now,"" Cecilia Soderberg-Naucler, Professor of Microbial Pathogenesis at the Karolinska Institute, told Reuters.
She is one of around 2,300 academics who signed an open letter to the government at the end of last month calling for tougher measures to protect the healthcare system.
""We must establish control over the situation, we cannot head in to a situation where we get complete chaos. No one has tried this route, so why should we test it first in Sweden, without informed consent?"" she said. 
Sweden reported 612 new cases on Friday, bringing the total to around 6,000. The death toll has reached 333, with fatalities now running at about 25-30 a day, according to the Swedish Health Agency.
A STORM IN STOCKHOLM
There are growing signs the virus is spreading at elderly care homes, again mainly in the capital, where some staff at hospitals and nursing homes have publicly warned of a lack of protective equipment such as masks.
Facing what a local official has called ""a storm"" of COVID-19 cases, Stockholm has opened a field hospital at a convention complex south of the city centre and called on anyone with medical training to help care for the sick. 
At a news conference this week centre-left Prime Minister Stefan Lofven fielded questions over whether the rising number of cases at Sweden's nursing homes was evidence of a failing strategy.
""I don't think it is a sign of that. This is what things look like around Europe,"" he said. ""We have said all along that things will get worse before they get better.""
Sweden has focused on isolating and treating the sick rather than closing down swathes of society.
Gatherings of more than 50 people have been banned, high schools and universities have moved teaching online and people have been told not to take unnecessary trips, all quite low-key measures in a European context.
The public face of Sweden's pandemic fight, Health Agency Chief Epidemiologist Anders Tegnell, only months ago a little known civil servant but now rivalling the prime minister for publicity, has questioned how effectively lockdowns can be enforced over time.
""It is important to have a policy that can be sustained over a longer period, meaning staying home if you are sick, which is our message,"" said Tegnell, who has received both threats and fan mail over the country's handling of the crisis.

""Locking people up at home won't work in the longer term,"" he said. ""Sooner or later people are going to go out anyway.""

As of 9am 3 April, a total of 173,784 people have been tested of which 38,168 were positive.
Stephen Powis, the national medical director of National Health Service England, said at a Downing Street briefing on Thursday that a high death rate would continue to be seen for ""a few weeks yet"".
Powis also said there was some early academic evidence that the transmission rate in the community may have fallen below 1.
British government scientists say that the United Kingdom would be doing well if it kept the coronavirus death toll below 20,000.
The British government's worst case scenario envisages a coronavirus death toll of 50,000 if self-isolation is not fully adhered to, but the United Kingdom is not right now on course for a toll of that scale, a source familiar with the government's emergency discussions told Reuters.
According to the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, the worst day for deaths is projected to be April 12, which this year is Easter Sunday.

Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday he would not steer away from reports which said April 12 would be the peak.

150,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 09:45AM ET</span>",Two migrants were killed at Turkey-Greece border: Amnesty,"By Ali Kucukgocmen
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Two migrants were shot dead last month as they tried to enter Greece from Turkey after Ankara ""recklessly encouraged"" thousands of migrants to cross the border to Europe, Amnesty International said on Friday.
A third migrant is missing and presumed dead after Greek soldiers fired shots toward her as she attempted to cross a river into Greece, the rights group said.
Amnesty's Turkey Research Director Andrew Gardner said it was not confirmed who fired the shots that killed the migrants but they were hit in areas where Greek security personnel were present, and he urged Greek authorities to find those responsible.
Amnesty said Greek efforts to repress the migrants' movements included the use of live ammunition.
Greece dismissed Amnesty's account.
""Greece categorically denies the Amnesty International Turkey report, which cites allegations that have already been officially dismissed by Greek authorities. Greece never used live ammunition,"" a government official in Athens said.
Amnesty said one of the migrants was a 43-year-old man who was shot in the chest as he tried to cross into Greece on March 4. It said five others were treated for gunshot wounds. At the time, Greece dismissed as ""fake news"" Turkish accusations that it fired on them. [nL8N2AX4BL] 
Tens of thousands of migrants tried to get into EU member Greece after Ankara said on Feb. 28 it would no longer prevent them from doing so, as agreed in a 2016 deal with Brussels in return for European aid for Syrian refugees. 
Turkey, which hosts some 3.6 million Syrians, the world's largest refugee population, lifted restrictions on the migrants because it was alarmed by the prospect of another wave of refugees fleeing war in northwest Syria.
The rush to the border, which Amnesty said was facilitated by Turkey, met a strong response from Greek security forces. Greek authorities have strongly rejected accusations by Ankara that their forces killed migrants at the border, and have denied firing live ammunition.
The tension on the border has largely settled since the outbreak of the new coronavirus prompted Turkey to close the borders with Greece and Bulgaria.
Amnesty said that according to Turkish officials some 5,800 people were moved last week from informal refugee camps near the Pazarkule border gate, where most of the clashes between migrants and security forces took place in early March.
The migrants were taken to nine locations across the country and would remain in quarantine for 14 days as a precaution against the spread of the coronavirus, Amnesty said.
The organisation called on Greek authorities to restore the right to seek asylum, refrain from pushbacks and protect people entering the country from land and sea. A 30-day suspension on asylum applications that Greece imposed in March ended on April 1.
It said Turkey should refrain from making announcements and taking unilateral actions likely to result in greater harm to migrants.

He was responding to a spate of reports of consignments of protective masks destined for European countries being bought up by United States officials, sometimes even as aeroplanes stood ready for departure on the tarmac.
""You hear stories of people fighting in the truest sense of the word over these masks in China,"" he told reporters on Friday during a visit to a logistics company that is acting for the German government. ""That's not a good development, but it reflects the strong demand.""
Germany's mix of lockdown measures and aggressive testing for the novel coronavirus has so far been successful in slowing the spread of the disease, with each patient only infecting one other on average in recent days.
But that development, while encouraging, has focused more attention on the supplies of protective equipment that will become necessary if the disruptive curfews in force are ever to be lifted.
""This crisis is not a sprint but a long-distance run,"" Spahn said, warning the public not to expect a sudden or complete relaxation of lockdown and quarantine rules.
He said Europe was in a strong position to manufacture much of the protective equipment it needed, even in the face of international competition for the output of the largest suppliers in China.
""We make masks only on a small scale here in Germany, but we build the machines that are used to make the masks,"" he said.

""And much of the animal fleeces that are used to make the masks are produced in Europe and Germany. So if the machines and the fleeces are from Germany and Europe, we should be able to have production in Europe again.""

152,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 03, 2020 06:59AM ET</span>","As pandemic rages, U.S. immigrants detained in areas with few hospitals","By Kristina Cooke, Mica Rosenberg and Ryan McNeill
BASILE, Louisiana (Reuters) - U.S. immigration officials say they have a plan if detention centers get hit with coronavirus outbreaks: They will transfer detainees with serious symptoms to hospitals with ""expertise in high risk care."" 
But many centers - each housing hundreds of people, often in close quarters - are located in remote communities, far from hospitals able to handle a rush of patients with COVID-19. Detention center outbreaks in such areas could quickly swamp local hospitals, threatening their ability to treat local residents along with detainees.
About a third of the 43,000 immigrants in detention as of March 2 were housed at facilities that have only one hospital - or none - with intensive-care beds within 25 miles, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the American Hospital Directory and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)). The seven sites with no such hospitals nearby held a total of about 5,000 detainees, according to the analysis, which examined centers that averaged 100 or more detainees.
The shortage of available care is especially acute in Louisiana, according to interviews with local health workers, hospital administrators and current and former detention-center employees. The administration of President Donald Trump has quadrupled the number of detainees in the state - to nearly 7,000 - as part of a larger immigration crackdown. And Louisiana hospitals are already straining to handle one of the world’s fastest-growing coronavirus outbreaks.
The closest hospital to four of the Louisiana sites - which together house an average of 3,700 detainees - is Winn Parish Medical Center, which has just 46 beds and five intensive-care beds. Such tiny rural facilities would be forced to send patients to a handful of larger regional hospitals.
Doctors and nurses at both the small and larger hospitals said that a severe outbreak at even one detention center could overwhelm their ability to respond. One of the four centers, for example, is LaSalle ICE Processing Center in Jena, Louisiana - among the nation’s largest with a daily average of about 1,200 detainees. The nearest larger hospitals are about 40 miles away in Alexandria.
One nurse at Rapides Regional Medical Center in Alexandria said she worried about the threat of an outbreak at a prison or detention center when she recently saw a man flanked by two guards in the hospital’s COVID-19 unit.
""We don't have enough staff or equipment to handle something like that,"" the nurse said, noting that workers have been duct-taping the door frames of makeshift isolation rooms. ""It's already chaotic.”
Six ICE detainees - five in New Jersey and one in Arizona - have tested positive for the disease, along with five ICE staffers, working in detention centers in New Jersey, Texas and Colorado, and two employees of privately run detention centers, according to ICE and the private operators. One of the employees worked at Stewart Detention Center in Lumpkin, Georgia, which housed more than 1,500 detainees as of early March. 
ICE spokespeople said the agency has a detailed pandemic response plan and is following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control protocols for testing and monitoring the disease. The agency said it would focus enforcement actions on the most serious criminals during the pandemic and seek alternatives to detention when appropriate. By the end of March, the number of immigrants in custody nationally had fallen to about 35,600, according to ICE, but the agency could not provide updated data by facility.
ICE spokesman Bryan Cox said that examining hospital resources near Louisiana detention centers is ""speculative"" because there are currently no confirmed COVID-19 cases at ICE facilities there. Cox and ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said they did not know how many coronavirus tests ICE has administered, in Louisiana or nationally, and could not say whether the agency tracks that information.
OUTBREAK 'WOULD BE OVERWHELMING'
Public health experts say the risks to detention centers are serious. Carlos Franco-Paredes - an infectious disease doctor in Colorado who has worked in detention centers - said an outbreak in a population of 1,500 detainees could require between 150 and 175 intensive-care admissions.
The South Louisiana ICE Processing Center is near the town of Basile - population 1,700. About 40 minutes away is the Pine Prairie Processing Center, in another small community. Together, the centers house an average of 1,300 detainees. The two facilities, along with the Jena detention center, are run by Geo Group, a private company contracting with ICE.
About halfway between the two detention facilities is the Savoy Medical Center - with just 10 intensive-care beds and 6 ventilators, said chief executive Gene Burge.
An outbreak ""would be overwhelming for an area like this,” Burge said.
‘TICKING TIME BOMB’
ICE facilities have in-house medical care, but available services and equipment vary widely, said Scott Allen, a doctor and Department of Homeland Security consultant who has inspected detention centers.
Some rural centers have one person providing medical services, a problem if that caregiver gets ill, Allen said in a March 19 letter he wrote with another doctor to the U.S. Congress. Local hospitals would be unable to provide ventilators to both detainees and local residents, the letter warned, causing people from both groups to ""die unnecessarily.""
Five detainees inside the South Louisiana center, which houses more than 670 men and women, said in interviews that the conditions inside the center don’t allow them to protect themselves by, for instance, frequently washing their hands or maintaining social distance. They said they each only recently received a miniature bar of soap and have not been provided cleaning products.
Daimy Garcia, 28, an asylum seeker from Cuba, said more detainees have been recently transferred into her unit, making social distancing harder. She said her unit now holds more than 70 women from Cameroon, China, Brazil, Cuba, Mexico and Central America.
""This is a ticking time bomb,"" Garcia said.
Pablo Paez, a spokesman for Geo Group said such allegations were ""unfounded"" and ""being instigated by outside groups with political agendas."" He said all the company's facilities provide access to regular handwashing and 24/7 access to healthcare. He referred questions about local hospital resources to ICE.
HIDING SYMPTOMS, SHARING BATHROOMS
The Catahoula Correctional Center near Harrisonburg, Louisiana houses a daily average of 500 detainees - just outside a town of 330 residents.
Four detainees at the center told Reuters that some immigrants have hidden symptoms of illness to avoid being isolated in the same solitary confinement cells the center uses for punishment.
Alfonso Diaz, a 58-year-old asylum seeker from Cuba with heart problems, said he shares a dorm with 100 other men, all sleeping in three-tier bunk beds and sharing four toilets and six showers. He said guards do not wear protective gear and told the detainees to ignore news about the virus.
Scott Sutterfield, a spokesman for the private company LaSalle Corrections that runs Catahoula said that it has implemented a pandemic contingency plan at its facilities, which includes screening, testing, treatment and infection-control measures. Sutterfield did not respond to the specific concerns of the detainees interviewed by Reuters or answer questions about limited hospital capacity nearby.
The Catahoula facility is about 40 minutes away from River Correctional Center, another new ICE site housing detainees in Ferriday, Louisiana. The two locations average about 900 detainees combined.
The nearest hospital to both centers is the tiny Riverland Medical Center in Ferriday. The center has five intensive care beds but is only staffed for two critically ill patients.
Patients could also be sent to Merit Health Natchez, in nearby Mississippi, which had 15 intensive care beds as of last year, according to federal records. Natchez is also home to a facility that recently started housing 1,000 ICE detainees. 

Blane Mire, a doctor at Merit Health, said on a March 26 call with town officials that his hospital was low on medicine and protective gear and full of coronavirus patients - three of them on ventilators. With hospitals in major urban centers also in need of supplies, he said, rural areas could be left behind. As Mire put it: ""Natchez isn't going to be on the priority list.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Labour Party will elect a new leader on Saturday, with Brexit policy chief Keir Starmer the frontrunner to take over a deeply divided party that, under veteran socialist Jeremy Corbyn, suffered a crushing defeat in a December election.
The finale of the leadership contest, under way since Corbyn announced his resignation after the election, has been overshadowed by Britain's growing coronavirus outbreak, all but silencing the hopefuls' campaigns.
But for many in Labour, Saturday's election will be a chance for the party to start afresh and move away from years of rows over everything from how to approach Britain's departure from the European Union and accusations of anti-Semitism among members, to the party's turn to the left under Corbyn.
It may not be easy. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservatives have occupied much of traditional Labour territory, with the coronavirus crisis prompting the ruling party to turn on the spending taps and end economic austerity.
""This election has been long – and it's fair to say that it hasn't ended in the way that any of us expected,"" Starmer told supporters on Thursday in an email run under his slogan ""another future is possible"".
""With the campaigns that all of the candidates have run, I honestly believe that we have come out of the other end of this contest as a better party: more united and ready to build another future.""
Starmer, who has been careful to try to carry Corbyn's supporters while also keeping more centrist Labour members on board, leads in the polls, ahead of Rebecca Long-Bailey, an ally of Corbyn, and third-placed Lisa Nandy.
Labour's more than 580,000 members, affiliate members through trade unions or socialist societies and people who paid 25 pounds to be registered supporters have all been eligible to vote in the election. 
The new leader will be announced on Saturday morning in a statement, rather than at a live event because of coronavirus, with the three hopefuls having had to record a victory speech ahead of time before knowing the result. 
Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions who was knighted in 2014 for services to law and criminal justice, has promised not to ""over steer"" the party back to the centre, but has also put forward a more pro-EU stance, suggesting he would bring back free movement for the bloc's citizens.

But many who backed Corbyn say they fear Starmer will come under pressure to dispense with the former leader's left-wing agenda and try to rebuild a membership base from the centre, changing the party back to something closer to the one led by Tony Blair, who was prime minister from 1997 to 2007.

BEIJING/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Regions along China's porous borders with southeast Asia are working hard to improve surveillance and curb illegal immigration, authorities said, as thousands flood into a country seen as a safe haven in the global war against the coronavirus pandemic.
As the number of confirmed cases across the globe exceeds one million, China says its lockdowns of Wuhan and the province of Hubei, where the disease originated late last year, have brought domestic sources of transmission under control. Authorities have now turned their attention to potential infections from overseas. 
But while they have imposed tough new quarantine measures on all passengers flying into China's airports, they are struggling to handle an influx of people crossing the poorly policed frontiers of Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam.
Premier Li Keqiang's special government taskforce handling the COVID-19 outbreak decided on Thursday to strengthen border controls and impose centralised quarantine on travellers who enter the country via highways. 
""China's southwest land border with South East Asian countries is too long and porous to be enforced properly,"" said Zhang Mingliang, professor of South East Asia studies at Guangzhou Jinan University.
These borders have often proved vulnerable to drug smugglers and human traffickers, and now local governments are facing the additional challenge of having to cope with thousands of people fleeing the coronavirus. 
""Before the outbreak, Vietnamese people have scaled barbed wire fences to cross into Guangxi for work,"" Zhang added, adding that it wouldn't be a surprise if more people were now entering the country, either because of the virus or for other purposes.
Last month, 13 foreign citizens were reported to have illegally entered the city of Baise in the region of Guangxi, which shares a border with Vietnam. They were immediately repatriated, and authorities have now set up volunteer checkpoints to try to stop further illegal entry. 
NO SIGNS OF STRICTER CHECKS
Although China has promised tougher controls, residents on the Myanmar side of the border said workers and businessmen continue to make routine journeys into the neighbouring Chinese province of Yunnan. 
""People cross to China every day,"" a resident of Namkham township, in Myanmar's northern Shan state, separated from China by the narrow Shweli river, told Reuters. ""Almost all of them are Myanmar nationals who are manual labourers on banana plantations, maize plantations and other plantations.""
A Reuters reporter saw no signs of tight surveillance on either side of the river at two crossing points. 
However, many people now entering China are Chinese nationals doing so legally, with tougher border and airport controls spooking thousands of Chinese farmers, traders and construction workers into returning home. 
Local authorities have promised to strictly apply quarantine rules on those who enter. 
Yunnan province, which shares a rugged and sometimes lawless 4,000-km border with Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam, has become the ""front line"" of efforts to prevent infections entering the country from overseas, senior provincial officials said at a meeting on March 31. 
In Mengla, a county in Yunnan on the border with Myanmar, traffic flows have surged since March 28 as people return to China by road following the cancellation of flights as well as toughened airport controls, residents said. 
Authorities have commandeered 46 hotels to quarantine incoming travellers, with as many as 3,589 incoming travellers isolated in the county by March 28. 
Xishuangbanna prefecture, which runs Mengla and forms a large part of China's border with Myanmar, has also set up a special task force to build a ""defensive line"" preventing illegal border entry, especially for citizens from Myanmar and Laos, it said in a notice on Thursday. 

""To be honest we were not that panicked during the domestic outbreak given our remote location,"" said a Xishuangbanna resident. ""But now we are frightened as we suddenly stand on the front line of the battlefield.""

KARACHI (Reuters) - Pakistani authorities ordered on Friday four men, including a British militant, convicted of the 2002 murder of U.S. journalist Daniel Pearl, to be detained for three months despite a lower court's ruling to overturn their convictions.
The High Court in the province of Sindh on Thursday acquitted the four, including Briton Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was sentenced to death in 2002 for masterminding Pearl's murder. The other three were sentenced to life.
Wall Street Journal reporter Pearl, 38, was investigating Islamist militants in the city of Karachi, the capital of Sindh, after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States when he was kidnapped in January 2002. He was beheaded weeks later.
The Sindh provincial government's Home Department issued the order to arrest and detain the four before they were released from prison.
""The government of Sindh has sufficient reason that Ahmed Omar Sheikh and Fahad Nasim Ahmed, Syed Salman Saqib, Sheikh Muhammad Adil be arrested and detained for a period of three months from the date of arrest (April 2, 2020),” a top official of the department said in the order, seen by Reuters.
The official cited concern that the released men may act ""against the interest of the country"".
The law to keep them in detention is one that the government has often used to keep high-profile suspects, particularly militants, in custody after being unable to successfully prosecute them in court.
The United States denounced Thursday's court acquittal of the four, with the top U.S. diplomat for South Asia writing on Twitter that it was ""an affront to victims of terrorism everywhere.""
SCRUTINY
Pakistan joined the U.S.-led ""war on terrorism"" after the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States but it has been dogged by suspicion that it has for years secretly backed some militant factions as tools in its decades-old confrontation with rival India.
Pakistan denies that but it has been under the close scrutiny of a global watchdog on terror financing, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), with its frequent inability to prosecute terrorism cases a particular concern of the agency.
The re-arrest of the four gives the government time to put together a legal appeal against their acquittal. 
A senior Pakistani government law officer told Reuters that the state would appeal against the Sindh High Court's Thursday ruling, which the United States welcomed.
""We welcome Pakistan's decision to appeal the verdict,"" acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells said.
Sheikh was born in Britain and enjoyed a privileged upbringing and studied at the London School of Economics.
He was arrested in India for his involvement in the kidnapping of Western tourists in 1994 as part of his support for Muslim separatists battling Indian security forces in the disputed Kashmir region.

He was one of three men released from an Indian prison after militants hijacked an Indian airliner in late 1999 and flew it to Afghanistan, where the then-ruling Taliban government helped negotiate an exchange.

Its omission has become a major source of anger for the Taiwan, which says it has been unable to get first hand information from the WHO, putting lives on the island in danger for the sake of politics. Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been given the help it needs.
The U.S. State Department said on Thursday senior officials from the United States and Taiwan on Tuesday held a ""virtual forum on expanding Taiwan's participation on the global stage"", with particular focus on the WHO and how to share Taiwan's successful model of fighting the coronavirus.  
""Participants also discussed ongoing efforts to reinstate Taiwan's observer status at the World Health Assembly, as well as other avenues for closer coordination between Taiwan and the World Health Organization,"" it said.
The World Health Assembly is the WHO's decision-making body.
Taiwan attended it as an observer from 2009-2016 when Taipei-Beijing relations warmed, but China blocked further participation after the election of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, who China views as a separatist, charges she denies.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry expressed thanks to the United States on Friday for its ""continued taking of concrete actions to support Taiwan's participation in the WHO and other international organisations"".
In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the United States and Taiwan were both well aware that members of the WHO must be sovereign states, and accused Taiwan of seeking political capital from the outbreak.
""We hope they will not attempt to use this epidemic to engage in political manipulation,"" she told a daily news briefing.
U.S. President Donald Trump signed a new law last month requiring increased support for Taiwan's international role. China threatened unspecified retaliation in response.
Like most countries the United States has only unofficial ties with the island, but is its strongest backer on the world stage.
Taiwan has been far more successful than many of its neighbours keeping the virus in check thanks to early and stringent steps to control its spread. It has reported 348 cases and five deaths to date.
In its latest measure, Health Minister Chen Shih-chung said on Friday people who don't wear face masks on public transport would face fines of up to T$15,000 (nearly $500).

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary will introduce a new pandemic fund on Saturday and work out the details of the country's biggest economic stimulus package by Tuesday, Prime Minister Viktor Orban said, adding that the plans focus primarily on employment.
Healthcare workers will receive a 500,000 forint ($1,500) bonus this year to compensate them for the extra workload and risk that fighting the coronavirus entails, he added.
Hungary, like most other countries, has already been hit hard by the fallout from the coronavirus epidemic, with business grinding to a virtual halt, and the important car manufacturing and tourism sectors all but shutting down.
With tens of thousands of jobs lost in March, Orban said the economic stimulus package would have to react to the crisis and prepare for life afterwards.
""We will have to create as many jobs as the crisis destroys,"" he told state radio on Friday. A Pandemic Fund will be introduced on Saturday, and detailed economic stimulus plans on Tuesday, he said.
He said Hungary would not join countries throwing limitless funds at the crisis, but would focus on maintaining a work-centred economic philosophy because any money spent now would have to be made later.
""The circumstances have changed now but our goals remain the same, except the route to them has changed,"" he said. ""I don't want my country to return to an aid-based economy, because that leads to loans, which leads to indebtedness.""
In his decade in power, Orban dragged the economy out of a deep debt and deficit trap and maintained rigorous finances, while drawing criticism for unorthodox fiscal moves that often taxed foreign business interests.
Orban also responded to criticism from the European Union, the United States and rights groups this week about his extension of special powers, including the open-ended right to rule by decree until the end of the pandemic.
""Brussels is busy with us, while they should be busy with the virus,"" he said. ""The Hungarian government's emergency powers are roughly the same as the French president has in peacetime. Clearly we are under political attack.""
""The main thing is that we stay the course ... this is a network, which would like to strip Hungary of its resources, with George Soros at the helm, with his people in Brussels criticising us.""
Soros is a favourite scapegoat for Orban, who was once a protégé of the billionaire financier.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's Grupo Modelo said on Thursday it will temporarily stop brewing Corona beer and other brands exported to 180 countries after its business activities were declared non-essential under a government order aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
The Mexican government this week declared a health emergency and ordered the suspension of non-essential activities after the number of coronavirus cases in the country surpassed 1,000. On Thursday, it reported 1,510 cases and 50 deaths. 
The brewer said in a statement that the suspension will go into place from Sunday and that it was already in the process of scaling down production to a level at which it could resume once the suspension is lifted. 
""If the federal government considers it appropriate to issue some clarification confirming beer as an agro-industrial product, at Grupo Modelo we are ready to execute a plan with more than 75% of our staff working from home and at the same time guaranteeing the supply of beer,"" the statement said.
Agriculture and food production in general are considered essential activities. 
Grupo Modelo, which is part of the brewing group Anheuser-Busch InBev, operates 11 breweries in Mexico.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Barata draws a circular map of Sao Paulo's largest slum, Paraisopolis, and begins to mark confirmed coronavirus cases in blue ink. At the center of the favela of around 120,000 people, which crowds between luxury apartment blocks and high-walled mansions, he draws four dots. 
""It's going to get a lot worse,"" the 34-year-old tells an assembled medical team, adding another two dots to the favela's outer districts. ""The surge hasn't hit yet.""
Barata is leading the coronavirus response in this labyrinth of red cinder block homes where, beyond the six confirmed cases, his team suspects another 60. 
He is not connected to the Brazilian state, and nor is the medical team around him. The former minor league soccer pro is part of an association of Paraisopolis residents whose deep distrust of government has led them to take things into their own hands. 
The residents' association has hired a round-the-clock private medical service including three ambulances, two doctors, and two nurses, as well as drivers and support staff. While President Jair Bolsonaro has dismissed the virus as ""a little flu"" and told Brazilians to get back to work, Barata is sleep-deprived trying to get his favela ready for what he describes as a ""war.""
Barata declined to say how much this would cost or how it was being funded, beyond saying some was covered by donations. Much of it still needs to be raised, he said. The medical team is on an initial 30-day contract, likely to be extended. 
""Favelas are going to be hit the worst,"" he said, standing in a parking lot outside a mechanic's workshop that doubles as a base for the medical team. ""The places that are already neglected by the state will be neglected even more.""
Public health experts agree. The packed living conditions, poor sanitation, lack of healthcare and flouting of lockdown measures make Brazil's slums – home to around 11 million people or 6% of the population – particularly vulnerable to the virus. 
Paraisopolis is likely to be on the front line. Many of its residents work in the nearby wealthy neighborhood of Morumbi, ground zero for the outbreak in Brazil. Across Latin America, many of the first cases were diagnosed in those affluent enough to travel abroad, but the virus is expected to hit the poorest hardest.
Brazil is Latin America's worst affected nation by the coronavirus so far, with nearly 8,000 confirmed cases and 299 deaths.
The Paraisopolis residents who have tested positive include two who work in the nearby Albert Einstein Hospital, a private medical facility that diagnosed the first case in Latin America. Another was a live-in nanny.
Celia Parnes, the Secretary of Social Development for the state of Sao Paulo, said the government was concerned about the ""speed of contagion in the favelas"" and was working to assist poor neighborhoods like Paraisopolis with subsidized meals and debt relief. 
She said public healthcare in Paraisopolis was no different to the rest of the city, saying ambulances do reach the favela and talk of an absence of the state ""was a major exaggeration.""
But she complimented the work of the residents' association. ""I recognize it and tip my cap,"" she said.
City Hall, in an emailed statement, said it handed out free food and essentials to residents of Paraisopolis, as well as driving cars with loud speakers pronouncing the importance of washing hands and staying indoors.
Sao Paulo's water and sanitation firm said it was distributing 2,400 water tanks to poor neighborhoods to help during the health crisis. It said Paraisopolis had already received more than 900 tanks. 
The state has also exempted poor families from tariffs for water and gas for three months.
CLOSE QUARTERS
The population density in Paraisopolis is about the same as Manhattan, although most buildings are just two or three stories tall. Residents complain the water runs dry after 8 p.m. and rubbish piles up along the tight, damp alleyways that weave through the community.
De facto authority here lies with the First Capital Command, Brazil's largest and most powerful gang, known by its Portuguese acronym PCC. 
""I think it's going to get ugly... This is a 'little flu' that kills,"" said Luiz Carlos, a short, grey-haired doctor who is part of the hired medical team. 
Roberto de Souza, 41, believes he caught the virus through his job in a pharmacy - despite wearing disposable gloves and a facemask when serving customers. He developed terrible pain in his legs and a constant cough soon followed.
After testing positive he isolated himself in a cramped second-floor flat in Paraisopolis. 
""What hurts the most is being locked away, alone,"" he said through a facemask, in between coughing fits. ""I have to worry, not just about myself but about not giving it to the next person.""
De Souza lives by himself. In Paraisopolis that puts him in the minority. 
Reuters visited one cramped home where a woman was self-isolating, sick with coronavirus symptoms. But her three children, mother and brother had nowhere else to go, so continued to live with her. 
To address that challenge, the residents' association is looking to use two local schools – closed due to the outbreak - to house up to 500 suspected and confirmed cases without life-threatening symptoms, removing them from tight living quarters.
Despite all the preparations, Barata is worried residents are not taking the threat seriously enough. Unlike in the rest of Sao Paulo, where a lockdown is in place, most bars and shops remain open in Paraisopolis. The streets bustle. Parties pound. 
Barata fears many will change their attitude only once a parent or a friend dies. By then it might be too late. 

""We're trying to get the message out: This is no joke,"" he said.

Wuhan, where 11 million people live, had been paralysed by containment efforts imposed by authorities, who shut down public transport as well as taxi services as part of a lockdown, leaving it mostly to ordinary citizens to keep the city running.
Zhang Quan is a member of Blue Sky Rescue, China's biggest nonprofit civil rescue organization, which has been involved in helping distribute medical supplies for the epidemic. 
The former soldier leads a team of 60 volunteers that has been focused on disinfecting places such as hospitals and schools. 
""We have teachers, policemen, entrepreneurs,"" he told Reuters on Thursday about his hazmat suit-clad team, who were preparing to walk through the Wuhan Qintai Grand Theatre to disinfect its seats and hallways with white plumes of chlorine dioxide. 
It has started to relax those restrictions in recent weeks and will allow people to start leaving the city on April 8, more than two months after the curbs were put in place in late January.
Still, the top official in Wuhan on Friday warned residents to strengthen self-protection measures and avoid going out as Beijing preaches vigilance to avoid a resurgence of infections.
Wang Zhonglin, Wuhan's Communist Party chief, said the risk of a rebound in the city's coronavirus epidemic remained high due to both internal and external risks and that it must continue to maintain prevention and control measures.

China has reported a total of 81,589 confirmed cases, which exclude asymptomatic patients, and 3,318 deaths from the outbreak. Worldwide, the number of cases has topped 1 million, with at least 52,000 deaths.

Anyone who violates the new law faces six months in jail and a fine of HK$50,000 ($6,450).
The extraordinary move in a city that never sleeps comes a week after the government stopped all tourist arrivals and transit passengers at its airport and said it was considering suspending the sale of alcohol in some venues.
""Any premises (commonly known as bar or pub) that is exclusively or mainly used for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquors ... must be closed,"" the government said in a statement late on Thursday. 
It added that 62 confirmed coronavirus cases in the city had been linked to bars, leading to 14 further infections, including a 40-day-old baby. Hong Kong has 802 cases of coronavirus and four deaths from the disease. 
Alcohol will still be available in supermarkets and convenience stores across the Asian financial centre.
Global coronavirus cases surpassed 1 million on Thursday with more than 52,000 deaths as the pandemic further exploded in the United States and the death toll climbed in Spain and Italy, according to a Reuters tally of official data.

167,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 05:44PM ET</span>",Pakistan court set to free four accused in Daniel Pearl killing,"By Syed Raza Hassan and Gibran Naiyyar Peshimam
KARACHI/ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Thursday commuted the death sentence of the main person accused in the 2002 kidnapping and murder of an American Wall Street Journal reporter, Daniel Pearl, and acquitted three other co-accused in the matter. 
All four had been convicted in connection with Pearl's kidnapping and murder, including British-born Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who was sentenced to death in 2002 for masterminding the murder. He has been in jail for 18 years awaiting the outcome of an appeal.
Pearl, 38, was investigating Islamist militants in Karachi after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States when he was kidnapped in January 2002. His case grabbed headlines globally, after a video of his beheading emerged weeks after Pearl was abducted.
""No evidence has been brought on record by the prosecution to link any of the appellants to the murder of Pearl and as such all the appellants are acquitted of murder,"" said a two-member bench of the Sindh High Court, in a ruling seen by Reuters.
The United States slammed the ruling, with the top U.S. diplomat for South Asia writing on Twitter that the verdict ""is an affront to victims of terrorism everywhere.""
The court also acquitted all four of charges of kidnapping the American for ransom too, and found Sheikh guilty only on the charge of abduction. 
Sheikh was sentenced to seven years on the abduction charge, but he is expected to be freed soon given time already served. 
""Omar has already served 18 years, so his release orders will be issued sometime today. He will be out in a few days,"" Khawaja Naveed, a defence lawyer in the case, told Reuters.
A senior Pakistani government law officer told Reuters via phone that the state would appeal against the Sindh High Court's verdict.
""We welcome Pakistan's decision to appeal the verdict,"" acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs Alice Wells said. ""Those responsible for Daniel's heinous kidnapping and murder must face the full measure of justice.""
Pakistan's Foreign Office said the issue pertains to the Ministry of Interior ""who will be looking at the judgment in detail."" The Ministry of Interior did not respond to a request for comment. 
The convictions in Pearl's murder case had been brought into question after another defendant, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, one of the alleged masterminds of the Sept. 11 attacks, told a U.S. military tribunal in 2007 that he beheaded Pearl.
In a statement, the Wall Street Journal said it continues to seek justice for the murder of Pearl.
His widow, Mariane Pearl, was not immediately reachable for comment. 
'CAN'T STOP RELEASE'
Another lawyer not involved in the case told Reuters that Pakistan would likely have to release all of the accused while any appeal was filed.
""The prosecution cannot stop their release in this case, unless they produce a Supreme Court interim order,"" Muhammad Farooq, a lawyer at the Sindh High Court, said, adding that the government could also seek to keep them detained by using a law related to the maintenance of public order. 
""Legally they cannot stop their release in this particular case,"" Farooq said.
Sheikh was born in Britain and enjoyed a privileged upbringing before going to study at the London School of Economics. 
He was arrested in India in the 1990s for his involvement in the kidnapping of Western tourists in 1994 as part of Sheikh's support of Muslim separatists battling Indian security forces in the disputed Kashmir region.
He was one of three men released from an Indian prison after militants hijacked an Indian airliner in late 1999 and flew it to Afghanistan, where the then-ruling Taliban government helped negotiate an exchange.
The Indian foreign ministry did not respond to requests for comment on the matter by Reuters.
Indian police later linked Sheikh to the Sept. 11 attacks, accusing him of involvement in transferring $100,000 to Mohammad Atta, one of the militants who flew airliners into New York's World Trade Center.
Pakistan is currently under close scrutiny by a global watchdog on terror financing, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), where the country's inability to prosecute terrorism cases has been highlighted. 

""The FATF situation is quite serious. I think pressure will come on Pakistan (after this verdict),"" said Amir Rana, director of the Pak Institute for Peace Studies, an Islamabad-based think tank that monitors anti-terrorism policies in Pakistan. He added that Pearl's case was high-profile and bound to get global attention.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. officials said on Thursday they would distribute a stockpile of personal protective equipment, including 192,000 N95 respirator masks, which they seized this week from an alleged hoarder.
The departments of Justice (DOJ) and Health and Human Services (HHS) said the equipment had been seized by a task force set up to crack down on coronavirus-related hoarding and price gouging.  
The material included 130,000 surgical masks, 598,000 medical grade gloves, surgical gowns, disinfectant towels and bottles of hand sanitizer and spray disinfectant. 
It will be distributed to health authorities in New York and New Jersey, the U.S. epicenter of a pandemic that has so far killed nearly 5,000 Americans.
Local officials have been scrambling to secure protective gear, which is in short supply. An emergency stockpile maintained by the U.S. government has been nearly exhausted.
Officials said they seized the supplies from Baruch Feldheim, a 43-year-old Brooklyn man arrested on March 30 for lying about his activity and coughing on FBI agents who questioned him.
Feldheim's defense lawyer, James Moriarty, denied the charges and said his client had not yet entered a plea.
According to court documents, Feldheim offered to sell around 1,000 N95 masks and other materials to a New Jersey doctor for $12,000, which federal authorities said was approximately a 700 percent markup over the normal prices.
Investigators said Feldheim told the doctor he could pick up the materials at an auto repair shop in Irvington, New Jersey.
The doctor told investigators the auto repair shop contained enough materials, including hand sanitizers, antiseptic wipes and surgical supplies, to outfit an entire hospital.
FBI agents also observed people walking away from Feldheim's residence with boxes or bags that appeared to contain medical supplies.
When federal agents questioned Feldheim outside his home on March 29, they said he coughed on them and told them he had COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, according to a court affidavit.

The seized material will be delivered to the New Jersey Department of Health, the New York State Department of Health and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.

LIMA (Reuters) - Amid a strict quarantine in Peru to slow the spread of a coronavirus pandemic, men and women will only be allowed to leave their homes on designed days divided up by gender, the country's President Martin Vizcarra said on Thursday.
The South American country will impose a rule which means on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays only men will be able to leave their homes to stock up. Women can go out on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. No-one at all can leave home on Sunday.
    ""We have to get fewer people to be on the streets every day,"" Vizcarra said in a virtual news conference with his cabinet of ministers and experts.
Vizcarra said it was easier for security forces to monitor the circulation of men and women to enforce the quarantine order, rather than using serial numbers of identity documents to divide up days which some other countries have done.
    The president said that the new measure, which will be in place until April 12, would not impact people who have an emergency or are authorized to work during the quarantine, such as those in essential food production, pharmacies and banking institutions.
Peru has imposed tough measures to control the spread of coronavirus, although there have been a significant number of arrests for people breaking the quarantine. The country has recorded 1,414 confirmed cases with 55 deaths.
    ""We have 10 days left. Let's make this additional effort to get into this curve and we can have control of the evolution of this disease,"" Vizcarra said.

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Jose Ramirez - whose total belongings fit into a scratched black suitcase and a backpack - is resigned to spending the night in a scruffy park in the depressed center of Colombia's capital, Bogota.
Ramirez lost his job as a driver because of a 19-day nationwide quarantine the government hopes will stem the spread of coronavirus and now cannot pay the $6 a day he needs to live in the modest room he called home for five months.
""They told me I couldn't stay because they need to pay public services, they have other obligations,"" Ramirez said. ""They said they aren't a charity and they kicked me out.""
Hundreds like Ramirez have been thrown out of housing because the lockdown has cut off income streams like street-selling, despite government bans on evictions.
Some five million families in the Andean country are renters, with some people paying as little as $1.20 a night for a bed.
President Ivan Duque said this week he will ban evictions and rent rises during the lockdown and a similar measure is in force in Bogota. But many landlords are not listening.
Some people - including Venezuelan migrants - have been able to return to their housing after interventions by the police, but others remain on the streets.
""The people who work there are administrators, they aren't the owners of the properties and they haven't wanted to speak to us,"" said Horacio Guerrero, head of ethnic issues for Bogota's mayor's office.
Guerrero was organizing temporary housing for a group of 60 people from the Embera Katio indigenous community, including Tintiliano Vitucay and 25 members of his family.
""At 9 a.m., the owner of the house threw us onto the street,"" said the 39-year-old Vitucay, who was forced to flee western Choco province three months ago by armed groups which threatened to kill him.
""Our things were left behind because we didn't have a way to get them out.""
Despite increased welfare payments and other government efforts, help is not reaching everyone.
Juan Jose Higuera has slept on the street since Sunday, after he lost his job selling flowers at the city's central cemetery and was kicked out of his housing.
Mayor's office officials said it was unclear where he could be housed.

""I don't have help from anyone, I don't have relatives, I don't have anywhere to stay tonight, I haven't eaten anything,"" said a tearful Higuera, 49. ""I want God to take my life.""

BERLIN (Reuters) - Law-abiding Germans are zealously helping police crack down on people flouting new social distancing rules aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus by reporting on strangers, neighbours and friends.
In a country where denunciation was commonplace under the Communists in East Germany and Hitler's Nazis, police forces across the country are getting tip-offs on anything from ""corona parties"" to people driving to weekend cottages.
Rules introduced in March forcing restaurants, pubs and sports facilities to shut and banning gatherings of people have given police plenty of work. With the number of corona cases and deaths climbing fast, there is no sign of an easing.
Since March 14, police in the German capital have ordered 830 pubs, shisha bars and other establishments to shut and recorded 898 crimes. 
""We are getting tip-offs from the public about open restaurants or large gatherings of people in parks,"" said a spokeswoman, adding officers were, as always, ready to deal with information from the public.
Forces around Germany are in a similar situation. Munich police took up to 150 calls every day last week from citizens reporting alleged breaches of corona rules, Spiegel Online said. 
The Mitteldeutsche Zeitung reported that authorities in Magdeburg had asked citizens not to overburden the police, quoting an official as saying ""people shouldn't make a report every time they see three people sitting on a park bench.""
While many citizens are acting responsibly, some experts say jealously, frustration or bearing a grudge can play a role.
Rafael Behr, professor of criminology and sociology at the Hamburg Police Academy cited the phenomenon of locals in the eastern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern denouncing Berliners driving to weekend homes by looking at their number plates.
""This willingness to report others is poisoning civilised behaviour somewhat,"" Behr told Reuters.
""Some people lack the civil courage to confront others but tip off the police anonymously,"" said Behr, adding people who had lived under the cloud of East Germany's loathed Stasi secret police might be remembering how things worked three decades ago.
One of the most repressive police organisations in the world, the Stasi crushed dissent by infiltrating almost every aspect of life in East Germany and relied on around 200,000 informants who spied on friends, colleagues and relatives.
""Snooping was widespread then and it's easier for people to do this if they have done it before,"" said Behr. ""In any case, it is typically German to wait until there is a law that allows people to do this,"" said Behr.

MIAMI - Florida officials have agreed to allow two Holland America Line cruise ships afflicted with the coronavirus to dock at a port in Fort Lauderdale, resolving a days-long impasse that drew the attention of President Donald Trump, NBC reported on Thursday.
The agreement would allow the cruise line’s Rotterdam and Zaandam ships to dock at the Port Everglades in Fort Lauderdale after 27 days at sea, according to an NBC News article. Four passengers aboard the Zaandam have died, two of them after becoming infected by the coronavirus, NBC said.
Representatives for the cruise line and Broward County, which contains Fort Lauderdale, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the deal. 
The port's website showed the vessels were scheduled to dock at 1 p.m. and 1:30 p.m. EDT (1700 and 1730 GMT). The Zaandam is carrying nearly 1,050 passengers and crew, while the Rotterdam has almost 1,450 on board.
Nine people suspected of having COVID-19, the potentially lethal respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus, will go to a Broward Health hospital, while foreign nationals will board buses directly to an airport before flying by charter planes back to their home countries, NBC reported. Forty-five severely sick passengers will remain on board.
The deal comes after Trump earlier this week urged the state's governor, a fellow Republican, to drop his opposition to accepting the ships.
Governor Ron DeSantis initially opposed the ships' arrival in his state, and told Fox News earlier this week he did not want passengers to be ""dumped"" in south Florida.
The nation's top infectious disease officials also urged that passengers be taken off the ships as soon as possible to prevent further spread of the highly contagious virus.
""You have to take care of the people who are ill. You just have an obligation to do that. And as quickly as possible. You've got to get the people who are not sick, who are not infected, off the ship,"" Dr. Anthony Fauci told CBS ""This Morning"" on Thursday just before the deal was reported.
""This is absolutely necessary to do before you get further spread of the infection,"" added Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. 
U.S. Representative Donna Shalala of Florida said earlier on Thursday that it was immoral not to accept the cruise ship passengers.
""We Americans don’t turn people away,"" she told CNN. ""We did once and to our shame. We turned Jewish refugees, desperate Jewish refugees (during Germany's Nazi era) away. ... We will never recover from that shame.”
Keith Kobler, a passenger on one of the ships along with his wife Doris, told NBC that they were aware that the country had undergone a severe shift over the past month as the coronavirus spread nationwide. 

""It's probably going to be strange for us,"" he told NBC.

OSLO, Norway (Reuters) - When President Trump announced the ban on travel from Europe last month, I was more than 3,000 miles away from my Norwegian childhood home, a 24-year-old photographer creating a life of my own in New York City.
I had to start thinking about whether I would risk my U.S. work visa – and my newfound freedom – to go home for nationalized health care and, most of all, to see my family. My mum recovered from cancer a few years ago: What if I couldn't see her if she became sick again?
That evening I went on a first date to a trendy and still-crowded New York City restaurant. We said goodbye with a wave after applying hand sanitizer. As I eagerly awaited the after-text to see if he was into me, he sent me a message to go home to Norway while I still had the chance.
The next morning my parents called. ""I want you to be here in case you should be sick,"" said my mum, Chava Savosnick. ""It's kind of scary to have my daughter on the other side of the world in these times.""
In a panic, I bought a ticket back to Norway. I braced myself for a return to childhood, quarantined in my parents' basement.
The basement looks the same as it did when I was 16, drinking my first few sips of hard cider with my friend Elena. The same books, the same movies, the same sofa bed. It felt comforting and a little claustrophobic at the same time.
So far, my mum hasn't caught me drinking – or even snagging a scoop of forbidden ice cream. My childhood had very few sugary treats. As an adult rebelling against those childhood restrictions, I'd buy at least three Ben and Jerry's pints a week.
Now, because I had to be in quarantine for two weeks after my arrival from America, my parents were in total control of my diet. I was rationed on the number of days I can fry my breakfast or have even a single egg. My mum is worried about my cholesterol and potential for high blood pressure.
I've learned that my 60-something parents are healthier than me. My mum walks as fast as a New Yorker, uses weights, and exercises every day. My dad, Mats Haraldsson, rides his bike for hours as a warm-up to his fitness regimen. He's an amateur lumberjack who still chops his own wood for the fireplace. It's how he heats our home. I probably will never live up to their fitness lifestyle, but I should take more yoga classes.
This time of enforced togetherness has been a time of discoveries – of differences, but also of finding common ground that we might have forgotten about, or never even known before.
In my bedroom there's a giant photograph of a tree that my father took when he was young. When I was a child, it had hung in the room where I slept when we visited my grandmother, so I've known it my whole life. When I went to art school, my father gave me the camera he used to take the photo.
I never pieced it together before living in quarantine, but my dad helped inspire my love of photography. He thought about being a professional photographer, but he was worried about if he could make a living at it. He's very security-minded.
""I didn't think I had the skills to take it to a professional level, but it was something I enjoyed for a few years,"" he says.
Now, during the quarantine, I've inspired him to pick up his camera again.
As my mum says: ""How you look at the quarantine is your choice. You can look at the quarantine as a problem, or you can look at the quarantine as something that gives you two weeks to be with yourself, to think about things, and to develop things which you have no time for otherwise.""
One night during my quarantine, we sat down and interviewed each other about what this time has meant to us, and to the world at large. We'd never done anything like that before, and it was fun and sometimes moving. 
My mother said it was hard to keep her distance from me when I arrived home.
""When you came from New York, you know, the natural thing for me is to go forward to you and kiss you and hug you, you know, my little girl,"" she said. But even though we couldn't touch, ""it's nice to, you know, have this feeling of having you close to me.""
My dad said he was glad I was home. ""We have to gather in these days,"" he said.
We talked about what we were most worried about. For me, it's my mum. She's in a higher-risk category, and she's been coughing. I'm afraid that without showing any symptoms, I've brought the disease with me from New York.
My mum fears getting ill, but she also worries about her country and the world as a whole.
""I'm a bit worried about how this is going to develop. Yes, not only because I'm in the risk group, but for the whole society. What's going to happen?"" she said. ""What kind of a Norway will this be when the virus is over or if it will be over?
""I am scared that it should get up the worst in people. And I hope it will take up the best in people.""
We looked for the blessings in this time we never wanted or expected.
""There have been many plagues in the history of humanity, and we have always continued in one way or another,"" my dad said. ""Maybe it will put us back to enjoy today because we don't know so much about tomorrow.""
My mum, who knows something about not taking life for granted, said: ""You have to live every day. And maybe don't think so much about the future. The future will come, but what the future will be, we don't know. But it will come. So it is to live every day as good as possible and enjoy every day.""
This disease has shown us how interconnected we all are, in scary ways, but possibly also good ones. We've seen how one place in the world might affect the rest of us.
""So it's in everybody's interest that things are going fine all over the place, because it might affect us,"" my mum mused. ""So maybe we will be more responsible and more conscious about how we act towards other places in the world.""
For me, I think we're facing a huge change. We've been treating this planet terribly for a long time, and I think we might come out of this as better people but also with a better planet.
But on a more personal level, even though I've sometimes felt restless and confined in my old home, this quarantine has given me a precious time with my parents.
I'm the journalist, but they interviewed me that night too. This is what I said.

""The best part is that I'm getting a lot closer to you guys, and I don't think I would ever get this close if it hadn't been for me literally being locked down in this house. ... And I think a lot of people will come out of this knowing the people they lived in the house with better. And I'm very grateful for that.""

176,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>","After death of a cashier, French supermarket staff work in fear","By Caroline Pailliez and Sarah White
PARIS (Reuters) - When 52-year-old supermarket cashier Aicha Issadounene died after contracting the coronavirus, her  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) colleagues felt the full fear of working on the frontline.
""I'm scared to go to work,"" said Tshela Ngandu, 53, who worked as a Carrefour cashier in the Paris suburb of Seine-Saint-Denis alongside union representative Issadounene.
Issadounene's last day at work was on March 16, when she sat at a counter welcoming shoppers, union officials said. She began coughing and stopped working the next day, a colleague who did not want to be named told Reuters.
There has been no evidence that Issadounene caught coronavirus at the store, where she worked part-time for decades to supplement her income as an accountant with a nearby firm, though her story has resonated with colleagues. 
When Issadounene fell ill, French authorities had yet to impose restrictive measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus and staff had not been issued with masks.
Ten days later, the checkout worker was dead. 
From the piazzas of Italy and plazas of Spain to the malls of the United States, supermarkets are playing a vital role in feeding people during the coronavirus pandemic, with measures now being taken to protect their staff.
At the Carrefour store in Seine-Saint-Denis this week, staff were wearing masks and only 100 customers were allowed inside at a time. Perspex shields were fitted at the checkouts.
Ngandu and other staff at the store who spoke to Reuters said they believed the protections were adequate.
Carrefour said employee safety was its top priority and that it had pre-empted government instructions and rolled out protective equipment early on. 
WALK OUT 
While supermarket workers everywhere face similar fears, in France they have the right in law to walk off the job, on full pay, if they don't feel safe. And managers are finding it hard to keep their shelves filled and tills staffed.
Absenteeism has reached 10-15% across the French supermarket sector, trade unions say, and in some stores has hit 40%.
Workers are off because they need to look after children with schools closed, because they are sick themselves, or in some cases because they have stayed at home out of fear.
But at a hypermarket run by Carrefour, Europe's biggest retailer, near the city of Marseille, some 200 workers out of 515 walked out on Monday, citing a lack of protective gear.
They only resumed work after store managers distributed a newly-acquired batch of face masks.
Carrefour said absences were on average 10% higher than usual, but largely due to staff having to take leave to look after children. 
Some French supermarkets are calling in temporary workers or students to help, as well as office-based staff. 
Casino-owned Monoprix sent a request to firms in sectors that have had to shut down to put forward any workers that might want to help in their stores, a letter seen by Reuters shows.
Monoprix did not respond to a request for comment. 
Supermarkets are also trying to persuade existing staff to work through the coronavirus crisis. Along with rivals such as Leclerc and Auchan, Carrefour has offered staff an extra 1,000 euros tax free.
A MASK A DAY
After the government lifted a requisition order on masks made in France for medical workers, Carrefour said it had managed to get hold of its first supplies of 2 million on Sunday though a private order, and would receive some 20 million more.
But employees and unions said that protective equipment was not always reaching stores on time or in enough quantities.
""We have one mask a day, that's far from being total protection for us,"" said Laetitia Gerbot, a 40-year-old mother of three who works at a Carrefour hypermarket in Bray-sur-Seine, 100 km (60 miles) south-east of Paris.
A small number of cashiers at her store had walked out on Tuesday because they had not received masks, Gerbot said, adding they arrived later the same day and staff returned to work.
While she had never been on strike, Gerbot said she would walk out if managers did not protect staff and colleagues were infected.
News of the sudden death of Issadounene, who was buried on Wednesday, has spread fast among her co-workers.

""We learn that the lady, Aicha, died not long ago, and we realise that no one is safe. That makes us think,"" Gerbot said.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - ""Boys, from now on each one brings his own plate, knife and fork. And the mates are no longer shared.""
This grim announcement by Argentine farmer Javier Dominguez resonated strongly among employees of his farm in Lujan, Buenos Aires province, the county's main agricultural district. 
Sharing food and bitter mate tea, which is passed among clusters of friends and slurped from communal metal straws, is indispensable to the iconic image of Argentine gaucho cowboys.
That gaucho aesthetic is essential to Argentine farmers, who are Argentina's biggest source of export dollars, forming the backbone of Latin America's No. 3 economy.
The tradition of sharing mate has been derailed as the country locks down and adopts social distancing to stem the tide of the coronavirus. The pandemic has cost exporters in Argentina tens of millions of dollars in business so far as some mayors refuse to let grains trucks into their towns.
""There are places that do not allow truckers to go to the bathroom, they relieve themselves behind their vehicles,"" Dominguez said. 
Between the virus and overly wet weather that has slowed harvesting in the world's No. 3 soy and corn exporter and No. 1 supplier of soymeal livestock feed, Argentine growers are facing disruptions that could force importers to turn toward rivals in Brazil and the United States.
""The perfect storm is brewing,"" Dominguez said.
Argentina has 1,054 confirmed cases of the coronavirus with 27 deaths so far, according to official data.
""I am concerned, which is why we are following protocols, such as not letting anyone in except for those strictly related to the harvest,"" said Juan Manville, a grower in northeast Buenos Aires, who apologized to Reuters for not being able to allow access to his fields to avoid risks of contagion.
In the coming weeks, as the harvest of soybeans and corn accelerates, the sight of farmers working their harvesting combines alone will become a common one.
The harvest is expected at 52 million tonnes of soy and 50 million tonnes of corn, according to the Buenos Aires Grains Exchange. Growers are bagging an increased amount of crops until pandemic- and rain-related bottlenecks clear up.
Increased storage in plastic ""silo-bags"" heightens the risk of spoilage when conditions are wet, adding to the uncertainties.

""I'm worried,"" Dominguez said. ""Everybody's scared.""

Ireland's prime minister significantly ramped up previous restrictions last Friday when he ordered citizens to stay home and only leave to shop for groceries, for brief individual physical exercise or make absolutely essential family visits.

""This disease has just occurred in Thailand. We've never had it in the past,"" director-general of the Department of Livestock Development, Sorawit Thanito, said on Thursday.
The government has quarantined sick horses to limit the spread of the disease, Sorawit said.
At least 131 horses have died across four provinces, latest government data showed.
""We have to investigate how this virus got to Thailand,"" he said, adding that the government was notified in late March of AHS in the country.
Horses suffering from the illness can have fevers of over 39 Celsius, difficulty breathing and bleeding in the eyes.
There have been no reported cases of AHS in humans and it was not related to the outbreak of the new coronavirus, Sorawit said. 
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) suspended Thailand's status as an ""AHS Free Country"" on March 27.
AHS is endemic in the central tropical regions of Africa, from where it spreads regularly to Southern (NYSE:SO) Africa and occasionally to North Africa, according to the OIE.
Myanmar and Kyrgyzstan had their AHS-free statuses suspended in 2018.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India reported its biggest single day increase in coronavirus cases as officials on Thursday raced to track down some 9,000 people exposed to the country's biggest infection cluster during a Muslim missionary group's gathering in the capital last month.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has placed the world's second most populous nation under a three-week lockdown until mid-April, and so far the number of coronavirus cases lags hard hit countries like the United States, Italy and Spain. 
As of Wednesday 50 people had died, but there are fears the death toll would explode if the contagion reaches epidemic proportions among India's 1.3 billion people. 
The number of cases jumped by more than half to 1,965 on Wednesday, fuelled by infections among people who either attended prayers and lectures at the Tablighi Jamaat's headquarters in a packed densely-packed Delhi neighbourhood or came into contact with them later.
A government official said about 9,000 people linked to the Delhi cluster were unaccounted for, of which 2,000 were identified as officials of the Tablighi and the rest were described as primary contacts. 
""This has emerged as a critical node in our fight against the coronavirus, we need these people to come forward, so we can quarantine them,"" the official leading the operation to trace potential virus carriers told Reuters, though he spoke on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media.
The Tablighi, is one of the world's largest proselytising groups, drawing followers from the South Asian Deobandi branch of Sunni Islam. 
Its leader Maulana Saad Kandhalvi issued an audio message to his followers asking them to cooperate with the government in the fight against the disease. 
""We have to take precautions, follow the guidance of the doctors and give full support to the government such as not crowding into places,"" he said. ""This is not against the principles of Islam."" 
About 2,300 people, including Bangladeshis, Indonesians and Malaysians, who had been staying at the Tablighi's cramped dormitories in Delhi, were transferred to quarantine centres in the city during the past few days.
The group said earlier people had been unable to leave as the nationwide lockdown that went into effect on March 24 brought a halt to transport.
Police in northern Uttar Pradesh state said they had lodged a case against 23 foreign nationals who were found to be involved with the Tablighi's activities while on tourist visas, a state police spokesman said.
India's shutdown has left millions of the poor without jobs and caused an exodus of migrant workers from the cities to the their homes in the countryside.
Bangladesh, home to about 160 million people, has extended a lockdown that was initially intended to last 10 days by a week, so it will last till April 11, the Public Administration Ministry said in a statement. 
Pharmaceuticals and export oriented factories such as the garments industry which account for over 80 percent of overseas shipments, can keep running, the ministry said. 
""If the garment factory owners want, they can run their factories following proper health guidelines,"" Commerce Minister Tipu Munshi said.
Following is data on the spread of the coronavirus in South Asia's eight countries, according to government figures: 
* Pakistan has registered 2,291 cases, including 31 deaths. 
* India has registered 1,965 cases, including 50 deaths. 
* Sri Lanka has registered 148 cases, including three deaths. 
* Afghanistan has registered 196 cases, including four deaths.

HAGATNA, Guam (Reuters) - About 1,000 sailors from the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt - roughly a fifth of its crew - were under quarantine at a U.S. naval base on Guam on Thursday as the Navy sought to control a coronavirus outbreak aboard the warship.
The evacuation of sailors from the vessel began on Wednesday, a week after the first coronavirus case was reported on the aircraft carrier, and followed public disclosure of a scathing letter to Navy command from the ship's captain urging ""decisive action"" to control the outbreak.
In his four-page letter, the contents of which were confirmed by U.S. officials to Reuters on Tuesday, Captain Brett Crozier described a bleak situation aboard the nuclear-powered carrier as more sailors tested positive for the virus. 
The letter put the Pentagon on the defensive about whether it was doing enough to keep the Theodore Roosevelt's 5,000 crew members safe, and alarmed the families of those aboard the vessel, whose home port is in San Diego.
In the letter, the captain called for more than 4,000 sailors to be removed from the ship and isolated, saying the Navy otherwise would be failing to properly safeguard ""our most trusted asset - our sailors.""
Acting U.S. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said he disagreed with the captain's assertion that all but 10 percent of the ship's crew could be removed from the vessel if necessary.
""This ship has weapons on it. It has munitions on it... It requires a certain number of people on that ship to maintain the safety and security of the ship,"" Modly said.
Asked whether the captain would face discipline for the letter, he said: ""The fact that he wrote the letter up to his chain of command to express his concerns would absolutely not result in any type of retaliation.""
When questioned repeatedly over the leak, he said: ""I don't know who leaked the letter to the media. That would be something that would violate the principles of good order and discipline, if he were responsible for that. But I don't know that.""
The carrier was in the Pacific when the outbreak started, and has since docked at the U.S. Naval Base Guam, on the southern end of the American island territory in the western Pacific.
HOTEL QUARANTINE ON GUAM
An initial group of 1,000 sailors were moved from the ship onto the base on Wednesday, with the Navy saying that 93 personnel had tested positive for the disease so far.
Those testing positive or showing flu-like symptoms were placed in isolation for treatment, while the rest were quarantined, the region's U.S. Navy commander, Rear Admiral John Menoni, said during a news conference on the island on Thursday.
Those who remain asymptomatic and test negative will be transported to vacant hotel space about 8 miles away in Guam's commercial Tumon district, where they will remain quarantined for two weeks, territorial Governor Lourdes Leon Guerrero told Reuters. 
The quarantined sailors will be moved to hotel quarters in the next 12 to 24 hours in an operation that will be run entirely by the U.S. military, Menoni said.
The Navy said on Wednesday that 2,700 crew would ultimately be removed from the ship over the next few days.
Menoni insisted that the aircraft carrier, despite the outbreak, ""is not incapacitated"" and ""could go to sea tomorrow if conditions required.""
The admiral said he was unaware of any discussions surrounding possible discipline of the ship's captain, adding, ""That's not my role."" 
Guam governor Leon Guerrero said some residents of the island, whose tourist-based economy has been devastated by the coronavirus pandemic, had been ""pushing back"" against welcoming the stricken aircraft carrier to shore.
But she was assured the sailors would be kept completely isolated from Guam's population.
""These are our sailors who go out in harm's way to protect our security in this part of the world,"" she said. ""I feel I have the moral obligation to reciprocate if I could.""

As of Thursday, Leon Guerrero said, Guam had 77 known cases of coronavirus, including three deaths.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - For many residents of bustling Bangkok, a daily walk or run through central Lumpini Park is considered a sanity saver, and especially these days as most people remain indoors during the coronavirus outbreak.
But as of Thursday, Thailand closed public parks until the end of the month as it steps up the fight against the virus, leaving many in this city of 10 million wondering how they will now destress.
""It's such a shame. So many people will have nowhere to go,"" said Chakrit Hovatanakul, who has been spending an hour or more in the park each day running and relaxing.
""Especially when I'm not working, it's important that I keep a routine, otherwise I'll be so depressed,"" he added.
Chakrit is a 49-year-old pilot at a Thai airline and, like many other airline staff around the globe, was told by his employer to stop working for two months as the coronavirus grounded airlines. With his family overseas, Chakrit said he had been coming to Lumpini Park to lift his spirits.
Nearly half of Thailand's 1,875 reported cases are in Bangkok, government data shows. Fifteen people have died.
""I'M JUST FEELING CAGED""
Globally, the coronavirus that first emerged in China late last year has infected at least 935,392 people and killed more than 46,000. 
Since March, Bangkok has closed shopping malls, schools, entertainment venues, libraries, museums, playgrounds, and sporting grounds in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. 
Closures of public and private parks were part of the latest measures announced on Wednesday, just hours before they would become effective. 
""We all have to change our lifestyles. Stricter measures naturally create more stress, but they won't be announced unless really necessary,"" said Varoth Chotpitayasunondh, a spokesman of the Department of Mental Health.
""We have to find ways to make ourselves happy under these new limitations,"" he added. 
Like Chakrit, many park-goers were taken by surprise that they were enjoying what would be the last green space outside for a while. 
For some of the city's poorest, parks have meant an affordable escape from their daily lives.
""Having the fan on all the time in my small rented room means higher electricity bills, so I come here for a few hours every day, as I have no income,"" said a 62-year-old man who only gave his name as Chai, as he lounged in a corner of the park. 

""At home, I'm just feeling caged, waiting for death.""

SATARA, India (Reuters) - As hundreds of millions of Indians remain locked down to stem the spread of coronavirus, some of its cattle are getting treated to strawberries and broccoli that farmers are struggling to transport and sell in cities amid the three-week lockdown.
Demand for such premium farm produce typically jumps in the summer, but with India's farm supply chain in disarray, farmers are unable to get goods to market.
The sudden drop in demand is hurting millions of farmers in the world's second-most populous country, with coronavirus cases surging to more than 1,900 in India, while the death toll rose to 50 on Wednesday. 
""Tourists and ice cream producers are the main buyers of strawberries, but there are no tourists now,"" said Anil Salunkhe, while feeding strawberries grown in his two-acre farm to his cows in Satara district, some 250 km (155 miles) south-east of Mumbai.
He was hoping to make 800,000 rupees ($10,600), but now has not even recovered the production cost of around 250,000 rupees, as it has become tough to transport produce to large cities.
Munishamappa, a farmer near India's IT hub of Bengaluru, dumped 15 tonnes of grapes in a nearby forest after failing to sell them - he had spent 500,000 rupees on his crop.
He had even asked nearby villagers to come collect his fruit for free, but few turned up, he said.
Indian grapes are also exported to Europe, which has sharply cut purchases in the past few weeks as the virus takes a heavy toll there, said Dyanesh Ugle of Sahyadri Farms, the country's biggest grape exporter.
Growers of expensive flowers such as gerbera, gladioli and bird of paradise, meanwhile, are worried after weddings that typically generate the bulk of demand have gotten cancelled.
""In summer, I sell one flower for 15 to 20 rupees. Now nobody is willing buy even at 1 rupee,"" said Rahul Pawar, who owns a 2-acre flower farm, as he plucked flowers to dump them into a compost pit.
Another flower grower Sachin Shelar says the bulk of his earnings come from the summer season, but sales have stalled during this crucial period.
Ajay Jadhav, who relies on upmarket restaurants to sell basil, iceberg lettuce and bok-choy grown on his three acres, said his fellow villagers won't take away the vegetables even for free.
""I don't have a choice but to make manure out of these exotic vegetables,"" he said. ""Rural folks don't even know the names of these vegetables. Forget about them cooking these.""

Fatalities in nursing homes have surged, with dozens of deaths reported across the country. Officials have held back on directly linking the deaths to the coronavirus given the age and health condition of many who have died.

188,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 02, 2020 02:16AM ET</span>","As Spain battles virus, medics' unions hit out","By Emma Pinedo and Joan Faus
MADRID (Reuters) - When Spain's first case of coronavirus was recorded on Jan. 31 - a German tourist in La Gomera, one of the remote Canary Islands - there seemed little cause for concern. 
""We believe that Spain will have, at most, not more than a few diagnosed cases,"" Fernando Simon, the country's health emergency chief, told reporters. 
Now, COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the virus, has killed more people in Spain than China, where it originated. 
Across the globe, the pandemic has swamped health systems and triggered calls for more and better protective equipment for those fighting it. 
Spain's doctors and nurses, who have released clips of each other cutting up plastic garbage bags to use as protective clothing, say their situation is worse than many. 
More than 15,000 of them are sick or self-isolating and unable to help patients. That's around 14.7% of the country's confirmed cases, said a health ministry spokeswoman. One union has said the concentration is higher in the capital Madrid - 21% - the epicentre of the outbreak that has killed more than 9,000 and infected more than 100,000. 
Medical workers in Italy, for example, make up just under 10% of reported COVID-19 cases, a smaller share than in Spain - although scientists say the data are not directly comparable because medical staff may not be tested at the same rate. 
In a town in Catalonia, as many as one in three medical staff have been out of action because they were infected or self-isolating. 
Cellphone footage has aired on Spanish TV and on social media showing patients with oxygen tanks packed into the corridors - some laid out on the corridor floors - of hospitals.
In Spain, unions representing Spain's medical staff are taking action. Unions have filed lawsuits in at least 10 of Spain's 17 regions asking judges to compel the authorities to provide equipment within 24 hours in line with health and safety law, said a spokeswoman for the national federation of doctors' unions, CESM. In Catalonia, the top regional court on Tuesday rejected the 24-hour deadline but said authorities must provide protection measures whenever equipment arrives. 
The health ministry said it had always acted on scientific evidence, following experts' recommendations, and taking steps based on a thorough assessment of the situation at any given time. Health Minister Salvador Illa has said the equipment market was simply overwhelmed, but said on Tuesday the ministry had managed ""steady and continuous deliveries"" of equipment.
""We feel very proud of what the Spanish healthcare workers are doing,"" he told a news conference.
Spain's health service, like Italy's, is run at regional level. The central government took control by declaring a state of emergency on March 14, and the authorities are trying to hire thousands of extra staff. But the health ministry - like everyone globally - has struggled to get hold of supplies.
""The explosion of cases in Spain is not normal ... it has been very poorly managed since the beginning,"" said Tomas Toranzo, president of CESM, whose members are filing the suits. ""The coronavirus infection was underestimated, treated like a mild flu, and it seemed that this would only affect a few elderly.""
ADVICE IGNORED
Unions say their members were ignored. Already in February, there were signs the virus was spreading, said Angela Fernandez, a Madrid surgeon and deputy secretary of the doctors' union AMYTS. 
She said doctors in major hospitals in Madrid noticed a cluster of unusually severe pneumonia cases that didn't correspond with the end of the flu season - similar to those that Chinese doctors had recorded on the new coronavirus. But strict protocols limiting testing from Spain's health ministry prevented doctors nationwide from testing for it.
It took until March 11 for the health ministry to allow doctors to test people who displayed even mild symptoms. Such confusion was widespread globally.
Spain's health workers, a dozen of whom spoke to Reuters, say they were vulnerable in other ways too. 
In mid-February, Jesus Garcia Ramos, the representative for health and safety for Madrid's nurses' union, Satse Madrid, asked the regional health authority for extra training to prepare for coronavirus patients, he said. One thing they wanted to know: How to take off protective equipment without infecting the wearer.
He said it took 10 days for the first training sessions to begin on Feb. 25, the date Madrid reported its first case. In some other Madrid hospitals, training didn't start until the first week of March, he added. By then, the number of cases nationwide had leapt from dozens to hundreds. 
The Madrid authority did not respond to requests for comment. 
RAINCOATS AND SHOWER CAPS
A doctor in Barcelona said he was also ignored. 
Josep Maria Puig, who works at Barcelona's Hospital del Mar, said he suggested to regional health officials from late February that they consider calling up retired health workers and building makeshift hospitals. It took a couple of weeks for them to act - too long, he said.
Puig, who is also secretary general of Metges de Catalunya, Catalonia's biggest doctors' union, said Spain wasted crucial time and ""failed spectacularly"" to get personal protection equipment (PPE) to its own healthcare workers, despite real-time lessons from Italy: ""Italy was 10 days ahead of us, which should have allowed us to see where things could be heading.""
A spokesman for Catalonia's health department did not respond to requests for comment. 
On March 18, the central government issued a document outlining ""alternative strategies"" for staff dealing with the shortage. Adapted from a similar one prepared by America's Centers for Disease Control, it said staff lacking masks had five options, including re-using masks or only providing them to staff at the highest risk of infection. It also suggested different kinds of aprons and gloves that could be used.
Some nurses have been forced to improvise, fashioning protective clothing from garbage bags, shower caps, or raincoats from a Madrid amusement park. 
In the town of Igualada, an hour's drive north of Barcelona, a local government spokesman said that about one-third of the hospital's 1,000 staff - all of whom have been tested - have had to self-isolate either because they had symptoms or were in touch with people who may have been. 
A total of 98 people in Igualada have died of the disease and, of the more than 600 infected, 154 are healthcare workers, according to the regional health authority.
On March 12, Igualada became the first municipality in Spain to be completely sealed off, following Italy's example with the northern region of Lombardy. Only those providing vital services can enter or leave.
""TSUNAMI MOVIE""
In Alicante, a Spanish port city popular with tourists, doctor Victor Pedrera said that on March 5, he asked the management of his healthcare centre and the local health authority to cancel all non-essential medical appointments to prepare for the pandemic. 
The request was ignored, he said.
""I felt totally helpless, because more and more people with respiratory symptoms were coming,"" he said. ""It was like a tsunami movie where you see the wave coming and no one is doing anything.""
Only more than two weeks after Pedrera's request did his clinic totally suspend non-essential appointments, he said.
Valencia's health authority said it had recommended hospitals set up virtual appointments from early March, and had always acted to minimise the risk for the population.
Infections of healthcare workers have continued to rise. 
On Monday Fernando Simon, the health emergency chief, tested positive for coronavirus. 

The health ministry said Simon was not available to comment as he was in isolation. On Tuesday, he connected by video to the government's daily news conference. He said, ""I'm feeling very good. A good night's sleep has done me good. I have to keep the quarantine even inside my house. I'm in my room and I'm not coming out of it.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia on Thursday announced free childcare for six months as part of a bid to keep businesses operating through the coronavirus pandemic, as data on new infections supported early signs of ""flattening the curve.""
The childcare centre subsidy adds to a growing list of support packages worth some A$200 billion ($121 billion) for airlines to mall owners as the government attempts to ""hibernate"" the Australian economy, to be reawakened when the crisis has passed.
""We will demonstrate to the world here in Australia how such societies can deal with these sort of challenges our way, the Australian way,"" Morrison said during a televised press conference. ""So stay positive, Australia. Stay connected, stay strong. We will get through this together.""
Morrison and state officials have introduced unprecedented restrictions on public movement to stop the spread of the virus and said that data on new infections continued to show those efforts were paying off. 
Australia has reported around 5,200 infections and 25 deaths, with daily increases in new cases dropping to single digits from between 25% and 30% two weeks ago.
""The curve is beginning to flatten,"" Health Minister Greg Hunt said. ""It isn't sustained yet, it hasn't been consolidated, but those early, important signs are absolutely critical.""
Morrison said on Thursday the country's testing rate was now more than 1,000 tests per 100,000 people, or 1% of the population. 
""We are the first country to the best of our knowledge that 
has been able to exceed that mark,"" Morrison said.
Childcare centres have lost significant business in recent weeks as thousands of people shifted to working at home, or were made redundant.
Morrison said the subsidy would keep about 13,000 childcare centres open by paying them A$1.6 billion over the next three months. The full subsidies will last for six months, when they will be reviewed.
Keeping the centres open would also allow critical workers from medical professionals to cleaners and food deliverers to continue to work, Morrison said.
Australia has ordered the shutdown of restaurants, cafes, bars, movie theatres and instructed people to stay inside unless they are shopping for food or taking their daily exercise as it tries to contain the flu-like illness.
The restrictions are expected to push the country's A$2 trillion economy into its first recession in almost three decades and lift unemployment to double figures.
CRUISE SHIP BAN
Australia was also dealing with the fate of around a dozen cruise ships it has banned from docking at its ports after disembarking passengers and crew became the country's biggest single source of coronavirus infections. 
A military-style operation was planned to airlift doctors onto eight cruise ships floating off the NSW coast which were refusing orders to leave Australian waters, to conduct health checks on nearly 9,000 crew members, local media reported on Thursday. 
The Maritime Union of Australia said there were 11 foreign-owned cruise ships in limbo in Australian waters, with 11,000 crew members in total, and their situation was ""an emerging humanitarian crisis"".
State governments, meanwhile, began putting time limits on the use of police to enforce restrictions on personal movement intended to slow the spread of the illness, including fines of up to to A$11,000 ($6,672) and prison time of up to six months.
Authorities themselves have referred to the measures as ""draconian"" but necessary. In New South Wales, the country's most populous state, officials said the rights of police to enforce penalties would initially last for 90 days. 
""People will have gotten the message by then, hopefully,"" NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fullter said. ""And we won't be talking about the powers, we'll be talking about what does it look like coming out of this?""
In Victoria, the second most populous state, officials said policing of the social distancing policies might last until at least June.

In a televised address, Duterte said it was vital everyone cooperates and follows home quarantine measures, as authorities try to slow the contagion and spare the country's fragile health system from being overwhelmed. 
The Philippines has recorded 96 coronavirus deaths and 2,311 confirmed cases, all but three in the past three weeks, with infections now being reported in the hundreds every day.
""It is getting worse. So once again I'm telling you the seriousness of the problem and that you must listen,"" Duterte said late on Wednesday.
""My orders to the police and military ... if there is trouble and there's an occasion that they fight back and your lives are in danger, shoot them dead."" 
""Is that understood? Dead. Instead of causing trouble, I will bury you.""
His comments came after media reports of a disturbance and several arrests on Wednesday of residents in a poor area of Manila who were protesting about sufficient government food aid.
They also follow outrage among the medical community about social stigma and instances of hospital workers suffering physical abuse and discrimination, which Duterte said must be stopped.
Activists deride Duterte over his fierce rhetoric and accuse him of inviting violence and vigilantism, as shown in his war on drugs, during which police and mystery gunmen have killed thousands of people accused of using or selling drugs.
Police say their actions in the anti-drug campaign have been lawful.
Duterte's office typically calls his remarks hyperbole to underline his point. 

The national police chief on Thursday said police understood that Duterte was demonstrating his seriousness about public order, and no one would be shot.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Ex-Vatican treasurer George Pell will learn on April 7 whether he can walk free from jail, when Australia's highest court hands down its judgment on his appeal against historical child sex offences.
The decision will likely bring to an end the long-running prosecution of the cardinal for sexually assaulting two teenaged choirboys in the 1990s when he was Archbishop of Melbourne. Pell is the highest ranking Catholic worldwide to be jailed for child sex offences.
The High Court of Australia said on Thursday it would deliver its judgment at 10am (0000 GMT) on Tuesday, April 7.
The court could overturn his conviction, in which case Pell would walk free, or it could dismiss the appeal, leaving him in jail. The case could also be sent back to a lower court, but legal experts considered that a slim possibility.
Pell was convicted by a jury in December 2018 on one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and four charges of an indecent act with a child under 16. He was sentenced to six years in prison and lost an appeal against his conviction in a lower court last August.
His appeal to the High Court was heard by seven justices over two days in March, during which numerous questions about the prosecution's case were raised.
Legal experts said the release of the judgment within one month of the hearing was relatively quick for a court that typically takes several months to deliver its decisions.

The decision will be delivered in the middle of the most important week in the Catholic liturgical calendar, when the church's 1.3 billion members celebrate Easter.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States believes Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security was directly involved in the killing of an Iranian dissident last November in Turkey, a senior administration official told Reuters on Wednesday.
Masoud Molavi Vardanjani was shot dead on an Istanbul street on Nov. 14, 2019. Citing Turkish officials, Reuters last week reported that two intelligence officers in Iran's consulate in Istanbul had instigated his killing. 
""Given Iran's history of targeted assassinations of Iranian dissidents and the methods used in Turkey, the United States government believes that Iran's Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS) was directly involved in Vardanjani's killing,"" a senior administration official told Reuters.
The United States had not previously disclosed its assessment on who might have been behind the incident.
A week after the killing, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had described it as “another tragic example in a long string of suspected Iran-backed assassination attempts” of Iranian dissidents. He had not elaborated further.
Late on Wednesday, Pompeo in a tweet said he found disturbing the reports that Iranian diplomats were involved in the killing of the dissident, but that they were ""fully consistent"" with their assignments. 
""Iran's 'diplomats' are agents of terror and have conducted multiple assassinations and bomb plots in Europe over the past decade,"" Pompeo said.
A police report by the Turkish authorities into the killing, published two weeks ago, said Vardanjani had an “unusual profile.” It said he had worked in cyber security at Iran’s Defense Ministry and had become a vocal critic of the Iranian authorities.
Turkish authorities did not publicly accuse the Iranian government of involvement at the time, but the Turkish officials last week told Reuters that Ankara would now raise Vardanjani’s killing with Iran.
The U.S. assessment comes amid its ""maximum pressure"" campaign against Tehran, through which President Donald Trump aims to force Iran to limit its missile program and curb its use of proxy forces in Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have remained high since Trump in 2018 unilaterally pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal to limit Iran's nuclear program.
In recent weeks, the United States has repeatedly tightened sanctions on Iran, despite calls from Iranian authorities, the United Nations and China asking it to ease them as the Islamic Republic became the hardest-hit nation in the Middle East by the coronavirus pandemic.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Wednesday it was deploying more U.S. Navy warships and aircraft to the Caribbean to prevent drug cartels and ""corrupt actors"" like Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro from exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to smuggle more narcotics.
President Donald Trump said he was doubling U.S. military resources in the region, including destroyers, surveillance planes and personnel, in an anti-drug crackdown to deal with what he called a ""growing threat.""
The beefed-up operation - quickly dismissed by the Maduro government - will also call for sending Navy ships closer to Venezuela, according to a U.S. official and two people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity. But it was unclear how close they would get to Venezuelan shores, the sources said.
Trump, joined by Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mark Milley, made the announcement at the start of the White House's daily briefing on efforts to battle the spreading pandemic.
It followed the indictment last week of Maduro and more than a dozen current and former officials on charges of narco-terrorism conspiracy, drug trafficking and corruption.
Maduro has remained in power despite a wide-ranging U.S.-led campaign of sanctions and diplomacy, something U.S. officials have privately said is a source of frustration for Trump.
On Tuesday, the Trump administration offered, however, to begin lifting Venezuela sanctions if the opposition and members of Maduro's Socialist Party form an interim government without him, marking a shift in a U.S. policy.
Trump said Wednesday's move was needed because cartels and others were trying to take advantage of a pandemic that has required massive resources from United States and other countries. ""We must not let the drug cartels exploit the pandemic to threaten American lives,"" he said.
Esper also pointed a finger at Maduro's government.
""Corrupt actors, like the illegitimate Maduro regime in Venezuela, rely on the profits derived from the sale of narcotics to maintain their oppressive hold on power,"" he said. ""The Venezuelan people continue to suffer tremendously due to Maduro's criminal control over the country.""
Venezuela's government said in a statement it ""energetically rejects"" the administration's announcement, calling it an effort to distract from incompetent U.S. handling of the coronavirus outbreak. Maduro has dismissed last week's criminal charges as false and racist.
MORE PRESSURE ON MADURO
The increased naval deployment could ratchet up pressure on Maduro and his allies but is not a prelude to U.S. military action against Venezuela, one person familiar with the matter said.
Although Trump has insisted that all options are on the table against Maduro, U.S. officials have made clear there is little appetite for military force, which could entangle the United States in another foreign conflict.
Federal prosecutors last week accused Maduro and his alleged accomplices of shipping tons of cocaine into the United States each year, using the drugs as a ""weapon."" 
U.S. officials have long accused Maduro and his associates or running a ""narco-state,"" saying they have used proceeds from drugs transshipped from neighboring Colombia to make up for lost revenue from a Venezuelan oil sector hit by U.S. sanctions.
The United States and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president, regarding Maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham.
But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the country's military and by Russia, China and Cuba.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced on Tuesday the administration's power-sharing transition plan, which proposed for the first time a ""sequenced exit path"" from tough U.S. sanctions, including on the vital oil sector, if Maduro and his allies cooperate.

But it will be no easy task to draw Maduro or his associates onto a path of political reconciliation with Guaido. Maduro has shown no willingness to seriously negotiate an end to his rule.

In a letter dated Tuesday, Republican Representative Jim Banks asked the U.S. government to seek a probe into the fates of Fang Bin, Chen Qiushi and Li Zehua. According to media reports, they went missing after taking videos and publishing them online including images of overwhelmed hospitals and corpses piled in a minibus.
""All three of these men understood the personal risk associated with independently reporting on coronavirus in China, but they did it anyway,"" Banks wrote, alleging that the Chinese government ""imprisoned them - or worse.""
The Chinese Embassy and the State Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
While the State Dept is under no obligation to follow through on Banks' request, the Trump administration has put in place a number of measures cracking down against China that were first proposed by hardliners in Congress. 
The virus, which has become a global pandemic, first emerged in Wuhan in late December, sickening tens of thousands and upending life in the industrial city of 11 million people in central China.
China's censorship policies came under scrutiny since the virus outbreak amid allegations from online critics and local media that they potentially obscured the seriousness of the outbreak in its early stages.
Banks also asked the State Department to open its own probe through diplomatic channels into the journalists' disappearance and ban those responsible for their mistreatment from entering the United States.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that Iran or its proxies planned a sneak attack on U.S. targets in Iraq, and warned they would pay a ""very heavy price"" but gave no details.
""Upon information and belief, Iran or its proxies are planning a sneak attack on U.S. troops and/or assets in Iraq. If this happens, Iran will pay a very heavy price, indeed!"" Trump said in a post on Twitter.
It was not immediately clear what information Trump was referring to in his tweet, which was posted after he was scheduled to have a 12 p.m. ET (1600 GMT) intelligence briefing.
U.S. intelligence about a potential Iran-backed strike in Iraq suggests it would likely be a deniable attack, as opposed to the kind of overt missile strike that Tehran carried out on Jan. 8, a U.S. official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
The official said intelligence threads about a potential attack by Iran or Iran-backed forces had been building for some time. The official did not disclose intelligence on the timing or precise locations of any attack.
Speaking before Trump's tweet, a top military aide to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned Washington against ""provocative actions"" in Iraq, Iranian news agencies reported.
U.S.-Iranian relations have been bitter since the Islamic Revolution toppled the U.S.-backed shah of Iran, Mohammed Reza Pahlavi, in 1979 and ushered in an era of theocratic rule.
While there was a detente with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, relations have deteriorated with Trump's decision nearly two years ago to abandon that multilateral agreement and reimpose U.S. sanctions that have crippled the Iranian economy.
Worsening tensions, a Jan. 3 U.S. drone strike in Iraq killed Qassem Soleimani, the head of Iran's elite Quds Force, as well as Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, who founded Iraq's Shi’ite Kataib Hezbollah militia after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq.
Iran retaliated with a rocket attack on Iraq's Ain al-Asad base where U.S. forces were stationed on Jan. 8. No U.S. troops were killed or faced immediate bodily injury, but more than 100 were later diagnosed with traumatic brain injury.
The United States has blamed Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah for a March 11 rocket attack that killed two American troops and a 26-year-old British soldier in Iraq and, a day later, carried out air strikes against its militants in Iraq.
Phillip Smyth, an expert who tracks Shi'ite militias at Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank, said he believed Trump’s warning was prompted by the emergence of the League of the Revolutionaries, a group he said was formed to give deniability to Kataib Hezbollah to attack U.S. targets.
The United States and Iran have also been engaged in a war of words over U.S. sanctions, which aim to force Iran to curb its nuclear and missile programs as well as its use of proxies in conflicts in Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen.

Washington has repeatedly tightened its sanctions, which are designed to choke off Tehran's oil exports, in the last month as the coronavirus outbreak has spread in Iran, one of the nations in the Middle East hardest hit by the virus.

ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey will step up measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak if it keeps spreading and people ignore ""voluntary"" quarantine rules, President Tayyip Erdogan said, as the death toll rose and doctors demanded action to ease the strain on hospitals.
Turkey's death toll from the pandemic rose by 63 to 277 on Wednesday, its sharpest daily increase yet, while the total number of cases from the disease rose by 2,148 to 15,679, Health Minister Fahrettin Koca said.
The government has urged people to stay at home, halted all international flights, limited domestic travel, closed schools, cafes, bars and suspended mass prayers and sports fixtures. 
But, it has so far stopped short of imposing a full lockdown on public life in an effort to cushion the economic impact.
""We are determined to continue production and exports,"" Erdogan told a meeting of provincial leaders of his AK Party in a televised video conference on Wednesday.
""We won't need further measures if all our citizens keep themselves in a voluntary quarantine. However, we may have to take much more advanced measures if the pandemic spreads and our citizens don't stay at home.""
Later on Wednesday, Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu warned that intercity travel would be further restricted in the coming days, after Ankara limited domestic transport at the weekend.
""Our message to citizens is very clear: Do not travel from one city to the other, stay at home. We will make it harder for you,"" he told broadcaster CNN Turk, adding that one step could be curbing the use of personal vehicles in intercity travel.
He said some 100,000 people had applied to local governors to receive permission for intercity travel, and the government will take steps based on the pace of the pandemic and directives from the health ministry.
In the last 24 hours, 14,396 tests had been conducted in the country, bringing the total number to 106,799 since the outbreak began, Koca said. He added that Turkey would conduct 20,000 to 25,000 tests per day next week and then rapidly reach 30,000.
GROWING PRESSURE
In Istanbul, Turkey's largest city which has the highest number of infections, the mayor has pushed for a lockdown to slow the spread of the virus because millions of people were still going to work each day.
On Wednesday, Koca said the virus had spread across all 81 provinces in Turkey, but that 60% of cases were in Istanbul. He said there were 8,852 cases and 117 deaths in Istanbul, with the western coastal province of Izmir and the capital Ankara as the next most afflicted regions with 853 and 712 cases respectively. 
The Turkish Medical Association (TTB) has criticised what it says is a lack of government readiness and transparency as cases surged over the last three weeks, and has been among those pressing Ankara to adopt and enforce a stay-at-home order. 
The TTB, citing its own data, said there are more than 200 patients in intensive care, with over 100 medical staff infected so far in Istanbul through March 30. It added that hospitals in the city of 16 million were short of masks, gloves, goggles and other protective equipment and could face a severe lack of beds.
Koca said 601 medical staff had been infected nationwide.
""This is surely the tip of the iceberg,"" TTB Chairman Sinan Adiyaman told Reuters. ""Every person in the public and private sector must stay at home unless it is essential they go out,"" he said, adding that this would mean granting them ""certain social rights (including) paid leave"".
""Layoffs must be absolutely banned. Every worker's social rights must be protected this way to ensure they stay at home apart from mandatory cases.""
The government has announced a 100-billion-lira ($15 billion) package to support the economy that includes some wage protection for workers, though many, including in the vast tourism sector, are not covered.
The TTB's office in Izmir said doctors were struggling to access patient data and that not enough was being done to ensure the separation of diagnosed and suspected cases.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Hospitals in the Belgian capital called on the federal government on Wednesday to address a shortage of medicines and equipment, as COVID-19 patients continue to arrive at intensive care units that are starting to fill up.
""Federal authorities do not seem to see or hear that the reality is that hospitals are in a massive shortage of all protective gear and drugs needed to treat COVID-19 patients and other categories of equipment like syringes,"" around 10 public and private hospitals said in a statement issued via the federation of hospitals and care homes for Belgium's regions of Brussels and Wallonia known as Santhea.
Belgium, with some 11.5 million people, is one of the countries hardest hit by the coronavirus in Europe.
Some 4,995 people have been hospitalized with COVID-19 symptoms in the country, meaning around half of the health services' capacity has been taken up treating the disease. The health ministry says it expects the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 to peak in the coming days and weeks.
Except for real emergencies, hospitals are focused on COVID-19 patients only.
""The situation is really dramatic,"" the statement said, adding that the hospitals are currently working with a three-day stock of medicines and fear they would soon no longer be able to offer adequate care.
Belgium's health ministry announced earlier on Wednesday that its stock of drugs such as curare, a drug to relax muscles of intubated patients, would last until mid-April.
The reality on the ground seems different as ""there is a real shortage of curare-type drugs and for other drugs, it becomes really very difficult,"" said Valerie Victoor, general adviser at Santhea.

Belgium reported its death toll rose by 123 to a total of 828 people on Wednesday, and its number of cases was up 1,189 to 13,964. Officials said the nation's testing capacity would reach 10,000 daily by the end of the week.

(Reuters) - New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ordered the closure of all playgrounds in New York City on Wednesday in an effort to bolster social distancing and limit the number of coronavirus-related deaths, which are approaching 2,000 in the state.
Cuomo said that New York, which had already shut playgrounds outside of the city, needed to clamp down further because young people continue to gather even as the virus takes a devastating toll on the city, the epicenter of the nation's outbreak.
""You still see too many situations with too much density by young people,"" Cuomo told a daily briefing. ""Who else has to die for you to understand that you have a responsibility in this."" 
Cuomo called on the city's police force to ""get more aggressive"" in enforcing social distancing efforts but added that open spaces in parks would remain available for people to ""walk around, get some sun.""
The governor said that the number of coronavirus cases in his state had increased to 83,712, up from 75,795 a day earlier, with deaths rising to 1,941, up from 1,550, by far the most in the United States.
The briefing came one day after U.S. President Donald Trump warned Americans of a ""painful"" two weeks ahead, referring to modeling that showed an enormous jump in deaths to a range of 100,000 to 240,000 people from the virus in the coming months.
Cuomo said the state was relying on models by the consulting firm McKinsey which projected a need for 75,000 beds for patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and 25,000 ventilators in the case of high compliance with social distancing meaures.
In a scenario where people didn't adhere to those directives, the need for beds will be over 110,000 and some 37,000 ventilators will be needed. In both models the projected apex of the crisis will be at the end of this month.
Cuomo warned leaders in other regions that they, too, would be facing a similar crisis. ""Look at us today, see yourself tomorrow,"" the governor said.
New York has only received 4,000 ventiatlors from the federal government, well short of its need, Cuomo said.
He said it was difficult for New York to purchase ventilators on its own amid fierce competition and price gouging. He reiterated his plea for the federal government to step in and act as the central purchaser.

""The only hope for a state at this point is the federal government's capacity to deliver.""

199,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 01:56PM ET</span>","As gangs ravage Mexico town, mayor seeks answers to husband's killing","By Daina Beth Solomon
APASEO EL ALTO, Mexico (Reuters) - After her husband was shot dead while running for mayor of Apaseo el Alto in central Mexico in 2018, Maria del Carmen Ortiz took over his campaign and, pushing through her grief, won the vote after becoming a symbol of residents' hunger for justice. 
A year and a half after taking office, Ortiz must now be accompanied by three police bodyguards wherever she goes, as her home state of Guanajuato has emerged as the most murderous in Mexico, caught in a battle between rival criminal cartels. 
Three town officials have been killed during her tenure: her transit director, tax chief and a city councilor. Like her husband's killing, none of their murders have been solved.
Now Ortiz is using her position as mayor to call for thorough investigations by prosecutors of their killings and dozens more in the hilly town. 
""They file the cases away,"" Ortiz, 34, said in her office at the two-story municipal palace beside photos of her late husband Jose Remedios Aguirre, who was 35 when he died, and their three children. ""They should do their job, but do it well, so there's justice: for my husband, for my colleagues, for everyone.""
The streets of Apaseo el Alto, home to some 70,000 people, are narrow yet bustling, lined with mom-and-pop businesses and dollar exchange stores serving locals with family members who bring earnings back from the United States. 
According to federal government data, the number of killings jumped here to 87 last year from 10 in 2015. 
The local records, kept at the fenced-in police station on the outskirts of town, paint an even grislier picture: 120 murders last year and none of them solved. 
A security crisis inherited by President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has worsened in many parts of Mexico since he took office in December 2018, as he eased back on a war against the cartels and pledged instead to tackle what he calls the root causes of violence: corruption, poverty and lack of opportunities for young people.
On his watch, Mexico tallied a record of 34,582 murders last year. Yet experts say Mexico's justice system is ill-equipped to solve them, feeding a vicious cycle of impunity and crime. 
Ortiz backs Lopez Obrador's policy. She decided to run for office after he endorsed her at his campaign rally in Apaseo el Alto, lifting her hand into the air. Onlookers applauded and broke into chants of ""Justice! Justice!"" 
Yet Guanajuato opened a record 2,775 murder investigations last year, making it the bloodiest state in Mexico. A decade ago, the state - home to nearly 6 million people - had just 437 murders.
Security consultants say the jump in killings is tied to a battle between Guanajuato's Santa Rosa de Lima gang and its bigger rival, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) from neighboring Jalisco state. 
In Guanajuato, just 10.5% of homicides under investigation result in jail time, according to a 2018 study from the University of the Americas Puebla. For Mexico as a whole, the figure is little better at 17%.
Many blame the entrenched impunity on an overwhelmed justice system in which the police, prosecutors and judges lack the training to prosecute crimes successfully, and where corruption and political interests derail investigations. 
Experts say, moreover, that criminal groups target local officials to deter investigations into their activities. They believe Santa Rosa is likely behind various political assassinations in the area, including in Apaseo el Alto, which is just 25 miles (40 km) from the gang's birthplace.
However, the town's public security minister Jose Abraham Dominguez said he had not identified any organized crime group in the municipality. He said that violence could be spilling over from gangs in neighboring states. 
    ""Perhaps they come, they pass through, but we don't have any criminal group here,"" he said. 
GANG WAR 
In the wake of the fragmentation of many criminal groups, the Jalisco cartel has made a push to claim swathes of territory throughout Mexico, driving up murder levels across the country as other groups band together against it. 
""They're waging all out war,"" said Falko Ernst, a senior analyst at International Crisis Group. ""There are resources pouring in on both sides sustaining bloodshed for the foreseeable future.""
According to Sophia Huett, Guanajuato's security commissioner, 85% of homicides carried out in the state are tied to organized crime.
Fighting among criminal groups has worsened in the past year since Lopez Obrador's administration cracked down on fuel theft from pipelines owned by state oil company Pemex, said Huett: ""Because there's less product, the fight becomes bloodier, more violent."" 
Worth up to an estimated $3 billion a year nationally before the government intervention, the revenues from fuel theft boosted Santa Rosa's rise – and are coveted by the CJNG, whose own rise built on drug trafficking. 
With one-third of Pemex's pipelines running through Guanajuato, the state has become a battleground for control of the illicit trade.
CJNG can afford to quickly send in new recruits given its presence not only in Jalisco, but in other nearby states. 
""They work as a franchise,"" Huett said. ""You have two people from the Jalisco cartel here one day, and the next day, they send another two.""
As a newcomer in Guanajuato, the Jalisco cartel has struggled to match Santa Rosa's homegrown roots and the help it receives from local criminals and officials.
Instead, it must rely on firepower. 
""They are going to fight inch by inch throughout the country, not through community support, but with violence and economic power,"" said security consultant Juan Miguel Alcantara, who was deputy attorney general in former president Felipe Calderon's government. 
For Alcantara, a lack of resolve by Lopez Obrador's government has encouraged cartels in Guanajuato to act more brazenly due to a sense of impunity. 
At least twice last month alone, gunmen in a part of Guanajuato dominated by Santa Rosa blocked highways with burning cars and shot at police, raising questions of whether the gang's notoriously violent leader, Jose ""El Marro"" Yepez, was retaliating against authorities closing in on him and family members.
The incidents paralyzed parts of Guanajuato for hours, reminiscent of the Sinaloa cartel's show of firepower when it sent gunmen to storm the northern city of Culiacan last year, forcing outnumbered security forces to free the son of Sinaloa capo Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, who had been captured hours before.
Lopez Obrador said after the incident in Culiacan it was more important to prevent mass civilian deaths.

""They saw that in Sinaloa it worked... so they're trying the same thing here,"" Alcantara said. ""They know the same thing will happen: that the authorities are going to cave in.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Easter celebrations should be permitted inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, even if only by a small number of clerics abiding by anti-coronavirus guidelines, a senior clergyman said on Wednesday.
Father Francesco Patton, a Franciscan friar who is the Custos of the Holy Land for the Roman Catholic church, urged the Israeli government to allow freedom of worship at the site which is the focal point of Holy Week.
Israel has imposed tight restrictions on public gatherings to curb the spread of the virus, on Monday barring gatherings of more than two people who are not in the same family, with few exceptions. 
With Easter approaching, the Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox and Roman Catholic authorities who share custody of the Holy Sepulchre issued a joint statement last week saying prayers ""will continue"" at the traditional site of Jesus’ crucifixion, burial and resurrection.
But discussions continue about how to ensure safety and continued worship during the most important festival in the Christian calendar, which Catholics celebrate on April 12 and Greek Orthodox a week later.
""I think that in this moment our community living in the Holy Sepulchre has the duty and the task to pray in this place for all those who are living around the world,” Patton told Reuters.
""We think that to pray is not something useless, we think that it is something that can really change the situation.""
The Holy Sepulchre lies at the heart of the Christian Quarter of Jerusalem's walled Old City. Its doors were shut to the public on March 25.
Patton said it would be impossible to carry out the annual Palm Sunday procession in Jerusalem on April 5 in anything like the normal manner, with thousands of pilgrims walking from the Mount of Olives to an Old City which now lies deserted.
But he said services could be filmed and livestreamed worldwide for those unable to attend, and held out hope that the bishops of each church would be able safely to mark the ""most important"" celebrations. 
These include Good Friday, Easter Sunday and the - usually - crowded Greek Orthodox ceremony of the Holy Fire, symbolizing the resurrection.
""We have to give to Caesar what is of Caesar and we have to give to God what is of God,"" said Patton. ""We respect what is the role and what is the duty of the public and civil power and in the same time we think that the different civil authorities have to respect what is the right of God.""
Israel has imposed a partial lockdown, with police and soldiers enforcing Ministry of Heath restrictions requiring people to stay near their homes. Religious leaders of other faiths have also taken precautions.
Islamic authorities last month suspended all Muslim prayers around Al-Aqsa Mosque on the hilltop compound known to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
At the Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews are allowed to pray in Jerusalem, up to 10 people are permitted to pray with worshippers keeping 2 meters apart. But the chief rabbi of the site instructed them not to kiss the stones.
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said it was too early to know the arrangements for upcoming religious holidays of all religions.

""It all depends on the health regulations,"" he said. ""If the situation is going to be the same with no public gatherings... nothing will be going on, not Passover, not Ramadan and not the Holy Fire ceremony. We will have to wait and see.""

202,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 12:13PM ET</span>",Turkey's prisoner release should not exclude political detainees: rights groups,"ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish academics, journalists and rights groups are demanding that a planned release of tens of thousands of prisoners to stem the spread of the coronavirus should not exclude inmates whose only crime, they say, has been to challenge the authorities.
President Tayyip Erdogan's AK Party proposed a bill on Tuesday that would temporarily free around 45,000 prisoners. A similar number would be released permanently under a separate part of the legislation aimed at reducing prison overcrowding.
The proposed bill does not cover those convicted of terrorism charges - potentially excluding many thousands of people caught up in a purge which followed a failed military coup against Erdogan in 2016.
""The state wants to release the ones who committed a crime against citizens while keeping the ones who questioned its authoritarianism behind bars,"" the campaigners said.
""When lives are at stake, there can be no discrimination based on beliefs or ideologies,"" they said in a statement signed by 281 people, including writers. 
Many prisoners were ""on the threshold of coronavirus catastrophe"" due to cramped conditions, they said.
Turkey has arrested thousands of academics, lawyers, journalists, civil servants and members of the military it says were supporters of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, who it blames for the coup attempt. Gulen denies any involvement.
Many Kurdish activists and politicians the state says have links to the banned Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) are also in jail.
There are about 300,000 prisoners in Turkey's crowded jails. The government has been working on reforms to ease pressure on the system, and expanded its proposals in light of the growing coronavirus outbreak which has infected more than 13,000 people.
Omer Faruk Gergerlioglu, parliamentarian from the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), said some 50,000 people were convicted or in jail pending trial on terrorism charges, including members of the PKK and Gulen's network, as well as journalists and others jailed on what he said were ""thought crimes"".
Erdogan's government has defended the crackdown, saying it reflected the scale of the security challenges Turkey faced.
Gergerlioglu said a former mayor from the party, who was jailed last year, was released from prison and placed on house arrest on Tuesday after being diagnosed with coronavirus.
""The coronavirus outbreak has started spreading in prisons. There are still no serious measures. If mass deaths begin in prisons, it will be too late, even if the law passes,"" he said.

The Justice Ministry has said no cases have been determined in prisons and that necessary measures are being taken. Last week, prosecutors launched an investigation into Gergerlioglu after he said a prisoner had been diagnosed with the virus.

Conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Monday masks would soon be required in supermarkets and possibly later in public places in general, a cultural shift for a country that introduced a ban on face-coverings like Muslim veils 18 months ago in the wake of Europe's migration crisis.
Neighboring Slovakia and the Czech Republic, which have far fewer cases, have introduced a more sweeping measure, making face masks compulsory outside the home. Support for wearing masks in public appears to be rising across Europe.
""I believe he is right. Yes, Kurz is handling this correctly,"" a shopper at a Vienna supermarket who gave only her first name, Martina, said after putting on a free mask.
Austria borders Italy, one of the world's hardest-hit countries but moved earlier in its outbreak to shut down schools, bars and other gathering places. Its more than 10,000 cases have yet to overwhelm its health system, but Kurz says that could happen in two weeks. There have been 146 deaths so far.
The World Health Organization has questioned the use of an entire population wearing face masks to slow the coronavirus and said it can be counter-productive, since the wearer could infect themselves by putting it on or removing it incorrectly.
Kurz says the aim is to prevent the wearer coughing or sneezing on others and infecting them. The measure has been widely supported. The head of the opposition Social Democrats said masks should also be compulsory on public transport.
While the masks being handed out by supermarket chain Spar at its 1,500 locations in Austria resembled surgical masks and were easy to put on, national broadcaster ORF found staff at another chain had been given models that were difficult for any beginner to assemble.
""You have to put on one of these masks before you enter the supermarket. With all the good will in the world, I don't see how that is supposed to work, especially if it really is this model,"" ORF's reporter said after struggling to assemble a mask and then squeezing it over the top of his head.

Masks will be compulsory in supermarkets and drug stores of more than 400 square meters as of Monday.

MADRID (Reuters) - Hugo Rodriguez runs a Madrid pizza business. But he's shut most of his outlets, and geared up the only one still open to feed doctors and nurses who are working round the clock to keep Spain's coronavirus crisis in check.
Spain went into lockdown on March 14, and the Grosso Napoletano chain that he co-founded began delivering to hospitals a few days later. Since rebranded Food4Heroes, the initiative he launched with that gesture is now established in several major cities.
""One time, I went to Gregorio Maranon hospital, and a single doctor came down,"" Rodriguez recalls of one of the first deliveries he made.
""He looked at me, crying. Neither of us will forget that moment. It was like we were hugging,"" Rodriguez recalled. ""It's meant a great deal to me; I feel we business people have a responsibility.""
Spain's medics are on the global frontline of the pandemic. The virus has killed more than 9,000 in the country - only Italy's death toll is higher - and confirmed cases have risen above 100,000.
The around 40 pizzas Rodriguez now makes free of charge for medical staff every day are delivered by volunteer couriers including Jose Maria Carrero Castano.
""I'm not doing much compared to (healthcare staff),"" said the 30-year old, who has swapped delivering parcels for taking food to hospitals, full time. ""We try to raise their spirits a bit, make them feel supported.""
With Spain's bars and restaurants all closed to customers due to the lockdown, Food4Heroes has drawn support from brands including Aloha Poke, Papa John's, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Danone and now also operates in Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and Malaga.
In Madrid, participating restaurants, cafes, caterers and couriers are divided into five groups, with the public postal service - Carrero Castano's employer - providing vans and fuel.
Deliveries are contact-free, and companies supply masks, gloves, and sanitizer to volunteers. 
Grosso Napoletano chef Flavio Russo moved to Spain two years ago from Naples. His family there worry about the situation in Madrid, which has been hit hard by the epidemic.
""My mother would prefer it if I came back,"" said Russo, who is staying put, and working seven days a week and longer-than-usual hours to keep up with demand.
""Each one of us brings our little grain of sand,"" Rodriguez said. ""Our chefs pick the toppings of medics' pizzas as they prepare them. People have asked if they can donate homemade cakes.""

""There's this very lovely feeling that everyone forgets who they are... and works together to get out of this as soon as possible.""

A total of 3,600 companies have applied for government support to pay a proportion of salaries for 76,000 workers whose jobs have been temporarily suspended as a result of the coronavirus crisis, the prime minister said.
President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa is expected to decide later on Wednesday whether to extend a state of emergency, declared on March 18, which restricted non-essential travel and led thousands of businesses to close their doors.
Costa said this week he expected the president to extend the state of emergency, as health authorities predict the number of cases in the country, where infections and death toll are way below those in neighboring Spain, will plateau at the end of May.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - The United States criticized on Wednesday a move by Kosovo making it harder for Serbians to enter the country, despite its removal of 100% tariffs on goods produced by its neighbor.
Under pressure from the European Union and the U.S., which last month halted $50 million in economic aid to Kosovo, prime minister Albin Kurti said the tariffs would be removed from April 1, with an evaluation of the situation on June 15.
But trucks and cars with Serbian license plates will now need temporary ones to enter Kosovo, Serbians will need a special permit as their documents will not be recognized and all trade documents should treat Kosovo as an independent country.
The U.S. Embassy in Kosovo said it opposed the new measures because they will create more problems.
""Kosovo should drop all tariffs and not create new barriers because these policies hurt the people of Kosovo and strangle Kosovo's own economy,"" it said in a statement. 
Kosovo introduced the tariffs in 2018 after Serbia blocked its former province's membership of international organizations including Interpol and UNESCO, prompting Belgrade to walk out of EU-mediated talks with Pristina aimed at normalizing relations.
The measures reciprocate those applied in Serbia to travelers from Kosovo, a country Belgrade still considers part of its territory having refused to recognize its independence.
Marko Djuric, head of the Serbian government office on Kosovo, said the new restrictions were unacceptable.
""(The measures) are distancing us from the normalization process and creating obstacles for the people and the economy to function properly on a day-to-day basis,"" Djuric told Reuters.
The European Union welcomed the removal of import tariffs with High Representative Josep Borrell Fontelles saying ""regional cooperation is key, as is maintaining flow of goods, in particular in times of crisis"".
The new measures introduced by Kurti have, however, angered his coalition partner, leading to the government losing a confidence motion in parliament last week.
Kosovo also said it would lift tariffs on goods from Bosnia and Herzegovina.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - NATO will speed up deliveries of medical aid to allies suffering the most from the coronavirus but must focus on defending Europe, the alliance's chief said, after large Russian war games that were seen by allies as a signal from Moscow.
NATO foreign ministers are set to discuss aid measures on Thursday via video conference, a first for an alliance ministerial, after countries such as Turkey and the Czech Republic began delivering supplies to Italy and Spain.
""We are mobilizing support from allies with spare capacity to help those in desperate need,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg told Reuters in an interview, saying a Turkish plane will deliver medical equipment to Spain and Italy on Wednesday.
""We will look into how we can step up and speed up our efforts,"" said Stoltenberg, who has suspended travel, works from home when possible and occasionally wears a protective mask.
However, Stoltenberg cautioned that NATO's main task was the protection of allied territory. He said the alliance had been notified by Russia at the end of March of large-scale exercises.
NATO diplomats put the number of troops involved at 82,000.
""What we see, despite the fact that Russia has called for a cessation of exercises, we observe that their military activities remain at normal seasonal levels,"" Stoltenberg said. 
Stoltenberg said the alliance had noted a ""significant Russian naval presence"" in the North Sea and a large, last-minute military exercise in late March, which NATO took as a show of force despite the coronavirus outbreak. 
""Moscow provided a notification that they were going to have a snap exercise, which they said was intended to test their capabilities to provide military support to the civil response to the COVID-19 outbreak,"" Stoltenberg said.
The Russian Defence Ministry said in a statement that the drills, carried out from March 25-28, would include medical units and nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops.
""But we actually judge that this exercise was also used to demonstrate to NATO that they remain combat-ready despite COVID-19,"" he said.
NATO is scaling down military exercises in Europe to curb the spread of the coronavirus, including its Defender Europe 20 exercises, billed as NATO's biggest war games in Europe since the Cold War. Alliance missions are continuing. 
Keeping the coronavirus from spreading through militaries is a major concern, and NATO has seen personnel infected, taking measures across all its operations, including regularly taking the temperatures of its personnel, officials have said. 

""I am absolutely certain that NATO will continue to deliver deterrence and defense,"" Stoltenberg said.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Charles, who has recovered after testing positive for coronavirus, praised the selfless devotion of healthcare workers on Wednesday and said it was a strange and distressing time for the nation.
Heir-to-the-throne Charles, 71, came out of self-isolation on Monday after suffering what he said were ""luckily ... relatively mild symptoms"" and his office said he was now in good health. 
Britain is in a state of virtual lockdown, with the public told they must stay at home other than for essential trips, such as to buy food. 
In a video address, the prince said although he had recovered, he was still in a state of social distance and general isolation. His wife Camilla, 72, who had tested negative, is remaining in self-isolation until the end of the week in case she develops symptoms.
""As we are all learning, this is a strange, frustrating and often distressing experience when the presence of family and friends is no longer possible and the normal structures of life are suddenly removed,"" he said.
The number of coronavirus deaths in Britain rose by 27% to 1,789 people, official figures on Tuesday showed, with one of the victims a 13-year-old boy with no apparent underlying health conditions.
""At such an unprecedented and anxious time in all our lives, my wife and I are thinking particularly of all those who have lost their loved ones in such very difficult and abnormal circumstances, and of those having to endure sickness, isolation and loneliness,"" Charles said from his home in Scotland.
The prince's mother, 93-year-old Queen Elizabeth, is currently with her husband Prince Philip, 98, at her Windsor Castle home, west of London. Buckingham Palace has said she too is in good health.
Charles also paid tribute to doctors, nurses and other staff on the front line in the National Health Service, whom he said were under enormous strain and risk, adding their ""utter, selfless devotion to duty"" made the nation proud.
It was essential, he added, that these key workers were treated with special consideration when trying to do their shopping, and also singled out store staff for praise for keeping shelves stocked.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - In February, an Iraqi militia commander trained by Iran took over the empty office of his slain superior, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, killed weeks before alongside Iranian military mastermind Qassem Soleimani in a U.S. drone strike.
Many pro-Iran militiamen hoped this was the answer to their problems: the experienced commander Abdul Aziz al-Mohammedawi might replace Muhandis as overall leader of Iraq's paramilitary groups, scattered after the killing of their two mentors.
Instead, it has led to new splits.
Factions refused to recognize Mohammedawi, known by his nom de guerre Abu Fadak, as commander of Iraq's militia umbrella grouping, the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF). Even within his own group, Kataib Hezbollah, some oppose him taking on that mantle, according to militia insiders.
The deaths of Soleimani and Muhandis in January challenged Iran-backed militias in Iraq, where the United States wants to reverse the influence of its regional foe Tehran.
Now, sources in the Iran-backed factions of the PMF and commanders in groups less close to Tehran describe growing fractures over leadership and reduced Iranian funds, thwarting attempts to unite in the face of adversity.
The rifts are accelerating a retreat from the political arena, where militia leaders who once controlled government jobs and parliament seats are in hiding for fear of assassination by the United States and confront anti-Iran dissent on the streets. They face the installing of a U.S.-aligned prime minister who signals he would check the dominance of Iran's proxy groups.
Bruised, the militias have stepped up attacks on U.S.-led forces in Iraq. Western military and diplomatic officials say this raises the prospect of a U.S.-Iran escalation Baghdad will be powerless to stop.
The focal point for the splits has been leadership of the PMF, which was formed to fight Islamic State after Iraq's top Shi'ite Muslim cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani called all able bodied men to take up arms against the Sunni militants.
The state-funded PMF comprises dozens of mostly Shi'ite militias with different loyalties but is dominated by powerful factions who take their orders from Iran, including Muhandis's Kataib Hezbollah, the Badr Organization, Nujaba and others.
Soleimani held ultimate authority over Iraq's toughest Shi'ite militias. But for those groups, loss of PMF military chief Muhandis, a rare unifying figure, was more significant.
GROWING DIVISIONS
Kataib Hezbollah in February announced Mohammedawi would be PMF military chief. Mohammedawi now works in Muhandis's old office in Baghdad, according to a senior militia source. He requested anonymity to talk about splits among paramilitaries.
""This created divisions, including within Kataib,"" the source said.
He and two other militia officials described shifting alliances, including within two pro-Iran groups. They said the splits were over both Muhandis's succession and where Iranian funds should go – into military action or political influence.
""One camp in Kataib is led by Abu Fadak. Another opposes him taking over the PMF,"" the first source said. ""In Badr, there's a wing that supports him and was closer to Muhandis – and another that doesn't, the political wing.""
The sources did not provide details on reduced funding from Iran, which is being hit hard by coronavirus and U.S. sanctions.
A PMF spokesman could not immediately be reached to comment.
The divisions mean groups are beginning to stage attacks on their own, without consulting each other, the militia sources said.
""Not everybody agreed Taji military base should be targeted,"" one official said, referring to an attack that killed two U.S. troops and a British soldier in March. ""Some groups just operate without consulting the PMF chain of command.""
The militia sources report an additional PMF split.
Several factions closer to Sistani, who oppose Iran's hegemony over the PMF, publicly rejected Mohammedawi taking over in February in a rare show of defiance of the pro-Iran camp.
Their commanders said they have since agreed in principle with the defense ministry to integrate into the military, a move that would clearly separate them from Iran-backed factions. A source close to Sistani confirmed his office had blessed the move.
POLITICAL WEAKNESS
Pro-Iran militias worry.
""If Sistani is backing this maybe 70 percent of lower-ranking fighters in all groups might follow - they joined up only because of his edict,"" the first militia source said.
None of those moves can be official until a new government is in place. But lawmakers and government officials say it is likely the designated prime minister, Adnan al-Zurfi, will be approved this month - a result of pro-Iran militia weakness.
""Before, the Iran-backed groups and politicians were able to get their choice of prime minister,"" one lawmaker from Iraq's biggest parliamentary bloc said, declining to be named.
""Now, they can't even agree among themselves who they want for the post,"" he said, adding many favoured Zurfi for the job.
President Barham Salih last month designated Zurfi, who is opposed by Iran-backed militia commanders. He has signaled he would come down hard on the factions, posting on Twitter in March that the PMF's ""loyalty will be to Iraq, and Iraqis"".

Iran-backed militias will not go quietly. Kataib Hezbollah warned last week it would fight any force cooperating with Washington in attacking militias.

212,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 07:26AM ET</span>","In Taiwan, anger at China over virus drives identity debate","By Ben Blanchard
TAIPEI (Reuters) - Anger at being confused with China amid the coronavirus outbreak and Beijing's stepped-up efforts to assert sovereignty is stirring heated debate in Taiwan about how to further distance itself from its giant and often threatening neighbour.
At its core is a debate about whether to drop ""China"" from the island's official name, the Republic of China. 
During the virus crisis, the World Health Organization (WHO), which considers the island part of China, has listed Taiwan's far lower case number under China's, and China has repeatedly insisted only it has the right to speak for Taiwan on the global stage, including about health issues.
Taipei says this has confused countries and led them to impose the same restrictions on Taiwanese travellers as on Chinese, and has minimised Taiwan's own successful efforts to control the virus.
Taiwan has been debating for years who it is and what exactly its relationship should be with China - including the island's name. But the pandemic has shot the issue back into the spotlight.
Lin I-chin, a legislator for the ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), said in parliament last month that Taiwan should change its English name to ""Republic of Chunghwa"", an English rendering of the word Taiwan uses for China in its name.
""Taiwan has been brought to grief by China,"" she said.
On Sunday, the New Power Party, one of Taiwan's smaller opposition groups, released the results of a survey in which almost three-quarters of respondents said Taiwan passports should only have the word ""Taiwan"" on them, removing any reference to China.
""During this epidemic period, our people have been misunderstood by other countries, highlighting the urgency of changing the English name,"" it said in a statement.
Taiwan's Foreign Ministry has given a cautious response to the passport idea, noting that according to the constitution, the official name is Republic of China and that the word Taiwan was already added to passport covers in 2003.
""In the future, if there is consensus between the ruling and opposition parties on this new name, the Foreign Ministry shall cooperate in handling it,"" spokeswoman Joanne Ou said.
But the government is wary of a name change for Taiwan, saying there is no consensus for such a radical move.
Although the DPP supports the island's independence - theoretically meaning the official formation of a Republic of Taiwan - President Tsai Ing-wen says there is no need to do so, as the island is already an independent country called the Republic of China. She often refers to the island as the Republic of China, Taiwan. 
'REPUBLIC OF TAIWAN' 
Premier Su Tseng-chang has said changing the island's name isn't the most urgent issue facing Taiwan.
""If we want to change then it might as well be to 'Republic of Taiwan'. Taiwan is more well known,"" Su said in parliament. ""But if there's no national consensus, a name change isn't the most important thing for now.""
Taiwan's official name is a throwback to when the Kuomintang party fled to the island after losing the Chinese civil war to the Communists in 1949, and continued to claim to be China's legitimate government.
""The Republic of China is a country, Taiwan is not,"" Chen Yu-jen, a Kuomintang legislator from the island of Kinmen, which sits just offshore from the Chinese city of Xiamen, told parliament on Monday.
The statement drew a sharp rebuke from Su, who told reporters it meant Chen had no right to be a member of the legislature. Chen said she was simply stating the facts, and that Taiwan is a geographic name, not a national name.
China's pressure on Taiwan diplomatically and militarily during the virus crisis has also reduced Beijing's already low standing in the eyes of many Taiwanese. 
A March poll commissioned by Taiwan's China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council and carried out by Taipei's National Chengchi University showed more than three-quarters of respondents believed China's government was unfriendly to Taiwan's, the highest level in a decade. 

Any name change would infuriate China, which has a law mandating the use of force to stop Taiwan independence.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Life in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged, is slowly returning to normal as the government relaxes a more than two-month-old lockdown that cut the city off from the world and kept most of its 11 million residents at home.
Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, was once the epicentre of the now global pandemic and was subjected to the strictest curbs on movement and business.
The virus is believed to have emerged from a seafood market in Wuhan last year and the city accounted for about two-thirds of China's total number of infections. New cases, however, have declined dramatically in the city and the rest of the country, prompting the easing of curbs that have been in place since Jan 23.
Reuters asked several Wuhan residents to share their experiences with the millions of people across the globe now in some form of lockdown or isolation.
Their advice? Stay united, stay indoors and ""add oil"", a Chinese saying that means stay strong. 
MU ZI, TAXI DRIVER 
""In the beginning, I was quite scared because my job involves meeting lots of people, so I went home and quarantined myself.
""After the government measures to control the epidemic started to work in February, I became more relaxed and in a better mood. And since my housing compound has had no cases, they've started allowing us to go out.
""The situation overseas, especially in Italy, really makes my heart ache. I hope that overseas coronavirus patients will be able to overcome this.""
DING FAN, 27, EMPLOYEE
""In the beginning I was pretty scared, because the week after the lockdown was when the infections in Wuhan peaked, and the numbers published every day made me very sad.
""I wasn't used to being at home and I would feel very anxious because everyone was very nervous; you'd open the windows to look outside and it would be completely empty, you wouldn't even see a shadow. It felt very miserable and not like my home, a city usually bustling with life.""
""We live in the same world, and we need to work hard together to defeat this illness. Everyone should go out less, stay at home to read books, watch television and play games with the family.""
ZHANG JIANJUN, 33, WORKS IN PROPERTY PLANNING
""You have to stay hopeful, limit contact with others, reduce visits to crowded places. These are the only way you can protect yourself and your family.""
HU YONG, 40, DISINFECTANT SPRAYER 
""I've been working as a volunteer and recently joined a disinfectant company to spray shops and streets. This epidemic has made me feel that we Chinese are really strong.
""As someone who has lived through this, I would like to tell everyone don't panic, you have to adjust your state of mind. Secondly make sure you take precautions, like washing your hands, ensuring good ventilation and exercising regularly.""
GENG YI, HOTEL STAFF
""I have seen how medical workers have helped Wuhan. We are very grateful.
""Now that it feels like we're close to victory, I would like to tell the world's citizens 'add oil', keep going! Let's work hard together and I'm sure everyone will beat this.""
YUAN YANZHONG, 59, RETIREE
""I am a Wuhan native. Since the city's lockdown, I haven't left the house. In the beginning, I was quite panicked, because this epidemic is very severe.
""I had stocked up on some essential goods before the Lunar New Year holiday, later my neighbourhood set up a group-buying chat group so we could buy food that would be delivered in bulk. Life wasn't easy but staying at home was more safe.
""Based on the Wuhan experience, a good way to beat this is to stay at home, don't go out, limit contact, bore this virus to death by staying at home. This is the best solution."" 
YANG YUANFANG, 39, COMMUNITY VOLUNTEER WORKER
""My aunt was diagnosed as having the virus on Jan. 22 and then slowly her family got infected. At the time they received a lot of help from the community.
""I chose to volunteer because I found it very difficult to just stay on the sidelines. The situation made me very emotional. Wuhan is my home.
""This virus is very scary. To fight it we need to keep a positive attitude and be united.""
QIU XIAOYING, 72, SHOPOWNER
""We basically didn't go out and didn't visit other people's houses. Everything stopped. We didn't even visit our relatives or have meals together during the Lunar New Year holiday.""
""If we in China can overcome this epidemic, other countries can definitely triumph over their difficulties. You have to rely on your willpower, figure out ways to make it retreat, learn from China to have a responsible attitude, don't take the virus lightly and don't go out on the streets without masks.""

Calls increased by 12.4% in the first two weeks of the lockdown compared to the same fortnight last year, while online consultations of the helpline's website grew by 270%, the Equality Ministry said.
Spain, like many other nations, has introduced stringent curbs on people's free movement outside the home to help halt the spread of coronavirus. Spain is among the countries worst affected by the pandemic, with 9,053 deaths as of Wednesday.
Worried about a rise in violence against women as people are stuck at home and can only go out to buy groceries, visit the pharmacy or, in some cases, to work, the government has started a new campaign encouraging women to call the helpline.
""We're here for you,"" said one poster with the helpline's number 016.
While most workers need to stay at home, the government said all services to help women victims of domestic violence would remain open.
It also said on Tuesday that victims of gender violence and their children would be housed in hotels if there is no room at the centers where they can normally stay in an emergency.
Spain's coronavirus lockdown started on March 14.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - With life in most of the United States grinding to a halt and the economy set to tip into a recession or worse, Americans appear to have no appetite for April Fools' Day this year. 
By tradition, pranksters stretch the limits of believability on April 1, creating fictitious news stories or products, often on social media, in the hopes of tricking the gullible and generating laughs. 
But this year, many social media users are calling for would-be hoaxers to skip the jokes, no matter how good-natured.
""I am 110% on board with having a moratorium on April Fool's Day this year,"" wrote Twitter user Mike Draco of San Francisco. ""Read the room.""
Twitter on Tuesday was flooded with tweets calling for others to set aside pranks as the world grapples with the severity of the coronavirus outbreak.
""Just FYI, April Fool's Day is cancelled! We've experienced enough trauma already,"" wrote D'Errah Scott of Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
Others feared that the deadly viral pandemic could become fodder for ill-advised attempts at humor. 
""Pro tip for someone thinking about making a Coronavirus joke on April Fool's: Do not do it,"" tweeted Andrew Streeter of San Antonio, Texas.
Even Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), a devoted April 1 corporate jokester for more than a decade, has pledged to skip this year's gag, in part to live up to its vow to provide accurate information about COVID-19 as the illness tightens its fatal grip on the country. 
Google told its employees it would hold off on the fun until 2021, according to an internal memo to company managers first reported by Business Insider.
""Make sure your teams pause on any jokes they may have planned - internally or externally,"" the memo was quoted as saying. 
""Our highest goal right now is to be helpful to people, so let's save the jokes for next April, which will undoubtedly be a whole lot brighter than this one,"" the memo said, according to the report. 
Mental health professionals agree that humor is essential for maintaining perspective and hope during a crisis, but they suggest a kinder, gentler form of wit than the typical April 1 hoax.
""Do the opposite on April Fools' Day and be good to each other and calming rather than goofing on each other,"" said psychologist Randy Kamen, who treats patients in New York and in Martha's Vineyard, Massachusetts.
""We are fragile right now. To be giving each other misinformation and 'I was just kidding,' we already don't know what to believe. It's like every day is April Fools' Day, so why add to the out-of-control situation?"" she said.
Ross Polly, a software developer from Waukee, Iowa, said he would refrain from his usual April Fools' Day activities, which typically involve interacting with online ""joke"" news posts, as well as in-person pranks.

""Who are you going to prank? The people you're going to be stuck in social isolation with the next few weeks or months? Not a time to make enemies,"" Polly told Reuters.

216,By Reuters,"<span>Apr 01, 2020 05:30AM ET</span>",India likely to soon ease some drug export curbs after U.S. pressure - sources,"By Neha Dasgupta
NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will likely relax some export restrictions on pharmaceutical products soon due to intense pressure from the United States which is worried about drug shortages as the number of coronavirus cases surge, two Indian government officials told Reuters.
India, which supplies more than a quarter of the world's generic drugs, last month restricted exports of 26 pharmaceutical ingredients and the medicines made from them. The move was seen as an attempt to secure supplies for its domestic population after the outbreak played havoc with the industry's supply chain globally.
The restrictions are not complete bans but impede sales of drug and drug ingredients overseas by specifying circumstances for their export and requiring firms to procure a ""no objection"" certificate from the government.
An easing of those restrictions will probably come within two days and will likely include Paracetamol, a common pain reliever also known as acetaminophen, the government officials in New Delhi said.
""There is so much (U.S.) pressure on the government. For U.S. what matters is Paracetamol, it matters to them significantly,"" said one official, adding that India had adequate stock of the drug for domestic use for at least four months. 
The restrictions will be lifted for all countries, the officials said, but it was not immediately clear exactly how many drugs formulations would be exempted.
Both officials declined to be identified due to the sensitive nature of the discussions. India's commerce ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.S. government said in a statement on Tuesday that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had spoken with India's foreign minister and sought cooperation in strengthening global pharma manufacturing and supply chains, but gave no further details.
President Donald Trump has warned Americans of a ""painful"" two weeks ahead in fighting the virus. Nearly 3,900 people have died in the United States, and the total confirmed U.S. cases has risen to 187,000.
Imports from India accounted for 24% of medicines and 31% of medicine ingredients to the United States in 2018, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
India was, however, unlikely to ease a ban on the export of malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, which came in addition to the restrictions on the 26 drugs and formulations. The drug is being tested to see if it is effective in treating patients with COVID-19.

The United States' Health and Human Services has listed hydroxychloroquine as a medical resource that was subject to hoarding prevention measures.

MOGADISHU (Reuters) - U.S. air strikes in Somalia killed two civilians and injured three in February, human rights watchdog Amnesty International said on Wednesday, in a statement that raised questions over U.S. investigations of such allegations. 
U.S. Africa Command said it was assessing the allegations and goes to great lengths to avoid civilian casualties. 
U.S. forces have been fighting a decade-long struggle against the al Qaeda-linked militant group al Shabaab. The insurgency wants to overthrow Somalia's shaky, internationally backed government and rule using its own strict interpretation of Islamic law.
Africa Command says air strikes are a key weapon against al Shabaab, but Amnesty says they also mistakenly target civilians. 
A U.S. airstrike in the town of Jilib on Feb. 2 hit a family having a meal, Amnesty said, killing 18-year old Nurto Kusow Omar Abukar, injuring her two younger sisters - aged 7 and 12 - and her 70-year-old grandmother. Amnesty cited an interview with the girls' father, who was present but uninjured in the strike. 
""He was very devastated, he didn't know why his family was targeted,"" Amnesty researcher Abdullahi Hassan told Reuters. ""He said, 'I'm now in my farm, alone in an open place, if they want to kill me.'"" 
Mohamed Omar Abukar, the son of the 70-year-old woman, told Reuters his family had been devastated by the strike. His youngest niece had come to the capital for medical treatment, he said. 
""She is OK and walking. My mum and my niece Fatuma ... are too seriously injured to be brought by car to Mogadishu,"" he said.
Another strike on Feb. 24 on the village of Kumbareere, about 10 kilometers north of Jilib, killed Mohamud Salad Mohamud, a 53-year-old father of eight who ran a banana farm and the local office for telecom company Hormuud, Amnesty said. Hormuud confirmed his death. 
Africa Command - also known as AFRICOM - issued statements after both strikes saying it had killed militants. 
""Following every airstrike, U.S. Africa Command conducts additional analysis to ensure the military objectives were met and that there were no civilian casualties,"" AFRICOM told Reuters in response to the allegations from Amnesty. 
""Our in-depth post-strike analysis relies on intelligence methods that are not available to non-military organizations, including Amnesty International ... The command’s civilian casualty allegation assessment process is precise, comprehensive, and led by a team of experts.""
Amnesty researcher Hassan said Africom should be more transparent about how it investigates allegations of civilian deaths. 
""They seem to be living in denial that the airstrikes actually kill civilians,"" he said.

Last year, Amnesty issued a report alleging 14 civilian deaths in five U.S. air strikes in 2017 and 2018. At the time, Africa Command rejected the report but later said a review found that two civilians had been killed in a 2018 strike.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - Lockdowns are slowly being lifted in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the coronavirus pandemic, but not fast enough for some residents, eager to get back to shopping for their own fresh groceries after weeks of living on delivered supplies.
Neighbourhoods in the city are still shut off by two-metre-tall plastic walls, set up early in the crisis to enforce social distancing and isolate communities. They also made residents wholly reliant on online deliveries.
In one neighbourhood, residents and traders are now doing business over the barriers. 
Shoppers stood on chairs on Wednesday to get a glimpse of the goods on sale on the other side, shouting down to vendors to check on prices, and then used payment apps on their mobile phones rather than risk grubby cash, to pick up groceries.
""It's safer for us to sell behind these barricades,"" the owner of a pork stall said.
White-board signs hung up on the barriers told shoppers what was for sale on the other side. Most listed vegetables, rice, oil and meat but one promised crayfish, a local delicacy.
Some supermarkets also reopened on Wednesday, with one attracting a long line of shoppers - everyone spaced 1.5 metres apart - that snaked around blocks. 
Some people wore raincoats or shower caps to ward off the virus. All wore masks and all seemed happy to finish with online shopping and delivered supplies.
""It wasn't fresh,"" said one 68-year-old man who gave his surname as Dong as he stood in the queue, referring to the groceries dropped off at his home by volunteers during the lockdown. ""They didn't look good, didn't taste nice.""
""If we go to the supermarket ourselves we'll have more choice."" 

Wuhan is preparing to lift its lockdown on April 8, when people in the city will be allowed to leave for the first time since Jan. 23.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters that controlling the virus that has raced across the world was a top priority. While Japan's some 2,200 cases and 66 deaths are dwarfed by numbers from the United States, Europe and China, new infections continue to set fresh daily records.
Coronavirus: Knowns and unknowns - https://reut.rs/2UHIgvz
Suga said the government would do ""whatever is needed"" to minimise the impact of the virus, including on the world's third-biggest economy - already teetering on the verge of recession - after a Bank of Japan poll showed the mood of the country's industrial manufacturers at its most pessimistic for seven years.
New virus infections in the capital rose to a daily record of 78 on Tuesday, for a total of over 500, amid calls for Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a state of emergency that would allow authorities to trigger a lockdown involving restrictions on movement that would be voluntary rather than legally binding. 
Abe is set to chair a meeting of his coronavirus task force on Wednesday evening. 
Japan first closed public schools at Abe's request from March 2. Though the Tokyo metropolitan government had previously said it was planning to re-open at least some schools when the new academic year began in April, public broadcaster NHK and other media said closures could now be extended until May. 
Tokyo's education board could meet as early as Wednesday to discuss the plan, the Nikkei business daily said.
Tokyo governor Yuriko Koike, who requested that all city residents stay indoors last weekend and has also said people should stay out of restaurants and bars at night, told reporters on Wednesday she hoped a decision would be made promptly and repeated calls for vigilance.
""People are saying, 'I didn't think I would get infected myself'. I want everyone to share the awareness that one should both protect oneself while also avoiding spreading (the virus),"" she said.
Japanese leaders have repeatedly said that while the country is on the brink of a state of emergency, it was not yet at the stage of officially declaring one - comments reiterated by chief cabinet secretary Suga on Wednesday. ""This is an extremely important period,"" he said.
Calls for a lockdown were on the rise on social media, however, with many Twitter users expressing worry and comparing the situation overseas, where whole cities have come to a standstill while Tokyo's relatively business-as-usual stance persists.

""One of my friends, who works in Tokyo, is still commuting on packed trains,"" wrote a user under the Twitter handle Arikan. ""I'm a little embarrassed by how indecisive Japan is compared to other nations.""

The country was placed into a complete lockdown last Thursday, and a national emergency was declared, to beat the local transmission of COVID-19.
Offices and schools were shut and all non-essential services, bars, restaurants, cafes, gyms, cinemas, pools, museums, libraries and playgrounds were closed.
The government on Wednesday said there were 61 new cases of COVID-19 in the past 24 hours taking the total to 708. 
The number of new COVID-19 cases was as high as 85 last week, but has stayed lower this week. More than half of the cases was related to overseas travel and community transmission cases were about 1%. 
""While on the face of it that might seem a heartening number relative to some of the other figures we have had now, I want to emphasize it's too early to assess if our measures are successfully slowing COVID-19,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a news conference.
Among all the confirmed cases, 82 people have recovered, and so far only one death has been recorded.
New Zealand, with about 5 million people, has fewer infections than many other countries, like neighbouring Australia, where the number of cases now exceeds 4,500 with 20 deaths.
Ardern has said she wants to see more testing as it was needed to stamp out the virus and guard against community transmission. 
""If virus is in the community in this way... then worst thing we can do is to relax and be complacent, and allow the silent spread,"" Ardern added.
QUANTUM SHOCK
Finance Minister Grant Robertson told a parliamentary committee earlier in the day that he expected a quantum economic shock from COVID-19 that would be greater than the global financial crisis. 
He said the treasury department was expecting unemployment rates to likely be worse than that of the global financial crisis where it peaked at 6.7%. The treasury said initial projections show unemployment could increase from between 5% to well into double digits, while GDP reductions could be anywhere between 10-17%.
Banks have forecasted unemployment rates to increase by up to 30%, Robertson told the committee.

He said the government will still be going ahead with the May release of its annual budget, but its focus would be different.

Amazon has denied wrongdoing in the matter, saying it fired the worker because he had put the safety of others at risk.
The dispute centers on a walkout by 15 workers on Monday at Amazon's warehouse in Staten Island, New York, amid concerns over reports of coronavirus cases among the facility's staff. 
The total number of workers at the warehouse was not immediately clear. 
De Blasio said he had ordered the city's commission on human rights to look into an allegation the worker was fired after raising health and safety concerns over the coronavirus outbreak.
""The allegation is because he spoke up for the safety of his fellow workers he was fired,"" de Blasio said at a media briefing on the coronavirus. ""If so, that would be a violation of our city human rights law. We would act on it immediately.""
The investigation concerns civil not criminal law.
Amazon has repeatedly denied the assertions of the warehouse worker, Christian Smalls, who organized Monday's protest.
Amazon, the world's largest online retailer, says Smalls did not adhere to the company's request that he stay at home for 14 days with pay because he had close contact with a person who had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. 
""Mr. Smalls received multiple warnings for violating social distancing guidelines and putting the safety of others at risk,"" Kristen Kish, a spokeswoman for the company, said in an emailed statement.
""This is unacceptable and we have terminated his employment as a result of these multiple safety issues.""
In a prior statement distributed by Athena, a labor and activist coalition, Smalls said he would continue to speak out ""until Amazon provides real protections for our health and safety.""

Letitia James, the New York Attorney General, had issued a statement on Monday calling the firing ""disgraceful"" and also asked the National Labor Relations Board to investigate.

WASHINGTON/PARIS (Reuters) - The Paris Club of creditor nations agreed on Tuesday to restructure Somalia's debt, including immediately canceling $1.4 billion owed by the impoverished Horn of Africa country.
Three decades of conflict have left Somalia all but cut off from the global financial system and relief from its debt is expected to open the way for new sources of financing for the country.
The decision, first reported by Reuters, cancels 67% of the debts owed to Paris Club creditors by Somalia. It came after more than nine hours of discussions by videoconference.
Somali Finance Minister Abdirahman Beileh called the decision a big step forward for his country, which is also grappling with the coronavirus outbreak and a recent desert locust swarm.
""We had very productive discussions with the Paris Club and we welcome their support in relieving Somalia of a substantial amount of its debt to them,"" Beileh told Reuters.
He said the Somali government would hold separate bilateral discussions with the creditors to finalize the process. He said his government would continue the economic reforms it had undertaken over the past eight years to enable the debt relief.
An official with the International Monetary Fund said several creditors were expected to grant Somalia additional debt relief on a bilateral basis, and it could eventually see 100% debt cancellation deals with some countries after it completes additional steps under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in about three years.
The IMF and the World Bank said last week that Somalia had taken the necessary steps https://www.reuters.com/article/us-somalia-debt/imf-world-bank-clear-somalia-for-debt-relief-normal-ties-to-world-idUSKBN21D05Q to begin receiving debt relief.
Several of Somalia’s Paris Club creditors, including the United States, the UK and Norway, as well as the World Bank and the IMF, urged Paris Club members to provide ""generous"" debt relief to Somalia during the negotiations on Tuesday, said one source familiar with the discussions.
Somalia is the 37th country to qualify for debt relief under the HIPC process.
In time, debt relief will help Somalia reduce its external debt to $557 million in net present value terms from $5.2 billion at the end of 2018, the IMF and the World Bank said.
The IMF last week also approved a new three-year $395 million financing arrangement for Somalia under its Extended Credit Facility (ECF) and Extended Fund Facility (EFF).

ROME (Reuters) - Italian health officials warned on Tuesday it was too soon to consider lifting lockdown restrictions, saying a deceleration in new cases of coronavirus should not raise hopes that the crisis was near an end.
The government announced on Monday that curbs on movement and business activities introduced nationwide on March 9 would stay in place until at least the Easter holidays in mid-April.
Politicians fear it will be hard to keep people penned up in their houses much beyond that date, especially as the daily medical bulletins start to improve, but doctors on the frontline of the fight against the disease urged caution.
""Today, official sources are suggesting that perhaps we can (lift restrictions) after Easter ... It seems to me highly unrealistic to think this nightmare will end by then,"" said Guido Marinoni, head of the doctors' association in Bergamo, the northern city at the epicenter of Italy's epidemic.
""If we let work resume (too soon), it will reignite the outbreak and the fire will return. This will cause devastating damage, not only for people but also for the whole economy,"" he told a group of foreign reporters.
After days of steep rises in cases, the data this week has suggested the pace of growth is slowing, with new infections coming in at 4,053 on Tuesday - some 1,200 less than the daily rate recorded a week ago. Deaths have remained largely steady at over 800 a day.
""The sacrifices and effort we have made are beginning to bear fruit,"" Giulio Gallera, the top health official in the northern region of Lombardy, told reporters, adding that there might be a gradual reopening after April 15.
In an effort to make the lockdown more bearable for families, the government said on Tuesday that parents would be allowed to take their children out for short walks around the block, although parks will remain closed.
SECTORS
Italy was the first Western country to introduce swingeing restrictions on movement after uncovering the outbreak almost six weeks ago. It has tightened them week by week, banning all but core strategic activities, while shuttering restaurants, most shops, schools and universities.
The fragile Italian economy is expected to be plunged into a deep recession by the virus, with investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) forecasting a contraction of 11.6%. This is putting huge pressure on the government to get business back up and running.
Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said on Tuesday that work restrictions would probably be lifted on a sector-by-sector basis, rather than on a geographical basis. 
""Things will have to be reopened in stages, when people's safety can be guaranteed. Today it is too early to do a timeline analysis. I think it will take a few more weeks before we get anywhere,"" he told Radio 24.
Urging against complacency, Silvio Brusaferro, the head of the national health institute ISS, said it was vital to reduce the rate of infection - the number of people each coronavirus sufferer themselves infect. 
At the start of the epidemic, the number was as high as four in Lombardy. It has now sunk to around one. 
""The ideal is to go to zero ... but reaching zero will be quite difficult until we get the vaccine,"" Brusaferro told a news conference, adding that in the meantime Italy needed to aim for a level of around 0.5, or below. 
However, it might take weeks to reach that point, making it hard for the government to reopen bars, cafes, cinemas and theaters where social distancing is difficult to patrol.
""We must avoid any measure that causes the curve (of cases) to climb again,"" said Brusaferro, adding that Italy was in a tough position because it was the first Western country to be hit by the virus so was plotting a path for others to follow.

""There are no studies or literature on this ... We are looking into scenarios that have never been taken before by countries that resemble Italy. Other nations are looking at us as a pilot program,"" he said.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Deise Geraldine is one of scores of Rio de Janeiro trash collectors who usually make their living by scavenging bottles and cans left by restaurants and bars at the curb. 
But with the coronavirus outbreak keeping consumers at home and shutting businesses, her cooperative of trash collectors has come a halt, and the members are struggling to put food on their tables. 
""When will I run out of diapers and milk for my children?,"" Geraldine asked from her home, which has a corrugated sheet for a roof and walls made of thin wood panels. 
""Because for us, we can handle without things, but children can't.""
Geraldine is a member of the Friends of the Environment Popular Cooperative (COOPAMA), a group of garbage collectors in Rio. It has almost 900 members who collect and sort the trash looking for items they can sell to recycling companies. Now, however, the COOPAMA facilities, once bustling, are empty. 
Brazil has over 4,500 coronavirus cases, more than any other country in Latin America, and its federal and state authorities are in a bitter fight over how to contain the virus. 
President Jair Bolsonaro does not believe in quarantines and has said that just as the disease can kill, so can hunger. Meanwhile, state authorities, including the Rio de Janeiro governor, have imposed quarantines in line with guidelines from international organizations. 
But those restrictions have come at a cost for the most vulnerable workers.
""This week, the staff has nothing left, no money to buy their food and maintain their expenses,"" said Luiz Carlos Fernandes, the cooperative's president. 
Jhonatan Ezequiel has been collecting trash for the cooperative for just four months. He is concerned about money, but health comes first. 

""I am very afraid of something infecting my family and seeing my family die and not being able to do anything,"" he said.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron pledged on Tuesday to make France self-sufficient in protective masks by year-end and learn lessons from the coronavirus emergency, firing back at growing criticism of his government over painful equipment shortages.
France has already ordered 1 billion masks to ease an acute shortage nationwide that has angered front-line healthcare officials and politicians as the coronavirus outbreak has swept across the country, killing at least 3,523 people. 
Speaking at a mask-producing factory on Tuesday, Macron said he had ordered a tripling of domestic mask production by the end of April to 10 million and production of 10,000 extra respirators by mid-May.
""The priority today is to produce more in Europe and France,"" Macron said at the Kolmi-Hopen factory near the western town of Angers.
""By the end of the year I want to us to be fully and completely independent (in production),"" he said, adding that 4 billion euros ($4.39 billion) had been set aside for the Public Health Authority to buy equipment.
The pandemic has triggered a massive surge in demand for protective gear in France and neighboring European countries including Italy and Spain, with the world's worst and second worst death tolls from the respiratory illness respectively.
China, where the virus originated and where countless factories were shut down to contain its spread, accounts for more than half the global production of masks, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). 
New mask producers like car parts maker Faurecia, tire maker  Michelin  (PA:MICP) and retailer Intermarché will also push total output to 15 million per week, Macron said.
The number of people in France infected with the virus rose to 52,128 on Tuesday, a 17% rise on the previous day. 
ROCKETING DEMAND FOR MASKS
In 2013, France's previous government took the decision to sharply reduce the number of face masks held in strategic reserve after a public outcry over the cost of bolstering stocks during the H1N1 bird flu crisis.
Mask consumption since the onset of the coronavirus crisis has soared from four million per week to more than 40 million, but the state's pre-crisis inventory of 140 million has proved insufficient as has the import of billions of masks.
Nowhere has the shortage been felt more than in hospitals and nursing homes where health professionals have criticized the government's slow reaction to the unfolding crisis.
Sarah, a nurse in a coronavirus wing of a Paris hospital, told Reuters on Tuesday that the lack of masks for staff, but also patients, was getting worse despite government pledges.
""Each patient should have their own mask, but we don't have enough to change them and some don't even have any. I had one (patient) who coughed on me and we didn't have any gel left either to disinfect,"" she said.
""What makes me angry is that we don't have the equipment to protect ourselves. Who will look after the patients when we fall sick?"" 
The management of the crisis, which has halt the economy and forced the government to lock down France until at least April 15, has also been condemned by opposition lawmakers.
Far-right National Rally leader Marine Le Pen said on Monday the government had lied about ""absolutely everything, without any exceptions"". Macron hit back on Tuesday.
""When we fight a battle, we must be united to win it and I think that all those who are already trying to hold trials when we have not won the war are irresponsible,"" he said. 

""The time will come for accountability.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - When the Chilean government announced a total quarantine last week for the wealthy eastern areas of capital Santiago where cases of coronavirus were most prevalent, Maria De Leon, a 31-year-old nanny, was presented with an unenviable choice. 
""My employer called me and told me that I had three options: one, that I go to live at work for three months with the same salary; two, that I only work 15 days a month for half the salary or three, that I say goodbye,"" she said.
When she tried to discuss the options further, her employer made the decision for her. 
""She fired me and now I'm home, with nothing in my pockets and in the midst of this quarantine,"" she said.
Across Latin America, where income inequality makes domestic workers more common than in more developed regions, the arrival of the coronavirus is forcing difficult decisions on those living most precariously, exposing holes in social safety nets.
In 2016, there were an estimated 18 million domestic workers in Latin America, more than nine out of 10 of them women, according to a report by the International Labour Organization. The vast majority of those workers were in the informal sector, without extensive labor rights, the ILO report found.
Chilean domestic workers unions say the ultimatum given to De Leon was not uncommon, as wealthier households across the country try to insulate themselves from the epidemic.
Luz Vidal, president of the Sintracap union which represents 500 domestic workers, said it had received many calls from colleagues presented with similar options. 
""People were being asked to move in with their employer but they also have to look after their own families,"" she said. 
""These women generally live on the lowest rungs of Chilean society and do not have much education. Their chances of finding new jobs are not high."" 
WHAT WOULD WE LIVE OFF?
In Brazil, Cleonice Gonçalves, a 63-year-old housekeeper, became the country's fifth fatality from coronavirus, which she allegedly contracted from her employer who had recently returned from vacation in Italy.
Her death sparked a public conversation about class and privilege in Brazil, Latin America's largest nation and its hardest hit so far, with nearly 4,700 confirmed cases and 165 deaths.
People affluent enough to travel abroad helped coronavirus get a foothold in Brazil, according to health officials, who worry it will swamp low-income communities where people do not have the kinds of work that allow them the luxury of staying in quarantine or access to the best healthcare.
In Bogota, Colombia, Duver Marin, who works as a cleaner, said it did not matter to him if authorities fined him for violating a quarantine announced two weeks ago. His priority was making sure his family could eat, he said.
""I would follow the quarantine order but then what will we live off?"" the 52-year-old told Reuters as he waited to board his bus last Thursday morning. He said he supports two children, a granddaughter, and his wife on his $200 minimum wage salary. 
In Chile, which has had over 2,700 confirmed cases and 12 deaths, the first people confirmed as having the virus were two doctors who traveled to Italy and Southeast Asia. The first deaths, however, were in poor Santiago suburbs. 
Middle-class Chileans have broadly observed an appeal for them to work from home by connecting to their jobs via computer but many nannies, housekeepers, gardeners and manual laborers have no option but to continue to show up for work, transiting the city by bus and metro.
There are at least 300,000 women working as ""nanas"" - as nannies and housekeepers are known in Chile - in private homes, according to Sintracap.
Yanneth, 55, a nanny, said she was relieved to move into her employers' comfortable home in Santiago's Lo Barnechea suburb rather than risking their health and those of her three adult daughters with whom she shares a tiny city-center apartment.
But Nancy Medel, 45, has not heard from her employer since last week, when she was told to stay home from her job as a childminder and bakery assistant. 
""My employer told me she didn't want me to bring the virus to infect her or her children,"" she said. 
""Now she is not answering my calls and I can't get to work. This isn't my fault, this is a global issue, but now I can't pay my bills or for my daughter's school."" 
Vidal said employers had a moral obligation to keep paying domestic workers or at least keep their jobs open, and the government needed to play a stronger part in ensuring people were treated fairly.
The Chilean government has promised bonuses for hard-hit families and negotiated delays on utility bills to avoid people being disconnected.
The life of a domestic worker in Latin America was portrayed in Alfonso Cuaron's Oscar-winning 2018 film ""Roma,"" set in Mexico City. In recent years, there has been a push across the region to defend and improve their rights.
Katherine Martorell, Chile's subsecretary for the prevention of crime, said last week that no one could be forced to stay in quarantine at their place of work. 

""It's up to the worker - if she doesn't live at her workplace she doesn't have to start, if she lives there and wants to leave and not go into quarantine there she can. The decision is absolutely hers.""

They voiced concern that disruptions to the movement of agricultural and food industry workers or food containers could result in the spoilage of perishables and increasing food waste and said protectionism was also a risk.

Such measures are particularly damaging to low-income, food-deficit countries and aid agencies' food procurement for those in desperate need, the joint statement said.

KABUL (Reuters) - A three-member Taliban team arrived in Kabul on Tuesday to begin a prisoner exchange process pivotal to starting talks between the insurgents and the government side to end Afghanistan's 18-year-old war.
The peace talks, known as the intra-Afghan dialogue, were envisaged in an agreement between the United States and the Taliban signed in Doha, which also stipulated an exchange of 6,000 prisoners held by the Afghan government and the Taliban. 
""Our three-member technical team will help the process of prisoners' release by identification of the prisoners, (and) their transportation,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters.
The prisoner release had been a sticking point, with the Taliban and the Afghan government differing over the process and timing of the exchange.
However, after weeks of back and forth, the process is set to begin with the arrival of the Taliban team, which will set up camp at a luxury hotel in Kabul.
""They are here now and we will begin our discussion; the prisoner release might go ahead in a few days if everything goes as planned,"" a senior Afghan government official told Reuters.
Mujahid said the Taliban team expected practical work to start in the next few days on a deal with the U.S.-backed government, to which the Taliban had previously refused to speak directly. 
The Taliban had planned to send a delegation of 10, Mujahid said, but it was reduced because of Afghanistan's coronavirus outbreak.
The talks also received a boost when the negotiating team appointed by the government was endorsed by Abdullah Abdullah, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's main political rival. 
""The formation of an inclusive negotiation team is an important step toward facilitating intra-Afghan negotiations,"" Abdullah said on Twitter. 
Differences between Ghani and Abdullah over the result of the 2019 presidential election have threatened to derail the peace process, raising concerns in Washington.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo termed Tuesday's developments ""good news"".
Pompeo last week flew to Kabul and the Qatari capital Doha, where the Taliban have an office, to urge all sides to move forward with the process, which at that point was deadlocked. 
""We've seen a (negotiating) team identified. Looks like it's pretty inclusive, pretty broad. We're happy about that,"" Pompeo told a news conference in Washington. 

""We've begun to see some work done on prisoner releases as well - all elements that have to come together so we can get to the inter-Afghan negotiations, which ultimately will prove to be the only mechanism that has any hope of delivering peace and reconciliation to the people,"" he said.

""Every voter, inkeeping with formal requirements, will be able to vote without having to personally go to a voting booth. The rules will only apply once, during the 2020 presidential elections,"" the draft legislation stated.

The government has not yet laid out its plans for physical polling stations.
Poland has confirmed 2,215 coronavirus cases and 32 deaths and on Tuesday told citizens to wear gloves while shopping, closed all parks and hotels and decreed that all minors will not be allowed to walk outside unaccompanied by adults.
Critics, including Poland's human rights commissioner Adam Bodnar, said elections could pose a threat to the health and safety of voters if held. Recent polls show a majority of Poles want the elections to be postponed.

Chamisa's deputy rejected the ruling and said it was an attempt by the government to usurp the party.
Chamisa, 42, narrowly lost the 2018 presidential vote to Emmerson Mnangagwa. He accused Mnangagwa of rigging the vote and does not recognize his presidency. 
He has refused to join political talks with the president over the country's economic crisis and ways to solve the intractable political disputes stemming from that election in the absence of a foreign mediator. 
The case against Chamisa was brought by a member of a rival faction of his MDC (Movement for Democratic Change). The court said the process that made Chamisa acting party president after Morgan Tsvangirai died in February 2018 was illegal and therefore null and void.
Police had already sealed off the MDC headquarters in Harare to prevent Chamisa's executives from entering the building.
The ruling could open the door to Chamisa's rival, Thokozani Khupe, who leads the smaller rival MDC faction and has been angling to take over the leadership of the larger MDC movement.
But political analysts said the ruling could be academic, with Chamisa still enjoying popular support from grassroots MDC members who elected him, unopposed, as their permanent leader at a congress last year.
""My position is that we as MDC we held our congress in May 2019. Nelson Chamisa is our president and our next congress is 2024. Full stop,"" MDC vice president Tendai Biti told reporters.
""The government is trying to usurp our party.""
Supporters of Chamisa accuse the ruling ZANU-PF party of using the courts to emasculate the MDC and to force him to accept Mnangagwa as legitimately elected.

Tuesday's ruling follows a similar judgment by a lower court last year when Chamisa was acting head of the party. Chamisa appealed against that ruling. He would have to raise constitutional issues with the Constitutional Court to appeal against this judgment.

Myanmar last week declared the Arakan Army a terrorist group after more than a year of intense fighting against the organization, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist ethnic Rakhine majority and seeks greater autonomy for the region.
The court in the second largest city, Mandalay, charged Nay Myo Lin, the editor-in-chief of Voice of Myanmar, under sections of the Terrorism Act for conducting the March 27 interview with the Arakan Army in which it responded to Myanmar's decision to label it as a terrorist group.
Nay Myo Lin's lawyer, Thein Than Oo, confirmed the charges, which can carry a life sentence, but told Reuters he did not have any more details. The journalist's wife, Zarni Mann, also confirmed to Reuters that her husband had been charged.
The Myanmar Times quoted Judge Kyaw Swa Lin as saying that Nay Myo Lin had been arrested over last week's interview. An Arakan Army spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Reuters was unable to contact the court to confirm the charges or to seek the reason they were brought. A government spokesman did not answer phone calls to request comment.
Myanmar’s communications ministry also said it had ordered mobile operators to block dozens of websites over ""fake news"". It did not publish a list of the blocked sites but several prominent outlets covering the conflict in Rakhine were inaccessible on Tuesday.
Myo Swe, an official from the Ministry of Transport and Communications, told Reuters that websites had been blocked ""because we received orders"", declining to elaborate.
""These websites are publishing fake news and news that can cause instability in the country,"" he said. Websites carrying pornography were also included in the ban, he said.
Norway's Telenor, one of four mobile operators in Myanmar, said in a statement that it had been ordered to block 221 websites and would comply, but added ""we do not, and should not, select or alter the content of communications in our channel"". 
Myanmar’s army has filed several cases in recent years against reporters and news organizations covering the conflict in Rakhine, where about 730,000 Rohingya Muslims fled a military crackdown in 2017.
Myanmar's army filed a criminal complaint against Reuters in early March over a story about the conflict in Rakhine. It later said it would withdraw the complaint at the request of the Myanmar Press Council and in the interest of good relations with the media.

The animals, who normally roam free on a nearby headland jutting out into the Irish Sea, have instead wandered into Llandudno where they have spent the past three days feasting on garden hedges and flowers.
Like other countries affected by the global coronavirus crisis, the United Kingdom has imposed strict social distancing measures including shop and school closures, and the authorities are asking everyone to stay at home except for essential travel.
With the streets of Llandudno unnaturally quiet, the goats have been free to wander the streets undisturbed.
Town councillor Carol Marubbi said the goats didn't normally come into town unless the weather was awful, but on this occasion she said they probably realized something unusual was going on because there were so few people around.
""I think they're probably feeling a bit lonely and they have come down to have a look around,"" she told Reuters by telephone.
Kashmir goats have lived on the Great Orem promontory near Llandudno since the days of Queen Victoria, when the species became popular in Britain due to a fashion for shawls made from their soft cashmere wool.
Marubbi said the herd of about 150 goats, some of whom had kids in February, were a well-known local attraction and most residents did not mind having their hedges nibbled by them.
""I'm a big fan,"" she said. ""I love them because they are characters.""
With millions of people stuck at home sharing light-hearted content online to alleviate the tedium of the lockdown, images and video of the goats roving around the streets were a hit on social media, with #goats and #Llandudno trending on Twitter.
""Just love this. Looks like they are definitely in charge,"" wrote Welsh Twitter user Sue Foster, a former primary school heart-ache.

LA PAZ (Reuters) - A former Bolivian interior minister known as ""Minister for Cocaine"" for his role in turning the impoverished nation into a narco-state during a military dictatorship in the 1980s has died after decades in prison, local media said on Tuesday, citing a Bolivian government minister. 
Luis Arce Gomez, reported by local media to be 82, was interior minister in the Andean nation's 1980-81 dictatorship of General Luis Garcia Meza. He was accused of presiding over the deaths and disappearances of more than 100 political prisoners, as well as the detentions of 4,000 more who alleged human rights abuses. 
Arce Gomez famously warned foes of the regime to ""walk around with their wills tucked under their arms"" and recruited the Nazi Klaus Barbie, the ""Butcher of Lyon"" who fled to Bolivia after the World War Two, as an adviser. 
Arce Gomez served 20 years in a U.S. prison for drug trafficking before being deported to Bolivia in 2009 to serve a 30-year sentence for a conviction in absentia of genocide and political assassinations. 
Bolivian Police Minister Javier Issa told local newspaper Los Tiempos that Arce Gomez, who suffered from diabetes, poor kidney function and hypertension, was transferred to a hospital on March 22 and died on Monday afternoon of generalized septic shock. He said the state would assist with burial preparations.

""We're starting to see glimmers that that is actually having some dampening effect,"" National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci told CNN in an interview. ""But that does not take away from the seriousness ... We clearly are seeing cases going up.""
Fauci's comments came after the United States endured its deadliest day yet on Monday with 575 coronavirus-related fatalities. U.S. officials want to build hundreds of temporary hospitals across the country as existing medical centers have come under siege from the coronavirus outbreak.
The number of U.S. dead has now climbed past 3,000, more than the number who died in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, as confirmed cases of COVID-19 infections rose to more than 163,000, according to a Reuters tally of official U.S. statistics. 
Fauci cautioned that, while stay-at-home restrictions were starting to produce some results, Americans remained at risk.
""We clearly are seeing cases going up. People in New York
are in a difficult situation,"" he said. ""We are still in a very difficult situation. We hope and I believe it will happen, that we may start seeing it turn around, but we haven't seen it yet.

""We really have to hang in there and abide by the mitigation strategies. We do believe it's working.""

It was spring cleaning again at the wall on Tuesday. But this time, the rite was held with precautions against coronavirus infection in place.
Workers in hazmat suits and gas masks sprayed sanitizer on the wall's ancient stones while others held onto their sticks with gloves as they extracted the paper notes left in ""God's mailbox"".
Religious authorities also operate a service in which people can email their prayers for placement between the stones.
One would-be worshipper, who stepped up to the wall and kissed it, was removed by police, a day after Israel tightened public prayer restrictions.
The Rabbi of the Western Wall, Shmuel Rabinowitz, who oversees the collection of the notes to ensure there's always room for more, offered a prayer for salvation ""from this difficult virus that has attacked the world"".
The papers were placed into bags for ritual burial on Jerusalem's Mount of Olives. A short distance away from the Western Wall, al-Aqsa mosque was also being sanitized.

The Western Wall is a remnant of the compound of the Second Temple that was destroyed in 70 AD. It stands today beneath a religious plaza revered by Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary and by Jews as the Temple Mount.

""Unlike other organizations, we cannot just run down our operations, our animals must be fed and looked after,"" said Joerg Junhold, president of the Association of Zoos, which has 56 members in Germany plus a few in Switzerland and Austria. 
Zoo costs are as high as ever but with no visitors allowed, there is zero income, said Junhold, meaning some bigger zoos were dealing with weekly losses of about half a million euros.
Berlin Zoo Director Andreas Knieriem said he had been overwhelmed by local support in the German capital but stressed that challenges were enormous.
""I am crossing my fingers that we will all soon have survived this difficult time,"" Knieriem said.
On top of the financial problems, keepers at Berlin Zoo have also said some of its animals are missing visitors.
""The monkeys really enjoy watching people,"" zoo spokeswoman Philine Hachmeister was quoted by the Maerkische Onlinezeitung as saying, adding seals and parrots were also stimulated by interaction with the visitors. 

""It is a bit boring for them at the moment,"" she said.

NIJMEGEN, Netherlands (Reuters) - While most of the Netherlands struggles through the coronavirus lockdown, marijuana smokers received the welcome news that ""coffee shops"" selling the drug have reopened for takeaway orders.
All businesses selling cannabis and hashish were ordered to shut, along with sex clubs and saunas, when the Dutch government imposed on March 15 measures to curb the COVID-19 epidemic.
A limited reopening has been allowed to avoid black market drug deals and ensure supplies of medicinal cannabis. With coronavirus regulations prohibiting gatherings of people, however, buyers are no longer permitted to stay for a smoke.
""What we saw is that people rushed to the coffee shops to buy something,"" Nijmegen Mayor Hubert Bruls said in an interview.
""We decided the next day, along with the government, that people can at least pick something up.""
Bruls said Dutch authorities wanted to avoid driving the sales underground to an unregulated black market. 
""It's a choice between two evils because you can say 'close the coffee shop' but then we know one thing for sure, that the illegal trade will come back.""
At the Jetset coffee shop in the eastern town of Nijmegen, safety precautions have been introduced to protect buyers and sellers from possibly infecting each other.
""We can refuse entry to coughers and sneezers"" and ""Hand sanitizer required on entry"" signs outside read.
“We have a whole bunch of people using it for medicinal purposes: pain relievers, people with multiple sclerosis, people with chemotherapy who really benefit from it,"" said Stan Esmeijer, owner of the Kronkel coffee shop next door to Jetset.
""It also gives a bit of relaxation. Especially in these times, it's nice that you also have moments when you can relax. One person uses a drink for that and the other a joint,” he said.

The Netherlands allows the sale of small quantities of cannabis in a policy aimed at managing crime and health risks. Usage rates are far lower than in many other countries.

The extension will apply to about 2,800 doctors, nurses and paramedics working in the stretched National Health Service (NHS) whose visas were due to expire before Oct. 1, and the measure will also include their family members.
""Doctors, nurses and paramedics from all over the world are playing a leading role in the NHS’s efforts to tackle coronavirus and save lives. We owe them a great deal of gratitude for all that they do,"" Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel said.
""I don’t want them distracted by the visa process.""
In February, Britain announced plans for a new post-Brexit points-based immigration system to cut down on what it said was a reliance on “cheap labor from Europe” but critics said the measures could cause a shortage in NHS staffing.
However, the government said the new system would include an NHS Visa (NYSE:V) initiative with preferential rules to attract doctors and nurses.

PASEWALK, Germany (Reuters) - If Tomasz Jamro, an emergency ward nurse in eastern Germany, returns home to see his wife and three children over the border in Poland, he will be stuck: authorities there will quarantine him for two weeks.
He is one of two dozen Polish medical staff who work at a hospital across the border in Pasewalk, northeastern Germany, where preparations for an expected wave of coronavirus patients are being hindered by the closure of once-open borders.
""We medical staff are fighting together against the coronavirus, but we can't go home to our family,"" he said, describing the predicament he and colleagues have been in since Poland's emergency quarantine laws came into force on Friday.
Since Poland joined Germany in the European Union 16 years ago, the border areas east of Berlin have essentially become a single, open space, where doctors, nurses, engineers and other essential workers commute back and forth.
That changed on Friday, when one of Jamro's colleagues went home from work only to find himself quarantined and unable to return for 14 days. Across the East, hundreds of doctors and nurses are in a similar position.
Around the world, border closures and quarantine rules have snapped the supply chains which deliver medical supplies and food, prompting calls for a return to shorter, more resilient supply networks.
Similarly, sectors that have come to rely on moving staff across borders are now scrambling to hold on to employees at a time when they've never been so badly needed.
Alexander Gross, head of the hospital where Jamro may soon be operating ventilators to keep coronavirus patients alive, has found temporary accommodation for some of his Polish staff, their partners and children - and even their pets.
""We're doing everything so they don't have to leave,"" he said of the commuters who make up a third of his staff. ""We're renting vacant holiday homes and rooms for them,"" he said.
For the border states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Brandenburg, losing the commuters is a disaster on top of the economic hit from a Germany-wide lockdown.
The state governments are offering anyone from Poland who is willing to stay in Germany 65 euros a day, plus an extra 20 euros per family member for temporary accommodation.
""Those affected are massively engaged in hospitals and healthcare, but also in manufacturing and food production,"" said Patrick Dahlemann, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern's minister in charge of the effort to keep some 3,400 Polish commuters.
Commuter numbers in neighboring Brandenburg are similar.
Even if Warsaw and Berlin reach an agreement to exempt healthcare workers from quarantine rules, as the states urge, there will still be disruptions.

""We do WhatsApp, my children see me every day,"" said Jamro. ""Let's see what happens next week: if my children get ill, I'll probably have to go home.""

244,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 08:50AM ET</span>",Eight countries ask EU to halt trucking reforms amid pandemic,"By Kate Abnett
(Reuters) - Eight countries have asked the European Union (EU) to support road transport firms hit by the coronavirus outbreak and halt work on reforms to truck drivers' working conditions they said would leave the vulnerable companies worse off. 
In a letter seen by Reuters, transport ministers of Bulgaria, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, Cyprus, Latvia, Malta and Romania said the bloc should stand up for transport firms as it has already taken steps to help struggling airlines.
""Instead, we are on track of adopting the first Mobility Package whose provisions, combined with the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, will literally bring many European road transport businesses to an end,"" said the letter to the heads of the three main EU institutions.
Even before the pandemic, the same mainly eastern European nations were considering a legal challenge to the looming revamp of EU trucking rules, which they say would put their firms at a disadvantage by forcing them to send empty trucks home – causing excessive costs and extra carbon emissions.
But a majority of EU countries and the European Parliament struck a deal in December on the reform, which is promoted by wealthier nations, including France and the Netherlands.
It would force trucks to return to home countries every eight weeks, give drivers the right to return home every four weeks, and require drivers to spend rest periods outside their vehicle – with employers shouldering the cost of accommodation.
The 27-strong bloc had planned to sign off on the rules at a meeting on March 24, but coronavirus pushed that off the agenda.
Road transport, which accounts for 75% of freight shipments within the EU, has been disrupted by the pandemic as countries have imposed emergency checks at normally open frontiers, resulting in pile-ups of trucks and waiting times of more than 24 hours to cross some of the bloc's internal borders.
The EU executive has urged countries to put in place ""green lanes"" to let fresh produce and medical supplies skip traffic jams.

Japanese cases topped 2,000, and public broadcaster NHK said 78 cases in Tokyo took its tally of infections past 500. Media reports said 7 people in the city had died, five at one hospital.
""This is the greatest increase up to now and is certainly of high concern, and I'm worried about what tomorrow's figures might show,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike said.
A government spokesman said Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told cabinet members he and his second-in-command, Taro Aso, would no longer attend the same meetings to protect the leadership from infection. But the two were later shown at the same gathering - although wearing masks and sitting apart.
Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was obliged to switch to running the country from isolation after testing positive for the virus.
Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said Japan was not yet in a situation that required a state of emergency, triggering a potential lockdown, although the situation was precarious. 
""We're just barely holding it together,"" Nishimura told reporters. ""If we loosen our grip even a little, it wouldn't be surprising to see a sudden surge.""
Infections have now exceeded 770,000 worldwide, with more than 37,000 deaths, as confirmed cases in the United States, Italy and Spain overtake mainland China, where the virus originated late last year. 
In Tokyo, there has been intense speculation that a lockdown could come soon, fueled by the rising number of cases.
The national total edged past 2,000 infections after a center for disabled people in Chiba prefecture, east of Tokyo, found seven more infections. There have been 66 deaths.
With limited testing in Japan, there are questions about how widely the virus has spread.
About 7.1% of nearly 64,000 respondents said they had at least one virus symptom, such as high fever or a bad cough, between Friday and Monday, according to a survey of users in Tokyo and neighboring prefectures run by the chat app Line (T:3938) and the health ministry.
Such symptoms do not by themselves prove infection. But the 4,500 people who reported symptoms in the survey was markedly higher than Tokyo's official figure of 443 infections by Monday.
NO BINDING LOCKDOWN
Only last Tuesday, with a lockdown already in the offing, Japan and Olympic authorities gave in to pressure from athletes and sporting bodies worldwide to delay Tokyo's 2020 Summer Games for a year.
Some businesses in the capital are moving to curtail operations even ahead of a lockdown. On Tuesday, department store operator Isetan Mitsukoshi Holdings Ltd (T:3099) said it would close six stores in Tokyo on weekends through April 12.
Koshidaka Holdings (T:2157), an operator of karaoke and hot spring outlets, said it would close 200 karaoke outlets until April 13.
But any lockdown in Japan would look different from mandatory measures in some parts of Europe and the United States. Laws limit local authorities to requesting people to stay at home.
Tokyo Governor Koike has asked residents to avoid unnecessary outings, while her counterpart in the second biggest city of Osaka felt the government should declare a state of emergency, media said.
The government said it would seek data from wireless carriers, such as statistics on people's movements, to help gauge the effectiveness of a voluntary request.
A director of Japan's top organization of doctors urged that an emergency be declared before it was too late.
Development of medicines and vaccines would be crucial to contain the virus, Abe told Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director general of the World Health Organization, in a telephone call on Monday. 
Japan intends to promote clinical research on an anti-flu medicine called Favipiravir with other countries as a treatment, Abe said.
The drug, also known as Avigan, was developed by Fujifilm Holdings Corp (T:4901), shares of which closed up 2.2%, after having risen as much as 6.6% in Tokyo. The company later said in a statement it was starting a Phase III clinical trial in Japan of the drug for the coronavirus.

ROME (Reuters) - Italian mayors and regional governors on Tuesday bought a page in Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung newspaper to ask Germany for solidarity amid the coronavirus outbreak, saying that other states agreed to cut its debt after World War Two.
Italy has seen more fatalities from the coronavirus than any other country, with 11,591 deaths as of Monday, about a third of the global total, and more than 100,000 cases.
The initiative underscores Italians' growing resentment against what is seen as Germany's indifference towards its plight as Berlin refuses to heed calls from other countries for the issuance of mutual debt to help their battered economies.
""Dear German friends, memory helps make the right decisions,"" the letter says, after referring to a 1953 agreement to reduce Germany's debt to help its post-war recovery.
It was signed by mayors from left and right-wing parties representing the northern Italian cities worst-hit by its coronavirus outbreak, including Bergamo and Milan, as well as the regional president of Emilia-Romagna.
The missive also took aim at the Netherlands, seen in Italy as a sort of corporate tax haven, saying that it had ""established a 'favorable' tax regime that has been subtracting resources from all big European countries for years.""
Nine European Union countries, including Italy, France and Spain, called last week for joint debt issuance to finance an economic recovery after the virus outbreak that seems certain to push the euro zone into a deep recession.
Germany, the Netherlands, Finland and Austria opposed the proposal for so-called euro bonds, maintaining their traditional unwillingness to share the debt of less competitive economies.
""Euro bonds to tackle the coronavirus will not erase or mutualize previous debts,"" read the Italian translation of the letter posted on Twitter by European Parliament member Carlo Calenda, one of the signatories.
EU leaders have so far failed to agree on the scale of support for their economies which have ground to a halt due to lockdown measures to try to contain the spread of the virus. 

At the end of videoconference held last week, Germany and the Netherlands said those in need could access a eurozone bailout fund to obtain credit lines. Italy opposes this mechanism, which entails conditionality.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan is under growing pressure from unions and the opposition for a lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus, but insists that Turkey should ""keep wheels turning"" in the economy and that people continue going to work. 
Ankara has stopped all international flights, limited domestic travel, closed schools, bars and cafes, suspended mass prayers and sports fixtures to counter the outbreak.
The authorities have not, however, ordered people to stay at home, even as the number of cases in Turkey has risen sharply. On Monday these reached 10,827, less than three weeks since Turkey registered its first case. The death toll jumped to 168, drawing fresh calls for tighter measures.
With Turkey emerging from a recession triggered by a 2018 currency crisis, Erdogan aims to avoid endangering the recovery by enforcing a stay-at-home order that would halt economic activity and has called instead for voluntary self-isolation.
Two leading union confederations called for a halt to all but emergency work and for measures to be implemented to support workers. ""All work should be stopped for a minimum of 15 days except for the production of essential and emergency goods and services,"" TURK-IS Chairman Ergun Atalay said in a statement.
He also called for a ban on layoffs for the duration of the pandemic and said income support should be provided to all workers who are experiencing loss of work and income. The DISK union confederation issued an identical statement.
The Turkish Medical Association said on Monday there were many mistakes in Ankara's ""inadequate"" response to the pandemic, saying borders had been left open too long and that quarantine had not been imposed on most Turks returning from abroad.
""At this stage, the disease has spread to every part of the country, hence the opportunity to enforce a quarantine has gone,"" it said in a statement.
It said that more than 30,000 tests needed to be carried out daily and that those testing positive needed to be properly isolated.
But after a cabinet meeting on Monday, Erdogan said it was necessary to maintain output to sustain the supply of basic goods and support exports.
""Turkey is a country that needs to continue production and keep the wheels turning under all conditions and circumstances.""
The main opposition CHP party leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu said measures imposed on senior citizens and the chronically ill should be extended to a nationwide ""quarantine"".
""INADEQUATE"" RESPONSE
The CHP's Istanbul mayor, Ekrem Imamoglu, underlined the importance of a lockdown in the country's biggest city, with a population of 16 million people - nearly a fifth of Turkey's population.
""If 15% of the city's population goes out that is 2.5 million people. As the weather gets better people will go out,"" Imamoglu told Fox TV in an interview on Monday. ""Even if they don't do it for Turkey, a lockdown can be announced for Istanbul.""

On Monday, Erdogan also launched a campaign to collect donations from citizens for those in need, saying he was donating seven months of his salary to the cause and that the effort had already drawn $11 million.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Tuesday criticized the U.S. military's decision to place thousands of Korean workers on unpaid leave this week, after the two allies failed to sign a new cost-sharing agreement.
South Korea and the United States are embroiled in a dispute dating back almost two years over how much each should pay to support the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in an armistice, rather than a peace treaty.
With no new pact months after the last agreement expired at the end of 2019, 4,000 to 5,000 of the nearly 9,000 South Koreans employed by the U.S. military command will be placed on unpaid leave starting on Wednesday. U.S. officials have said they will cover the payroll for any workers deemed essential.
South Korean negotiator Jeong Eun-bo said South Korea regrets the move and that the United States had not agreed to proposals that would have prevented the furloughs while a new deal is hammered out.
""The decision by the U.S. side to implement the unpaid leave for our workers as planned does not properly reflect the situation of the negotiations and we think this is regrettable,"" Jeong told a briefing in Seoul.
""We urge the U.S. to take measures to ensure the workers subject to the furlough scheme can swiftly return to work.""
The move comes as South Korea and the U.S. military there battle outbreaks of the coronavirus, which has placed an economic strain on many residents. North Korea has also continued to test fire missiles, and South Korea said the furlough could undermine military readiness.
United States Forces Korea (USFK) did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. officials have previously said that a separate deal to address the workers would have undermined efforts to reach an overall agreement.
Washington had demanded up to $5 billion a year, more than five times the $870 million that Seoul agreed to pay last year under a one-year deal, though U.S officials said they have ""compromised"" on the numbers.
Jeong said that the two countries had ""substantially narrowed"" their differences and were making the utmost effort to sign a new agreement soon.
""We expect an agreement to be finalised soon,"" he said.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India will buy ventilators and masks from China to help it deal with the coronavirus, a government official said on Tuesday, even though some countries in Europe had complained about the quality of the equipment. 
India has recorded 1,251 cases of the coronavirus, with 32 deaths, but health experts say the country of 1.3 billion people could see a major surge in cases that could overwhelm its weak public health system.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government said it was trying to procure medical gear, including masks and body coveralls, both from domestic firms and from countries like South Korea and China, to meet shortages.
""China, definitely we are going to buy ... Because scaling up our domestic production will take time,"" said a top Indian policy official aware of the plan, who declined to be identified due to sensitivity of the discussions.
The Netherlands has recalled thousands of masks imported from China because of quality issues, while Spain has complained about defective imported test kits supplied by a Chinese manufacturer, media have reported.
China's foreign ministry said several countries had raised doubts about the quality of products imported from China, and acknowledged that there might be some problems.
""A large number of Chinese manufacturers are working around the clock to help other countries save lives. Our sincerity and assistance is real. If problems occur in this process, the Chinese side will talk to relevant departments,"" China's foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a news conference on Monday.

TIJUANA/CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico (Reuters) - The world's busiest land border has fallen quiet as restrictions to contain the coronavirus prevent millions of Mexicans from making daily trips north, including many who work in U.S. businesses.
At least 4 million Mexicans residing in cities along the 1,954-mile (3,144-km) border have been hit hard by the restrictions on non-essential travel. The measures effectively invalidate visas allowing short crossings into U.S. cities to visit family, get medical care or shop.  
While such B1/B2 ""border crossing cards"" are officially recreational, Reuters spoke to nearly two dozen residents of Tijuana, Nogales and Ciudad Juarez who use their cards to reach jobs or to care for relatives on the U.S. side of the frontier. 
All said they could no longer make the crossing, dealing another blow to businesses already suffering from shutdowns on the U.S. side of the border, including vital industries like agriculture. 
""I don't know what I'm going to do without money. I'm just waiting for a miracle,"" said 28-year-old Rosario Cruz, a mother of two young children who works for a cleaning company that subcontracts with major retailers in California. 
The coronavirus restrictions prohibit all non-essential travel across the border. However, the restrictions have not been widely imposed on U.S. citizens traveling to Mexico.
The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said it did not have an estimate of how many Mexican tourism-related visa holders work without permission in the United States. But U.S. and Mexican immigration experts say the practice is common.
According to the U.S. State Department Report of the Visa (NYSE:V) Office more than 4 million border cards have been issued since 2015. The cards are valid for 10 years. 
Before the coronavirus restrictions, over 950,000 people entered the United States from Mexico on foot or in cars on a typical day, according to 2019 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agency data. 
Andrew Selee, president of the Washington-based Migration Policy Institute, said limiting transport to contain the epidemic was understandable, but in cities such as San Diego or El Paso ""businesses that really should be open in the middle of a crisis might find that they don't have employees.""
""We're talking about farm work, we're talking about caregiving, and probably food production like canning and warehousing operations,"" he said.
    
RIPPLE EFFECT? 
Once teaming border crossings used by pedestrians and cars have emptied because of the measures, and people's fear of catching the virus. In U.S. border cities like El Paso and San Diego, the impact is already being felt. 
Cindy Ramos-Davidson, chief executive of the El Paso Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, said the lack of Mexican shoppers was ""devastating"" for retail businesses downtown. She was also concerned about day labor for nearby farms that grow chiles, tomatoes, hay, and alfalfa. 
""They depend on farm workers, the day workers,"" she said, adding that some of these employees use tourism-related visas to enter the United States.
Farm workers are designated ""essential"" travelers under the new DHS rules, but only those with the right paperwork. Workers usually able to cross using border cards are now stuck on the Mexican side.    
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said the measures would not ""disrupt critical supply chains."" CBP said in a statement cargo trucking continued and was not seen as a threat.
So far, Paola Avila, vice president of international business affairs at the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce, said so-called retail tourism, the second biggest contributor to the city's economy, had taken the biggest hit from the border closure there.
A manager at a San Diego hotel, who refused to share his name because the company employs Mexicans without legal U.S. work permits, said the measures decimated the establishment’s workforce. 
""The impact was so great that we decided to close; the legal workers wouldn't have been able to cope,"" on their own, he said.
Avila is also worried about the effect on U.S. residents cared for by relatives who cross from Mexico, and vice-versa — especially in the midst of a public health crisis. 
""If the hospitals overflow, as we predict, and they start sending people to be cared for at home, who will care for them?"" she asked. 
That's the fear that has already consumed 45-year-old Joel Sosa Moreno, whose elderly parents live in El Paso. He usually visits three times a week to clean house and bring food and medicine for diabetes and his mother's cancer.
Under the new restrictions, he has been prohibited from crossing at the port of entry. 
Asked about such humanitarian cases, a Customs and Border Protection official told Reuters officers had discretion to handle such situations on a case-by-case basis.

""It's essential that I go there,"" Sosa Moreno said, fearful for his parents. ""They can't go out into the street at all because they are more sensitive"" to coronavirus.

This comes a day after Indonesian President Joko Widodo said that he planned stricter rules on mobility and social distancing after a report showed more than 140,000 people in the Southeast Asian country could die in the pandemic.
Foreigners with residence visas and some diplomatic visits will be exempted from the ban, foreign minister Retno Marsudi said, adding that the government aims to issue the regulations for the ban on Tuesday.
The government will also strengthen screening for Indonesian nationals returning to the country, she said.
""The president has decided that the existing policy needed to be strengthened,"" Marsudi said, adding that details of the rules would be published later Tuesday. 
She said she did not know when the new travel ban would take effect. 
Medical experts have said the world's fourth-most-populous country must impose tighter movement restrictions as known cases of the highly infectious respiratory illness have gone from zero in early March to 1,414, with 122 deaths.

Indonesia's foreign ministry previously prohibited the entry and transit of visitors from seven European countries plus Iran, China and South Korea from March 20. Travellers not included in the ban had to obtain a health certificate from their home countries.

Guatemala, with 36 infections and one death, closed its borders in mid-March to halt spread of the virus, before it resumed flights ferrying home Guatemalans deported from the United States.
Authorities said the three minors were taken to hospital for a checkup and virus test while the other 77 Guatemalans had their temperature taken and will spend the night at the airport awaiting the results. 
The incident comes a day after Guatemala reported that a migrant deported on Friday, also from the United States, tested positive for the virus.
Officials of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
""The people who came on the flight as well as migration officials, are isolated while they're awaiting instructions from the health ministry,"" said Alejandra Mena, a spokeswoman for the Guatemalan Migration Institute.
It is the second time migrants have been held in the temporary shelter of the capital's La Aurora International Airport. On March 23, health personnel reported two cases of fever in adults from the Texas city of El Paso.
""How can it be that people who may be sick are being deported?"" asked Juan Jose Hurtado, director of the Guatemalan migrant association Pop Noj. ""What they're doing is compounding the problem.""

255,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 31, 2020 12:15AM ET</span>","In China, a young diplomat rises as aggressive foreign policy takes root","By Keith Zhai and Yew Lun Tian
SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - Diplomats returning from overseas postings don't usually receive special attention at China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a vast government bureaucracy with thousands of staff.
But when Zhao Lijian, a diplomat known for his pugnacious social media presence, finished a posting in Pakistan in August, he received an enthusiastic welcome in Beijing. A group of young admirers at the ministry gathered at his office to cheer his return, according to two people familiar with the matter.
That admiration was fueled in part by a Twitter spat he had engaged in a month earlier with Susan Rice, the national security adviser to former U.S. President Barack Obama. Each accused the other of being ""ignorant"" and a ""disgrace"". 
Now a foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao has come to represent a new generation of diplomatic hawks in China, challenging the restraint that long characterized the country's engagement with the world, according to a dozen current and former ministry officials and government researchers who spoke with Reuters.
Their emergence has caused a rift with the old foreign policy establishment, amid worries that increasingly assertive rhetoric could put the country on a dangerous collision course with powers like the United States, they said. 
The shift followed instructions that President Xi Jinping issued diplomats in a memo last year, calling on them to show more ""fighting spirit"", said two people with direct knowledge of the matter. 
""This is the first time since 1949 that the 'new hawks' have the power to reshape China's diplomatic policy,"" said Qin Xiaoying, who was a director of the ruling Communist Party's international propaganda department and is now a researcher with the China Foundation for International and Strategic Studies in Beijing.
Driving the shift is the widespread feeling among many Chinese that the United States wants to contain China's rise. Aggressive pushback by diplomats on issues that provoke nationalistic sentiment, like the protests in Hong Kong or the coronavirus outbreak, has proven popular domestically.
Most people who spoke with Reuters for this article declined to be named given the sensitivity of the matter. 
In response to a request for comment by Reuters, the ministry said Chinese diplomats from all age groups are determined to ""resolutely safeguard"" national sovereignty and security.
""We will not attack unless we are attacked,"" the ministry said, citing a slogan from founding leader Mao Zedong. ""But if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack.""
Zhao, 47, did not respond to requests for comment.
A spokeswoman for Rice, the former U.S. national security adviser, said she would not be available for comment. The U.S. State Department did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters.
HANDWRITTEN MESSAGE
Xi gave his instructions about adopting a tougher stance in the face of international challenges, like deteriorating relations with the United States, in a handwritten message to diplomats last year, two people with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters.
State Councillor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi gave the same message to officials attending the celebration of the 70th anniversary of the ministry's founding, Reuters reported in December.
Over the past year, more than 60 Chinese diplomats and diplomatic missions set up Twitter or Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) accounts, by Reuters' count, even though both platforms are banned in China, often using them to attack Beijing's critics around the world.
Zhao this month promoted a conspiracy theory on his personal Twitter account that the U.S. military brought the coronavirus to the central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began late last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump escalated the spat, infuriating Beijing by repeatedly citing the ""Chinese virus"".
The new Chinese assertiveness is a response in part to Washington's more confrontational stance towards China under Trump, according to Chinese diplomats.
""Why can the Americans criticize us constantly, and we can't scold the U.S.? Nobody likes to be educated all the time,"" said a diplomat who helped one embassy set up its Twitter account.
Among China's new Twitter warriors is Zhao's boss, Hua Chunying, who became the ministry's top spokeswoman last year and began tweeting last month. A rising star, Hua spent several weeks last year at the Central Party School, which trains officials destined for promotion.
The Twitter aggression is aimed not only at Washington.
In Brazil, Chinese Ambassador Yang Wanming shared a tweet, later deleted, calling the family of President Jair Bolsonaro ""poison"" after his son blamed the ""Chinese dictatorship"" for the coronavirus pandemic. 
China's embassy in Peru blasted Nobel laureate Mario Vargas Llosa for ""irresponsible"" comments after the 83-year-old said the virus had ""originated in China"".
And the Chinese Embassy in Singapore went after a former Singaporean diplomat, Bilahari Kausikan, after he linked the virus outbreak and China's political system. The article was ""smearing China's political system and the leadership system,"" it said.
""These diplomats are not engaging the world with diplomatic language, but they are trying to please the domestic audience,"" said Qin. ""This is not diplomacy. This is very dangerous.""
Many young diplomats have pushed the Chinese government to take a harder line when dealing with the United States, according to diplomats. This month, the foreign ministry made an unprecedented move by expelling about a dozen American journalists at U.S. newspapers.
WORDS OF CAUTION
Some more traditional diplomats have sought to distance themselves from the new tactics, wary of putting China on a collision course with the United States.
Cui Tiankai, a ministry spokesman in the 1990s and now ambassador to Washington, said in a recent interview with Axios on HBO that it would be ""crazy"" to spread theories about a possible U.S. origin for the virus.
""There is definitely a generational divide,"" said Douglas H. Paal, who served on the National Security Council under U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. Cui ""was and is in the tradition of 'just the facts'.""
Some retired diplomats and researchers at state think tanks, wary of provoking anti-China sentiment globally, have been writing cautionary internal reports, the researchers said. 
Some cite the pragmatism of Communist China's first foreign minister, Zhou Enlai, who sought to make as many friends as possible for the country and avoid making enemies.
Zhou's spirit of diplomacy was largely adopted by the later reform leader Deng Xiaoping, whose policy of ""biding our time and nurturing our strength"" enabled China to keep a low profile internationally while focusing on economic growth.
""The young diplomats are taking control of strategy and want it to be more pugnacious to win domestic public opinion,"" said a veteran government researcher who wrote one of the reports.
The younger generation only know a rising China, and think this is a law of nature, said Kausikan, the retired permanent secretary of Singapore's Foreign Ministry.

""It sometimes seems as if this new generation feels obliged to have a public quarrel to prove their patriotism.""

256,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 08:37PM ET</span>","Brazil's Bolsonaro urges no more coronavirus quarantine, says jobs being lost","By Lisandra Paraguassu, Ricardo Brito and Pedro Fonseca
BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said on Monday that there can be no more quarantine measures imposed on the country than those already in place to combat coronavirus because jobs are being destroyed and the poor are suffering disproportionately.
Speaking to Rede TV, Bolsonaro criticized self-isolation and other measures imposed by local authorities to limit the spread of the virus, a view that again appeared to put him at odds with Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mendetta.
Mendetta on Monday urged Brazilians to maintain maximum social distancing to ease the strain on the fragile health system and said that 200 million personal protective equipment (PPEs) items would be arriving from China next month.
""You can't impose any more quarantine than there already is,"" Bolsonaro said, adding that the question people ask him most is when can they return to work.
Brazil's Senate passed a bill on Monday evening guaranteeing some of the country's poorest citizens income of 600 reais ($117) a month for three months, a package that could cost almost 50 billion reais. 
According to Bolsonaro, all measures to combat the crisis could cost 800 billion reais, and the economy, which is expected to contract this year, could rebound and be back on track within a year. 
Earlier on Monday, Bolsonaro had stepped up his stand-off with state governments, branding governors in the hardest-hit states ""job-killers"" and suggesting that democracy could be at risk if the coronavirus crisis leads to social chaos.
""When the situation is heading toward chaos, with mass unemployment and hunger, it's fertile ground for some to exploit, seeking a way to reach power and never leave it,"" Bolsonaro told reporters outside the presidential palace.
Bolsonaro last week warned that Brazil could break with ""democratic normalcy,"" citing the risk of rioting and suggesting ""the left"" could capitalize on any chaos, without elaborating.
The right-wing populist, elected in 2018 on a pledge to break with a corrupt political establishment, has long defended Brazil's 1964-1985 military dictatorship as necessary to keep communists out of power.
The coronavirus outbreak, which has now resulted in 4,579 confirmed cases and 159 deaths in Brazil, has led governments around the world to call for emergency powers, raising concerns among human rights advocates.
So far Brazil's political leaders have been eager to negotiate emergency measures such as a ""war budget"" exempt from fiscal rules, but many have criticized the president, who lacks a solid alliance in Congress, for downplaying health risks.
On Sunday, Bolsonaro visited a market area outside the federal capital to stress the message that lockdown measures should be relaxed. 

Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) on Monday followed Twitter and removed a video of him speaking to street vendors, explaining that it violated their standards on misinformation.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is expected to allow Russian, Chinese and European companies to continue their work at Iranian nuclear sites to make it harder for Tehran to develop nuclear weapons, four sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.
The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity and included one U.S. official, said a U.S. decision could come as early as Monday to renew waivers to sanctions that bar non-U.S. firms from dealing with Iran's Atomic Energy Organization.
Jewish News Syndicate, a news outlet predominantly focused on Israel and the Jewish world, first reported the United States was expected to renew the waivers, citing two sources familiar with the decision.
The move by the Trump administration, which in 2018 withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Iran, will allow nonproliferation work to continue at the Arak heavy-water research reactor, the Bushehr nuclear power plant, the Tehran Research Reactor and other nuclear initiatives.
The waivers would be a rare breather in a hardened U.S. policy toward Iran, one of the hardest-hit places in the Middle East by the global coronavirus pandemic, which has killed 2,460 people in the Islamic Republic and infected nearly 40,000.
Iranian authorities say U.S. sanctions are hampering their efforts to curb the outbreak and have urged other countries and the United Nations to call for the measures to be lifted. Washington rejects the assertion.
""Stop lying. ... It's not the sanctions. It's the regime,"" State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus, said on Monday in a Twitter post that copied a tweet by Iran's foreign minister, Javad Zarif, accusing Washington of waging an economic war on Iranians and engaging in ""medical terror"" amid the outbreak.
Washington has so far refused to lift any sanctions and has even ramped up its pressure campaign. Last week, it blacklisted five Iran- and Iraq-based companies and 15 individuals for supporting terrorist groups, its third round of sanctions on Iranian targets in two weeks.
Under the 2015 deal between Iran and six world powers - Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States - Tehran agreed to limit its nuclear program in return for the lifting of sanctions that had crippled its economy.
Tehran has long rejected Western assertions that it has sought to develop nuclear weapons.

LONDON (Reuters) - Prince Harry and his American wife Meghan posted their last message as working members of Britain's royal family on Monday before officially embarking on new careers without their ""Royal Highness"" styles.
Harry and Meghan shocked Queen Elizabeth and the other Windsors in January by announcing plans step back from their royal roles. A later deal brokered by the 93-year-old monarch means they will go their own way from April.
So from Wednesday, the couple, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, will be free to pursue new careers, earn their own money and spend most of their time in North America.
But they will no longer be able to use the word ""royal"" in their branding or carry out official duties and have agreed not to use the style of HRH - His or Her Royal Highness. 
Harry, 35, the queen's grandson and sixth in line to the throne, will remain a prince but relinquish his military appointments.
""While you may not see us here, the work continues,"" the couple said in the last message to their more than 11 million followers on their sussexroyal Instagram page.
""We look forward to reconnecting with you soon. You’ve been great! Until then, please take good care of yourselves, and of one another.""
Harry, and Meghan, a former actress, married in a lavish ceremony in May 2018, a wedding which was heralded at the time as infusing a blast of Hollywood glamour and modernity into the monarchy, and making them one of the world's biggest celebrity couples.
Their son Archie was born a year later, but by then relations with the media and with Harry's elder brother Prince William were becoming strained, and in January they announced plans to step back from their royal roles.
It provoked a crisis, and in a subsequent deal thrashed out with the queen, her son and heir Prince Charles and William, it was agreed the couple would have to give up their royal jobs altogether.
As a result, the couple will no longer use their sussexroyal handle on Instagram nor update their SussexRoyal.com website. The Sussex Royal Foundation, which they were setting up, will be wound up.
However Travalyst, a sustainable tourism initiative launched by Harry which had been the foundation's main initiative, will continue as an independent non-profit body.
The couple will now focus on their family for the next few months while ""developing their future non-profit organization"", a statement from their office said.
""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex would prefer that in the immediate weeks and months, the focus remains on the global response to COVID-19,"" the statement said. 
SECURITY
Their last public appearance came earlier this month when they joined other senior royals at the annual Commonwealth Day service in London.
After that they returned to Canada where they had spent most of their time in the last four months, and a royal source confirmed they had now moved to the Los Angeles area. Meghan, 38, who starred in TV legal drama ""Suits"", was raised in the area and her mother Doria still lives there.
Since their exit deal was announced, there have been questions over who would provide their personal security which media have estimated costs millions of dollars a year.
Canada had already said it would not provide security for them after they relinquished their royal jobs and on Sunday, U.S. President Donald Trump tweeted that the United States would not foot the bill either.
However, a spokeswoman for the couple said they had no plans to ask for any public funding for their security, adding: ""Privately funded security arrangements have been made.""
Meghan's first post-royal job will be to narrate a nature documentary ""Elephant"" for Disney which will be released on April 3 and will raise money for an animal welfare charity.

""For now, there will be no additional information on their next steps,"" the statement from their office said.

259,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 03:00PM ET</span>",No scandal here: Mexico president defends meeting mother of drug lord 'El Chapo',"By Raul Cortes and Jesus Bustamante
MEXICO CITY/BADIRAGUATO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday defended his weekend handshake with the mother of drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, calling her a ""respectable old lady"" and seeking to cast his critics as the principal menace to the country.
In a 30-second video posted on Twitter on Sunday, Lopez Obrador could be seen approaching Maria Consuelo Loera's car, parked on a dirt road on the outskirts of Badiraguato, a mountainous municipality in the northwestern state of Sinaloa.
Surrounded by onlookers, Lopez Obrador told Loera she need not get out of the car, they shook hands and after a brief exchange he told her he had ""received her letter.""
Guzman was for years boss of the Sinaloa Cartel, a powerful criminal organization blamed for the deaths of thousands of people in Mexico ranging from rival gang members, ordinary citizens, police and members of the armed forces. 
Critics on social media asked what kind of message the encounter, videotaped by part of the entourage that regularly accompanies the president on weekends, was meant to send.
Questioned about the meeting at his regular morning news conference, Lopez Obrador was unrepentant and quickly blamed ""adversaries"" for trying to make a ""scandal"" out of it.
""Sometimes, because it's my job, I have to shake hands with white collar criminals who haven't even lost their respectability, how am I not going to greet an old lady who leaves her hand outstretched?,"" he told reporters.
In the video, Lopez Obrador could also be seen talking to one of El Chapo's lawyers, Jose Luis Gonzalez Meza.
Lopez Obrador said Loera, a ""respectable old lady,"" wrote to him to ask for help in getting permission from U.S. authorities to visit her son, who is in a maximum security U.S. prison.
""This depends on the United States government, the U.S. embassy. I believe that for humanitarian reasons she should be allowed to go with caregivers, sanitarians, doctors,"" he said.
The leftist leader said ""conservative"" opponents, were trying to use the encounter to hurt him.
Accusing them of hypocrisy, he said the corruption he identifies as their legacy is a much bigger threat to the country than a 92-year-old woman ""who deserves my respect.""
After questions by reporters about the meeting, Lopez Obrador promised to publish the letter from Loera, saying: ""We have nothing to hide ... there's nothing that can embarrass us.""
Guzman shipped tons of drugs around the world and twice embarrassed the Mexican government by escaping from prison. 
Captured for a third time in 2016, he was extradited to the United States in 2017 and sentenced to life in prison by a U.S. judge last year after his conviction on multiple drug charges.
The Sinaloa Cartel caused Lopez Obrador's government considerable embarrassment last October, when security forces briefly surrounded and captured the notorious drug lord's son Ovidio Guzman in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa.
Cartel gunmen responded with prolonged bursts of gunfire in the streets after Ovidio's arrest.
To avoid bloodshed, the government ordered Ovidio's release, sparking widespread criticism of Lopez Obrador's security policy, and angering some military leaders.
Lopez Obrador saw Guzman's mother on a visit to a rural area of Sinaloa where the government was building a new road that would pass near El Chapo's birthplace. The president said he went to meet Loera after hearing she wanted to greet him.
The 66-year-old, who has flouted the advice of his own government not to engage in physical contact during the coronavirus crisis, dismissed the suggestion that he should not be shaking hands with an elderly woman at risk of contagion.
He said it would have been ""disrespectful"" not to take her hand - even as two state governors Lopez Obrador had recently met with said over the weekend they had coronavirus.

""I am not a robot,"" he said. ""I have feelings.""

KRASNAYA POLYANA, Russia (Reuters) - When Muscovite Vera Butakova arrived on Russia's Black Sea coast to spend a week-long holiday proposed by President Vladimir Putin to help curb the spread of the coronavirus, she did not expect to get kicked out of her resort hotel.
Putin last Wednesday ordered workers from non-essential businesses nationwide to observe a week-long holiday this week, a measure he said would help the country combat the virus.
But despite pleas from the authorities for people to stay at home despite being off work, some Muscovites flew to Sochi, a popular resort some 1,354 km (841 miles) to the south, only to find that restrictions are now being enforced there too. 
""I came here and no one was wearing masks. It was just amazing,"" said Butakova, sporting sunglasses. ""And yesterday it was a mess. They (my hotel) expelled me at midnight because Putin had issued some kind of order.""
Russia, which has so far recorded 1,836 coronavirus cases, has grounded international flights, closed its borders and urged the population to remain at home. Moscow introduced a partial lockdown of the city after cases there exceeded 1,000.
Moscow's decision to tighten restrictions came after its mayor, Sergei Sobyanin, said many had ignored the authorities' calls to remain at home, strolling through the city despite restaurants and attractions being closed. 
Butakova said she had been pleased with the atmosphere in Sochi before the week-long holiday began. 
But the situation changed abruptly when regional authorities restricted public transport and ordered resorts and hotels to stop taking in new guests. A popular ski resort at Krasnaya Polyana, in the Caucasus mountains near Sochi, closed completely. 
""It is good that the resort is closed... especially with tourists who see this week as days off for a vacation,"" said Maria, a local resident. ""It will lower the chances of the infection spreading.""
Vladimir Alexeyev, a Muscovite, arrived in Sochi before the week-long holiday came into force and was allowed to remain in his room.
""There is nothing to do here anymore,"" said Alexeyev, who is returning to Moscow on Monday. ""Everything is closed.""
Sochi, which hosted the 2014 Winter Olympics, has been a popular tourist destination since Soviet times thanks to its subtropical climate, its pebbly shore and proximity to the mountains.

STRASBOURG/PARIS (Reuters) - Army helicopters on Monday transported coronavirus patients fighting for their lives from eastern France to hospitals in Germany and Switzerland as the country battled to free up space in life-support units.
The Grand Est region was the first in France to be overwhelmed by a wave of infections that has rapidly moved west to engulf the greater Paris region, where hospitals are desperately adding intensive care beds to cope with the influx.
The number of coronavirus deaths since March 1 climbed 13% to 2,606 on Sunday, while the number of intensive care cases rose 8.4 percent to 4,632, its lowest daily rise in that period -- a rare positive in recent days.
However, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has warned the country's 67 million people that the toughest weeks in the fight against epidemic were still to come and doctors in the capital said on Monday they were close to saturation point.
""Today in the pulmonology unit we are as full as full can be,"" Jerome Pinot, a doctor at the Georges Pompidou hospital in Paris told Reuters.
""To find a place in intensive care is a never-ending headache. We ask ourselves whether we can move this patient to this unit to take another patient. It's an incessant game."" 
France has already doubled the number of beds in intensive care units from 5,000 to about 10,000 since the start of the crisis and the government at the weekend pledged to quickly increase that number to 14,500. 
In the eastern city of Strasbourg, paramedics in hazmat suits transferred six patients onto three Caiman NH90 medicalized helicopters before they were moved to hospitals in Bern and Frankfurt. 
Eighty have so far been moved from the region to Switzerland, Germany and Luxembourg, Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Twitter, adding that the aim was to transfer more than 100 in the coming hours.
Transfers from Paris hospitals are expected in the coming days. 
Health officials want to send some patients to other countries and to less stricken regions to make space in the worst hit areas so that if the peak shifts, then the capital in particular could again take patients in two weeks' time.
""The growth phase of the epidemic in the region will probably last two weeks,"" said Pierre Delobel, head of the infectious and tropical diseases unit at the University Hospital in Toulouse, where the number of cases have jumped from eight to 40 in a week. 
""Then there will be a slowdown but that does not mean a decrease, it will go up less quickly."" 
Highlighting the cost to frontline medical personnel, a doctor, who had been close to retirement, died in the Paris area at the weekend from the virus.

""We will use this rage from his death to fight more and more and be tougher than this virus,"" Aurelien Rousseau, director general of the Paris region health authority, said in a letter made public.

Countries across the 27-nation European Union have set up border controls to stem the spread of the virus, but with the side effect of delaying food and medical supplies, as well as cross-border workers.
The EU executive last week urged EU countries to limit to 15 minutes the time it takes for goods traffic to cross a border, reporting some success on Monday, although some crossings into and out of Hungary had jams of up to 4 km (2.5 miles).
The Commission said on Monday countries should establish simple and fast procedures to ensure smooth passage for essential workers with proportionate health screenings. Some 1.5 million people live in one EU country and work in another. 
Essential workers, the EU executive said, include healthcare professionals, police and transport workers. In Luxembourg, for example, most people working in hospitals live in Belgium or France.
The Commission also highlighted the issue of seasonal workers, particularly in farms, who it said should be categorized as essential and able to travel. It encouraged EU countries to exchange information on their different needs.
France and Germany together take in around 500,000 seasonal farm migrant workers each year and have been considering how to get fruit and vegetables picked in changed times. French Agriculture Minister Didier Guillaume last week issued a rallying cry to a ""shadow army"" of other workers laid off by the crisis to help.

However, Europe's leading farming association has expressed doubt that such people would be willing or able to fill the gap.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union expects Britain to seek an extension of its post-Brexit transition period beyond the end of the year, diplomats and officials said on Monday, as negotiations on trade have ground to a halt due to the coronavirus pandemic.
Europe has gone into a deep lockdown in a bid to curb the spread of the disease, with more than 330,000 infections reported on the continent and nearly 21,000 deaths.
In Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his health minister have both tested positive for the virus and the prime minister's senior adviser Dominic Cummings - one of the masterminds behind Britain's departure from the EU earlier this year - was self-isolating with symptoms.
""The coronavirus pandemic complicates the already very ambitious schedule,"" said David McAllister, a conservative German EU lawmaker who chairs the European Parliament's Brexit group. 
""The EU has always been open to extending the transition period. The ball is now clearly in the British court ... So far, the UK government has constantly rejected such an option. Under the current circumstances, London should carefully re-examine a prolongation.""
London and the EU have been seeking to agree a new trade pact by the end of the year to kick in from 2021, even though the bloc has long said that such a timeframe was extremely short to agree rules on everything from trade to security to fisheries.
EU diplomats said on Monday they expected a request from London in May or June.
Johnson has ruled out delaying the date when Brexit would finally take effect following Britain's 2016 vote to leave, and said London was also ready to withdraw from its current cooperation accords at end-year without a new deal.
His spokesman repeated on Monday the deadline for the transition ended on Dec. 31 and ""this is enshrined in law"".
""We have shared legal texts and they are the subject of informal discussions between ourselves and the EU commission ... I would expect those sorts of conversations to be carrying on this week,"" he told reporters.
""The structure of the negotiations has changed to reflect the current situation with regard to coronavirus, so there are more continuous discussions taking place rather than the set rounds which were originally envisaged."" 
PANDEMIC SAPPING ENERGY
Sources on both sides of the English Channel said tackling the pandemic was sapping political energy and government resources to the detriment of Brexit negotiations. 
Several British civil service sources told Reuters many officials previously focusing on the Brexit talks have been shifted to teams dealing with the outbreak.
In Brussels, diplomats and officials said there have been no formal negotiations since the sides exchanged their drafts of a new trade agreement in mid-March, though some contacts between officials were taking place to exchange views on the documents.
""It's increasingly obvious the transition period will have to be extended,"" said an EU diplomat. ""It's a matter of political momentum - when things get so bad in Britain that Johnson can do a U-turn and say he is prioritising saving lives and hence delays Brexit.""
Both sides would have to agree by the end of June on the extra time of one or two years. In Britain, parliament has passed laws ruling that out.

272,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>",North Korea says Pompeo undercuts its interest in restarting talks,"By Hyonhee Shin and Heekyong Yang
SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said on Monday that U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo undermined its willingness to restart stalled denuclearisation talks, criticising his recent remarks on sanctions on Pyongyang. 
Pompeo had said after a teleconference with G7 foreign ministers last week that all nations must remain united in calling for North Korea to return to negotiations and applying diplomatic and economic pressure over its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
That comment highlighted the United States cannot reverse its hostile policy toward North Korea ""no matter how excellent and firm the relationship"" their two leaders have, state media KCNA said, citing an unnamed foreign ministry official responsible for the negotiations. 
""Hearing Pompeo's reckless remarks, we dropped the interest in dialogue with further conviction, but have become more zealous for our important planned projects aimed to repay the U.S. with actual horror and unrest for the sufferings it has inflicted upon our people,"" the official was quoted as saying. 
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump have boasted of rapport they have built during three meetings and an exchange of multiple letters since 2018. 
But little progress has been made on dismantling Pyongyang's weapons programmes, with a last round of working-level talks in October falling apart. 
North Korea has not confirmed any case of the coronavirus, but KCNA said Trump had sent a letter to Kim carrying a ""sincere aid plan"" to help prevent an outbreak, only to be followed up soon by Pompeo's ""slander"" against the country. 
Pyongyang has touted the letter as a sign of ""the special and very firm personal relations"" between the two leaders despite recent frictions.
""This makes us misjudge who is the real chief executive in the U.S.,"" the diplomat said. 
WEAPONS TEST
In an earlier dipatch on Monday, KCNA said Sunday's test of super-large multiple rocket launchers had been a success. 
North Korea fired what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles off its east coast on Sunday, the latest in a flurry of launches that South Korea decried as ""inappropriate"" amid the coronavirus pandemic.
KCNA said the launch was aimed at examining the strategic and technical features of the launchers, which has been tested multiple times since last August overseen by leader Kim Jong Un, ahead of deployment. 
KCNA did not mention Kim's attendance at the latest test, led by ruling party vice chairman Ri Pyong Chol and conducted at the Academy of National Defense Science. 
""The operational deployment of the weapon system of super-large multiple rocket launchers is a crucial work of very great significance in realising the party's new strategic intention for national defence,"" Ri was quoted as saying during the test, without elaborating. 
""The test-fire was conducted successfully,"" KCNA added. 
It marked the fourth round of tests this month since North Korea staged military drills and resumed missile launches following a three-month break. 

The move indicated the progress of Pyongyang's weapons development while denuclearisation negotiations with the United States remain in limbo.

He was 97.
Revered across Greece's political spectrum, Glezos was most famous for scaling the steep walls of the Acropolis with a friend in 1941 to take down the swastika and replace it with the Greek flag.
It was the first visible act of resistance against the Nazis occupying Greece.
Glezos died of heart failure at a central Athens hospital, where he was admitted on March 18.
With his white mane of hair and thick moustache, Glezos was a recognizable fixture in leftist politics.
He braved police teargas at protest rallies against tough cuts imposed in exchange for international bailouts that kept the Greek economy afloat between 2010 and 2015.
A member of the Socialist PASOK party which he represented in the European Parliament, Glezos gradually migrated further to the political left.
At the age of 91, in 2014, he became a member of the European Parliament representing Syriza, the left-wing party which came to power in 2015. He resigned a year later.
Asked what had kept him at the forefront of politics for so long, Glezos told Reuters in 2012 that it was the memories of dead comrades.

""Before every battle, every protest, we told each other: 'If you live, don't forget me'. I am paying a debt to those I lost during those difficult years. My only regret is that I haven’t done more.""

In a statement, Portugal's criminal investigation police agency, the PJ, said the alleged crime was committed at a temporary detention center at Lisbon's airport run by the country's immigration and border service SEF. 
PJ said the victim arrived on March 10 and was killed on March 12 after he ""allegedly caused some disturbances"" at the center. The three SEF workers were believed to be responsible for his death, the statement said.
SEF confirmed in a statement that three of its officers had been detained on suspicion of murder, adding the director and deputy director of SEF's Lisbon Border Directorate had suspended their duties with immediate effect as result of the incident. 
""SEF has been collaborating with the authorities involved in the investigation since the beginning and took the needed disciplinary measures,"" it said.
Portugal's internal affairs minister said the government had ordered an inquiry into what happened. 
Police said the suspects would appear before a judge to answer questions, but did not provide details on when the appearance would take place.

It was not immediately clear whether the three men had appointed lawyers yet to represent them.

The gunmen opened fire at around 2 p.m. (0300 GMT) at the office in the city of Timika in Indonesia's Papua province, the company PT Freeport Indonesia said in a statement.
Police said the attackers were members of an armed criminal group without going into further details.
Separatists have launched a string of attacks in recent years in the area around the company's nearby Grasberg operation - the world's second largest copper mine. 
There have been sporadic shootings and ambushes on vehicles traveling on the main supply route to the mine. 
PT Freeport Indonesia said one staff member was killed and six other people wounded, two of them seriously.
Workers had been evacuated from the office in the city's Kuala Kencana district and from the surrounding area, the company added. 
Conditions were being ""monitored and so far there is no direct impact"" on mining operations, Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said by text message.
Papuan police spokesman Ahmad Mustafa Kamal identified the victim as a New Zealand citizen. 
""Joint security forces are carrying out a pursuit in the forest area in Kuala Kencana,"" Kamal said in the statement.
Papua, which shares the island of New Guinea with the nation of Papua New Guinea, was a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. 
The region has since endured decades of mostly low-level separatist conflict.

WUHAN, China (Reuters) - For barber Xiong Juan, a recent easing of restrictions in the city of Wuhan, epicenter of China's coronavirus outbreak, means she is now busier than ever. 
Xiong, 39, now spends her days riding around on her electric bicycle and offering her services to local residents who like her were stuck at home after authorities ordered a lockdown in the city of 11 million people in early January. 
""It was so difficult to bear,"" said one client who only gave his surname as Ren, describing how his hair had grown too long since he last had it cut in December.
""This is bliss,"" he said as Xiong carefully trimmed his hair with a pair of clippers.
Xiong worked at a hairdressing salon but, like hundreds of thousands of businesses across China, it had to shut due to government measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which as of Sunday had infected 81,470 people and killed 3,304 in mainland China, mostly in Wuhan.
Xiong stayed indoors to look after her two children, but started venturing out three weeks ago. The additional income is welcome after being off work for such a long time. 
""In a day, if it's a peak period, I might work from 8 a.m. in the morning till 6 p.m. in the evening to cut the hair of 70 people,"" she said from an open-air square of a residential compound where she had set up a plastic chair for clients to sit in. She lets them see their final look via her iPhone camera. 
""STILL A LITTLE SCARED""
Each client is charged 30 yuan ($4.23), much lower than her usual salon-based cuts, which cost up to 156 yuan. She only cuts men's hair as they usually take less than 15 minutes. 
Xiong wears a hazmat suit and gloves and disinfects the clippers between each customer. She usually finds customers by word of mouth or just riding around, and sometimes cuts their hair at the roadside due to the restrictions some compounds still have on visitors.
The salon where she works is expected to reopen in due course when restrictions are eased further. 
Asked about the risk of infection, she said: ""Of course I'm still a little scared. But society needs us so I should help in the little way I can.""
The relaxing of curbs in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in December, comes as the number of new local cases in China drops sharply, though the disease has since spread to 203 other countries, prompting lockdowns there too.

KABUL (Reuters) - Taliban insurgents have killed 27 members of the Afghan security forces, police and government officials said on Monday, as a peace effort brokered by the United States struggles to get off the ground.
The Taliban and the United States struck a deal last month allowing the United States and its allies to withdraw their forces in exchange for Taliban promises on preventing terrorism.
A Taliban commitment to talk peace with the U.S.-backed government was part of the pact but efforts to get talks going have been hampered by differences between the government and the Taliban on a prisoner exchange and on negotiating teams.
The Taliban have not agreed to a ceasefire with government forces and fighting has not ended, although the insurgents have not announced any spring offensive, which they normally do at this time of the year.
In the latest clashes, insurgents stormed the compound of a top police officer in the northeastern province of Takhar on Sunday, killing 13 policeman and wounding the senior officer, a spokesman for the force said.
In the southern province of Zabul, Taliban forces attacked government security outposts, killing at least 11 soldiers, also on Sunday, police said. The ministry of defense said on Twitter six soldiers were killed in those clashes.
Government security posts were also attacked in the southern province of Helmand and northern province of Baghlan, officials said. Four members of the security forces were killed in both attacks.
Thirteen Taliban fighters were killed in Baghlan, according to police spokesman. The Taliban also suffered casualties in the other three attacks, officials said, but they did not provide details.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Kabul and Doha, where the Taliban have an office, last week to urge all sides involved to move the process forward.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain on Monday named Ken McCallum, a career spy who led the response to the attempted murder of former Russian double agent Sergei Skripal, as the new head of its MI5 domestic intelligence agency.
McCallum, who has worked in MI5 for 25 years, spent his first decade in MI5 focusing on Northern Ireland but then began battling Islamist militants, developing cyber security and ensuring the safety of the 2012 London Olympics.
McCallum was in charge of all counter-terrorism investigations and risk management in the run-up to, and during, the London Olympics, MI5 said.
Then, after former Russian double agent Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found poisoned with a Soviet-developed nerve agent in 2018, he led the agency's response to the attempted murder.
""In 2018, Ken took charge of the MI5 response to the attempted assassination of Sergei Skripal, within the unprecedented UK-led international response from intelligence allies,"" MI5 said.
Britain blamed Russia for the attack in which a British citizen died. Russia denied any role, though Western powers expelled dozens of Russian spies working under diplomatic cover.
MI5 said one of McCallum's top priorities was enabling MI5 to seize the fast-moving opportunities provided by technology, including machine learning. He enjoys mountain hiking.
He succeeds Andrew Parker who retires in April. 
MI5, established in 1909 to counter German espionage ahead of World War One, is tasked with protecting British national security. Its main job is currently countering international terrorism though it is also a counter-intelligence agency.
""MI5's purpose is hugely motivating,"" McCallum said in a statement.
""Our people - with our partners - strive to keep the country safe, and they always want to go the extra mile. Having devoted my working life to that team effort, it is a huge privilege now to be asked to lead it as Director General.""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore's high court upheld on Monday a rarely-used law that criminalizes sex between men, dismissing three appeals that argued it was unconstitutional.
The ruling follows challenges to the colonial-era law by activists emboldened after India's decision to scrap similar legislation in 2018. Previous repeal efforts in the socially-conservative city-state in 2014 also failed.
""The High Court dismisses all three applications,"" Judge See Kee Oon said in a summary of the case published by the court. 
""Legislation remains important in reflecting public sentiment and beliefs,"" it said, adding that non-enforcement of the law against consensual male homosexual activity in private did not make it redundant. 
Bryan Choong, one of the three men who challenged the law, said he was disappointed by the ruling. ""But my eyes are firmly on the road ahead,"" he said.
The Attorney-General's Chambers did not immediately comment. Previously, it has said prosecution under the law would not be in the public interest.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has previously said that society in Singapore ""is not that liberal on these matters"".
However, after the Indian decision, a prominent Singapore diplomat urged challenges to the city-state's law, while Law Minister K. Shanmugam said a ""growing minority"" wanted it repealed and that laws should keep pace with societal change.
Polls have also suggested changing attitudes towards homosexuals, and a perceived softening in tone from some establishment figures.
The applicants in Monday's cases had argued that Section 377A, which provides for jail terms of up to two years for a man found to have committed an act of ""gross indecency"" with another man, was unconstitutional. The law does not apply to lesbians.
Rights groups had said Singapore's decision had wider implications for Asia, where social attitudes are conservative.
""In declining to strike out this archaic and discriminatory law, the court has reaffirmed that all gay men in Singapore are effectively unapprehended criminals,"" Téa Braun, director of the London-based rights group, Human Dignity Trust, said in a statement.
There have been concerns around growing intolerance toward the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community in Muslim-majority neighbours like Malaysia and Indonesia.

LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus epidemic in the United Kingdom is showing signs of slowing and antibody tests could be ready in days, Neil Ferguson, a professor of mathematical biology at Imperial College London, said on Monday.
""We think the epidemic is just about slowing in the UK right now,"" Ferguson told BBC radio.
Britain, which has the world's fifth largest economy, initially took an approach to containing the spread of the disease that was modest in comparison to European countries such as Italy.
But Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed stringent controls after projections showed a quarter of a million people could die. Johnson on Friday became the first leader of a major power to announce a positive test result for coronavirus. He is self isolating in Downing Street. 
Ferguson said a third or even 40% of people do not get any symptoms. He said perhaps 2% to 3% of the United Kingdom's population had been infected. 
But Ferguson cautioned that the data was not good enough to make firm extrapolations.
He said antibody tests were in the final stage of validation right now and could be hopefully ready to use in ""days rather than weeks"".
Health officials said on Sunday that figures showed that 1,228 patients in the UK who tested positive for coronavirus (COVID-19) had died. As of 0800 GMT on March 29, a total of 127,737 people in the UK have been tested, of which 108,215 were confirmed negative and 19,522 were confirmed positive.
When asked whether the antibody test would be ready in days, junior health minister Helen Whately told BBC radio: ""I am not going to confirm when that's going to arrive.""
Britain has begun rolling out antigen tests - which are different to antibody tests - for healthcare workers but the numbers being tested are far below the levels of Germany, Europe's largest economy.

Whately said there was capacity to have 10,000 people a day tested though 7,000 were tested on Saturday or Sunday. She said the government hoped to get to 25,000 tests per day over the next few weeks.

289,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 30, 2020 03:45AM ET</span>",Special Report: Five days of worship that set a virus time bomb in France,"By Tangi Salaün
PARIS (Reuters) - From the stage of an evangelical superchurch, the leader of the gospel choir kicked off an evening of prayer and preaching: ""We're going to celebrate the Lord! Are you feeling the joy tonight?""
""Yes!"" shouted the hundreds gathered at the Christian Open Door church on Feb. 18. Some of them had traveled thousands of miles to take part in the week-long gathering in Mulhouse, a city of 100,000 on France's borders with Germany and Switzerland. 
For many members of this globe-spanning flock, the annual celebration is the high point of the church calendar. 
This time, someone in the congregation was carrying the coronavirus.
The prayer meeting kicked off the biggest cluster of COVID-19 in France - one of northern Europe's hardest-hit countries - to date, local government said. Around 2,500 confirmed cases have been linked to it. Worshippers at the church have unwittingly taken the disease caused by the virus home to the West African state of Burkina Faso, to the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, to a French nuclear power plant, and into the workshops of one of Europe's biggest automakers. 
Weeks later, Germany partially closed its border with France, suspending a free-movement pact that has been in place for the past 25 years. The church cluster was a key factor, two people familiar with the German decision told Reuters. Church officials told Reuters that 17 members of the congregation have since died of complications linked to the disease.
Other religious gatherings have been linked to the spread of the virus: A large church in South Korea has triggered more than 5,000 cases there. This story, told to Reuters by members of the Christian Open Door congregation and officials involved in coping with the outbreak, is testament to the speed and ferocity of the coronavirus infection. As public health administrators were still gearing up for coronavirus, the disease was operating to its own, remorseless timetable - one that has quickly outpaced anything they could put in place. 
As the faithful gathered on a clear Tuesday evening in the church, an old shopping center converted into a 2,500 seat auditorium, the disease seemed remote. France had 12 confirmed cases, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data. There were none in the Mulhouse area. 
France, like other governments in northern Europe, had imposed no restrictions on big meetings. There was no alcohol gel for the congregations to clean their hands, no elbow bumps instead of handshakes. 
""At the time, we viewed COVID as something that was far off,"" said Jonathan Peterschmitt, son of the lead pastor and grandson of the church's founder. His father, Samuel, was unavailable for an interview because he had been sickened by the virus, his son and a church spokeswoman said.
The day after the first case linked to the church was identified on Feb. 29, public health officials followed the usual protocol and traced the people whom the carriers had been in contact with, to stem the spread. Using a list supplied by the church - which public health officials said cooperated fully - they first contacted those who had staffed the children's crèche during the gathering. 
At this point, the health inspectors realized they were too late. Some crèche staff were already sick, according to Michel Vernay, an epidemiologist with France's national public health agency in eastern France.
""We were overwhelmed,"" said Vernay. ""We realized that we had a time bomb in front of us.""
""SPIRITUALLY RECHARGE""
Among the congregation was local man Elie Widmer, a 37-year-old manager of a house-building company. His parents were members of the church, which was founded in 1966 by Jean Peterschmitt, a French shopkeeper who embraced evangelism after his wife was unexpectedly cured of an illness.
Widmer said he had drifted away from the church as a teenager, but returned. The Mulhouse gathering was something he looked forward to the whole year, he said: ""You feel a special energy during that week. For a week, you stop everything to spiritually recharge."" As a drummer in the church orchestra, he attended the whole week.
Coming from further afield was Antoinette, a 70-year-old grandmother who lives on the Mediterranean island of Corsica. For her, the gathering was part of a 25-year tradition.
Antoinette made the trip with five other women who worship at the Bethel evangelical church in the capital Ajaccio. She spoke on the condition that she not be fully identified, saying believers had been stigmatized by people outside the church for spreading the virus. 
Antoinette has chronic lung problems, for which she has regular treatment. As the women flew out of Corsica on Feb. 16, they looked forward to combining evangelical workshops with excursions to the shops.
""We knew nothing,"" she said from her home in Ajaccio. ""We weren't thinking about the epidemic.""
Neither was Mamadou Karambiri, who flew into Paris's Charles de Gaulle airport on Feb. 14 aboard an Air France flight from Ouagadougou, capital of Burkina Faso.
He is pastor of his own church in Africa and co-founder of an organization called the International Evangelism Center – Africa Interior Mission. A charismatic speaker with a shock of white hair, Karambiri was to be the meeting's star preacher. 
His church, a warehouse-like building that takes up a city block in Ouagadougou, can accommodate 12,000 people, according to a worshipper there. A giant white cross towers above the red dirt street outside. Across the road is the studio that televises the sermons the pastor delivers to worshippers assembled on rows of blue plastic chairs. 
Karambiri traveled to the Mulhouse gathering with his wife and a bodyguard, said his spokesman, Aristide A. Ouedrago. The pastor, through his secretary, declined to be interviewed for this story.
Ouedrago said that he believed that when Karambiri traveled, the virus was not in France, although in fact there were 12 cases. 
""PETRI DISH""
In Mulhouse, the Christian Open Door church stands across the road from a kebab cafe. A four-storey-high white metal cross rises over the car park.
Also gathering in the church building were two children whose mother had taken sick before the event started, health officials said. The mother stayed at home, but their grandfather brought the children along - the elder child was five, the younger just one year old. 
The children and their mother would later test positive for coronavirus, making the mother a potential source of the cluster, said Vernay, the French public health official. It was not clear to public health officials where the mother, whom Vernay declined to identify, picked up the infection.
The week's schedule included gospel choir performances, collective prayer, singing, sermons from preachers, workshops, and testimony from people who said God had cured their illnesses.
The best-attended sessions had up to 2,500 people and there were never fewer than 1,000, said Jonathan Peterschmitt, the founder's son, from his home. Many people came day after day, and spent hours there. ""So we were in the same petri dish for a week,"" he said.
By the end of the gathering on Feb. 21, no one had reported any flu-like symptoms, according to Nathalie Schnoebelen, a church spokeswoman. At the time, France's tally of confirmed COVID-19 cases was steady at 12. 
SPREAD
In late February, Widmer, the drummer, started feeling unwell. His wife, his three children, and his mother-in-law also took ill. 
On March 3, the WHO recorded 91 new COVID-19 cases in France, bringing the country's total to 191. The church, prompted by the discovery of the infected woman and her two children, posted on its Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that people who had come to the gathering should contact a doctor. 
Widmer dialed 15, the number in France for emergency medical care. There were not enough testing kits for him to be tested. But doctors diagnosed coronavirus and ordered him and his family to quarantine themselves. 
For three days he had a strong fever and headache, and lost his sense of taste and smell. He said he was not especially worried: His family had milder symptoms. He has since recovered, but remains in self-isolation. 
The virus spread through the church founder's family. Around a dozen members are now recovering.
A few miles away across the border, German officials were watching with growing alarm. 
They had received a report from the Robert Koch Institute, a German state public health institution, that added eastern France to its list of four coronavirus risk areas around the world - along with China's Hubei province, Iran, Italy and North Gyeongsang province, adjoining the city of Daegu, the site of the South Korean church outbreak. By March 11, France's COVID-19 tally at the WHO had leapt to 1,774, of whom 33 had died.
Roughly 45,000 French workers commute to Germany daily, according to official data - around a fifth of them from the Mulhouse area. Most work in Germany's wealthy industrial region of Baden-Wuerttemberg, where automakers Porsche and Mercedes-Benz have their headquarters. Europa-Park, a theme park just over the Rhine in Germany, is a big employer, also of French workers. 
After attending the gathering, a worker from the French nuclear power plant at Fessenheim near Mulhouse tested positive. The plant's operator, Electricite de France SA (PA:EDF) (EdF), ordered 20 others to self-isolate at home but operations were not disrupted, a representative of the power company said. Another person who had been at the gathering worked in the Peugeot Citroen factory on the edge of Mulhouse; that individual too was infected, according to a person familiar with the case. 
German officials in Baden-Wuerttemberg decided to act, imposing restrictions on movements across the border. 
The French government asked Berlin for an explanation. On March 16, German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron. They talked about the cluster in eastern France and the risk from commuters, said a German government official briefed on the call. Then they agreed to close the border to traffic other than cargo vehicles and people making essential trips. A French official confirmed the contents of the discussion.
Police appeared at previously unmanned border posts, asking car drivers for a document from their employer proving travel is essential. Cargo trucks are backed up.
But the disease was already out. A resident of Switzerland who went to the meeting brought the virus back to their evangelical community near Lausanne, the Swiss federation of evangelical churches said on its website. Public health authorities in French Guyana said they found five people who had traveled to the gathering also tested positive. 
GOD'S PRESENCE
Back home in Corsica after her trip to the church gathering, Antoinette felt under the weather.
She put it down to the exertion of the trip, and carried on meeting up with other church-goers in Ajaccio. On March 2, nine days after she returned, she received a call from Mulhouse describing the outbreak there. 
She was hospitalized overnight, tested, and on March 4, became one of the first cases of COVID-19 on the French island of Corsica. She has since been in self-isolation, and her church has suspended services. As of March 27, 263 people were infected with coronavirus on Corsica, 21 of whom died. 
""People have pointed their finger at me,"" said Antoinette on March 16. ""They need a scapegoat."" She said some people outside her circle were suspicious of evangelical Christians and blamed her for bringing the virus to Corsica. Jonathan Peterschmitt, the son of the Mulhouse pastor, said others in the congregation had been subject to verbal attacks by strangers for spreading the infection, and were now fearful of revealing their identities.
By March 20, France had more than 10,000 cases of COVID-19. Around a quarter were in Grand-Est, the region that includes Mulhouse. ""The very great majority"" of these could be traced to the church, said Vernay, the local public health official. 
Because there are more critical cases than intensive care beds in the region, some patients have been flown by helicopter to Switzerland, Germany and Luxembourg. The French military have set up a field hospital inside green metal-framed tents.
At home in Ouagadougou, Pastor Karambiri and his wife, after falling ill on March 1, went to a local clinic, tested positive, and quarantined themselves until March 20.
At the end of his self-imposed period of isolation, he broadcast a message to his followers in a video posted on his organization's Facebook page. Sitting on a sofa, his bible on his lap and his wife alongside him, he told them about the infection.

The coronavirus, he said, is ""a satanic plan conceived a long time ago to destroy the world. But God is watching over us and he will lead the people out.""

BADIRAGUATO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Sunday shook hands with the mother of the country's most infamous drug trafficker, Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, during a visit to their hometown, long a stronghold of the Sinaloa cartel.
In a 30-second video posted on Twitter, Lopez Obrador can be seen approaching the passenger side of Maria Consuelo Loera's car, parked on a dirt road on the outskirts of Badiraguato, a mountainous municipality in the northwestern state of Sinaloa.
Surrounded by dozens of onlookers, Lopez Obrador told Loera that she need not get out of the car, they shook hands and after a brief exchange he told the mother of the jailed kingpin that he had ""received her letter."" He did not elaborate.
The video then showed Lopez Obrador having a chat with one of El Chapo's lawyers, Jose Luis Gonzalez Meza.
In October, Mexican officials detained Ovidio Guzman, the son of El Chapo, after shootouts with drug gangs broke out in the streets of Culiacan, a major city, but released him a short while later, drawing public criticism of security policy.
A Reuters witness said that Loera was waiting for Lopez Obrador near the hamlet of La Tuna, El Tuna, birthplace of El Chapo. The president was on an official visit with the state governor.

Numerous people criticized Lopez Obrador on Twitter for greeting El Chapo's mother and for shaking hands with the woman, who is in her 90s, especially at a time when Mexico is promoting social distancing measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

The parliament gave no reasons for the planned changes in a statement announcing the special session.
Ukraine faces a sharp economic hit from the coronavirus epidemic and President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the parliament must pass banking legislation and lift a ban on the sale of farmland to qualify for a new loan deal from the International Monetary Fund.
The vote could see Serhiy Marchenko appointed as the new finance minister, the parliamentary website showed. Marchenko worked as deputy finance minister in 2016-2018 and deputy head of the presidential office of Petro Poroshenko in 2018-2019.
The current minister Ihor Umansky, who has proposed a series of budget amendments seen by some as too radical, replaced Oksana Markarova as finance minister on March 4 following the resignation of Prime Minister Oleksiy Honcharuk.
The parliament also plans to appoint new health and energy ministers.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - President Jair Bolsonaro visited a market area just outside the Brazilian capital on Sunday to press home his case for keeping Latin America's largest economy ticking instead of locking down activities to combat the spread of the coronavirus.
But Bolsonaro office's social media campaign ""Brazil can't stop"" was banned on Saturday by a federal judge and ran into a barrage of criticism from state governors, politicians, public health experts and even his own health minister.
In Taguatinga, a low-income suburb of Brasilia, Bolsonaro stopped in a normally bustling market square to speak to a man selling barbecued meat on skewers.
""We have to work. There are deaths, but that is up to God, we cannot stop,"" the man said, according to a video posted on the president's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter accounts. ""If we do not die of the illness, we will die of hunger.""
Bolsonaro said he has maintained that Brazilians need to continue working to earn their incomes while taking precautions not to catch COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus. He also has lashed out at state and municipal officials who, in steps aimed at saving lives implemented tough lockdowns, closed non-essential businesses and banned public meetings, even in churches.
Bolsonaro told reporters he is considering an executive decree that would allow all professionals and informal sector workers to work if their income is vital to feed their families.
Despite confirmed cases of COVID-19 almost tripling in seven days to 4,256 by Saturday, Bolsonaro has continued to deny the gravity of the disease, calling it ""a small cold"" that would kill only old people. The diseases has caused 136 deaths in Brazil so far, and more than 30,000 globally.
On Friday, Bolsonaro cast doubt on the state of Sao Paulo's official death toll from the outbreak, the highest in the country, accusing the governor of manipulating the numbers for political ends.
""I'm sorry, some people will die, they will die, that's life,"" Bolsonaro said in a television interview.
The ""Brazil can't stop"" social media campaign, suggesting to most Brazilians that there was no need for isolating themselves at home, was banned by Judge Laura Bastos in Rio de Janeiro at the request of federal prosecutors.
The judge ruled Brazilians could not be encouraged to leave the isolation of their homes and return to the streets without there being a national plan to fight the pandemic.
Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta, often at odds with Bolsonaro since the president greeted supporters rallying outside his office on March 15, reinforced his opposition to all public gatherings on Saturday.
Mandetta asked the president during a cabinet meeting to stop minimizing the gravity of the epidemic, two government officials with knowledge of the meeting attended by other ministers told Reuters. They called the meeting tense.
Mandetta also told Bolsonaro that he could not defend the president's proposal to isolate only the old and the ill as a way of reducing the economic impact of the pandemic, the sources said.
At a news conference following the meeting, Mandetta said his measures will be guided by scientific experts and he called on people to stay at home because the health services cannot cope with a surge in cases of infected people.

He also said chloroquine, which is used to treat malaria and defended by Bolsonaro as a possible solution to the health crisis, is not a cure for the disease and can be toxic if used without medical advice.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Islamic State prisoners on Sunday seized control of the ground floor of a major prison in northeastern Syria run by the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), with some of the militants managing to escape, an SDF spokesman said.
The SDF, which is spearheaded by the Kurdish YPG militia, mounted an operation to capture those who fled as security forces sent reinforcements to crush the mutiny in Hasaka prison, spokesman Mustafa Bali said in a tweet.
""The situation is tense inside the prison currently and we sent anti-terror forces and additional troops to control the situation,"" Bali said.
Earlier, Syrian state television said 12 militants had fled from the prison toward the southern outskirts of Hasaka.
A U.S. led coalition spokesman confirmed a riot had taken place, adding the facility held only low level Islamic State members.
""The coalition is assisting our Syrian Democratic Forces partners with aerial surveillance as they quell an uprising at Hasakah detention facility,"" U.S led coalition spokesman Col. Myles B. Caggins III said in a tweet.
Arab tribal figures in touch with residents in the area said U.S. coalition planes were seen flying overhead in the vicinity of the prison following the incident. 
There were unconfirmed reports that several inmates had been killed in the uprising, the latest of several recent attempts to flee from SDF prisons, according to residents. 
It was not clear how many inmates were in the prison, one of several where the SDF has kept thousands of detainees, many of whose relatives say are young children and others arrested on flimsy charges or for disobeying the SDF's policy of forcible conscription. 
U.S.-based Human Rights Watch says the SDF holds about 12,000 men and boys suspected of Islamic State affiliation, including 2,000 to 4,000 foreigners from almost 50 countries.
The inmates are held in overcrowded prisons where conditions are inhumane in many cases, according to Human Rights Watch and other rights groups.
The Kurdish-led forces also hold about 100,000 Syrian and foreign women and children who are family members of militant suspects in squalid camps across the areas they control. 
Some Arabs, who form a majority of the inhabitants of the areas under the control of Syrian Kurdish YPG militia, accuse the Kurds of discrimination, an allegation rejected by Kurdish officials.
With crucial U.S. air and ground support, the SDF defeated jihadists across north and east Syria. lslamic State has resorted to guerrilla attacks since losing its last significant piece of territory in Syria last year.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Sunday that the United States would not pay for security protection for Britain's Prince Harry and his wife, Meghan, who, according to media reports, have settled in Los Angeles.
Trump wrote on Twitter that ""now they have left Canada for the U.S. however, the U.S. will not pay for their security protection. They must pay!"" In January, the couple said they would step away from their royal duties.
There is no indication that either Prince Harry or the British government has asked the U.S. government to cover security costs, which some media reports have said run to millions a year. The British Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Britain's Sun newspaper reported last week the couple took a private flight to Los Angeles, but did not say when. Earlier this month, the United States and Canada agreed to close their border to non-essential travel at land crossings to ease the strain on health systems caused by the coronavirus.
The couple had been living for several months with their son, Archie, on Vancouver Island in Canada.
Meghan Markle was raised in the Los Angeles area and her mother, Doria, still lives there. Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co said last week that Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, had narrated a nature documentary that will be released on its Disney+ streaming platform on Friday.
Last month, Canada said it would no longer provide security once the couple were no longer working members of the British royal family.
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police had been assisting London’s Metropolitan Police with security for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex ""intermittently"" since November, when the couple began a six-week vacation in Canada, Reuters reported in February.

The couple stunned the royal family in early January with an announcement they would be stepping down from their roles as senior royals, in order to gain freedom from the intense media scrutiny that has followed them for several years.

The Grand Est region was the first in France to be hit by a wave of coronavirus infections that has rapidly moved westwards to engulf the greater Paris region, where hospitals are desperately adding intensive care beds to cope with the influx.
The number of coronavirus deaths in France since March 1 climbed 13% to 2,606 on Sunday, while the total number of confirmed infections rose above 40,000. 
The specially adapted trains carried 36 patients to the Nouvelle-Acquitaine region in the southwest, where a line of ambulances waited outside Bordeaux station.
""We urgently need to relieve congestion in the region's intensive care units, because you have to stay one step ahead,"" Francois Braun, head of the SAMU paramedics, told RTL radio.
Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Saturday warned France's 67 million people that the toughest weeks in the fight against epidemic were still to come, as the number of patients on life support rose to more than 4,600. 
Hospitals are racing to add intensive care facilities, sometimes taking ventilators out of operating theaters as they build makeshift units. Student medics are being drafted in and retired doctors are returning to the wards.
President Emmanuel Macron has deployed the army to help to move the sick while a field hospital has been set up in the eastern city of Mulhouse.
Paramedics in hazmat suits loaded several patients on life-support into a German Airbus (PA:AIR) A400M aircraft in Strasbourg for transfer across the border to the German city of Ulm.
European Affairs Minister Amelie de Montchalin hailed the German aid as a symbol of European solidarity, though she expressed frustration at the failure of European Union members to agree on how to mitigate the sharp economic downturn.

WARSAW (Reuters) - The main Polish opposition candidate running for president called on Sunday for a boycott of the country's May election due to the coronavirus and completely suspended her campaign, adding to doubts about whether the vote will go ahead as planned. 
The ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party has so far stuck to the May 10 date for the presidential election despite calls to delay the vote.
On Saturday, it introduced rules on postal voting, infuriating the opposition which said changing regulations so close to the election was unconstitutional.
""Let's boycott these elections, Poles stay home, your life is the most important thing,"" Malgorzata Kidawa-Blonska, the presidential candidate of the center right Civic Platform (PO) party, told reporters, calling on other candidates to suspend their campaigns.
Incumbent President Andrzej Duda, a PiS ally, is well ahead in the polls and his election is crucial to the government's hopes of implementing its socially conservative agenda as the president holds the power to veto laws.
Critics say PiS is keen to hold the elections in May to capitalize on Duda's current strong position and avoid a later election where the fallout from the pandemic could dent his popularity.
Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, the agrarian Polish Peasants' Party's (PSL) presidential candidate, was quoted by state-run news agency PAP saying he was focusing on amendments to the government's package of anti-crisis economic measures.
Independent candidate Szymon Holownia tweeted that the government should postpone the election but that a boycott would mean giving up civil rights.
On Saturday, Duda said he hoped elections would go ahead as planned but the situation was unpredictable.
""If it did happen that the epidemic was raging... then in that situation the election date could turn out to be unsustainable, but I am counting on it that we will be able to calmly hold these elections,"" he told state-run news channel TVP Info.
Health Minister Lukasz Szumowski said on Thursday it was too early to talk about the date and that an assessment should be made in two weeks.
Nearly three-quarters of Poles believe the election should be postponed, according to an opinion poll released on Wednesday.
France and Bavaria in Germany held local elections on March 15. Jaroslaw Flis, a sociologist with the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, estimates that the Bavarian elections resulted in an around 2,000 extra coronavirus cases.

France has postponed the second round of its local elections. Doctors there have said they are bracing for a new wave of coronavirus infections after the government pressed ahead with the first round.

Prime Minister Igor Matovic's four-party center-right coalition took power on March 21 after opposition parties unseated the long-ruling Smer party in a February election. 
New finance minister Eduard Heger said the aid package, under which the state will pay 80% of wages for employees at firms forced to shut, would be the biggest in Slovak history.
The state will also contribute help to self-employed people and employees in firms that suffer falling revenue, with payments linked to the size of the revenue drop.
Employers will be allowed to postpone their contributions to state social and health systems and delay some tax payments if they suffer a 40% drop in revenue. 
Firms can also offset accumulated losses from past years going back to 2014 against corporate income tax.
On top of the direct aid, the state will offer firms bank guarantees of up to 500 million euros a month.
Slovakia, which has a population of 5.5 million, has so far reported 314 cases of coronavirus and is ramping up testing. Most shops and restaurants have been closed as part of measures to contain the virus's spread while a number of factories, including the country's four car plants, have idled production.
While central Europe is seeing fewer cases of coronavirus than bigger western neighbors like Germany or Italy, the outbreak is set to take a toll on economies that are geared largely towards the car industry and supply chains. 
The central bank has predicted the economy will contract by anything between 1.4% and 9.4% this year.
Slovakia had a budget deficit of 2.2 billion euro in 2019. This year's draft budget saw a 2.8 billion euro gap but officials have not estimated what further impact the coronavirus outbreak might have.
The neighboring Czech Republic has made plans for a five-fold increase in its state budget deficit.

MUMBAI (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked the nation's poor for forgiveness on Sunday, as the economic and human toll from his 21-day nationwide lockdown deepens and criticism mounts about a lack of adequate planning ahead of the decision.
Modi announced a three week-lockdown on Tuesday to curb the spread of coronavirus. But the decision has stung millions of India's poor, leaving many hungry and forcing jobless migrant laborers to flee cities and walk hundreds of kilometers to their native villages.
""I would firstly like to seek forgiveness from all my countrymen,"" Modi said in a nationwide radio address.
The poor ""would definitely be thinking what kind of prime minister is this, who has put us into so much trouble,"" he said, urging people to understand there was no other option. 
""Steps taken so far… will give India victory over corona,"" he added. 
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in India rose to 979 on Sunday, with 25 deaths. 
The government announced a $22.6 billion economic stimulus plan on Thursday to provide direct cash transfers and food handouts to India's poor. 
In an opinion piece published on Sunday, Abhijit Banerjee and Esther Duflo - two of the three winners of the Nobel Prize in Economics in 2019 - said even more aid for the poor is needed.
""Without that, the demand crisis will snowball into an economic avalanche, and people will have no choice but to defy orders,"" they wrote in the Indian Express. 
The lockdown is expected to exacerbate India's economic woes at a time when growth had already slumped to its lowest pace in six years. 
MIGRANT CRISIS 
There still appears to be broad support for strong measures to avoid a coronavirus catastrophe in India, a country of some 1.3 billion people where the public health system is poor. 
But opposition leaders, analysts and some citizens are increasingly criticizing its implementation. In particular, they say the government appears to have been caught off guard by the mass movement of migrants following the announcement, which threatens to spread the disease into the hinterlands. 
""The Gov't had no contingency plans in place for this exodus,"" tweeted opposition politician Rahul Gandhi as images of migrant laborers walking long distances to return home dominated local media. 
#ModiMadeDisaster was a top trending topic in India on Sunday on social media site Twitter. 
Police said four migrants were killed on Saturday when a truck ran into them in the western state of Maharashtra. Also on Saturday, a migrant collapsed and died in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, according to a police official.
""We will die of walking and starving before getting killed by corona,"" said migrant worker Madhav Raj, 28, as he walked by the road in Uttar Pradesh. 
On Sunday, several hundred migrants in the town of Paippad, in southern Kerala state, gathered in a square demanding transport back to their hometowns.
The central government has called on states to provide marooned laborers with food and shelter, and Modi's supporters slammed state governments on Twitter for failing to properly implement the lockdown.
In India's cities, too, anger was rising.
""We have no food or drink. I am sat down thinking how to feed my family,"" said homemaker Amirbee Shaikh Yusuf, 50, in Mumbai's sprawling Dharavi slum. 
""There is nothing good about this lockdown. People are angry, no one is caring for us.""
Following is the spread of the coronavirus in South Asia's eight nations, according to government figures: 
* Pakistan has registered 1,526 cases, including 13 deaths. 
* India has registered 979 cases, including 25 deaths. 
* Sri Lanka has registered 115 cases, including one death.

Saudi Arabia, which has the highest tally at over 1,200, imposed entry and exit bans on Jeddah, after doing so for Riyadh, Mecca and Medina last week, state news SPA reported.[S8N25U02O]
The kingdom late on Saturday extended indefinitely its suspension of international passenger flights and a bar on workplace attendance in both public and private sectors.
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have imposed partial curfews and the UAE has put in place an overnight curfew until April 5 under a nationwide campaign to sterilize streets and public venues.
UAE Attorney-General Hamad Saif Al Shamsi issued a statement detailing coronavirus-related fines, including 50,000 dirhams ($13,613) for non-compliance with home quarantine orders and 3,000 dirhams for individuals violating curfew.
The UAE, the region's tourism and business hub, has also halted passenger flights at its main airports, except for evacuation trips. Kuwait has done the same.

Bahrain said it would send a charter flight on Sunday to evacuate 31 citizens who had been received by Qatar after traveling to Doha from Iran, one of the epicenters of the disease.
They are unable to fly directly from Qatar to Bahrain, which is among four countries that have boycotted Doha since mid-2017. Qatar said on Saturday it had offered to send the group home on a chartered flight for free but that Bahrain refused.
Bahrain, which has struggled to source charter flights willing to go to Iran, said in a statement it was working to repatriate all its citizens and asked Doha ""not to interfere"".

300,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 29, 2020 06:45AM ET</span>","WHO says following Taiwan virus response closely, after complaints","TAIPEI (Reuters) - The World Health Organization (WHO) is closely following the development of the coronavirus in Taiwan and is learning lessons from how they are fighting it, the body said on Sunday, after complaints from Taiwan it was being intentionally ignored.
Taiwan is not a member of the WHO due to the objections of China, which claims the democratic and separately-ruled island as its own. 
Taiwan's government has said that keeping it out of the WHO during the outbreak amounts to playing politics with Taiwanese lives. Both the WHO and China say Taiwan has been provided with the help it needs.
Taiwan last week said the WHO ignored its questions at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, part of what it has long described as a pattern that puts it at risk because of Chinese pressure to exclude it from international bodies.
Taiwan has reported 298 cases, far lower than many of its neighbors, and has won plaudits from health experts for its early response and measures to keep the numbers low.
On Sunday, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu tweeted a complaint to the WHO, following an interview WHO Assistant Director-General Bruce Aylward did with a Hong Kong reporter in which he declined to answer questions about Taiwan and whether it should be a WHO member.
""Wow, can't even utter 'Taiwan' in the WHO? You should set politics aside in dealing with a pandemic,"" Wu wrote. 
In an emailed statement, the WHO said the question of Taiwan's membership is up to member states not its own staff.
""However, WHO is working closely with all health authorities who are facing the current coronavirus pandemic, including Taiwanese health experts,"" it said. 
""The Taiwanese caseload is low relative to population. We continue to follow developments closely. WHO is taking lessons learned from all areas, including Taiwanese health authorities, to share best practices globally.""
The WHO has been working with Taiwanese health experts and authorities during the virus outbreak ""following established procedures to facilitate a fast and effective response and ensure connection and information flow"".
Taiwan gets access to information under the International Health Regulations and two Taiwanese health experts took part in a WHO-organized forum last month along other scientists from around the world on how to tackle the coronavirus, it added.

""WHO staff work around the world to respond to this pandemic with the best evidence-based guidance and operational support available for all people, based on public health needs.""

Residents in Riyadh reported multiple blasts around 2320 (2020 GMT), followed by emergency vehicle sirens in some northern districts.
The source of the projectiles was unclear and there was no immediate claim of responsibility.
Yemen's Iran-aligned Houthis battling the Saudi-led coalition have launched hundreds of missiles and drones across the border, mostly at nearby military and civilian targets but also at Riyadh. The last attempted strike on the capital was in June 2018.
Saudi Arabia blamed Iran for a September 2019 drone and missile attack on two oil installations that initially halved Saudi oil output, even after the Houthis claimed responsibility. Tehran denies involvement.
The Saudi-led coalition intervened in Yemen's civil war in 2015 to try to restore the internationally-recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, ousted by the Houthis in 2014. Tens of thousands of people have died in the conflict that is widely seen as a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea fired what appeared to be two short-range ballistic missiles into the ocean off its east coast on Sunday, the latest in an unprecedented flurry of launches that South Korea decried as ""inappropriate"" amid the global coronavirus pandemic.
Two ""short-range projectiles"" were launched from the coastal Wonsan area, and flew 230 kilometers (143 miles) at a maximum altitude of 30 kilometers (19 miles), South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff reported.
""In a situation where the entire world is experiencing difficulties due to COVID-19, this kind of military act by North Korea is very inappropriate and we call for an immediate halt,"" South Korea's JCS said in a statement, according to Yonhap news agency.
Japan's Ministry of Defense said they appeared to be ballistic missiles, and they did not land in Japanese territory or its exclusive economic zone.
They would be the eighth and ninth missiles launched in four rounds of tests this month as North Korean troops conduct ongoing military drills, usually personally overseen by leader Kim Jong Un.
That would be the most missiles ever fired in a single month by North Korea, according to a tally by Shea Cotton, senior researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies.
""Coming this early in the year, the only time we've seen tests this frequently were in 2016 and 2017, both of which were huge years for North Korea's missile program,"" he said in a post on Twitter.
All of the missiles fired so far this year have been small, short-range weapons, such as the KN-24 fired during the last launch on March 21.
But Kim has warned that North Korea is developing a new ""strategic weapon"" to be unveiled this year, with analysts speculating that it could be a new long-range ballistic missile, or a submarine capable of launching such missiles.
United Nations Security Council resolutions bar North Korea from testing ballistic missiles, and the country has been heavily sanctioned over its missile and nuclear weapons programs.
MILITARY DRILLS CONTINUE
This month's military drills have been conducted despite a border lockdown and quarantine measures imposed in North Korea in an effort to prevent an outbreak of the new coronavirus.
South Korea and the United States have postponed some of their joint military exercises because of the coronavirus outbreak in South Korea.
Politically and economically isolated, North Korea has not reported any confirmed cases, though some foreign experts have expressed doubts.
In the past, North Korea has typically conducted military drills, including tests of its ballistic missiles, in March as the wintry weather turns warmer. For the previous two years, however, it had avoided such springtime launches amid denuclearisation talks with the United States.
Those talks have since stalled, and this year's string of tests and military drills appear aimed at underscoring North Korea's return to a more hard-line policy, said Ankit Panda, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Federation of American Scientists.

""There is an element of projecting a business-as-usual image amid the COVID-19 situation, but I think it's not overriding,"" he said. ""These tests do allow Kim Jong Un to show that he's sticking to the hard-line policy he laid out in December 2019.""

CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The former head of Venezuela's military intelligence unit, Hugo Carvajal, is discussing his possible surrender with U.S. authorities, three people familiar with the matter said on Saturday, after prosecutors charged him this week with drug trafficking alongside Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
Carvajal, a former general and ally of late Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez, has been in hiding since a Spanish court in November approved his extradition to the United States. It was unclear when or if he would surrender as the people said talks were ongoing.
One person familiar with the matter said U.S. authorities were in touch with Carvajal through a non-governmental intermediary trying to convince him to turn himself in, and there was a ""50/50 chance"" it would succeed.
Carvajal's lawyer in Spain, Maria Dolores Arguelles, said she was not aware of discussions over his surrender. 
U.S. officials have long sought Carvajal because they believe, if he is willing to cooperate, that he could provide a treasure trove of information on the alleged drug activities of Maduro and his associates.
The U.S. State Department and Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA declined to comment. The Justice Department did not return requests to comment. Spain's Justice Ministry declined to comment.
On Friday, DEA agents flew to Colombia to remand in custody retired Venezuelan general Cliver Alcala, three people familiar with the matter said, after he agreed to work with prosecutors who charged him in the same case.
The U.S. government on Thursday indicted Carvajal, Alcala, Maduro, and a dozen other current and former Venezuelan officials on charges of ""narco-terrorism"", the latest escalation of a pressure campaign by U.S. President Donald Trump administration to oust the socialist leader.
Attorney General William Barr accused Maduro and his associates of colluding with a dissident faction of the demobilized Colombian guerrilla group, the FARC, ""to flood the United States with cocaine.""
Carvajal has repeatedly denied accusations he helped smuggle cocaine to the United States. During an extradition hearing in September, Carvajal said Washington was fabricating the drug trafficking charges to make him talk.
Since leaving Venezuela, Carvajal has denounced Maduro and given his support to opposition leader Juan Guaido, who has staked a rival claim to the Venezuelan presidency with U.S. support.

Carvajal was arrested by Spanish police in April 2019 at the request of U.S. authorities but Spain's High Court initially ruled that he should be released and his extradition request denied. The court reversed that decision in November.

Hailing from the Ile-de-France region, the 14-strong group, which includes eight minors, arrived in Murmansk, 1,480 kilometers (920 miles) north of Moscow, on March 12 to play opponents from Russia, Ireland and the Netherlands. 
But the tournament was derailed when an Irish player was diagnosed with the coronavirus, forcing other participants into quarantine.
Jurriaan Kien, an official accompanying the French players, told Reuters from quarantine in a Murmansk hospital on Saturday that the group are due to return to France on Monday despite Russia having grounded all international flights. 
He said that he had received assurances from the airline that their flight from Moscow had so far not been canceled. 
""We have a Plan B because we are chess players and always anticipate the next move,"" Kien said. ""If for some reason we arrive in Moscow and we can't leave, we will be hosted at the French embassy's residence in Moscow. They have already prepared 14 beds.""
The group has kept a regular schedule while in quarantine, where they have all been tested three times for the virus and were found to be healthy. Each day they follow their school curriculum, practice English, hold a French dictation and play chess. 
Russia, which has recorded 1,264 cases of coronavirus, has halted all international flights and on Saturday said it would be closing all border checkpoints from Monday. [L8N2BL0EA]
Chess grandmaster Maxime Vachier-Lagrave, currently ranked eighth in the world, returned to France this week from a tournament in Yekaterinburg, a city 1,400 kilometers (885 miles) east of Moscow, just as all international flights were being suspended. 
Vachier-Lagrave was tied for the lead in the Candidates Tournament, which brought together contenders vying for the chance to challenge defending world champion Magnus Carlsen of Norway for the world title, when it was abruptly suspended on Thursday because foreign participants were at risk of remaining stranded in Russia. [L8N2BJ88J]

""We made the effort to come play because this is a very important tournament, but we knew there was a chance it would not be completed,"" Vachier-Lagrave told Reuters from his home in Paris. ""You just have to remain calm and wait for the world to do better. Then when everything is resolved, we can play chess again.""

SERIATE, Italy (Reuters) - When he became a priest 40 years ago, Father Mario Carminati knew he would be dealing with death - but not on an industrial scale.
Coffins bearing deceased parishioners no longer leave one at a time in a shiny hearse after a funeral every week or so.
Now, because of the coronavirus outbreak, clusters of coffins arrive every day and are laid on the cold marble floor of St. Joseph's Church.
""Authorities didn't know where to put the coffins,"" said Carminati, 64, the senior priest in Seriate, a tranquil, middle-class riverside town of 25,000 people in northern Italy.
When enough have accumulated, he and others priests give them a hasty blessing and then a forklift loads them on to army trucks to cemeteries and crematoria.
Gatherings have been banned throughout Italy because of a national lockdown so church funerals cannot be held.
Seriate is in Bergamo province, the hardest hit in Italy's northern Lombardy region and the epicenter of the outbreak.
With the national death toll topping 9,000 on Friday, Italy has suffered almost twice as many deaths as any other nation.
The priest said the saddest thing for him was that many of his parishioners died alone, without loved ones, because restrictions in place to stem the spread of the virus do not allow family members into hospitals.
""We often talk about the most needy and these are truly the most needy now,"" he said outside the church after blessing about 40 coffins along with a younger priest, Father Marcello Crotti.
""They are the most needy even though they are no longer alive. No one has the time or opportunity to take care of them anymore so I decided to open the house of the Lord to them,"" Carminati said.
It is a short stay. After Carminati and Crotti blessed the latest batch of coffins on Saturday, army troops in protective gear loaded them onto five trucks covered by camouflaged tarps.
Bells tolled as the trucks left the church and residents looking down from windows and balconies made the sign of the cross.

As the caravan crossed an intersection, a town policeman wearing a medical mask and white gloves stood at attention and saluted.

The camp centered around Martyrs Square (NYSE:SQ) had mostly fallen dormant in recent months as the protests waned. Lebanon this week tightened measures to restrict movement as part of its effort to curb the spread of coronavirus. 
Security forces began pulling down tents on Friday night, meeting resistance from several dozen protesters who were still camped out. One protester set himself on fire before being quickly smothered in blankets by members of the security forces, a Reuters witness said. 
On Saturday, a handful of protesters took away furniture used during the sit-in. Although Martyrs' Square was reopened to traffic, a security source said roads leading to the nearby Riyad al-Solh Square remained closed.
The government declared a medical emergency on March 15 to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
This week it banned people from leaving their homes from 7pm to 5am. Lebanon has recorded 412 cases of coronavirus and eight deaths. 
Martyrs' Square was a focal point of large nationwide protests that erupted on Oct. 17.
Fueled by the corruption and bad governance of Lebanon's ruling elite, the protests cut across sectarian divisions and led to Saad al-Hariri quitting as prime minister, toppling his government.
Lebanon has sunk deep into a long-brewing economic crisis since October.

The heavily-indebted state this month declared it could not meet its foreign debt repayments. The local currency has sunk more than 40% against the dollar.

KABUL/PESHAWAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - The Taliban declined on Saturday to begin talks with the Afghan government's new negotiating team in a setback to the U.S.-brokered peace process for one of the world's longest-running conflicts.
Spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said the militants could not talk to the 21-member team named on Thursday as it was not constituted taking into account all parties.
The team is headed by Masoom Stanekzai, an ex-security chief and supporter of President Ashraf Ghani, and includes politicians, former officials and representatives of civil society. Five members are women.
""In order to reach true and lasting peace, the aforementioned team must be agreed upon by all effective Afghan sides so that it can represent all sides,"" said Mujahid. 
The United States, which ousted the Taliban from power in 2001, signed a troop withdrawal deal with the group in February.
But progress on moving to talks between the militants and the Afghan government has been delayed by a feud between Afghan politicians, and disagreement between the Taliban and the government prisoner releases and a possible ceasefire.
Afghan ministry of peace affairs spokeswoman Najia Anwari said the Taliban's stance was unjustified as the negotiating team was made after wide consultations among Afghan society.
Ghani's political rival Abdullah Abdullah has not confirmed whether he will support the delegation, potentially important given his camp's strong influence in the north and west. 
Abdullah's spokesman Fraidoon Khwazoon said that though the announced list was not final and there were ""considerations that needed to be addressed"", it should not be rejected outright.
""All sides including the Taliban should try not to lose the available opportunity for peace, by make illogical excuses. The Taliban should not lose the current opportunity.""
The U.S. Embassy did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Saturday.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to mediate between Abdullah and Ghana to create an ""inclusive"" government during a visit to Kabul on Monday, and announced a $1 billion cut in U.S. aid to Afghanistan, which he said could be reversed.

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's parliament passed a law early on Saturday allowing postal voting for senior citizens and those in quarantine or self-isolating as the government looks to press ahead with May presidential elections which opposition parties want postponed.
Poland is due to hold the first round of its presidential election on May 10, with incumbent Andrzej Duda, an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party, expected to win.
Opposition parties have called for the vote to be postponed due to the coronavirus.
""PiS at all costs is preparing for the election on May 10. It's 2 a.m. ...they want to change the electoral code,"" Borys Budka, leader of the largest opposition party Civic Platform (PO) tweeted.
PiS lawmakers said the change to the electoral code, an unexpected last-minute addition to a package of measures designed to shield the economy from the effects of the coronavirus, would help the election go ahead safely.
""After several weeks of attacks that the election will endanger senior citizens and that those in quarantine will not be able to vote... of course, the opposition is vehemently attacking the amendment,"" tweeted PiS lawmaker Marcin Horala.
ELECTRONIC VOTE
Lawmakers voted online for the first time ever to pass the ""anti-crisis shield"" package after watching speakers in a largely empty chamber by video-link.
Members of different parties were put into separate rooms in the parliament complex to vote on the package, which is worth over 200 billion zlotys ($49 billion), while others voted from home. 
Opposition lawmakers complained of problems logging in to the online voting system.
""Our anti-crisis shield is a good instrument for this stage of coronavirus development... We must act quickly, we must act as soon as possible, we want to make these instruments work in the coming days,"" Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said on Friday.
The package comprises a mix of spending and liquidity measures designed to protect workers and companies from the effects of a crisis that economists fear could cost tens of millions of jobs around the globe.
Poland has already introduced sweeping measures to limit the spread of the virus, closing schools, banning outside gatherings of more than two people, excluding families, and imposing a lockdown to prevent people leaving home except for essential purposes.

China said on March 18 it was revoking the press accreditations of all American journalists in the China bureaus of the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post, which were due to expire at the end of 2020.
Beijing also said those affected would not be allowed to work as journalists in the Chinese-run city of Hong Kong. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of, or barred from, mainland China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.
""As @nytimes, @WSJ & @washingtonpost face intensifying hostility in China, I'd like to welcome you to be stationed in Taiwan - a country that is a beacon of freedom & democracy,"" Wu wrote on Twitter. 
""Yes! You'll find people here greeting you with open arms & lots of genuine smiles.""
Taiwan is home to only a small number of permanent foreign correspondents, and none of the three newspapers has a full-time presence on the island currently.
While Chinese-claimed Taiwan is a freewheeling democracy with freedom of expression, it has stepped up border controls to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, and generally only foreigners already holding residence permits are currently allowed entry.
China has laid the blame for the situation with the three newspapers at Washington's door, for first restricting the number of Chinese media in the United States.
Last month, Washington demanded journalists from Chinese state media be registered as staff of diplomatic missions, saying it was a response to the growing crackdown on independent reporting in China.
China then expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters - two Americans and an Australian - after the paper published an opinion column calling China the ""real sick man of Asia"".
In an open letter published earlier this week, the three publishers urged China to reconsider the move, saying it was ""uniquely damaging and reckless"" at a time when the world is sharing the burden of fighting the coronavirus.

China hit out at what it called ""biased"" reporting on Friday in a frosty response to that request.

President Tayyip Erdogan called on Friday for a ""voluntary quarantine"" in which Turks stay at home except for shopping or basic needs. Announcing new measures to contain the virus, he said all international flights were stopped and that intercity travel would be subject to a governor's approval.
Turkish Airlines CEO Bilal Eksi said domestic flights would only operate from Ankara and Istanbul to certain big cities as of midnight Saturday. He said passengers would need to receive permission from the governor's office after 1400 GMT.
""As of Saturday 23:59, our domestic flights will be carried out from Istanbul Airport and Ankara Esenboga Airport. Our domestic flights list will be prepared and announced during the day,"" Eksi wrote on Twitter.

It said citizens would need to apply to the Travel Permission Council, tied to the local governor's office, to travel. All bus terminals will be equipped with medical personnel to carry out regular checks on workers and passengers, it added.

TOKYO (Reuters) - People in greater Tokyo and the Osaka area in western Japan hunkered down on Saturday as officials urged citizens to stay indoors to prevent a potential emergency, but some were carrying on as normal.
Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike's plea for the tens of millions of people in the capital and surrounding regions to avoid non-essential, non-urgent outings until April 12, and particularly this weekend, followed a surge in coronavirus infections this week that she said put Tokyo on the brink of an emergency.
Koike urged the public to avoid the national pastime of congregating to drink and watch the cherry blossoms as they hit their peak in the capital, saying on Friday, ""The cherry blossoms will bloom again next year.""
Infections in Japan have climbed to more than 1,400, with 47 deaths, excluding those from a cruise ship quarantined last month. Hit early by the coronavirus in its initial spread from China, Japan had seen a more gradual rise than the recent surge in much of Europe and the United States. 
This week, however, saw an acceleration that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called ""a national crisis"".
Infections on Friday rose by a daily record 102, said public broadcaster NHK. Tokyo reported 40 new cases on Friday, bringing its total to 299. 
While those figures are not high for a city of nearly 14 million, with many millions more in neighboring suburbs, experts warn of a high risk of an explosive rise in infections, since authorities have not been able to track all the contacts of more than half the newest cases.
The government has deployed the military to greater Tokyo's Narita and Haneda airports to assist in virus screenings and the transport of people placed in quarantine, NHK said. 
The voluntary calls by Koike and other Japanese leaders for people to stay at home compares with the more rigors lockdowns in major cities in Italy, Britain, France, Spain, and the United States - the new global epicenter of the virus.
Globally, infections have topped half a million with more than 20,000 deaths, with the contagion affecting more than 100 countries. 
Abe, who has not declared a national state of emergency, is expected to order economic steps including $135 billion or more in spending, government officials and lawmakers say, joining policymakers globally trying to blunt a downturn. 
In a quiet neighborhood close to the prime minister's private residence in central Tokyo, the scene was typical of a Saturday morning. Some people were jogging and walking their dogs. A few stopped to pray at a local shrine. Auto traffic was brisk on local roads.
""I'm a little worried, but I have an appointment today, which is why I'm outside,"" said a 41-year old man walking down the street, who declined to be named.
""It's not something that I can't cancel, but I do have to meet someone. I will be riding the train later.""
Trains weren't empty but were far less crowded than on a normal weekend. Some department stores, movie theaters, museums and parks closed, but many supermarkets and convenience stores were open as usual.
In Setagaya, a popular residential area in western Tokyo, many restaurants and shops were shut, although those that were open were doing brisk business, including an Italian restaurant that was filled with some young families and older couples.
Nearby, laborers worked on a construction site as if it were a normal day.

""We have to stay in our homes, we have to keep a healthy distance,"" Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said in a 14-minute video on YouTube, warning that the health system may not be able to cope with a mass outbreak of cases, although Mexico has so far registered far fewer cases than other countries. 
Mexican health officials reported 717 cases of coronavirus on Friday, up from 585 a day before. The country has reported 12 deaths from the disease so far. 
""If we don't stay inside our homes the number of infection cases could shoot up, and it would saturate our hospitals,"" he said. ""It would be overwhelming."" 
Lopez Obrador also acknowledged that the economic impact of a major outbreak would be worse in the long run if companies don't send employees home, changing tack after warning earlier that a business shutdown could cause more damage than the virus. 
""I know this is going to mean costs, but we could be losing more. Without prevention, the economy could fall even more,"" he said. Mexico slipped into recession last year, and the struggling economy was one factor that pushed the president's approval rating below 50% for the first time in a poll on Friday. 
Lopez Obrador has also drawn criticism in recent weeks by holding mass rallies around Mexico and hugging and kissing supporters - even as his own medical experts urged people to avoid physical contact. 

Friday's comments, however, reinforced the president's graver tone on the pandemic in the past few days. All non-essential federal government activities have been halted and he has taken care to preserve at least a meter of distance with other officials even as he continues his usual travel around the country.

QUITO/GUAYAQUIL (Reuters) - Ecuadorean authorities have removed 100 corpses from homes in the city of Guayaquil in three days, the interior minister said on Friday, following residents' complaints that they have no way to dispose of relatives' remains amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The coastal city has the country's largest concentration of COVID-19 cases as well as a heavy presence of military officers enforcing curfew prompted by a nationwide health emergency declaration.
Interior Minister Maria Paula Romo said on Friday that the curfew had restricted funeral homes' operating hours and left some family members with no choice but to keep deceased relatives in their homes. 
""Some of these deaths are related to the coronavirus and others were not,"" she said in an interview with online broadcaster MaxTv. 
Ecuador as of Friday had reported 1,627 infections and 41 deaths from the novel coronavirus. More than 70% of the cases are in the province of Guayas, where Guayaquil is located.
Romo acknowledged most of those who had died in their homes had not been tested for the virus, and therefore would not appear in the official tally of deaths.
On social media and in interviews with local media, Guayaquil residents have complained of delays of more than 24 hours to remove the remains of relatives, which they said was creating the risk of the disease spreading further.
One such case was that of Bolivar Reyes, 43, a juice merchant, who died after suffering symptoms consistent with COVID-19 but was never tested, his wife Rosa Romero said in a telephone interview. 
His remains stayed inside her home in a poor area of northern Guayaquil for more than a day because crews tasked with removing bodies were unable to keep up, she said.
""They told me to be patient, that they hadn't been able to arrive because they only had a single vehicle that needed to go to a number of places,"" said Romero. 
""The neighbors told me that if I didn't get rid of (the remains), they were going to burn down my house.""

Macron also called for stronger budget solidarity in Europe.
""France is alongside Italy,"" Macron said in a interview to Italian newspapers La Repubblica, Corriere della Sera, and La Stampa.
""There is a lot of talk about Chinese or Russian aid, but why don't we say that France and Germany have delivered 2 million masks and tens of thousands gowns to Italy?"" Macron said.
""It is not sufficient, but this is just a start and we must not let ourselves be intoxicated with what our international partners and competitors say"".
Italy, one of the countries worst-hit by the virus worldwide, was sharply critical of France and Germany after they initially declined to provide face masks and other equipment to help handle the outbreak.
Rome turned instead for help to China, which sent an airplane full of masks and ventilators bearing ""Forza Italia"" stickers with small Chinese and Italian flags - and leaving a powerful impression on Italians. 
""Europe must feel proud and strong, because it is. But it must indeed go much further. This is why I defend budget solidarity in the management of this crisis and of its consequences,"" Macron added.

""What worries me is the illness of every man for himself: if we do not show solidarity, Italy, Spain or others would be able to say to their European partners: where have you been when we were at the front? I do not want this selfish and divided Europe"".

Finland's government decided on Wednesday to issue a three-week blockade of the region around Helsinki, the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak in Finland, to prevent people from travelling and spreading the virus elsewhere in the country. But the decision needed parliament's approval, which it granted unanimously late on Friday.
Traffic began to jam towards evening on the motorways leading out from the capital region, Uusimaa, as police began blocking lanes with bollards and fences at roughly 30 makeshift checkpoints, local media reported.
Meanwhile in Helsinki, legislators at the parliament debated the law throughout the evening as it got delayed due to constitutional technicalities earlier on Friday.
Travelling to and from the Uusimaa region will be prohibited until April 19, with certain exceptions such as goods deliveries and indispensable work-related commuting. 
By Friday, authorities had counted seven deaths and 1,025 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Finland, most of them in the capital region.
Last week, Finland restricted traffic across its borders, banned public meetings of more than 10 people, closed schools for most pupils and urged people to stay at home as much as possible.
Earlier on Friday, the government decided to introduce stricter controls and 14-day quarantine rules for residents who return from abroad.

Due to the coronavirus outbreak, Finland will also temporarily suspend its operations in Iraq, where some 80 Finnish soldiers have participated in international counter terrorism efforts by training Kurdish peshmerga troops, the Finnish army said.

CARACAS/BOGOTA (Reuters) - U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency agents flew to Colombia on Friday to take into custody Cliver Alcala, a retired Venezuelan general indicted for drug trafficking along with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, two DEA source familiar with the operation told Reuters.
Alcala surrendered to the DEA and waived his extradition, after agreeing to collaborate with prosecutors, the DEA sources said. The DEA agents are flying back to the United States with Alcala this evening from the Colombian port city of Barranquilla, where Alcala now lives, the sources said.
Two Colombian law enforcement officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed there was a DEA flight scheduled to leave Colombia tonight, though they declined to give more details.
Spokespeople for the DEA, U.S. State and Justice Departments, and Colombia's National Police did not immediately reply to requests for comment.
The U.S. government on Thursday indicted Maduro, Alcala and more than a dozen other top Venezuelan officials on charges of ""narco-terrorism"", the latest escalation of the Trump administration's pressure campaign aimed at ousting the socialist leader.
Attorney General William Barr accused Maduro and his associates of colluding with a dissident faction of the demobilized Colombian guerrilla group, the FARC, ""to flood the United States with cocaine.""
The U.S. State Department had offered a reward of up to $10 million for information leading to Alcala's arrest. There is a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to Maduro's detention.
Alcala told the DEA on Thursday evening that he would give himself up, one DEA source said.
Alcala retired from the armed forces as Maduro took over the presidency in 2013, after Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez died of cancer.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - It's not just protective facemasks that are in short supply: health workers in U.S. hospitals are reporting dwindling stocks of drugs, catheters and other medical miscellany vital for caring for a surge in patients stricken by the coronavirus outbreak.
Marney Gruber, a doctor who works in emergency rooms around New York City, said a number of commonly used medications are in short supply, and at least one hospital had run out of central line kits, which are used to administer drugs to patients in intensive care.
""Never ever before have I heard of that being an issue,"" Gruber said in an interview on Friday. ""These are staples in emergency medicine and ICUs. These are your bread and butter, truly, your very basic essentials.""
Hospitals have quickly begun to strain under the surge as the city has become the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. At least 366 people have died in the city from the virus this month, and more than 4,700 people have been hospitalized.
The drugs running low include midazolam and fentanyl, both of which can be used to sedate patients whose lungs have been damaged by the new virus and need a mechanical ventilator to function, Gruber said. 
The hospitals are also short on Levophed, which treats low blood pressure and heart problems, and Albuterol inhalers, which normally treat asthma but appear to help those suffering from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus.
In addition to ventilators, some hospitals are running out of oxygen tanks, Gruber said. Patients normally only use the tanks when being transported from one part of the hospital to another, but with wall-mounted oxygen units all taken, doctors have been hooking COVID-19 patients up to the tanks in intensive care unit rooms.
PLEADING FOR CLOROX WIPES
Shortages of vital protective equipment for health workers, including N95 respirator masks that fit tightly over the nose and mouth, have been widely reported in recent weeks, caused in part by poor stockpiling efforts and by disruptions in global supply chains.
But vanishing supplies of other medical resources are alarming nurses and doctors in hospitals around the country.
Dr. Kent Collin, the medical director at the emergency department of the St. Joseph Mercy Chelsea Hospital in Chelsea, Michigan, sent an email to a neighborhood mailing list soliciting donations of disinfecting wipes, which he said he could pick up from doorsteps.  
""If anyone would be willing to part with your Clorox wipes, any help would be appreciated,"" he wrote. ""Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is completely out at this time or else I would not have bothered you guys.""
Mary MacDonald, a nurse at the Ascension Providence Hospital in Novi, Michigan, said tearfully in a video uploaded to Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) that she was seeing her workplace run out of fentanyl and propofol, another drug used to sedate patients on ventilators, as well as the basic painkiller acetaminophen, commonly known as Tylenol. 
""This is truly scary and nobody's taking it seriously,"" she said.
A spokesman for the hospital did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but the hospital told the Detroit News in a statement that it was ""taking proactive steps with our distributor and suppliers to ensure access to supplies.""
Simpler necessities are running short, too. In New Jersey, Dr. Lisa, who asked to be identified by her first name because she was not authorized to speak with journalists, recalled a kind offer from her aunt to make face masks after reading about the shortages.
Dr. Lisa told her the masks she needs cannot be made, but she could use more scrub caps to protect her hair.
""Well, we can make that,"" she recalled her aunt saying. ""We know how to sew. Send me a pattern.""
Within five minutes, her aunt had recruited other relatives to pitch in, and they mailed out 10 homemade scrub hats for her and her co-workers.

""That's the beauty that you see in people,"" Dr. Lisa said.

Footage from private broadcaster TVN 24 showed crowds of people, many wearing face masks, waiting outside the railway station in the city of Przemysl to cross the border.
""All this doesn't meet the Sanepid (Sanitary Epidemiological Service) or Health Ministry recommendations. The expanded restrictions ban gatherings of more than two people, allow only essential travel, and look what you see behind,"" the mayor of Przemysl, Wojciech Bakun, said.
Serhyi Tymchuk, a 32-year-old electrician, queued for hours at the border crossing in Korczowa before giving up and returning to his workplace in Leszno, central Poland. 
""Frankly speaking, I was shocked by what I saw at the border. ... I have not seen such a horror,"" he said. ""If people had followed the distance rule and stood 1.5 metres away from each other, the line would have reached Krakow."" 
THOUSANDS PER DAY
Around 3,500 people were lined up at the Korczowa crossing in southeastern Poland, 74 km (46 miles) west of the Ukrainian city of Lviv, to cross the border to Ukraine.
""We are observing an exodus of Ukrainian citizens in recent days with 3,500 to 5,000 people leaving Poland via the Korczowa crossing a day,"" said Major Elzbieta Pikor, a regional spokeswoman for the Polish border guard.
Between 1 million and 2 million Ukrainians are estimated to live or work in Poland. Many Ukrainian workers, who plug labour gaps in industries like construction and farming, enter Poland on temporary visas for a few months at a time and then return home.
Poland last week closed its borders to foreigners in an effort to curtail the spread of the coronavirus. And with Ukraine to close its borders, too, on Friday night, many Ukrainians are trying to get home out of fear the border barriers will be closed for good.

The last charter flights carrying Ukrainians returning from abroad are landing on Friday. But authorities in Kiev have said that all citizens coming back from Poland who manage to get to the border will be allowed to cross it entering into Ukraine also after Friday.

323,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 05:35PM ET</span>","Exclusive: Iranian diplomats instigated killing of dissident in Istanbul, Turkish officials say","ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Two intelligence officers at Iran's consulate in Turkey instigated the killing last November of an Iranian dissident in Istanbul who criticized the Islamic Republic's political and military leaders, two senior Turkish officials told Reuters.
The accusation is likely to strain ties between Turkey and Iran, two regional powers which had grown closer under the government of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan.
Masoud Molavi Vardanjani was shot dead on an Istanbul street on Nov. 14, 2019, a little over a year after the Turkish officials say he left Iran.
A police report into the killing, published two weeks ago, said Vardanjani had an ""unusual profile"". It said he worked in cyber security at Iran's defense ministry and had become a vocal critic of the Iranian authorities.
According to the report, Vardanjani had posted a message on social media targeting Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards in August, three months before he was shot dead.
""I will root out the corrupt mafia commanders,"" the post said. ""Pray that they don't kill me before I do this.""
Reuters was unable to independently confirm either Vardanjani's position at the Iranian defense ministry or his social media posts. 
No one at the Iranian embassy and consulate in Turkey responded to calls on Friday seeking comment on Vardanjani's background or death. Asked about possible Iranian government involvement in the killing, a spokeswoman for Istanbul's police said the investigation was continuing and declined to comment further. 
A week after the killing, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo described it as ""another tragic example in a long string of suspected Iran-backed assassination attempts"" of Iranian dissidents. He did not elaborate further. 
Turkish authorities did not publicly accuse the Iranian government of involvement at the time. But the two senior Turkish officials said that the Turkish government would now raise Vardanjani's killing with Iran and one of them said that Turkish prosecutors were also following the case.
The suspected gunman and several other suspects, including Turks and Iranians detained in the weeks after the killing, told authorities they had acted on orders from two intelligence officers at the Iranian consulate, the first official said.
""It was reflected in the testimonies of the arrested suspects that these two Iranians, carrying diplomatic passports, had given the order for the assassination,"" he said, identifying the two men by their first names and initials.
The second Turkish official said evidence including the suspects' statements suggested ""Iranian nationals played a serious role in both instigating and coordinating"" the killing. 
Both of the Turkish officials said Ankara would soon deliver a formal response to Iran over Vardanjani's killing and the role they said was played by officials with diplomatic passports. 
WARNINGS
Vardanjani was on the radar of the Iranian authorities.
Two Iranian security sources said he had defied a warning from the Revolutionary Guards not to cooperate with Turkish firms on drone projects, without giving details. They said he had also approached the United States and European states to work for them, although Reuters could not corroborate this. 
One of the Iranian sources said he had published documents online that he had either hacked or obtained from contacts in Iran and had ignored requests to contact the Iranian embassy in Ankara, instead meeting Americans and an Israeli diplomat. The source gave no details on the documents or his meetings.
The second Iranian source also said that Vardanjani had been warned about his contacts with foreign diplomats.
The second Turkish official compared Vardanjani's death to the October 2018 murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi by a team of Saudi agents inside Saudi Arabia's Istanbul consulate.
Erdogan has said Khashoggi's killing was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has denied ordering the killing but said he bore ultimate responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto leader. 
On Wednesday, the Istanbul prosecutor's office said it had indicted 20 people, including a former aide to Prince Mohammed over Khashoggi's killing.
Relations between Turkey and Iran have been tested by the civil war in Syria, where they back opposing sides.
Turkey has been particularly angered by the role of Iranian-backed fighters in a Syrian government offensive against rebels backed by Turkey in Idlib, a Syrian province just over Turkey's southern border, launched not long after Vardanjani's killing. 
ROADSIDE KILLING
A joint investigation by Istanbul police and Turkish intelligence reviewed more than 320 hours of footage, searched 49 premises and spoke to 185 people, the police report said. 
Video footage broadcast on Turkish television after Vardanjani's killing showed a gunman running past two men as they walked in central Istanbul's Sisli neighborhood at 10 pm on Nov. 14 last year. The gunman fired several shots at one of them, who fell to the ground while his companion took cover.
The Turkish officials said the companion walking with Vardanjani had struck up a friendship with him after he arrived in Istanbul from Tehran in June 2018 and had passed information about him to Iranian intelligence.
The morning before the killing, the companion, whom the police report and Turkish officials say was named Ali Esfanjani, went to the Iranian consulate. He later met the gunman to discuss details of the operation, the officials said.
The police report describes Esfanjani as the leader of the team that carried out Vardanjani's killing.
Esfanjani was spirited across the border into Iran three days later by an Iranian smuggler, the first Turkish official said, showing a copy of a bus ticket he had used under a fake name to get to Turkey's eastern border region of Agri.
Reuters could not confirm Esfanjani's whereabouts.

Equipped with 20 camping beds, mattresses, and toilets stacked with toilet paper - an increasingly hard-to-find commodity, the hall in the western town of Menden is empty for now. But council head Sebastian Arlt said he was open about who the facility might be used for.
""We might house the homeless. It might also be used as additional capacity for hospitals if we have a situation like in Spain or France, if hospitals simply run out of space,"" he said, standing in a hall that looked more like an army training facility than a gymnastics hall.
""Or it could be used to house people who repeatedly defy the quarantine and deliberately put others in danger of being infected,"" he added. ""Then we could forcibly house them here.""
Germany has recorded some 43,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 253 deaths. The government will need bed and intensive care capacity in hospitals should thousands of people need medical attention after contracting the virus.
Restaurants, malls, gyms, cinemas and all non-essential businesses have been shut, and people have been instructed to stay at home unless they have to run essential errands or buy food. People have also been advised to stay 1.5 metres apart.
Chancellor Angela Merkel has been in quarantine since Sunday after visiting a doctor who subsequently tested positive for the virus.
Arlt said statistics in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia where Menden is located suggest that one if five people are not abiding by the quarantine rules. 
""The gym is fitted out like that to show quite plainly what happens to people who do not obey the rules,"" he said. ""We will use all methods available, and if we reach the conclusion that the situation will improve only if we use force, then we will do so with help from the police.""

The U.S. government on Thursday indicted Maduro and more than a dozen other top Venezuelan officials on charges of ""narco-terrorism,"" the latest escalation of the Trump administration's pressure campaign aimed at ousting the socialist leader.
Russia, Maduro's longtime political and financial backer, considers those accusations ""absurd"" and ""wild"" at a time when countries across the world join efforts to fight coronavirus, the Interfax news agency cited Maria Zakharova, spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, as saying.
""We can not stress enough our call for an immediate lifting of unilateral unlawful sanctions that are turning in the current epidemic into an instrument of genocide,"" Zakharova was quoted as saying.
Zakharova said Russia had supplied coronavirus test kits to Venezuela, which has reported 107 confirmed cases of the disease and that Moscow would continue helping Caracas to stop coronavirus spreading.

President Donald Trump denied that the charges were an attempt to take advantage of Venezuela at a vulnerable time when it is expected to be hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.

Ninety-two percent of voters supported changing the constitution in last Sunday's referendum, the head of the electoral commission, Amadou Salifou Kebe, said on Friday. 
The Constitutional Court has eight days to confirm the results. 
The referendum, originally scheduled for March 1, was pushed back because international observers raised concerns about the electoral register. It was boycotted by the opposition.
Conde, 81, has refused to rule out using a new constitution as a reset button on his mandate, which expires in December, citing other African countries as examples of where leaders have extended their rule.
The new constitution would impose a limit of two six-year terms, up from the current two five-year terms. It does not specify whether terms served under the previous constitution would count, but Conde has suggested they would not.

At least 30 people have been killed since October in protests against the proposed changes. The vote could be a bellwether for a presidential election before the end of the year in Guinea, the largest African producer of bauxite, an ore used to produce aluminum.

327,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 03:35PM ET</span>",UK's plan B if 'Team Johnson' is incapacitated? Answer is unclear,"By Michael Holden and Kylie MacLellan
LONDON (Reuters) - What would happen if British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's case of coronavirus - so far he has ""mild symptoms"" - were to become more serious or even incapacitate him and his team? Under Britain's uncodified constitution, the answer is unclear.
Johnson and Health Secretary Matt Hancock both said they were able to keep working from self-isolation at home after confirming they had tested positive for the virus.
But the fact that two such crucial members of the British government have contracted the disease - and their top medical adviser is now self-isolating with symptoms - has raised questions about how the government would function without them at a time of global crisis.
With only an unwieldy collection of sometimes ancient and contradictory precedents to go by, there is no simple, formally-enshrined ""Plan B"" or succession scenario, experts said.
""We've not been in that kind of situation, we've not had to think about it from that point of view before,"" Catherine Haddon, a senior fellow at the Institute for Government, told Reuters.
Whereas in the United States the vice president steps up if the president dies or becomes incapacitated, Britain has no formal deputy or caretaker prime minister who would take over.
Downing Street has already said, however, that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab would deputise if necessary.
Nor is there any guidance for such circumstances in the Cabinet Manual which sets out the rules and conventions for the running of government, and there is little precedence.
When asked about who would stand in for the prime minister, his spokesman said: ""The prime minister has the power to delegate responsibility to any of his ministers, but for now it is the prime minister and then the foreign secretary.""
CHURCHILL'S STROKE
In June 1953, then-Prime Minister Winston Churchill suffered a stroke while in office. His illness was kept so secret that some senior ministers were unaware. 
Churchill surprised doctors by recovering to carry on his duties, returning to Downing Street and running the cabinet two months later.
More recently, Tony Blair twice underwent treatment for a heart condition while prime minister in the early 2000s, each time briefly cutting back on his workload for a couple of days.
Officials said had he been incapacitated, his then-deputy John Prescott would take over until a new leader was elected.
There is no suggestion Johnson is unable to perform his job, and his spokesman said he could carry on as before, although he was now doing so via teleconferencing.
Bob Kerslake, head of the civil service from January 2012 to September 2014, agreed that Johnson and ministers could continue to operate by video, but said there were potential drawbacks.
""It is a cabinet government but the prime minister's role is crucial at this time, not least ... because of the visible leadership that the country needs,"" he told Sky News.
MUDDLE THROUGH?
Kerslake said officials would need to know there was a system for what would happen if senior ministers were unable to do their jobs.
Losing Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who coordinates policy across government, would be a serious blow.
""He is critical to all of this,"" Kerslake said. ""If, for whatever reason, he was ill, who takes over from him?""
Haddon said some powers were specifically vested in cabinet ministers, so there was an issue of what happened if they were unavailable.
""If you got to a stage where ... you had secretaries of state who aren't able to perform their functions, then there are question marks about whether junior ministers in their department act on their behalf,"" she said.
One lawmaker in Johnson's party, who has repeatedly tried to bring in a law to formalize who would replace a prime minister in the event of incapacity, said last week no one seemed to know what would happen.
""In a national emergency, you don't want to be scrabbling around worrying about who's in charge,"" Peter Bone told the Mirror newspaper.
However, Haddon said naming Raab as Johnson's substitute would prevent a political squabble among senior ministers over who fronted press conferences or chaired meetings.
""It is valuable for them to work out contingencies for various scenarios and they have obviously done a certain amount of thinking about that,"" she said.
She said prime ministers and cabinet ministers were often absent and government operated in their absence.
""Secretaries of state go on holiday and their department functions without them. The prime minister goes on holiday and the rest of government is able to continue working,"" she added.

""If there are things that (are) invested in a secretary of state and it is not proper for someone to act on their behalf, that's when it becomes a problem.""

TIRANA (Reuters) - Albania will impose a 40 hour curfew at the weekend and limit shopping to just one family member, who will need to seek permission from an app to leave home from Monday, as the country toughens measures to contain a coronavirus outbreak.
Since the first infection was recorded 18 days ago, eight people have died, 31 have recovered and 186 have contracted the virus. With a surge in cases expected, this week's 16-hour daily lockdown will be extended into next week.
Every kind of mass gathering has been banned and internal transport stopped, except for movement of goods and of workers in selected industries, as the army and police check streets and roads.
Pensioners have been ordered inside and Prime Minister Edi Rama said those who had no children would be supplied with food and medicine by the state.
The first public figure to be infected, opposition lawmaker Adriatik Alimadhi, approved of lockdown measures and praised the work of doctors, but said he regretted the lack of attention once he and his wife, also infected, were confined at home.
""Why isn't there some attention for our case after we were diagnosed on March 24,"" Alimadhi said. ""Why were those in contact with me just asked if they had a fever and told to take paracetamol?""
Alimadhi said both he and his wife were taking paracetamol every five hours and taking care of each other.
""Turn your eyes and necessary attention to the Albanians, check the (health) services and do not take for granted what you are being told,"" Alimadhi wrote to Rama on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Rama wished Alimadhi a speedy recovery and told him the coronavirus strategy was devised by health specialists, not politicians.

KIRKLAND, Wash. (Reuters) - Doug Briggs put on a surgical gown, blue gloves and a powered respirator with a hood. He headed into the hospital room to see his mother - to tell her goodbye.
Briggs took his phone, sealed in a Ziplock bag, into the hospital room and cued up his mother's favorite songs. He put it next to her ear and noticed her wiggle, ever so slightly, to the music.
""She knew I was there,"" Briggs recalled, smiling.
Between songs by Barbara Streisand and the Beatles, Briggs conference-called his aunts to let them speak to their sister one last time. ""I love you, and I'm sorry I'm not there with you. I hope the medicine they're giving you is making you more comfortable,"" said Meri Dreyfuss, one of her sisters.
Somewhere between ""Stand by Me"" and ""Here, There, and Everywhere,"" Barbara Dreyfuss passed away – her hand in her son's, clad in latex. It would be two days before doctors confirmed that she had succumbed to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Dreyfuss, 75, was the eighth U.S. patient to die in a pandemic that has now killed more than 1,200 nationally and nearly 25,000 worldwide. She was among three dozen deaths linked to the Life Care nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, the site of one of the first and deadliest U.S. outbreaks. (For interactive graphics tracking coronavirus in the United States and worldwide, click https://tmsnrt.rs/2Uj9ry0 and https://tmsnrt.rs/3akNaFr )
Dreyfuss's final hours illustrate the heartrending choices now facing families who are forced to strike a balance between staying safe and comforting their sick or dying loved ones. Some have been cut off from all contact with parents or spouses who die in isolation, while others have strained to provide comfort or to say their final goodbyes through windows or over the phone.
Just three days before his mother died, Briggs had been making weekend plans with her. Now, in his grief, he found himself glued to news reports and frustrated by the mixed messages and slow response from local, state and federal officials.
""You find out all these things, of what they knew when,"" Briggs said.
Officials from Life Care Centers of America have said the facility responded the best it could to one of the worst crises ever to hit an eldercare facility, with many staffers stretched to the brink as others were sidelined with symptoms of the virus. As the first U.S. site hit with a major outbreak, the center had few protocols for a response and little help from the outside amid national shortages of test kits and other supplies.

A flower child of the 1960's, Dreyfuss lived a life characterized by art and activism. After marrying her high school sweetheart and giving birth to their son, she pursued a degree in women's studies at Cal State Long Beach, where she marched for women's equality and abortion rights.
Furious over President Gerald Ford's pardoning of former president Richard Nixon in 1974, Dreyfuss took to her typewriter and penned an angry letter to Ford. ""Today is my son's 9th birthday,"" she wrote of a young Briggs. ""I do not feel like celebrating.""
By the time she arrived at the Life Care Center in May 2019, years of health issues had dimmed some of that spark, her son said. Fibromyalgia and plantar fasciitis restricted her to a walker or a wheelchair, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease required her to have a constant flow of oxygen.
When her son visited on Feb. 25, he brought a grocery bag of her favorites, including diet A&W root beer. She awoke from a nap and smiled at him, but hinted at her discomfort.
""Hi Doug,"" she said. ""I'm not feeling too good.""
Still, Dreyfuss talked about an upcoming visit with her sisters - the movies she wanted to see, the restaurants she wanted to try. The mother and son then had only a vague awareness of the deadly virus then ravaging China.
In hindsight, Briggs realized he had witnessed the first signs of her distress. His mother was using more oxygen than usual, her breathing was more strained.
At the time, staff at the nursing home believed they were handling a flu outbreak and were unaware the coronavirus had started to take hold, a spokesman has said.
         
'A TINY FOOTNOTE'
Two days later, Briggs dropped by to see his mom. She felt congested, and staff were going to X-ray her lungs for fluid. Briggs, 54, still saw no red flags, and continued to discuss weekend plans with his mother.
""I hope we can finally watch that new Mr. Rogers movie,"" she told him, referring to the film, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood. 
Briggs hugged his mom before she was wheeled to the imaging room and drove for a quick meal. Soon after, he received a call from the nursing home. His mother was experiencing respiratory failure. She was on her way to the hospital. Doug rushed to nearby EvergreenHealth Medical Center. By then, she was unresponsive.
At the time, there were 59 U.S. cases of coronavirus, a number that has since soared to more than 85,000.
After hearing of her sister's sudden hospitalization, Meri Dreyfuss remembered an earlier voicemail from Barbara: her distant voice, groaning for 30 seconds. When she had first heard it, she assumed Dreyfuss had called by accident, but now she realized her sister was in pain. ""It haunts me that I didn't pick up the phone,"" she said.
Briggs spent close to 10 hours the next day in his mom's hospital room. He wore a medical mask and anxiously watched her vital signs – especially the line tracking her oxygen saturation.
On his way out the door, a doctor took him aside to say they were testing her for the coronavirus. He remembered the difficulty reconciling the outbreak taking place on television - far away, in China - with what was happening in his mother's hospital room.
In the Bay Area, Meri and Hillary Dreyfuss were packing their suitcases on Feb. 28 when Briggs telephoned. After the call, they decided that visiting their sister would pose too much danger of infection.
""I realized there was no way we were going to get on a plane at that point, because we couldn't see her,"" said the middle sister, Hillary. ""And now, it seemed that we shouldn't be seeing Doug, either.""
They canceled their flights. On Saturday, Feb. 29, Briggs learned his mother's condition was deteriorating. Tough decisions loomed. Briggs and his aunts decided to prioritize making her comfortable over keeping her alive. Doctors gave her morphine to relax the heaviness in her lungs.
She died the next day. 
Having emerged from a two-week quarantine, Briggs will soon retrieve his mother's cremated remains. The family has been struggling with how to memorialize her life in such chaotic times.

""All the things that one would want to happen in the normal mourning process have been subsumed by this larger crisis,"" said Hillary Dreyfuss. ""It's almost as though her death has become a tiny footnote in what's going on.""

(Reuters) - New York plans to build eight temporary hospitals to meet an expected surge in coronavirus patients, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Friday, and the state estimates that demand for hospital capacity will peak in three weeks.
Cuomo also took an apparent swipe at U.S. President Donald Trump's claim that New York was exaggerating its needs for resources to fight the outbreak and did not really need the 30,000 ventilators it has sought from the federal government.
""Everybody's entitled to their own opinion, but I don't operate here on opinion,"" the governor told reporters at a news conference. ""I operate on facts and on data and on numbers and on projections.""
Cuomo, speaking against a backdrop of makeshift hospital beds at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, also said schools should remain closed for another two weeks until April 15th. 
The governor has become a leading national voice on the coronavirus pandemic as the state has accounted for roughly one-third of the national death toll and half the known number of cases.
Cuomo said 44,635 people have tested positive in New York, up about 7,400 from Thursday, and that 519 New Yorkers have died from the virus, up from the previous day's total of 385 deaths. 
""We are battling a deadly virus,"" Cuomo said. ""It's the worst news but it's not unexpected news either."" 
Cuomo said the state was seeking to build another four temporary makeshift hospitals to add an additional 4,000 beds, which he called part of a plan B to try to make up for a shortage of medical resources. Cuomo said he was going to ask the White House to grant the request to build those additional resources.
Cuomo reiterated the state's goal to get to 140,000 hospital bed capacity from the current 53,000 available.

He said that hospitalizations are increasing at a rate at which they double every four days, compared with three days last week. He said he believed there was a correlation between social distancing measures and the improved rate.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Two weeks before Easter, a group of Roman Catholic priests gathered before the locked doors of the ancient Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem on Friday chanting in prayer.
Any other year the clerics would be inside the church, preparing it and themselves for the most important festival in the Christian calendar, which Catholics this year celebrate on April 12. 
Greek Orthodox celebrations are held a week later, culminating in the colorful ceremony of the Holy Fire, symbolizing the resurrection of Jesus.

SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Few venture into the streets of Sao Paulo these days, but Erik Thiago says he will not stop working as a bike delivery man until he gets sick or the government forces him inside. 
As others in this city of 12 million stay home to slow the coronavirus outbreak, the 22-year-old rides an hour from his favela in the southern outskirts to deliver groceries, medicine and whatever else residents of upscale neighborhoods request. 
Without a face mask and with just a small bottle of hand sanitizer to use between deliveries, he knows he is especially exposed. Still, he wants to keep working to put aside a little cash ""in case it gets worse."" 
In Brazil, where 77 people have died out of nearly 3,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, the country's largest city has come to near standstill. It is people like Thiago, usually poor young men from the favelas or slums, who allow the rest to stay indoors. 
Thiago delivers for the mobile app Rappi — one of 200,000 people in Latin America to do so. The company declined to break out numbers for Brazil.
More than just a delivery app for picking up meals from restaurants, Rappi also gives couriers shopping lists to collect items off the shelves and a customer-funded debit card for payments. 
During the lockdown, Thiago's orders have shifted from fast food to goods for stockpiling. One customer asked for 70 cans of Coke. 
On Thursday, Thiago delivered bleach, a pack of sausages and anti-bacterial pet shampoo, among other things. Sometimes orders are more sensitive: he bought the erectile drug Viagra for one particularly grateful customer. 
Thiago's work is deemed ""essential"" by the state government, but that has not helped his bottom line much. On a good day, he takes home 100 reais ($20). But demand varies dramatically. Over the five hours Reuters shadowed him on Thursday, he earned 31 reais — and most of that was tips.
""Before the epidemic no one tipped,"" said Thiago, wearing a black T-shirt and striped shorts. Between his eyebrows is a rough scar from when a car hit him last year.
He hopes the virus will bring some recognition for his line of work. ""Right now they throw us in with the drug addicts,"" he said. 
""Sometimes when I'm out on the street, people thank me for the service I'm doing,"" Thiago added, pedaling the trusty black bike his mother gave him as a present two years ago. 
But at other times the injustice prickles. 
On one order, Thiago picked up three tomatoes, a yellow pepper, two potatoes, some bacon and a pack of sausages from a supermarket. When he checked the delivery address it was four doors down — 30 meters (yards) away. 
A software engineer in his 20s accepted the delivery, saying he is staying indoors to stay safe. 
""I'm not angry, but it's a privilege that he has,"" said Thiago. ""I would like to stay at home and quarantine but...""

PRAGUE/WARSAW (Reuters) - Eastern Europeans with strong memories of authoritarian Communist rule have taken a ""been there, done that"" attitude to the restrictions on free movement and shortages of some basic goods caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
The shuttered stores, sealed borders and other measures have revived memories of life behind the old 'Iron Curtain' before the fall of Communism and advent of democracy in 1989.
As Czech scientist Jan Konvalinka, 57, joked on Twitter, ""Shut borders, nothing on shelves, store closures? Welcome to my childhood."" 
""We've been there, done that,"" he added.
Scenes of shoppers in Britain, the United States and elsewhere plundering supermarkets for toilet paper, pasta and canned goods have bemused many in a region where people once had to wait years to be able to buy a car or where they would queue hours for a rare delivery of bananas at a state-run store.
""In the UK, where you’ve had democracy for years, people panic when there’s an unusual situation. We are behaving in a more rational way, we are detached,"" said Piotr Adamowicz, 59, an opposition member of the Polish parliament and former anti-communist activist. 
Echoing that comment, Andrea in Budapest said: ""People here are not panicking"".
""My grandmother lived through two wars, my mom was born during World War II and then we had Communism. We are prepared for this,"" said Andrea, an ethnic Hungarian who grew up in Romania and spent time in a detention center before 1989 after trying to cross into Hungary.
TEMPORARY MEASURES
People do not expect the current restrictions to last very long, unlike the privations they endured in the past.
""For me these border closures don’t hurt me as much as during Communism because I know they will open one day,"" said Filip Antos, 51, owner of Czech online travel service A-Hotel.com.
""This is not like Communism because we know this will end. During Communism we didn’t think it would ever end.""
Access to trustworthy news sources today has also eased the strain for those who remember Moscow-dominated rule that ended in a series of mostly peaceful revolutions in 1989. Under Communism, governments that nobody trusted were the main source of people's information in a pre-Internet world.
i For younger east Europeans, however, the experience of shortages and closed borders is novel.
""I never thought such things could happen again,"" said Tomas Klima, 31, who was born a year before the 1989 Velvet Revolution in then-Czechoslovakia.
But, noting the hugely expanded role of the state in many countries to tackle the coronavirus pandemic and cushion the economic impact of the disruption caused, he added: 
""We tend to forget too quickly what it used to be like back then. The state controlled everything, you had to ask for permission to travel abroad etc.
""I hope people will realize soon that by allowing the state to take control of various aspects of people's lives, even if with good intentions, they lose a lot of their liberty.""

What are they waiting for?"" said Theodora Papadimitropoulou, whose 15 year-old daughter is still in class in Stockholm despite most of Europe closing its schools to stem the spread of the coronavirus.
""They are not reacting fast enough,"" she said. ""Schools are breeding grounds for infection to spread.""
Papadimitropoulou is one of a growing number of people both inside and outside Sweden critical of the authorities' decision not to close schools to slow down the virus, which has now killed more than 24,000 people worldwide.
Critics argue that while children generally appear less affected by the virus, they can still spread it to family members and to others.
""Each infected child infects two to three other children a week, who then infect their parents and grandparents,"" said Jorn Klein, Associate Professor in Microbiology and Infection Prevention, at the University of South Eastern Norway.
""From a pure infection prevention perspective, it does not make sense to keep the schools and kindergartens open."" 
Earlier this week a group of senior health care officials sent a letter to the government calling on it to take stronger measures to fight the spread of the disease.
""Our nation should not be the exception in Europe,"" the letter said. ""We request that our Government takes action now!"" 
Sweden had around 3,000 confirmed cases of the coronavirus on March 27 and 92 deaths. While Sweden has closed universities and upper secondary schools, it has resisted sending younger children home.
The Swedish Health Agency says that it does not believe school children are transmitting the disease to a great extent and that the costs of drastic measures outweigh the benefits.
""We know that if you close schools, it has consequences in society in general ... if many parents have to be at home who work in healthcare or in other critical jobs,"" said Anders Wallensten, an epidemiologist at the agency.
Johan Giesecke, former chief epidemiologist at the agency, said most of the measures taken across Europe lack any scientific foundation. ""Things like border closure, school closure - the effect on epidemics is quite unknown,"" he said.
But while scientists bicker, many Swedes feel torn about the strategy.
""Of course we're worried because we have teachers in risk groups who do not want to infect anyone or be infected by others,"" said Sara Svanlund, a 47-year-old maths and science teacher at the Mollevang school in Malmo.
""But we also feel that we have a big responsibility to society, to keep society functioning. So I have mixed feelings.""

The EU launched a joint procurement procedure on March 17 to buy ventilators on behalf of 25 members states, in a bid to cut prices and reduce competition among EU nations seeking the machines which help coronavirus patients breathe and are in short supply.
Britain, which is entitled to participate in such schemes under an 11-month transition deal since leaving the EU in January, did not join it.
That attracted criticism at home from opponents who accused the government of prioritizing ""Brexit over breathing"" - so determined to act independently of the bloc that it would risk public health in the coronavirus crisis.
A British government spokesman said on Thursday London had not rejected the scheme deliberately, but had stayed out because it missed the invitation, due to an e-mail mixup. Britain would consider joining such joint procurement schemes in the future.
However, an EU spokesman said on Friday British officials had attended several meetings at which the scheme was discussed, and Britain had been given a chance to say if it wanted to be included.
Schemes to buy ventilators and other medical gear were ""discussed several times in the meetings of the health security committee where the UK participated,"" the spokesman said.
""Member states and the UK had the opportunity to signal their interest to participate in any joint procurement"" at the meetings and via an EU communication system, he said.
The EU is analyzing offers received on Thursday on the procurement for ventilators, the EU spokesman said.

Offers were also received this week for an earlier EU procurement for face masks, gloves and visors for medical staff launched a month ago. If contracts are signed, goods could be received in coming weeks.

The poll by the Levada Centre found 6% of 1,624 people of different ages polled across Russia from March 19-25 said they were unable to answer the questions posed, while 47% opposed the measure and 48% supported it.
Putin, 67, who has dominated the Russian political landscape as president or prime minister for two decades, maintains a high approval rating, although his trust rating has been sliding and hit a six-year low in February.

The proposed change, part of a package of reforms that has already been approved by parliament and Russia's Constitutional Court, would reset Putin's presidential term tally to zero, allowing him to serve two more back-to-back six year terms.

Billboards urging Russians to take part in the nationwide vote have already gone up in many Russian towns and cities, but the nationwide vote scheduled for April 22 has been postponed because of the coronavirus crisis and no new date has been set.

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A deeply conservative, tribal region of Pakistan is spreading an animated, Pashto-language video to warn its population about the coronavirus - and taking a shot at its gun culture in the process. 
In the video set in a field amid lightning, protagonist Pabo ""Badmash"", or Pabo the Thug, is setting out to defeat the virus. Villagers offer him a wooden bat, a pistol, a sword and even a rocket launcher. 
But Pabo astounds them by refusing, saying he will defeat the enemy with his ""bare hands"".
He then proceeds to wash his hands with soap - and even checks to ensure he has lathered them for 20 seconds, as recommended. 
""The soap is my law,"" says Pabo, playing on the saying ""the gun is my law,"" a common refrain among many Pashtun tribes for whom gun ownership is deeply engrained.
Pakistan is the latest country to employ creative public safety campaigns to increase awareness.
Last month, Vietnam initiated a project involving a catchy music video, which includes demonstrations of hand-washing. India has roped in celebrities to push their campaigns.
Pakistan has more than 1,200 confirmed infections, the highest number in South Asia. Nine people have died. 
Many parts of the country have imposed lockdowns, but authorities say they have struggled to get people to cooperate due to a lack of awareness. 
They say that is particularly a problem in Khyber-Pakhutunkhwa province, bordering Afghanistan, which saw the country's first death from the virus last week. 
So, two weeks ago, the government reached out to media and communication specialists asking them to help. 
""The Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa government realizes that this war will only be won if we win the public awareness war,"" the province's health minister, Taimur Khan Jhagra, told Reuters.
Zeeshan Parwez, a Pakistani-Canadian who owns a video production house in Peshawar, the provincial capital, said the idea was to make the video relate to people sometimes overlooked in government campaigns. 

""'The gun is my law' is one of the most used lines in Pashto slang. To replace 'gun' with 'soap' was the perfect rhyming choice.""

More than 80,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Italy since the outbreak emerged little more than a month ago and some 8,215 have died, far more than in any other country.
Francesco Rocca, an Italian who heads the world's largest disaster relief network, said that as well as social unrest the risk of suicide is increasing among vulnerable isolated people.
""We have a lot of people who are living very marginalized, in the so-called black hole of society... In the most difficult neighborhoods of the biggest cities I am afraid that in a few weeks we will have social problems,"" Rocca told a U.N. news briefing.
""This is a social bomb that can explode at any moment, because they don't have any way to have an income,"" said Rocca, whose Geneva-based agency also deploys volunteers in hard-hit Spain and France.
He said the largest Western cities could see these problems emerge ""in a few weeks"".
Rocca, who is also president of the Italian Red Cross, spoke from Milan in the north, epicenter of the country's outbreak, after visiting Codogno, Bergamo, Brescia and Lodi. 
Some people with a family who normally live on odd jobs that earn them 20-25 euros a time are often outside social assistance programs, Rocca said, adding: ""Think about the Roma camps.""
In Italy, Rocca met mayors and some of the 180,000 Red Cross volunteers who visit elderly people confined to their homes, do their food shopping and get medicines from pharmacies. There is a shortage of ventilators in the north and the south, he said.

The measures will be in place for 14 days, starting from March 29. Other regulations to be implemented included requiring restaurants to operate at half their capacity and to set tables at least 1.5 meters apart.
The ban on public gatherings includes both indoor and outdoor venues. Game centers, gyms, cinemas and other places of amusement and public entertainment are also required to close for two weeks starting from Saturday.
""We have to use stringent measures to prohibit, reduce or even impede public gathering activities,"" Lam said
The restrictions would hit the entertainment and leisure industries, Lam said, adding that the government has pledged financial support to affected employees. Further details will be announced later.
Hong Kong has witnessed a surge in people returning home since last week as they flee coronavirus outbreaks in Europe, North America and the Middle East.
The former British colony has 518 cases and four deaths so far. It has had some success in reining in the spread of the coronavirus; the majority of recent cases were contracted overseas or by people who had close contact with travelers.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's government has over-ruled efforts by a province to lockdown its borders to prevent the coronavirus from spreading, highlighting the country's reluctance to embrace the strict containment strategies of other nations.
President Joko Widodo's policy to curb the virus encourages social distancing but does not tightly restrict movement across Indonesia. 
""Every country has their own characters, cultures, and discipline level,"" Widodo said in a social media post on Tuesday. ""With this in mind, facing this COVID-19, we don't opt for lockdown"".
On Friday, the world's fourth most populous country announced the biggest one-day surge in coronavirus cases, up 153 to 1,046. Indonesia has only conducted 4,336 tests, a fraction of those done by other nations. One model by infectious disease experts suggests there are as many as 50,000 cases.
Hundreds of thousands of residents of Jakarta, where most confirmed cases have been clustered, have left over the past week for their home villages to find a safe haven, or after losing their jobs, officials said.
In response, local governments are taking matters into their own hands.
On Thursday, the easternmost province of Papua shut its airports, sea ports and land borders to passengers for 14 days, alarmed that the coronavirus had reached there.
In Tegal in Central Java, the mayor this week closed 49 access points and shut public spaces until July 30 after someone who had returned from Abu Dhabi contracted the coronavirus.
""People need to understand the policy I took. If I had to choose, I'd rather be hated by people then let them die,"" the mayor, Dedy Yon Supriyono, was quoted by CNN Indonesia as saying.
In Papua, the decision to close its borders was taken in consultation with the police and the military, documents showed. 
Papua's four airports and sea ports were closed on Thursday and remained shut on Friday, a government official said. 
The order to reverse the airport closures reflected the views of the ""highest level of government"", said Novie Riyanto, a senior official at the Ministry of Transport, .
""We have no national lockdown. If we close the airport, it means that we are against the direction of the president,"" Riyanto said in a video. 
Ahmad Syarif Syechbubakr, a Jakarta-based analyst with Bower Group Asia, said Widodo was ""very concerned about the economic impact of the lockdown"" and his advisers saw a risk of social unrest by millions of informal workers like street hawkers and laborers if movement is restricted.
The University of Indonesia's Panda Rio said authorities must cancel the ""mudik"", when millions of Indonesians leave towns for their villages at the end of the Muslim fasting month Ramadan in May.
""Many people going home are likely to come from a place that's infested with the virus,"" he said.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Large queues formed at supermarkets and stores in Tokyo on Friday as residents in the Japanese capital prepared for a weekend at home, after the city's governor called on them to remain indoors to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
Governor Yuriko Koike's plea on Wednesday to refrain from non-essential, non-urgent outings through April 12, and especially this weekend, prompted residents to stock up on everything from instant noodles and rice to toiletries and fresh produce, despite public-service warnings against hoarding.
Yuri Inoue, a 31-year-old graphic designer in Tokyo, said she was one of the ""panic buyers"", hoarding food for the next two weeks to allay concerns from her parents living outside Tokyo.
""If convenience stores and supermarkets will stay opened, people should stay calm. The government should emphasize that point more strongly,"" she told Reuters.
In one residential neighbourhood, more than a dozen people lined up for toilet paper at a local drug store. One of them, an elderly woman, leaned on her walker as she held a 10,000-yen (about $92) note in her hand.
Tokyo governor Koike asked for calm while repeating her pleas to refrain from weekend public gatherings. 
""But I am saying you can go to supermarkets to buy food or medicines or go to hospitals,"" Koike said at a coronavirus meeting for the Tokyo government.
""There are acts of securing things like food, but I would like to ask Tokyo citizens for calm behaviour.""
Tokyo has seen a surge in coronavirus cases this week, reporting a record 47 cases on Thursday for a total of 259.
While not many for a city of nearly 14 million, experts have warned of a high risk of an ""overshoot"" - or explosive rise - given that more than half of the newest cases could not be traced.
The Tokyo area has also asked residents to refrain from congregating to view its famous spring cherry blossoms at parks and plans to close its zoos and aquariums for two weeks.
Parts of three public parks in Tokyo will be closed off until the flower-viewing season is over, a Tokyo government official told Reuters, without specifying the dates.
And retail giants Takashimaya (T:8233) and Matsuya (T:8237) said they would shutter multiple department stores in the greater metropolitan area on the upcoming weekend.
Coronavirus infections have climbed to more than 1,400 nationwide with 47 deaths, excluding those from a cruise ship that was quarantined last month. Globally, infections have topped half a million people and deaths at more than 24,000.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to order his cabinet to compile an economic package with spending worth $135 billion or more, government officials and lawmakers say, joining global policymakers in rolling out fiscal stimulus to avert a downturn from the spreading pandemic.
Tokyo has not declared an emergency or a full-blown lockdown, and its streets were not as deserted as many European cities, where laws are forcing residents to stay indoors. 
But during rush hour around 8 a.m., some subway lines in central Tokyo where commuters normally stand elbow-to-elbow were visibly less crowded, some even with empty seats.
A truck driver delivering toilet paper and tissues to drug stores said he'd been working 12 to 13-hour shifts every day for the past month - compared with five-day weeks of 9-10 hours before the hoarding began.
""It's been tough,"" he told Reuters, declining to give his name. ""This job involves a lot of lifting, so I don't know how long my body can last at this pace."" 
Others worried about losing work as economic activity slows.
""They say we have to stay in but I'll probably end up going out since otherwise I won't make any money,"" said taxi driver Takahiko Nihei. 

""If I stay at home I'll just worry about things: money, the virus, making a living. But if I get out and around, I can forget this for a while.""

TAIPEI/BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has signed into law an act that requires increased U.S. support for Taiwan internationally, prompting a denunciation by China, which said it would strike back if the law was implemented.
China claims democratic and separately ruled Taiwan as its own territory, and regularly describes Taiwan as the most sensitive issue in its ties with the United States.
While the United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, the Trump administration has ramped up backing for the island, with arms sales and laws to help Taiwan deal with pressure from China.
The Taiwan Allies International Protection and Enhancement Initiative (TAIPEI) Act, signed by Trump into law on Thursday with strong bipartisan support, requires the U.S. State Department to report to Congress on steps taken to strengthen Taiwan's diplomatic relations.
It also requires the United States to ""alter"" engagement with nations that undermine Taiwan's security or prosperity.
Taiwan complains that China is poaching the dwindling number of countries that maintain formal ties with Taipei and has prevented it from participating in bodies like the World Health Organization. 
China says Taiwan is merely one of its provinces, with no right to the trappings of a state.
Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen posted a picture on her Twitter page of Taiwan's flag fluttering next to the U.S. one under the words ""Friends in freedom, partners in prosperity"", to welcome Trump's signing of the law.
It was ""a testament to Taiwan-U.S. friendship & mutual support as we work together to address global threats to human health & our shared democratic values"", she wrote in English. 
'RESOLUTE STRIKE'
China has stepped up its military drills around Taiwan in recent weeks despite the outbreak of the coronavirus, which emerged in a central Chinese province late last year and spread rapidly in China and beyond.
Taiwan says China should focus more on fighting the disease than menacing it.
China is already angry about U.S. accusations it poorly handled the coronavirus outbreak, and the new law adds to Sino-U.S. tension. 
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the U.S. act contravened international law, was a ""crude"" interference in China's internal affairs and obstructed other sovereign states from developing normal relations with China. 
""We urge the United States to correct its mistakes, not implement the law, or obstruct the development of relations between other countries and China, otherwise it will inevitably encounter a resolute strike back by China,"" Geng said, without giving details.
One of the authors of the act, Senator Cory Gardner, said it was needed to respond to Chinese pressure on, and bullying of, Taiwan.
""This bipartisan legislation demands a whole-of-government approach to ramp up our support for Taiwan, and will send a strong message to nations that there will be consequences for supporting Chinese actions that undermine Taiwan,"" he said in a statement.
The United States has been particularly concerned about China hiving off Taiwan's allies in the Pacific and Latin America, areas of the world Washington traditionally considers its zone of influence.

Taiwan now only has diplomatic relations with 15 countries, almost all small and developing nations like Nauru, Belize and Honduras.

355,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 05:25AM ET</span>",Gantz supporters angry as he moves towards deal with Netanyahu on Israeli leadership,"By Rami Ayyub
TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel appeared headed for a unity government on Friday after opposition leader Benny Gantz moved towards an agreement with Prime Minister Benjmain Netanyahu, disappointing voters who had hoped to bring down the right-wing premier. 
Gantz was elected parliamentary speaker on Thursday with support from Netanyahu's Likud and allied parties, leaving many of his own partners furious over the possibility he could form an alliance with a leader under criminal indictment.
He cited the coronavirus epidemic as the reason for his decision.
The shock move splintered Gantz's centrist Blue and White party just 13 months after it came into existence as a coalition of Netanyahu opponents intent on bringing down the 70-year-old, who is Israel's longest-serving prime minister.
It is also drew an angry resposne from some among the hundreds of thousands of Israelis who turned out to support Gantz's coalition in three elections in the past year. Some commentators accused the former general of caving in to Netanyahu. 
""It makes me feel terrible. It's exactly what I did not want to happen, to see Gantz actually partner with Netanyahu,"" said Tami Golan, 46, who voted for Gantz in all three elections. 
""I understand the coronavirus makes for a special situation, but I can't help but feel disappointed - we might not be done with Netanyahu,"" Golan said. 
Many Blue and White voters felt betrayed, commentator Nahum Barnea wrote in the Yedioth Ahronoth daily. 
""The only reason that led them to vote for this half-baked party was the desire to see Netanyahu outside of Balfour Street,"" he said, referring to the prime minister's official Jerusalem residence.
In accepting the speaker's gavel late on Thursday, Gantz said the coronavirus epidemic required what he called a ""national emergency government"". 
""Israel should not be dragged into a fourth election in such a challenging time, when the country is dealing with the coronavirus crisis and all its implications,"" Gantz said on Twitter. 
Israel is under partial lockdown due to the virus, which has killed 10 people and infected more than 3,000. 
During the election campaign Gantz had ruled out serving with Netanyahu, citing the prime minister's looming trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which he denies.
But Gantz lacked enough support on the centre and left to form a coalition after being asked by President Reuven Rivlin to try to form a government following a March 2 election. 
Netanyahu has proposed a unity government to tackle the coronavirus, promising to step down as prime minister within an agreed period and with Gantz then taking over. 
Gantz's move Thursday opened up the possibility of such a ""rotation"" deal, but there has been no formal announcement that such an agreement had been reached.

356,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 04:50AM ET</span>",Exclusive: Japan favors home-grown design for next-generation fighter after rejecting foreign plans: sources,"By Tim Kelly
TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan wants to develop a stealth fighter domestically, rejecting designs from  Lockheed Martin  Corp (NYSE:LMT) and Boeing (NYSE:BA) Co in the United States and Britain's BAE Systems (LON:BAES) PLC, three sources with knowledge of the program told Reuters. 
That would put Japan's leading defense contractor, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, in the lead for a military contract worth more than $40 billion. The company has not submitted a design for the next-generation fighter, but developed Japan's stealth fighter technology demonstrator, the X-2, in 2016. 
""Japan's stealth designs have performed well in tests so far,"" said one of the sources, who has knowledge of discussion about the new proposed plane, referred to as the F-3 or F-X.
A spokesman for Mitsubishi Heavy said the company would work with the government on whatever policy it decided to follow.
""We understand the Japanese government will lead the development program,"" a Mitsubishi Heavy spokesman said. 
Japan's Air Self Defense Force flies about 200 Boeing F-15 jets and is replacing squadrons of decades-old F-4 fighters with Lockheed Martin F-35s. The F-3 will succeed the F-2, a derivative of the F-16 Fighting Falcon jointly developed by Mitsubishi Heavy and Lockheed Martin more than two decades ago.
Proposals from Lockheed, Boeing and BAE ""were judged not to have met our needs,"" said an official at the Japanese defense ministry's Acquisition, Technology & Logistics Agency (ATLA). ""No decision has yet been reached on the airframe,"" he added.
After settling on the airframe - the aircraft itself without the systems that make it fly - Japan's government will select suppliers for the engine, flight systems, sensors and other components that will give the proposed jet its advanced capabilities, the sources said.
All three spoke on condition of anonymity because the were not authorized to speak to the media. 
For many of the systems, Tokyo will need help from foreign companies to reduce development costs and time, ensuring it can deploy the fighter in the next decade to counter Chinese expansion in East Asia.
U.S companies, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing and  Northrop Grumman  (NYSE:NOC), are still potential partners, the sources said. 
""Lockheed Martin is encouraged by the ongoing dialogue between the U.S. Government and Government of Japan regarding Japan's F-2 replacement plans, and is looking forward to detailed discussions with Japanese industry,"" Lockheed Martin said in an email. It had proposed an aircraft combining elements of its F-22 and F-35 stealth jets.
""Boeing is committed to partnering with Japan to support development of a Japan-led, next-generation future fighter,"" said a spokesman from Boeing, which had offered Japan a design based on its F-18 Super Hornet jet.
Northrop Grumman is ""engaged in frequent dialogue with Japan's Ministry of Defense and Japanese industry in support of the F-X program,"" a company spokesman said. Northrop Grumman did not submit an airframe proposal.
The United States, which has about 50,000 troops in Japan, including as an aircraft carrier strike group, remains the cornerstone of Tokyo's defense policy. U.S. President Donald Trump wants Japan to pay more for that protection and reduce its trade surplus with the United States. 
Japan is seeking deeper security ties elsewhere, including with Britain, which is courting Japan as a possible partner on its proposed next-generation jet, the Tempest. If built, it would deploy in the 2030s. 
The leading defense contractor in that project, BAE, which offered Japan a design based on the Eurofighter Typhoon jet, could stand to benefit.
BAE and other companies involved in Tempest proposal ""continue to support the UK in its discussions with Japan to consider more deeply how the two nations can collaborate on their combined combat air requirements,"" a BAE spokesman said.

Japan wants to decide on the international partners for the F-3 by the end of the year, the ATLA official said.

OTTAWA/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Canada on Thursday slammed a U.S. proposal to deploy troops along their undefended border to help fight the spread of the coronavirus, saying the idea was unnecessary and would damage relations.
The uncompromising comments were a surprise, since Ottawa has enjoyed smooth relations with U.S. President Donald Trump's administration over the past 18 months. Last week, the two nations agreed to close the border to non-essential travel to ease the outbreak's strain on health systems.
The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday evening that Washington had dropped consideration of the plan, citing an unnamed U.S. official. Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. 
Canadian Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland had made clear the Liberal government had no time for a plan to send hundreds of troops to the border to boost security.
""Canada is strongly opposed to this U.S. proposal and we have made that opposition very, very clear ... this is an entirely unnecessary step which we would view as damaging to our relationship,"" Freeland told a news conference.
""The public health situation does not require such action,"" she said, noting Washington had yet to take a final decision.
Speaking at the White House, Trump appeared to lack details on the possible troop deployment and said he would look into the matter. 
He said it would be ""equal justice"" since the U.S. military had deployed to play a support role on the border with Mexico.
A U.S. official familiar with the matter said that U.S. Customs and Border Protection was stressed on the northern border because virtually all patrol officers and border crossing officials were shifted to the southern border, where they are supplemented by a brigade from the 101st Airborne Division, a Marine battalion and National Guard personnel.
The Canada-U.S. border stretches 8,891 km (5,525 miles) and is a crossing point for one of the world's largest bilateral trading relationships.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said earlier that Ottawa was in touch with U.S. authorities and would adjust border security measures if needed.
The United States now has the most coronavirus cases in the world, with over 82,000 infections and more than 1,200 deaths.
Canada, with a population about 1/9 that of its southern neighbor, has reported 4,043 coronavirus cases and 39 deaths.
The state of New York, which shares a border with Canada, has been an epicenter of the U.S. outbreak.
Tim Currier, the mayor of Massena, New York, a town of 13,000 people 9 miles (15 km) from the border, said a deployment could spark panic if it were not communicated properly.
""I'm concerned about how citizens look at that,"" he said.
Canada is no longer accepting migrants who walk over the border at unofficial crossings, instead sending them back to the United States. Washington plans to return them to their countries of origin.
Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration policy with the Washington-based Bipartisan Policy Center, said the undefended U.S.-Canada border had long been a point of pride.

""I have not seen any reporting whatsoever of an increased threat posture at the U.S.-Canada border,"" she said. ""Did we not have other stuff that troops could and should be doing?""

359,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 27, 2020 03:00AM ET</span>",Afghan government selects negotiators for talks with Taliban,"KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's government late on Thursday announced a 21-member team to negotiate with the Taliban in a tentative sign of progress for the United States-brokered peace deal. 
The list announced by the country's State Ministry of Peace would be led by Masoom Stanekzai, a former National Directorate of Security chief, and included politicians, former officials and representatives of civil society. Five members of the team are women. 
It was not immediately clear whether President Ashraf Ghani's political rival Abdullah Abdullah would endorse the team selected, which diplomats have said would be vital given his camp's strong influence in much of the country's North and West.
Following the selection of the government's negotiators, the next step should be to convene talks with the Taliban as part of a process aimed at ending America's longest war and bringing peace to Afghanistan. 
Abdullah's spokesman did not immediately reply to request for comment. 
The United States signed a troop withdrawal deal with the Taliban in February, but progress on moving to negotiations between the militant group and the Afghan government has been delayed, in part by the political feud between Ghani and Abdullah with both men claiming to be Afghanistan's rightful leader following September's election. 
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to mediate between the two men to create an ""inclusive"" government during a day-long visit to Kabul on Monday, and announced a $1 billion cut in U.S. aid to Afghanistan, which he said could be reversed.
The government announced this week it would begin releasing Taliban prisoners at the end of March, edging closer to removing an obstacle to talks. The Taliban had demanded the unconditional release of 5,000 prisoners before starting talks with the government. Ghani countered with an offer to free 1,500 prisoners, and has since said he would release 100 at the end of March.
The arrangement was struck in a talks between Taliban and government officials held over Skype because of travel restrictions due to the global coronavirus pandemic.

TAOYUAN, Taiwan (Reuters) - Health worker Huang Ching-yuan knows exactly what to do the moment her mobile phone sounds an alert that someone in home quarantine as part of Taiwan's stringent coronavirus prevention methods has stepped somewhere she shouldn't.
Huang, a government employee in the industrial northern city of Taoyuan, immediately calls the 27-year-old woman to tell her the police are coming to check on her whereabouts. 
""The police will confirm your location,"" Huang tells her. ""You won't be punished as long as you're actually at home,"" she adds, referring to fines of up to T$1 million ($33,051) for people who step outside before their mandatory 14-day quarantine expires.
For those who follow the rules, the outcome is more pleasant: a stipend, and goodie bags that can include items ranging from masks and instant noodles to free packages for online gaming and movie services, plus snacks.
Such steps are one of the reasons Taiwan, which sits next door to China and has close economic ties with it, has been able so far to avoid the fate of many of its neighbours and control its virus outbreak, with just 267 cases so far.
Taiwan's approach, combining early controls on Chinese visitors, vigorous contact tracing for all cases, technology and now stringent 14-day quarantines for all arrivals, has won it praise and support around the world, including from New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
But like many places, Taiwan is now dealing with an upsurge in imported cases, and pockets of local outbreaks where there is no obvious link to other infections - a vexing problem for a government aiming to track the source of each.
Taiwan is in the middle of what Health Minister Chen Shih-chung has called a ""crucial"" two-week period to control the virus, with tens of thousands of Taiwanese flooding home from places wrestling with a surge in cases, such as the United States and Britain. 
Some health workers, tasked with missions that include tracking patients' contact history to delivering care bags to those in quarantine, have expressed concerns the system could be overstretched if cases jump sharply in the coming weeks. 
""Many hospitals are getting nervous, trying to secure enough hospital beds and respirators,"" said Su Po-wen, deputy head of Taoyuan's public health department. ""Our staff are working very hard for the time being, but if we can make it through these two weeks the situation will be less tense.""
A few Taiwanese politicians have said the government should be tougher, and that President Tsai Ing-wen should issue an emergency order forbidding foreign travel.
Freddy Lim, a rock star and independent legislator, said not doing so was dangerous.
""As the epidemic continues to grow, there are still people wilfully leaving the country, getting infected and then coming back, becoming a loophole in epidemic prevention,"" he said.
Taiwan is also not rolling out widespread testing, as South Korea and some other countries have done, triggering concerns in Taiwan media that the island might have more cases than reported. 
Vice President Chen Chien-jen, a U.S.-trained epidemiologist and health minister during the 2003-2004 SARS crisis, said widespread testing is a waste of resources in Taiwan, where workers have been able to trace almost all cases and their contacts.
For now, the government says its quarantine system is working.
Taiwan has 86,000 people in quarantine, mostly at home but also in hotels for those who don't live on the island. On top of large fines for breaking the rules, the government has threatened to name and shame quarantine breakers.
Taiwan has also deployed an ""electronic fence"" that uses mobile telephones to track those in home quarantines.
""We want people to know that we are serious,"" Taoyuan health worker Huang told Reuters. ""The police will dash off to get you even if you are merely turning your phone off."" 
More than 220 people have been fined a total of over T$18 million for breaking quarantine rules, official data shows.
The approach is not all stick, however. The government has rolled out incentives to get the public onboard with the quarantine programme.
Taiwanese can order up to three masks a week online and pick them up from convenience stores across the island, a government-led effort to address panic buying after authorities teamed up with manufacturers to boost their daily supply to more than 12 million masks. 
In Taoyuan alone, more than 10,000 ""care bags"" have been delivered to people ordered to stay at home for 14 days. 
A daily subsidy of T$1,000 is also given to those quarantined at home, although it is withheld from people who travelled abroad against government advice. 
""We hope the home care bags cheer people up,"" said Huang Tsui-mi of Taoyuan's Public Health Department. ""Having to spend 14 days at home, we don't want them to get too bored.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - As thousands of Hong Kong citizens and expatriates return to the city, many are seeking refuge in hotels, fearful that cramped apartments in one of the world's most expensive property markets could put families or flatmates at risk. 
Social distancing is tough in Hong Kong, where the bulk of the city's 7.4 million population lives in flats that on average are no bigger than 500 square feet (46 square metres).
The concerns have triggered a spike in occupancy rates for those Hong Kong hotels prepared to take self-quarantine guests, even as most of the industry grapples with a devastating slump due to coronavirus.
One expatriate who has lived in Hong Kong for over 12 years opted to self-quarantine in a hotel when returning last week, worried that going back to his two-bedroom apartment could put his wife and two daughters at risk. 
""In case I had it, I didn't want to get the girls sick,"" he said, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity around the issue. 
Even before the government implemented a compulsory 14-day quarantine for all arrivals on March 19, many returnees had voluntarily self-isolated in hotel rooms. 
The numbers returning have been swelled by an influx of students arriving from overseas where the virus is spreading rapidly, at a time when Hong Kong's infection rate remains relatively low, officials said. More than 77,000 Hong Kong citizens have returned since the mandatory quarantine was imposed, according to government figures.
A four-star hotel on Hong Kong Island, which had 15% of its rooms occupied at the start of the virus outbreak in January, said 60% of its rooms were now full. 
""Ninety percent of our guests are here for quarantine reasons,"" said a sales official at the hotel, who declined to be named because she was not authorized to speak to the media. 
The rest of the hotel's rooms had been left unoccupied intentionally for social distancing purposes, she said, adding that in hotels which did not implement such measures the occupancy rate could be as high as 90%.
Packages for a 14-day stay in a standard room at the Dorsett Hotel in its properties in the densely populated districts of Mong Kok and Wan Chai, costing cost HK$5,600 ($718) and HK$6,888, respectively, are fully booked until early April. 
Dorsett Hotel told Reuters it had assigned a certain number of standard rooms for students' self-quarantine purposes. 
By doing do, it hopes to ""further reduce the chance of outbreak in the community,"" it added. The hotel said it had two air purifiers on each floor and a separate check–in area and elevators for quarantine guests. 
Lawmaker Yiu Si-wing, who represents the tourism industry, told reporters last week that at least 14 hotels are together offering 1,000 rooms for the quarantine arrangement. 
However, some travelers have complained on social media of being stranded at Hong Kong's international airport because they could not find a hotel room. 

""Does this mean I need to sleep in the airport for 14 days?"" one post said.

JINGZHOU, China (Reuters) - Li Yu is happy she sold six pieces of roasted corn on the day she reopened her stall after travel restrictions were lifted in Jingzhou, but she worries about the future of her business near the city's ancient wall, a tourist attraction in Hubei province.
Li was forced to close her stall in late January as part of Hubei's lockdown to tackle the spreading coronavirus epidemic, only opening on Thursday as China began lifting curbs on the province amid a sharp fall in locally-transmitted virus cases.
Li, 55, says business is at its worst in the seven years since she opened her stall. The Chinese Lunar New Year holiday in February is usually high season for Li, but the virus lockdowns killed that.
In normal times she makes 4,000 yuan ($565.70) a month. The sale of six corn cobs would fetch around 12 yuan - a paltry daily income.
""The first half of the year is the season for the flowers to bloom. Many people come out here to admire the flowers, take pictures. It is supposed to be the peak period for us, but this year the coronavirus will definitely have a big impact,"" Li told Reuters on Thursday.
For residents of Hubei, where the outbreak began late last year in its capital city of Wuhan, it has also left them to battle a stigma. 
""Just look, there are so few people. Those from outside (Hubei) will not travel here for holiday,"" said Li. 
""Now Hubei in China is the hardest hit area, and no one dares to come. When they know you're from Hubei they all keep away from you. They are scared.""
On the day Reuters spoke to Li only two of seven stalls around her section of the ancient wall were open, on Friday all the stalls were closed, with just a handful of people strolling around.
PESSIMISM AND HOPE
Chinese authorities have recently announced measures to try and get consumers spending and visiting tourist attractions again, such as by handing out millions of yuan worth of discount vouchers.
The government of Hubei, like others across the country, has also pledged to help tide over small businesses with policies such as value added tax exemptions. 
That is little solace for Zhou Yanjun. Her restaurant, a 10 minute walk from Jingzhou's ancient wall, is required to remain shut until further notice, although she is still on the hook to pay rent. 
""Now we can only make food for ourselves to eat,"" she said, as she prepared dinner for her family from her restaurant's kitchen. ""It's going to be a very, very difficult year.""
Others found comfort in the reopening of the Jingzhou city's ancient wall tourist area. 
Friends Wang Jue and Xiao Man, both 25, met there on Wednesday for the first time since the lockdown was imposed two months ago.
Wang was still waiting to get back to her job in Wuhan, which remains on lockdown until April 8, while Xiao said she was applying for jobs, though she had yet to hear back for any in recent weeks. 
Still, she was optimistic, Xiao said. ""I hope everything can get back to normal soon.""

BEIJING/TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc (O:TSLA) plans to slash on-site staff at its Nevada battery plant by around 75% due to the coronavirus pandemic, the local county manager said on Thursday. 
The move comes after its Japanese battery partner Panasonic Corp (T:6752) said it would scale down operations at the Nevada factory this week before closing it for 14 days. 
The factory produces electric motors and battery packs for Tesla's popular Model 3 sedans. 
""Tesla has informed us that the Gigafactory in Storey County is reducing on-site staff by roughly 75% in the coming days,"" Austin Osborne said in a post on the county's website. 
No further details were available and it was not clear how many employees work in the factory. Tesla did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. 
The Reno Gazette Journal, which earlier reported the planned suspension, said Panasonic has about 3,500 employees at the Nevada plant. 
Tesla said last week it would temporarily suspend production at its vehicle factory in San Francisco Bay Area from end of March 23, as well as at its New York solar roof tile factory.
However, Tesla CEO Elon Musk said the company will reopen the New York plant ""as soon as humanly possible"" to manufacture ventilators for coronavirus patients.

Two employees of Tesla have tested positive for coronavirus but have been working from home for the past two weeks and had not been symptomatic at work, Tesla said in an email to employees on Thursday. It did not disclose which unit or at what location the employees work.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will receive recommendations this weekend from his advisers about the next steps in the battle to stop the coronavirus and reignite the U.S. economy, Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday.
Trump has been pressing for days to get the economy moving again despite an increasing number of U.S. coronavirus cases that the strict measures recommended by his advisers are meant to curb.
Trump and his coronavirus team on March 16 put in place recommendations for people nationwide to reduce social and professional interactions for 15 days, including by schooling children at home and not gathering in groups of more than 10 people.
Pence said that as day 15 approached, the president's advisers planned to deliver recommendations to him based on the latest data.
""We'll be presenting this weekend (to) the president a range of recommendations and ... additional guidance for going forward,"" Pence said, adding that the president had made it clear that he wants to ""'open the country up.' But we're going to do that responsibly.""
Trump said he had told state governors earlier in the day in a letter that his administration would be updating its guidance on social distancing related to the pandemic.
""We will vanquish this virus,"" he said. ""We have to get back to work. Our people want to work."" The president has said he would like the economy to open up again by Easter on April 12.
Trump said he was likely to speak with President Xi Jinping of China later on Thursday and cast doubt on the figures provided by Beijing for coronavirus cases. Meanwhile, the number of reported infections in the United States rose to at least 81,378, according to a Reuters tally, surpassing China and Italy to become the most in the world. 
Trump has praised Xi's handling of the coronavirus while also emphasizing that the disease originated in China and accusing the country of not being transparent enough about it.
Trump, who has been holed up in the White House for nearly two and a half weeks as political rallies and other trips were canceled, said he planned to visit Norfolk, Virginia on Saturday to send off the Navy's USNS Comfort hospital ship as it sails for New York City. It is expected to arrive on Monday.
""I'm going to go out and I'll kiss it goodbye,"" Trump said.
A second Navy hospital ship, the USNS Mercy, was dispatched to Los Angeles from San Diego earlier this week. 

The president called on the House of Representatives to pass a $2 trillion stimulus package to fight the coronavirus right away after the Senate passed the bill on Wednesday. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has said she expects the chamber to pass the bill on Friday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Thursday indicted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and more than a dozen other top Venezuelan officials on charges of ""narco-terrorism,"" the latest escalation of the Trump administration's pressure campaign aimed at ousting the socialist leader.
The State Department offered a reward of up to $15 million for information leading to the arrest of Maduro, whose country has been convulsed by years of a deep economic crisis and political upheaval. 
The indictment, a rare U.S. action against a foreign head of state, marks a serious new phase against Maduro at a time when some U.S. officials have privately said President Donald Trump is increasingly frustrated with the results of his Venezuela policy. 
Attorney General William Barr, announcing charges that include narco-terrorism conspiracy, corruption and drug trafficking, accused Maduro and his associates of colluding with a dissident faction of the demobilized Colombian guerrilla group, the FARC, ""to flood the United States with cocaine.""
But Trump administration officials are mindful that their chances are slim of getting Maduro or the other major figures in custody anytime soon, a person familiar with the situation said on condition of anonymity.
""While the Venezuelan people suffer, this cabal lines their pockets with drug money and the proceeds of their corruption,"" Barr said.
""You are a miserable person, Donald Trump,"" Maduro said in a state television address during which he dismissed the charges as false and racist. Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said the charges were aimed at benefiting Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.
Trump's pressure on Venezuela, an OPEC member, has gone over well among Cuban Americans in South Florida, a key voting bloc in a major presidential swing state.
The U.S. government has previously lodged criminal indictments against members of Maduro's family and inner circle. He and his allies have dismissed such allegations as a smear campaign, and argue the United States is responsible for drug trafficking, given its role as a leading consumer.
Maduro is already under U.S. sanctions and has been the target of a U.S. effort aimed at pushing him from power. He took office in 2013 after the death of his mentor President Hugo Chavez, a staunch foe of the United States.
Other Venezuelan officials whose indictments were announced on Thursday include Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, senior socialist leader Diosdado Cabello, and the chief justice of the country's supreme court, Maikel Moreno, who was charged with money laundering. The U.S. government is offering $10 million for information leading to Cabello's arrest.
The United States and dozens of other countries have recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president, regarding Maduro's 2018 re-election as a sham. But Maduro has remained in power, backed by the country's military and by Russia, China and Cuba.
U.S. officials have long accused Maduro and his associates or running a ""narco-state,"" saying they have used proceeds from drugs transshipped from neighboring Colombia to make up for lost revenue from a Venezuelan oil sector hit by U.S. sanctions.
Trump denied that the charges were an attempt to take advantage of Venezuela at a vulnerable time when it is expected to be hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic.
""No, no. We don't look at a weak point. This is a serious problem for over 150 nations,"" Trump said in response to a reporter's question. But he added: ""Maduro and Venezuela, we're watching it very closely.""
'DEPLOYED COCAINE AS A WEAPON'
The indictments were unsealed in New York, Florida and Washington.
Barr dodged a reporter's question on whether Trump, who has pressed his aides in recent months for a tougher approach on Venezuela, was briefed in advance.
Maduro and his closest allies ran a ""narco-terrorism partnership with the FARC for the past 20 years,"" stated Geoffrey Berman, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern (NYSE:SO) District of New York, who said the Venezuelan president ""very deliberately deployed cocaine as a weapon.""
""The scope and magnitude of the drug trafficking alleged was made possible only because Maduro and others corrupted the institutions of Venezuela and provided political and military protection for the rampant narco-terrorism crimes,"" he added.
The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida, Ariana Fajardo Orshan, said she sees signs of Venezuelan officials' laundered money throughout her area every day, from lavish yachts to million-dollar condos.
""This party is coming to an end,"" she said.
Asked whether the U.S. government was also considering designating Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism, which carries further sanctions, Barr said: ""It's really one step at time, so I really have nothing to say about that right now.""
Thursday's charges altogether carry a maximum penalty of up to life in prison. Asked whether the U.S. government wants to capture Maduro dead or alive, Barr said: ""We want him captured so he can face justice in U.S. court.""
But he offered no indication of how U.S. authorities might get their hands on Maduro, who has endured more than a year of international pressure and on-again, off-again street protests.
Maduro's international travel could be restricted, given Washington would be able to request that he be handed over if he visits a country that has an extradition treaty with the United States. U.S. authorities can also freeze any assets he has in the United States, though such holdings are considered unlikely.
The Justice Department said that since 1999, Maduro, along with Cabello and others, acted as leaders of the ""Cartel of the Suns."" The name, it said, refers to the sun insignias affixed to uniforms of high-ranking Venezuelan military officials. 

An indictment accused Padrino of using his control of the n military to facilitate cocaine flights to the United States.

367,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 09:30PM ET</span>",Too close? Singapore's new virus-fighting rules could lead to prison,"SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Anyone caught breaking Singapore's social distancing rules can land themselves in prison from Friday after the city-state made it an offence for a person to intentionally stand close to another person as part of its coronavirus defense. 
Singapore has won international praise for its fastidious approach in tackling the virus, which has included using police investigators and security cameras to help track suspected carriers. 
With some of the world's highest population densities, the city-state this week announced more stringent social distancing measures such as shutting bars, limiting gatherings to up to 10 people outside work and school as well as a ban on large events.
Under updates to its powerful infectious diseases law, anyone who intentionally sits less than 1 meter away from another person in a public place or on a fixed seat demarcated as not to be occupied, or who stands in a queue less than a meter away from another, will be guilty of an offence.
Offenders can be fined up to S$10,000 ($6,990), jailed for up to six months, or both.
The rules, in place until April 30, can be applied to individuals and businesses.
Singapore is well known for its strict rules: fines can be doled out for everything from feeding birds to forgetting to flush a public toilet.
Some countries including Italy, Britain and New Zealand have gone into complete lockdown, but Singapore has avoided the move. Authorities have said more drastic measures may be needed if locals do not take social distancing seriously.

Singapore's number of coronavirus cases rose by 52 to 683 infections on Thursday, and two people have died.

In Yemen, Houthi air defences intercepted on Friday aircrafts affiliated with Saudi-led coalition forces over the Yemeni city of Marib and forced them to leave, the Houthi military spokesperson Yahya Saria said in a Tweet.
The two attacks come after Yemen's warring parties had welcomed a U.N. call for an immediate truce on Thursday to fight the coronavirus outbreak. 
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthis ousted the government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The group still controls most major urban centres despite years of war.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - 81-year-old Judie Shape tested positive for coronavirus just days after checking into the Life Care nursing home near Seattle, where three dozen people have died in one of the earliest and deadliest U.S. outbreaks.
On Thursday, she went home.
Shape was featured in a previous Reuters story and photo essay chronicling the nightmare endured by residents, staff and families at the home. (For full story, click https://reut.rs/2Jkqv0h ) 
She recovered despite serious underlying health problems, including a stomach infection and recent blood clot surgery. Such conditions make the disease particularly dangerous for the elderly.
""She's a survivor,"" said her daughter, Lori Spencer.
Shape was admitted to Life Care Center on Feb. 26, for rehabilitation after her surgery. Three days later, when the facility confirmed its first positive coronavirus test, Shape was essentially trapped there because no other facility would accept patients that had been exposed to outbreak at the Kirkland, Washington nursing home.
Shape was first tested for coronavirus on March 8, with a positive result coming back two days later. She was again tested on Tuesday and Thursday, because she has been symptom-free for nearly two weeks.
Although the results have yet to come back, Spencer decided Shape was strong enough to leave. The daughter, like other family members with relatives at the home, had been barred from visiting her mother for safety reasons. She often comforted Shape by standing outside the window of her room - able to see her, but not touch her - as the two women talked on the phone.

""I went to the window yesterday, she looked really good, really bored, and like a caged tiger,"" Spencer told Reuters in an interview. ""It was time to take her home. And man, it's nice to have her home.""

NEW YORK (Reuters) - At least one New York hospital has begun putting two patients on a single ventilator machine, an experimental crisis-mode protocol some doctors worry is too risky but others deemed necessary as the coronavirus outbreak strains medical resources.
The coronavirus causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19 that in severe cases can ravage the lungs. It has killed at least 281 people over a few weeks in New York City, which is struggling with one of the largest caseloads in the world at nearly 22,000 confirmed cases.
A tool of last resort that involves threading a tube down a patient's windpipe, a mechanical ventilator can sustain a person who can no longer breathe unaided. The city only has a few thousand and is trying to find tens of thousands more.
Dr. Craig Smith, surgeon-in-chief at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center in Manhattan, wrote in a newsletter to staff that anesthesiology and intensive care teams had worked ""day and night"" to get the split-ventilation experiment going.
By Wednesday, he wrote, there were ""two patients being carefully managed on one ventilator."" 
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, who says his staff is struggling to find enough machines on the market, has touted the adaptation as a potential life-saver. ""It's not ideal,"" he told reporters, ""but we believe it's workable.""
The U.S. Food & Drug Administration, which regulates medical device manufacturers, gave emergency authorization on Tuesday allowing ventilators to be modified using a splitter tube to serve multiple COVID-19 patients, though manufacturers still must share safety information with regulators.
Some medical associations oppose the unproven method.
On Thursday, the Society of Critical Care Medicine, the American Association for Respiratory Care and four other practitioner groups issued a joint statement saying the practice ""should not be attempted because it cannot be done safely with current equipment.""
It is difficult enough to fine-tune a ventilator to keep alive even one patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the statement said; sharing it across multiple patients would worsen outcomes for all. They proposed doctors instead choose the one patient per ventilator deemed most likely to survive.
At Columbia, Smith noted that they could not split a ventilator across just any two COVID-19 patients, but were only pairing patients with sufficiently similar respiratory needs.
Across Manhattan, Mount Sinai Hospital told staff in an email that officials were ""working to figure out"" whether they could split ventilators. The hospital has ordered the necessary adapters, a nurse there said in an interview on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to speak to reporters.
Experts at Columbia pointed to a 2006 study where researchers, using lung simulators, concluded that a single ventilator could sustain four adults in an emergency scenario.
One author of that study, Dr. Greg Neyman, cautioned against the application in COVID-19 cases in part because the lungs themselves are infected. If one patient's lungs were deteriorating faster, he said, it could cause imbalances in the closed system. One patient could starve for oxygen while the other patient's lungs would get increased pressure.

""Unless they were very very closely monitored, such a set up may end up doing more harm than good,"" Neyman wrote in an email to Reuters.

ANKARA/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A week after sending half a million coronavirus test kits to the United States, Turkey is struggling to ramp up its own testing for the disease as doctors warn the country has reached a crossroads in containing the fast-growing outbreak. 
Turkey reported its first infection just over two weeks ago. 
Since then, a surge in cases to 3,629 has outstripped rates in most other countries and the government has fallen short of its target to conduct 10,000 tests per day.
In interviews with Reuters, experts have urged stronger stay-at-home orders and some said it was risky for Ankara to export 500,000 kits to the United States only to turn around and order a million more from China. 
""Our test numbers are low. We were certainly not prepared. Countries that are ready must have high test numbers,"" said Sinan Adiyaman, chairman of the Turkish Medics Association (TTB). 
The government has said it took timely measures to delay the outbreak.
But Adiyaman said Turkey was slow on some steps, including suspending sports leagues and quarantining those coming from abroad, especially the thousands returning this month from an Umrah pilgrimage. 
""Around 200,000 people arrived from abroad since the outbreak began, and they were just given a simple fever test and released across Turkey in an uncontrolled manner,"" he said. ""You cannot fight a pandemic this way.""
The coronavirus has so far killed 75 people in Turkey, an international crossroads with one of the world's biggest airports in Istanbul. 
About 40,000 tests have been done including about 7,000 in the last 24 hours, suggesting Turkey is edging toward the target Health Minister Fahrettin Koca set out a week ago, but only two-thirds of the way there. South Korea, seen as the global leader, does more tests each day than Turkey's total. 
(Click here https://graphics.reuters.com/HEALTH-CORONAVIRUS-GLOBAL-TESTING/0100B5LC45H/index.html for a graphic of global tests; click here https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-MAP/0100B59S39E/index.html for its global spread.)
To contain the virus, Ankara has closed schools, cafes and bars, banned mass prayers, and suspended sports matches and flights. President Tayyip Erdogan said Turkey, which has a population of about 83 million, would overcome the outbreak in two to three weeks.
Mustafa Cankurtaran, head of geriatrics at the Hacettepe University Faculty of Medicine, said his team is following the national guidelines, testing only ""risky"" patients with cough and fever. But next month will be critical since the outbreak will widen, he said. 
RAZOR THIN MARGIN
Earlier this week Koca said the kits sent to the United States were locally produced PCR tests for the coronavirus. He said Turkey had a monthly production capacity of 2 million tests, and added that the tests purchased from China were ""rapid tests"", not PCR.
The TTB's Adiyaman said sending the test kits jeopardised the health of the public and medical personnel. ""Exporting testing kits to the United States as Turkey needs them and while they need to be used here will be an unforgivable mistake,"" he said. 
Irshad Shaikh, the World Health Organisation's health security program Leader in Turkey, said the country now had little room for error and must test everyone who has had contact with the virus. He said, however, that the export of test kits to the United States, which he said was in a ""perilous situation,"" could be seen as a form of capital investment.
""From now on, it's a very slippery slope and razor-thin margin moving forward,"" he said. ""Now if the U.S. succeeds in vaccine development, we already have our invested cash in the bank in the form of our IOUs,"" Shaikh told Reuters.
Among the containment measures, Ankara said it quarantined Muslims returning from Umrah in Saudi Arabia. 
But Nihat Gonul, the local administrator of a village in Sakarya province some 120 km east of Istanbul, said two returning pilgrims continued their lives normally and attended gatherings for days before authorities came to quarantine them.

""There is this atmosphere of uncertainty in the village. People are scared, not sure what to think,"" Gonul said.

The measures could be used if demand exceeds supply or when a patent holder cannot produce for Canada, said Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada in a statement on Thursday. 
Patent holders would receive ""adequate remuneration."" 
""These provisions will help ensure that the existence of a patent covering an existing or new vaccine or treatment is not a barrier to securing needed supplies when those supplies cannot be secured from the patentee,"" said the ministry. 
The ministry said the new provisions applied equally to all patented inventions. They expire on Sept. 30, 2020.
Ventilators could be the legislation's first target, pharmaceutical consultancy PDCI Market Access said in a note to clients. ""The authorizations are not referred to as compulsory licenses in the legislation, however, that is their effect,"" the note said.
Canada's main pharmaceutical lobby group, Innovative Medicines Canada, said it was concerned that the legislation did not require the government to check in with the original manufacturer to see what it can supply before authorizing others to step in.
The bill, passed on Wednesday, accelerates a process that was already possible during public health emergencies, said Richard Gold, a pharmaceutical law expert at McGill University.
""This legislation makes it clear that companies that try to raise prices or assert patents during the crisis will be ignored,"" and their patents supplied by other companies, he said.
On March 19, Israel approved a generic version of  AbbVie Inc  (NYSE:ABBV)'s anti-viral Kaletra as a possible treatment for COVID-19, even though the company's patent does not expire in Israel until 2024. One recent study found the drug was not effective.

QUILMES, Argentina (Reuters) - In a suburb of Quilmes, south of Buenos Aires, dozens wait in line at an army field kitchen to get rations of food, their pockets emptier than normal due to a nationwide shutdown aimed at stemming the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.
In a country where at least 35% of people live below the poverty line and many are employed informally in piecemeal work, Argentines are being hard hit by the obligatory quarantine.
Only those who work in essential sectors have permission to move freely until at least the end of March, with police controlling movement in big cities and highways. The country's borders have been closed as cases of the virus have topped 500.
""I come here because they don't let me go out to work on the street. All my life I have worked and driven on the streets,"" said Roberto Brandán, 58, who usually does odd jobs where he can find them.
""With this problem that is happening, I can't even go out to the corner of the road, so I come here to bring food back to my children at home.""
At the military kitchen, soldiers filled containers that people brought with them to take food home.
""The army has always supported communities,"" Alejandro Liberatore, a colonel in charge of the operation, told Reuters. ""This situation is changing all the time and today our help is needed, doing this activity with the people.""
For many Argentines, the lockdown simply means dealing with challenges of life confined at home, with allowance to go out only to buy essential food or medicine.
Others face the very real danger of running short of funds, with normal supplies of income cut off, however. President Alberto Fernandez has announced measures to support those hardest hit, including providing subsidies to families.
""I come here and bring food back to my children. Like everyone, it's out of necessity,"" said Fermina Velázquez, a 38-year-old housewife. 

She said the food aid helped protect her savings. ""At least with this I keep what little I have.""

This is the latest example of the coronavirus' impact on the military and could test the Navy's ability to continue operations in the region at the same pace. 
Acting U.S. Navy Secretary Thomas Modly told a Pentagon news conference that, while the carrier in the Pacific Ocean was capable of carrying out military operations, it would be pulling into the U.S. island territory of Guam in the western Pacific.
""We are in the process now of testing 100 percent of the crew of that ship to ensure that we are able to contain whatever spread might have occurred there,"" Modly said.
In all, eight sailors have tested positive for the coronavirus, up from three on Tuesday, Modly said. 
However Defense Department officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the number of infected sailors had increased to about two dozen and would likely further increase as more were tested for the highly contagious respiratory illness.
The nuclear-powered Theodore Roosevelt, a small city at sea, usually also includes naval aviators and Marines. 
Modly said the carrier could do a small amount of the testing of samples taken from crew members, but that the Navy was looking into what other labs could process the tests for the virus. 
Earlier this month, the carrier visited the central Vietnamese city of Danang. Vietnam has only about 150 known cases of the illness that has infected more than 500,000 people worldwide.
As of Thursday, 280 U.S. service members around the world had tested positive for the coronavirus, including 104 from the Navy. 
""We are trending higher,"" Modly said, but added that it was too early to say why that was the case. 

The Navy is doing its part to assist with the strain on overwhelmed hospitals during the U.S. epidemic. It was sending a 1,000-bed hospital ship to New York City and another one to Los Angeles to treat non-coronavirus patients.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States blacklisted five Iran- and Iraq-based companies and 15 individuals on Thursday for supporting terrorist groups, its third round of sanctions on Iranian targets in the last two weeks even as Tehran battles the coronavirus outbreak.
In a statement, the U.S. Treasury Department accused those targeted of supporting the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and its Quds Force elite foreign paramilitary and espionage arm and of transferring lethal aid to Iran-backed militias in Iraq such as Kataib Hezbollah and Asaib Ahl al-Haq, all of which Washington deems foreign terrorist organizations.
The Pentagon blamed Kataib Hezbollah for a March 11 rocket attack that killed one British and two U.S. personnel in Iraq.
U.S. officials say they plan to keep sanctioning Iran to try to force it to curb its nuclear, missile and regional activities despite the coronavirus outbreak, which has killed 2,234 people in Iran.
Treasury accused those designated of ""malign activities"" including selling Iranian oil to Syria, smuggling arms to Iraq and Yemen and backing Iraqi militias that attack U.S. forces.
The sanctions freeze any of their U.S.-held assets and generally bar Americans from dealing with them.
The five targeted companies are Mada’in Novin Traders and Reconstruction Organization of the Holy Shrines in Iraq, both of which are based in Iran and Iraq; Bahjat al Kawthar Company for Construction and Trading Ltd, also known as Kosar Company, and Al Khamael Maritime Services, which are both based in Iraq; and Middle East Saman Chemical Company, which is based in Iran.
The action also blacklists 15 individuals who are associated with the companies or officials of the Quds Force and Kataib Hezbollah.
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged the boycott of U.S. sanctions, though it was unclear if he was responding to the latest actions. ""Does the US want a 'forever pandemic'? Moral imperative to stop observing the bully's sanctions,"" he tweeted.
Humanitarian supplies are exempt from sanctions Washington reimposed on Tehran after President Donald Trump abandoned Iran's 2015 multilateral deal to limit its nuclear program.
However, broader U.S. sanctions deter many firms from humanitarian trade with Iran.
The United States and Switzerland this year finalized a Swiss channel to get humanitarian goods to Iran. As of March 19, one transaction had been processed.
Separately, Washington renewed a sanctions waiver letting Iraq import electricity from Iran but vowed to blacklist anyone who used it to help terrorist groups.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - As Argentina was scrambling to introduce emergency measures to insulate its ailing economy from the coronavirus last week, the Chinese ambassador paid a visit to the home of President Alberto Fernandez to discuss an offer.
At the meeting in the wealthy Olivos suburb of Buenos Aires, ambassador Zou Xiaoli laid out how the Asian giant was ready to help Argentina face the pandemic: donating masks, gloves, thermometers and protective suits.
The donations, welcomed by Fernandez's government, show how China is leveraging its production of medical equipment and expertise in halting the coronavirus as a soft-power tool in regions like South America, where it is jostling for influence against the United States.
From Argentina to Mexico, Brazil to Peru, Latin American nations have accepted offers of support from China as the number of coronavirus cases across the region has climbed, amid growing fears about the preparedness of their healthcare systems. 
There have been nearly 500,000 confirmed cases worldwide of the virus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19, and over 20,000 deaths.
Although South America has so far not been as hard hit as other parts of the world, experts fear that may change as winter arrives in the southern hemisphere.
""Some countries in the region have reached out to China asking for help,"" a Chinese official in Buenos Aires, who asked not to be named, told Reuters. ""We will share with them our experience in combating COVID-19 and offer sanitary materials within our capacity.""
As trade tensions between Washington and Beijing have simmered in recent years, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has warned Latin American nations that they should be wary of becoming too economically reliant on China - to little avail.
In Argentina, the region's third-largest economy, China has made steady in-roads, from solar power investments to the construction of a new space monitoring station. It has supplied over $17 billion of financing since 2007, Inter-American Dialogue data shows. China has also become the top consumer of Argentine soybeans and beef.
As the coronavirus spread in China, Argentina's new left-leaning leader Fernandez - who took office in December - exchanged correspondence with Chinese leader Xi Jinping. 
In letters seen by Reuters, Fernandez offered solidarity to China in February as the virus raged from the outbreak center of Wuhan. In March, Xi replied that the situation in China was improving and he called for a deepening of ties between the two nations. 
Days later, the Chinese embassy announced its donations, posting pictures on Twitter of large trucks carrying a mobile hospital that was set up within a military base near the Argentine capital.
""China will continue to help in all possible channels. Long live friendship!"" the embassy said on Twitter. 
The help came at a difficult time for Argentina, which is grappling with a severe economic crisis and re-negotiating $110 billion in foreign debt with creditors, including the International Monetary Fund.
""This is part of the link we have with China, which is a solid relationship of mutual respect and ties that go beyond strong trade,"" a spokesman for Argentina's foreign ministry told Reuters, when asked about the donations.
INFORMATION CONTROL
China's aid to Latin America reflects a broader global trend, as Beijing looks to steer the narrative away from it being the country where the coronavirus started and was initially downplayed. Instead, China wants to be seen as spearheading the global fight against the pandemic, experts say.
Luo Zhaohui, a vice minister at China's foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday that the country would ""ride out the storm with people from other countries, strengthen cooperation and strive to win the last victory in the fight against the virus.""
While Trump has been criticized by opponents for branding the pandemic 'the Chinese virus,' China has won praise among Latin American governments that have accepted its help. The Chinese government said it has supplied test kits, protective suits and other forms of medical aid to more than 80 countries and international organizations.
""It's remarkable and a credit, in a way, to China's own commanding control of information that it's been able to re-envision itself as a leader in the fight against coronavirus globally,"" said Margaret Myers, director of the China and Latin American program at the Washington-based Inter-American Dialogue. 
Myers said the recent re-start of Chinese industry, as cases have subsided, has enabled the country to be a provider of key products as the rest of the world's production slows.
""This will create opportunities for China in the coming years,"" she said. 
The United States, meanwhile, is struggling with its own battle to contain the virus, with the World Health Organization warning on Tuesday that the country could become a new epicenter of the crisis.
Before the epidemic hit hardest, Washington in February pledged $100 million towards international efforts in combating COVID-19, including for developing nations. A regional breakdown of that funding was not immediately available.
THANK YOU, CHINA
In Latin America, China's hands-on approach has been well received.
Chile, which has among the highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the region, has sought advice from Chinese health officials to guide its response and is sending an air force plane to China to pick up donated supplies, including tests and respiratory equipment, Chile's health minister said.
In Mexico, officials have said they are awaiting 300 ventilators from China, crucial yet scarce equipment in treating patients, while in Panama, government health officials heralded a video conference with Chinese experts to work on strategy, something China has done with more than 100 countries.
In Venezuela, the government of President Nicolas Maduro said China would send protective gear for health professionals and coronavirus test kits. The country has also opened talks with China over possible financial support.
""Thank you China for cooperation and solidarity with Ecuador!"" the country's Vice President Otto Sonnenholzner wrote on Twitter, itemizing help from China that he said included 40,000 surgical masks, infrared thermometers, and protective suits.
In Brazil, right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has moved quickly to heal a diplomatic rift with China and Chinese officials have said Beijing would assist with medical supplies and technical assistance.
Chinese firms, including  Alibaba  (N:BABA), Huawei, COFCO, China Communications Construction and the Bank of China have pledged donations around the region.
Back in Argentina, Washington is keen to show that it also wants to help.

""We plan this week to make funds available to Argentine authorities to combat coronavirus,"" an official at the U.S. embassy in Buenos Aires told Reuters, adding the country was ""looking at the possibility of additional donations.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's main rival, Benny Gantz, was elected Speaker of parliament on Thursday in a surprise manoeuvre that could herald a unity government keeping the veteran leader in power.
With only the partial backing of his centrist Blue and White party and the support of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud, Gantz left many of his own political allies fuming over the smoothing of a path to partnership with a prime minister under criminal indictment.
The surprise twist in 48 hours of political drama plunged Blue and White in disarray. But Gantz's move kept open the possibility of a ""rotation"" deal in which he and Netanyahu would take turns as prime minister.
Each has insisted on going first, following three inconclusive national elections in less than a year.
Netanyahu has proposed a ""national emergency"" government with Gantz to help tackle the coronavirus crisis.
Israel's president, who enjoys wide public respect, had pressed them to join forces, with Israelis facing a possible national lockdown within days to try to lower infection rates.
""Israel is facing a growing number of (coronavirus)infections and the number of victims is rising daily,"" Gantz told parliament, accepting the speaker's gavel. 
Gantz said he intended to advance towards a unity government, and that he had opted to put himself up for the Speaker's office to promote a deal.
Gantz had ruled out serving with Netanyahu, citing the prime minister's looming trial on charges of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, which he denies.
But Likud had threatened to abandon unity efforts if Blue and White's original candidate for Speaker, an opponent of a partnership with Netanyahu, was chosen in the newly sworn-in parliament.
Mired in political deadlock, the prospects of Gantz forming an administration on his own had appeared slim.

At least one member of Netanyahu's right-wing bloc, Defence Minister Naftali Bennett, publicly congratulated both Netanyahu and Gantz on a unity agreement, but there was no formal announcement that a deal had been reached.

382,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 26, 2020 12:50PM ET</span>",U.S. to return Canada-bound asylum seekers stopped at border to home nations,"By Anna Mehler Paperny
TORONTO (Reuters) - After years of asylum-seekers crossing the Canada-U.S. border illegally to file refugee claims, Canada is turning them around and sending them back to the United States, which says it plans to send them swiftly back to their countries of origin. 
Canada said last week it will no longer accept irregular migrants trying to cross the shared border with the United States and will instead return them to U.S. authorities, as a temporary measure amid the coronavirus outbreak.
""In the event an alien cannot be returned to Mexico or Canada, CBP will work with interagency partners to secure return to the alien’s country of origin and hold the alien for the shortest time possible,"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) spokesman Michael Niezgoda told Reuters in an email. 
""For those who remain in CBP custody, CBP will, to the extent possible, keep them separated. Symptomatic individuals will be referred to CDC and placed in isolation.""
Since 2017 around 54,000 people have crossed the border into Canada, many saying they want to evade U.S. President Donald Trump’s crackdown on refugees and illegal immigrants.
Initially, in early March, Ottawa had said it would keep irregular migrants crossing the border in quarantine for two weeks. Last week, it said it reached an agreement with the United States to close the border to all but essential travel.
Amnesty International said the Canadian position violates its obligations under the 1951 UN refugee convention, including a clause on non-refoulement or the return of asylum seekers to places they fled due to persecution, often their home countries. 
""It demonstrates a lack of leadership. It demonstrates a lack of legal commitment to the obligations Canada has signed up for,"" said Justin Mohammed, a human rights law and policy campaigner for Amnesty International Canada. 
Immigration and Refugees Minister Marco Mendocino's office referred questions about irregular migrants to Public Safety Minister Bill Blair, who was not available.
Blair's spokeswoman said Ottawa was ""committed to ensuring Canada remains a welcoming country for those fleeing war and persecution"" and meeting its international commitments.
""We must note that these restrictions are temporary, and are constantly being re-evaluated to best reflect the advice of our public health officials,"" spokeswoman Mary-Liz Power said in an email.
Amnesty International considers aspects of U.S. immigration detention policy a violation of human rights, citing high detention rates, inadequate conditions and the practice of separating parents and children.
U.S. authorities said last week they will delay arresting some people suspected of violating immigration laws until after the coronavirus crisis. 
Returning people to their country of origin will be tough given flight restrictions in the U.S, said Janet McFetridge, whose organization Plattsburgh Cares helps migrants on the U.S. side of the New York-Quebec border near Roxham Road, a popular crossing spot. 
""If they need to return to wherever they came from, they're going to have a very difficult time getting there right now,"" she said. ""It's an absolutely bleak situation.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain brought in tough measures on Thursday to curb the spread of coronavirus and ensure people obey the government's virtual lockdown which many thousands are feared to have so far ignored.
The new powers allow police to issue instant fines those who leave their homes without good reason or gather in groups of more than two people.
In northern England, one police force has begun introducing random vehicle checkpoints to ensure the new rules are enforced while the head of the Church of England told Britons who were flouting the instructions to ""get your act together"".
Last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered pubs, restaurants and nearly all shops to close, banned social gatherings and told people to stay at home unless they needed to buy food, go out to essential work or to exercise once a day.
While millions have respected the measures, roads and parks have remained busy, and the authorities across the country have repeatedly reported that people have not respected the 2 metre (6 foot) guidance on social distancing while others have continued to mingle.
On Thursday, a new regulations came into effect which give the authorities the power to impose a 30-pound fixed penalty on those who breach the rules. Repeat offenders could ultimately receive a fine of up to 960 pounds and might be arrested.
Those who did not pay up could be taken to court, where magistrates could impose unlimited fines, the government said.
""The prime minister has been clear on what we need to do: stay at home to protect our NHS and save lives,"" said Home Secretary (interior minister) Priti Patel.
PARKS CLOSED
Some Britons have continued their daily routine and risked spreading the virus which the government fears could overwhelm the National Health Service if large numbers contract COVID-19. 
In east London, police and the Tower Hamlets local authority said they had been forced to close Victoria Park, one of the largest and most popular open public spaces in the area, because people were failing to abide by the guidance.
The Royal Parks, a charity which looks after eight major parks across the capital, said it too was considering shutting its gates. 
""It is up to all of us collectively to adhere to the latest guidance, otherwise we will have to consider closing the parks. We will keep the situation under constant review,"" said Tom Jarvis, its Director of Parks. 
Other cities have already closed some parks and facilities to meet the guidance on social distancing while Greater Manchester firefighters said they had received reports of lots of people having barbecues on moorlands.
Meanwhile police in Devon, southwest England, said when they has asked a young cyclist why he was four miles from his home and not following the rules, he had replied: ""It only kills old people"".
The Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, spiritual head of the Church of England, said people should not act selfishly.
""Get your act together,"" he said to those who have been ignoring the strict government social distancing instructions. 
""If you are not complying, you are risking other people's lives, not just your own,"" he told  ITV  (LON:ITV) News.
To ensure compliance, police in northern England said they would bring in vehicle checkpoints from Thursday, along with foot patrols to disperse any groups.
""We sincerely hope that we won’t have to resort to enforcement action, but if people do not comply, we will,"" said Mike Walker, Assistant Chief Constable of North Yorkshire.
Meanwhile, Britain's Director of Public Prosecutions Max Hill said anyone who claimed they had the virus and deliberately coughed at police or other emergency workers could be charged with common assault and face up to two years in jail.

""Let me be very clear: this is a crime and needs to stop.""

""This regulation will be extended... until April 13, then we will be in accordance with the rules and regulations of the republic of Austria,"" said Guenther Platter, referring to a country-wide call for people to stay at home.
People in the ski resorts, that include Ischgl, St. Anton, St. Christoph and Soelden, would only be allowed to leave if they can provide permits from the ministries of foreign affairs and health, Platter said.
Austria has reported nearly 6,400 cases in its nine provinces, a quarter of them in Tyrol. 
Austrian economic research institute Wifo warned on Thursday that the economy could shrink by 2.5% this year in a best-case scenario. 
The calculation was based on assumptions that lockdown measures are eased in May and daily life is back to normal by the summer, Wifo chief Christoph Badelt said. 
Badelt predicts Austria to record a Maastrich deficit of 5.4% and an unemployment rate of 8.4% this year.
More than 150,000 people have registered as newly unemployed since March 15, many of them from the hospitality and services sector, according to employment agency AMS, although the government has launched a 38 billion euros aid package and promised generous support for short-time working agreements.

BAARLE-HERTOG, Belgium/BAARLE-NASSAU, Netherlands (Reuters) - Measures to halt the spread of the coronavirus have created an odd situation in a village straddling the Dutch-Belgian border where opposite sides of the road are in different countries.
For decades residents have freely gone about their business barely noticing the dotted frontier on the ground, but now tougher lockdown rules in Belgium limit its citizens to food shops and pharmacies, while the Dutch are also allowed to visit the shoe shop, travel agency and optician on their territory.
""These are all Dutch shops, but in Belgium they would have to be closed in this time of coronavirus,"" said Frans De Bont, mayor of the Belgian municipality Baarle-Hertog, pointing at a row of shops on a Dutch street section.
""I live just 50 meters away, I walk by, but I cannot go into any of these shops because I am Belgian,"" he told Reuters TV. ""We have extra police driving around, but we are calling for understanding from the public.""
One store even had a ribbon down the middle of its premises, marking the border, with the Belgian section off-limits. Belgians are still allowed to go to food shops, a pharmacy or a doctor if they happen to be on Dutch territory.
The village and its surroundings are entirely within the Netherlands, but it also comprises 22 Belgian enclaves that form Baarle-Hertog and, within these, a further eight Dutch micro-enclaves, which belong to Dutch Baarle-Nassau. The border even bisects some properties.
De Bont said the quirky geography stemmed from a feudal system of land swaps and rentals that took place as much as 1,000 years ago, and left in place.
""It used to be very common, but it's just here that it's stayed,"" he said, adding that efforts to establish a more regular border, including after World War One, had come to nothing.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Tehran said on Thursday that a former FBI agent who disappeared in Iran 13 years ago had left the country a long time ago, despite his family saying a day earlier that he had died in Iranian custody.
Robert Levinson went missing on Iran's Kish Island in the Gulf in March 2007. The case is another irritant in the already hostile relationship between Washington and Tehran.
Levinson's family said on Wednesday it now believed Levinson died in Iranian custody, based on information from U.S. officials.
""Today with aching hearts, we are sharing devastating news about Robert Levinson, the head of our family,"" they said in a statement.
However, Iran's foreign ministry spokesman said on Thursday 
that, based on what he called credible evidence, Levinson had left Iran ""years ago"" for an unspecified destination.
""In the past years Iran has tried to find out his state but could not find any signs of him being alive,"" spokesman Abbas Mousavi said, according to state television.
Reuters reported in 2013 that Levinson, a private detective and former FBI agent, was investigating allegations of corruption by well-connected people in Iran.
Lawyer David McGee said then that Levinson was trying to trace money laundered through Iranian exiles living in Toronto. 
U.S. officials had acknowledged to Reuters that Levinson had a relationship with the CIA as a source at the time he visited Kish Island and disappeared.
A video released in 2011 showed him pleading for help. It did not say who was holding him or where.
Tehran denied knowledge of Levinson’s whereabouts last November, when it said a legal case involving him was under way at a revolutionary court that handles security-related cases.
""Iran has always maintained that its officials have no knowledge of Mr. Levinson's whereabouts, and that he is not in Iranian custody. Those facts have not changed,"" the spokesman for Iran's mission at the United Nations, Alireza Miryousefi, said on Thursday. 
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had not been told that Levinson was dead.
But White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said later that an investigation was still going on but ""we believe that Bob Levinson may have passed away some time ago"".
Levinson's family said in their statement: ""We recently received information from U.S. officials that has led both them and us to conclude that our wonderful husband and father died while in Iranian Custody.""
They said they did not know when or how he died but that it was before the coronavirus epidemic hit Iran. Nor did they know if Levinson's body would ever be returned to them.
O'Brien said Iran must provide a complete accounting of what happened to Levinson.
Levinson disappeared after flying from Dubai to Kish in 2007. There he met with Daoud Salahuddin, an American Islamic militant who fled to Iran while facing charges in the murder of an Iranian embassy official based in Washington.
Levinson, then a private investigator, was seeking information on alleged corruption involving former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his family, sources familiar with his work said.
The Iranian government has never publicly acknowledged any role in Levinson's abduction, though at the time of his disappearance a government-affiliated media outlet said he was ""in the hands of Iranian security forces"".
Some U.S. investigators at least until recently believed Levinson was still alive, while officials at other U.S. agencies believe he died some time, perhaps years, ago.
The United States and the Islamic Republic are longtime foes. Washington opposes Tehran's influence in the Middle East and backs its regional rival Saudi Arabia. They also support opposing sides in wars in Yemen and Syria.
Washington also maintains tough economic sanctions on Iran. In 2018, Trump pulled the United States out of an international agreement which curbed Iran's nuclear program.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain has placed an emergency order of 10,000 ventilators designed at breakneck speed by bagless vacuum cleaner company Dyson, the first fruits of an industry-wide call to arms to prepare for the looming peak of the coronavirus outbreak.
In another industry effort, a consortium of companies in the aerospace and engineering sectors are working with seven Formula One racing teams to ramp up production of existing ventilator models, with a manufacturing launch date penned in for March 30. 
Ahead of an expected surge of cases that could overwhelm Britain's publicly funded health service, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an urgent appeal to manufacturers 10 days ago to build ventilators to help keep patients alive.
Production of Dyson's new CoVent ventilator could start early next month but the government made clear the order was dependent on it passing safety and regulatory tests.
""The core challenge was how to design and deliver a new, sophisticated medical product in volume and in an extremely short space of time,"" billionaire founder James Dyson said on Wednesday evening in an email to staff seen by Reuters. 
""The race is now on to get it into production.""
Dyson is able to draw on the company's expertise in air movement, motors, power systems, manufacturing and supply chains to design and build an entirely new ventilator. 
The company revolutionized the vacuum cleaner market with its bagless cyclonic device in the 1990s and has since gone on to build air purifiers, hand dryers and fans from its base in southwest England and manufacturing plants in Malaysia, Singapore and the Philippines. 
TARGET: 30,000
The aerospace and engineering consortium, meanwhile, includes such names as Rolls-Royce (LON:RR), BAE, Airbus and Siemens UK which will help existing medical device makers such as Penlon and  Smiths Group  (LON:SMIN) to ramp up production.
It is waiting for the green light from government. 
British engineer Babcock has also joined forces with a leading medical equipment company and experts from London's Royal Brompton Hospital. 
The companies have all sprung into action after the government said it needed another 30,000 ventilators to save the lives of patients who develop complications with COVID-19. The government is also acquiring the life-saving devices from private hospitals and international producers. 
Britain currently has about 8,000 ventilators with another 8,000 on order to come into the health system in about a week
By 0900 GMT on Wednesday some 9,529 people had tested positive for the virus in the United Kingdom while 463 patients had died. 
Britain has also bought 3.5 million antibody testing kits - largely used to determine if someone has already had the virus - and is currently making sure they work before distributing them.
Prototypes of an antibody test which could be a game-changer in the fight against the pandemic are being assessed and are ready to be optimized, the developer of the technology said on Thursday. 

Many staff within the National Health Service (NHS) have not been tested, a major concern for health workers and a cause of mounting criticism of the government's response.

LONDON (Reuters) - Extending school and work closures at the coronavirus' ground zero in China may delay a second wave of infections, researchers said on Thursday, urging the rest of the world to take note. 
With containment measures largely successful and the epidemic's epicenter now in Europe, China has loosened a two-month lockdown in the city of Wuhan where the new coronavirus is thought to have jumped from wildlife to people late last year.
But a study in The Lancet Public Health journal suggested continuing Wuhan's shutdowns until April would push a potential second wave of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the new virus - until later in the year. That would give health services more time to recover and expand, potentially saving lives.
""The city now needs to be really careful to avoid prematurely lifting physical distancing measures, because that could lead to an earlier secondary peak in cases,"" said Kiesha Prem, a specialist at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), who co-led the research.
""If they relax the restrictions gradually, this is likely to both delay and flatten the peak.""
The study used mathematical modeling to simulate either extending or relaxing school and workplace closures in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people whose name has become synonymous with the coronavirus for much of the world.
By lifting control measures now, a second rush of infections may occur in late August, the analysis suggested. But keeping lockdown measures until April would likely delay a second peak until October — giving healthcare workers a chance to regroup.
RESURGENCE FEARS 
Those findings were ""crucial for policy makers everywhere"", said Tim Colbourn, an expert in global health epidemiology at University College London, who was not directly involved in the study. 
Stunned by the disease's rapid spread, governments around the world are trying to replicate China's draconian lockdown measures while also working out the risk of recurrences once the epidemic peaks have passed in their countries. 
""Our results won't look exactly the same in another country,"" said Yang Liu, an LSHTM expert who also worked on the research. ""But we think one thing probably applies everywhere: physical distancing measures are very useful, and we need to carefully adjust their lifting to avoid subsequent waves of infection ... If those waves come too quickly, that could overwhelm health systems.""
World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Wednesday expressed the same view, saying lockdowns were the best way to curb transmission. 

""The last thing any country needs is to open schools and businesses only to be forced to close them again because of a resurgence,"" he said.

BRUSSELS/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's military planeloads of aid to Italy to combat the spread of coronavirus have exposed the European Union's failure to provide swift help to a member in crisis and handed President Vladimir Putin a publicity coup at home and abroad.
Italy has been thankful for the Russian decontamination units and army medical staff sent over the past four days, contrasting it with a piecemeal response by EU states.
But senior EU and NATO diplomats and officials see the assistance less as generosity and more as a geopolitical move asserting Russian power and extending influence.
""The Italians made a general request for assistance and the Russians are sending military doctors and military equipment by military planes,"" a senior EU diplomat said.
""That sends a signal.""
Russian gas imports help fuel Italy's power plants and Rome has long called for a relaxation of EU sanctions imposed on Moscow over Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014. The penalties have been repeatedly renewed while Moscow backed separatists elsewhere in Ukraine.
Rome denies the aid signals a merging of geopolitical interests.
""There are no new geopolitical scenarios to trace, there is a country that needs help and other countries that are helping us,"" Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio was quoted as saying by Italy's Il Corriere della Sera newspaper on Thursday.
""It is not a question of a Cold War, it is a question of reality, or realpolitik, you call it what you like.""
'FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE'
Russia has flown at least 15 flights to Italy using military transport planes with truck-based disinfection units. Eight medical brigades and another 100 personnel include some of its most advanced nuclear, biological and chemical protection troops.
""France has given us 2 million masks, Germany has sent us a few dozen ventilators. (Prime Minister Guiseppe) Conte requested and obtained some planes from Russia that brought 180 doctors, nurses, ventilators and masks,"" Italy's government commissioner for the coronavirus emergency, Domenico Arcuri, told RAI on Sunday.
Russia's government and its delegation to NATO have published multiple videos of trucks on their way to Bergamo, the epicenter of Italy's coronavirus crisis, on their Twitter accounts while Russian state media showed Italy's foreign minister personally welcoming the first Russian plane.
Labeled ""From Russia with Love"", planes and trucks bore giant stickers showing heart-shaped Russian and Italian flags next to one another.
By contrast, NATO airlifts of urgent medical supplies to European allies have not grabbed public attention. The European Union has faced delays obtaining face masks and other protective gear while EU governments have closed borders to one another.
NATO militaries are active flying sick patients to hospitals, delivering beds and repatriating citizens, although NATO has not deployed its own biological protection units.
""This is a big success story for Putin. I think the Italians have fallen into a trap,"" said a senior NATO diplomat, although he noted that Italy was now receiving more support directly from the alliance. Spain has also requested direct NATO help.
Alexander Baunov, a senior fellow at the Moscow Carnegie Center, noted China and Cuba were also sending medical aid to Italy. ""For countries that would like to see the existing world order revised in their favor, the pandemic is an opportunity,"" he said.
SANCTIONS RELIEF
The EU and NATO have long accused the Kremlin of using a mix of soft power, covert action and computer hackers to try to destabilize the West by exploiting divisions in society.
Last week, an EU internal document seen by Reuters accused Russian media of deploying a ""significant disinformation campaign"" against the West to worsen the impact of the coronavirus. Moscow denied any such plan. 
While not mentioning Russia by name, the EU's foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in his blog this week that the EU needed to be more aware of ""a struggle for influence through spinning and the politics of generosity"".
Russia is subject to European Union sanctions on its banking, financial and energy sectors and all 27 governments must agree to renew them every six months.
When asked if Russia expected Italy to return the favor by trying to get EU sanctions lifted, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov described the notion as absurd.
""We're not talking about any conditions or calculations or hopes here,"" he said on Monday. ""Italy is really in need of much more wide scale help and what Russia does is manageable.""

The Schengen agreement, underpinning an increasingly integrated and united Europe, came into force on March 26, 1995.
It initially abolished checks at frontiers between France, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Spain and Portugal. In the following months and years others joined, and today the Schengen zone has 26 members, including non-EU nations Switzerland and Norway.
But on its 25th anniversary, the agreement is virtually suspended because of the coronavirus, which has frozen most economic and social activity, disrupted supply chains and turned most Europeans into prisoners in their own homes.
""The COVID-19 outbreak is having a major disruptive impact on European cross-border mobility and transport,"" an internal document of the European Commission said, referring to the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The document, dated March 25, said all EU member states had introduced border restrictions or closures, with the exception of Ireland, which is not a member of the Schengen area and does not share any land border with EU states following Britain's exit from the bloc.
""THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO""
Airports in all but five EU states are subject to restrictions on arrivals and flights, the Commission document said, warning about the disruption caused by such measures on the supply of goods, including essential ones such as drugs.
""The very life of many of our citizens relies on unhindered movement across borders of workers, essential medical supplies and goods of first necessity,"" Jean Asselborn, foreign minister of Luxembourg, where the town of Schengen is located, said on Thursday.
He called for the lifting of checks and the reopening of borders as soon as possible. 
But even the founding members of the Schengen accord have shut their borders, despite experts' advice that the measure is not effective against the virus.
""I had heard in the news that the borders were closed, but I did not expect that there would be such strict controls. There's nothing we can do about it,"" said Dutch commuter Bart Jansen.
He was trying to go to work from his home town of Breda in the Netherlands via a shortcut on Belgian territory, but was not allowed to enter Belgium.

The two countries were, along with Luxembourg, France and West Germany, the signatories of the original Schengen agreement in 1985, 10 years before its application.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britons around the country were set to take to their balconies and front gardens on Thursday evening to applaud healthcare workers who are battling the spread of coronavirus.
The ""Clap for our Carers"" initiative, which has been widely spread on social media, encourages people to deliver a round of applause at 2000 GMT to show their appreciation to doctors, nurses, and all those tackling the COVID-19 outbreak.
""During these unprecedented times they need to know that we are grateful,"" the message said.
""Please join us on 26th March at 8pm for a big applause (from front doors, garden, balcony, windows, living rooms etc) to show all nurses; doctors; GPs and carers our appreciation for their ongoing hard work and fight against this virus.""
Asked whether the prime minister would be taking part, Boris Johnson's spokesman said: ""The prime minister will take every opportunity that is available to him to express his support for the fantastic efforts of the NHS (National Health Service).
Frontline doctors have warned they do not have enough personal protective equipment and feel like ""cannon fodder"" in the fight against the virus and have complained about a lack of testing for healthcare workers.
As the health service becomes increasingly stretched by the number of cases, the government is opening a temporary hospital at an exhibition centre in east London and asking manufacturers to produce thousands of ventilators.
More than 9,500 people have tested positive for the virus in Britain and 463 have died. 
On Tuesday the government issued a call for 250,000 volunteers to sign up to help the NHS and vulnerable people hit by the coronavirus crisis, and health minister Matt Hancock said on Thursday that 560,000 people had already volunteered.
Johnson's spokesman said the scheme would not be closing and it would be ""fantastic"" if it could get to 750,000.
Sporting and entertainment venues including London's Royal Albert Hall and the National Theatre, as well as several other landmarks, will also be illuminated in blue at the time of the applause to honour the NHS.
Others planning to mark the occasion include London's Thames Clipper boat bus service. 
""Today our fleet will be blowing their horns as part of the Clap for Carers Campaign at 8pm. Please join us by giving a big round of applause for all their ongoing hard work,"" it said.

Similar events have taken place in other countries including India, where people took to their balconies and stood near open windows on Sunday to clap, clang metal vessels and ring bells to cheer emergency workers.

The overall drawdown will see coalition forces move into a smaller number of bases and reduce personnel. The coalition has not provided details or numbers.
Qayyara air base, south of the city of Mosul where Islamic State declared its caliphate in 2014, is the second base to be handed over to the Iraqis this month. Coalition troops left a base at al-Qaim on the Syrian border last week.
""The coalition will operate from fewer locations, but remains committed to supporting our partners in their fight against Daesh (Islamic States),"" Brigadier General Vincent Barker of the coalition said in a statement.
Coalition officials say the troop cuts and relocation of units into fewer Iraqi bases is because Iraqi forces are mostly capable of containing the threat from leftover Islamic State militants on their own.
The U.S.-led coalition has supported the Iraqi military since 2014 in the fight to neutralise Islamic State. A few thousand militants are believed to be remain active, mostly confined to remote areas such as desert and mountains across northern Iraq. They periodically attack security forces but have held no major territory like towns and cities since 2017. 
The coalition currently deploys around 7,500 troops in Iraq, including 5,000 Americans.

The Forsa poll for RTL put Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU), who are in the middle of a leadership contest, and their Bavarian sister party the CSU up 4 points from last week at 36% compared with 32.9% in the 2017 election.
Their Social Democrat (SPD) coalition partners were up 1 point at 16% while the Greens, who had soared in polls in the last year due to climate fears, were down 3 points at 17%.
""The corona crisis has led to a kind of renaissance at least for the two main traditional parties,"" said Forsa chief Manfred Guellner, who cited the ruling parties' focus on solving the virus problem and putting internal disputes behind them.
The poll showed that 40% of Germans were convinced that the conservative bloc was best-placed to deal with the country's current problems. That is a 12-point rise from a week ago.
With 36,508 confirmed cases and 198 deaths, according to the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases, Germany has largely shut down, and the pandemic is likely to push the economy into recession.
Merkel's government has announced a range of measures to cushion the blow, including a 750 billion euro stimulus package, and has even suspended a constitutionally enshrined debt brake to help fund it.
After nearly 15 years leading Europe's biggest economy, Merkel has said she will not stand for a fifth term in an election due by October 2021.
Her protege Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer said last month she would stand down as head of the CDU, triggering a leadership contest.

The winner will be in a strong position to run as chancellor in the federal election. But Bavaria's CSU must give its consent, and polls show that its leader Markus Soeder has also gained in popularity during the virus crisis.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's capital is installing hand-washing stations and disinfectant-spraying booths across the city of 10 million people to try to curb an accelerating spread of coronavirus infections.
Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, has reported 893 cases of the virus and 78 deaths, the majority clustered in and around the capital. 
The governor of Jakarta has declared a two-week emergency that includes the shutting of cinemas and letting staff work from home though President Joko Widodo has so far resisted calls for tougher lockdowns amid concerns about the economic impact.
The city government has installed hand-washing stations in some public areas to reinforce the message of the need for good hygiene. 
""We have to be more vigilant and most importantly keep the environment clean,"" said Jakarta-resident Desianta, who was at a hand-washing station set up in the city. 
""Everything begins from home and then around the neighborhood, we help to protect each other,"" she said.
The city has also been setting up booths covered by plastic sheets that spray disinfectant on to people's clothes with the aim of killing germs.After being sprayed, security guard Suwarno said he felt a little more at ease but not totally safe ""because there are many ways of transmission"".
Another resident, Marina Nur Solihin, praised efforts by authorities to disinfect public transport and other facilities.
Nonetheless, some experts were sceptical about the effectiveness of such efforts, including spraying disinfectant indiscriminately in some areas.

""It’s just to reassure people... but it’s actually a waste of resources,"" said Syahrizal Syarif, an epidemiologist at the University of Indonesia, adding it was better to target specific items like tables and chairs in public places.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - China accused the United States on Thursday of playing a dangerous game with its support for Taiwan, after a U.S. warship passed through the sensitive Taiwan Strait following heightened military tension between China and Taiwan.
China has been angered by the Trump administration's stepped-up support for the island it considers its own, such as more arms sales, U.S. patrols near Taiwan and last month's visit to Washington by Taiwan Vice President-elect William Lai.
Anthony Junco, a spokesman for the U.S. Seventh Fleet, said the guided-missile destroyer USS McCampbell conducted ""a routine Taiwan Strait transit"" on March 25, in line with international law. 
""The ship's transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the U.S. commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,"" he added. ""The U.S. Navy will continue to fly, sail and operate anywhere international law allows.""
Taiwan's defence ministry said the ship sailed north through the waterway and was monitored by Taiwan's armed forces, on what it called an ""ordinary mission"", adding there was no cause for alarm.
In Beijing, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Ren Guoqiang denounced ""continued negative actions"" by the United States on Taiwan, including sailings through and flights over the Taiwan Strait.
""U.S. moves have seriously interfered in China's internal affairs, severely harmed peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait and poisoned Sino-U.S. military ties,"" Ren told a monthly news conference. 
The actions were ""extremely dangerous"", he added. 
Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial and diplomatic issue and Beijing has never ruled out the use of force to bring the island under its control. The narrow Taiwan Strait that separates the island from China is a frequent source of tension.
In recent weeks China's air force has conducted several exercises close to Taiwan, prompting its mostly U.S.-equipped military to scramble fighters to intercept and warn away the Chinese aircraft.
Taiwan has called the drills provocative, and urged China to pay more attention to fighting a coronavirus pandemic, rather than menace it.
The United States, like most countries, has no official relations with Taiwan, but is the island's most important international supporter and main source of arms.
In January another U.S. warship sailed through the Taiwan Strait less than a week after President Tsai Ing-wen won re-election by a landslide on a platform of standing up to China.
Tsai visited a military base on Tuesday and again warned of the threat from China during the virus outbreak.
""Everyone knows that although at present there is an intense epidemic situation, the Chinese Communists' military aircraft continue to harass Taiwan,"" she said. ""Their threat to Taiwan and regional security has not gone down.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia ordered two cruise ships to leave its waters on Thursday, after a liner that docked in Sydney Harbour last week became the primary source of infection in the country's coronavirus outbreak.
Although well below levels elsewhere in the world, the pace of Australia's infections is starting to pick up speed, reaching nearly 2,800 cases and 13 deaths.
The government of West Australia state said nobody would be permitted to disembark from the German-operated MV Artania after seven of 800 foreign passengers on board tested positive for the virus, unless there was a ""life threatening emergency"".
""This ship needs to leave immediately,"" Premier Mark McGowan said. ""Our position is clear, we are not going to have a Sydney Harbour fiasco on our watch."" 
Germany's Phoenix Reisen, owner of the Artania, was not immediately available for comment. 
McGowan said a second cruise ship, the MSC Magnifica, which was refused permission to dock in Perth this week, was headed out of Australian waters. MSC Cruises, which has said it had no ill passengers, declined to comment on its destination. 
Cruise ships have become a flashpoint after 147 of the 2,700 passengers allowed to disembark from Carnival Corp's (N:CCL) Ruby Princess later tested positive for the virus, a blunder that underlined official tensions in handling the crisis.
State and federal authorities have clashed over who was at fault, amid conflicting public advice over matters such as virus testing and school closures.
The discrepancies echo similar tensions elsewhere. In Brazil, state governors have defied President Jair Bolsonaro's call to ease strict curbs. Bolsonaro, who has called the virus a ""little flu"", wanted schools and businesses reopened.
Western Australia is preparing Rottnest island, a former prison island, to quarantine some of the 800 Australians aboard a third cruise ship, the British-operated Vasco de Gama. More than 100 other passengers, from Britain and New Zealand, will be quarantined on the ship when it docks on Monday.
Shipowner Britain's Cruise & Maritime Voyages said it was carrying no unwell passengers or staff.
More than 3,000 Australians are scattered on about 30 cruise ships around the world, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said. 
""In so many ports - I couldn't begin to count - but literally from South America, to Europe, to the United States, and further afield,"" she said. ""We want to make sure that those Australians are able to return."" 
Two British tourists found themselves stranded in South Australia last week after getting off the Celebrity Solstice cruise liner in Sydney, and traveling to the city of Adelaide where they were told to quarantine themselves, they told media.
Steve and Tina Dixon, an asthmatic diagnosed with the virus, had to rely on a good Samaritan for food after arriving in the city where they had no friends or family, and were unable to register for a home delivery account at a local supermarket.
TOUGHER SOCIAL CURBS
Some state leaders have also flagged that they are willing to push for tougher curbs on social activities if Prime Minister Scott Morrison's government does not move fast enough.
Stricter measures likely in the next few days are expected to affect retail and public transport. 
Police will patrol beaches on what is set to be a sunny weekend, after crowds at Sydney's Bondi last weekend frustrated officials and set off a round of tighter curbs.
""Because of the lack of consistent messaging, because people had been flouting the earlier advice regarding social distancing measures, we need to move further and quickly to ensure that what we're seeing around the world doesn't mimic and occur on front doors,"" Australian Medical Association President Tony Bartone told reporters. 
With infections rising quickly, Australia has ordered curbs, such as the forced closure of pubs, restaurants and cinemas.
Long queues snaked around welfare offices, while more than a quarter of a million Australians registered for financial help on Wednesday, the government said.
Further job losses are expected, with some economists expecting Australian unemployment to double this year to more than 11%.

 Flight Centre  (AX:FLT) on Thursday said a third of its workforce of 20,000 faced temporary or permanent redundancy, while retail tycoon Solomon Lew's Premier Investments Ltd (AX:PMV) temporarily closed all stores in Australia.

The tomb-sweeping, or Qingming, festival is one of the most important dates in the traditional lunar calendar, when people go to cemeteries to make offerings to their ancestors and ensure the graves are properly tended.
It is also a four-day weekend holiday for Taiwan, where many people take religious traditions very seriously. That increases the potential for large crowds at a time when the government is encouraging social distancing.
Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Lin Ching-chi, the Interior Ministry's director of civil affairs, said this year they were encouraging ""chill-out"" tomb sweeping, in which people make their offerings online. If they must go to the cemetery, Lin said, they should limit or space out their trips.
Standing next to a cartoon image of a person sitting in the lotus position at home with a laptop on a coffee table, Lin said local governments were setting up websites for the virtual offerings.
""If you really want to meet your ancestors, you can do it online,"" he said. 
If you do have to go out in person, make sure it's only one or two people, Lin added. ""And we hope everyone doesn't go on the same day.""
Some of the local government websites ask people to input details of the deceased person to track them in the system, and encourage people to write their ancestors a message. 
Virtual flowers and candles for ancestors can be offered with a few clicks. 
Taiwan has kept it virus numbers low so far in comparison with its neighbors, especially China, not only by the early deployment of its first-rate medical system but also by using an often witty online public health campaign.
Premier Su Tseng-chang has been a notable example of this, using his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page to post humorous messages with serious content about how to prevent the virus, and what the government has been doing.

Taiwan has reported 252 cases so far, and two deaths.

ADEN (Reuters) - Yemen's warring parties welcomed a United Nations call for an immediate truce on Thursday as the country entered its sixth year of a conflict that has unleashed a humanitarian crisis, rendering it more vulnerable to any coronavirus outbreak.
A Saudi-led military coalition said late on Wednesday that it backed the Yemeni government's acceptance of the U.N. appeal. Their foe, the Iran-aligned Houthi movement, welcomed that stance but said it wants to see implementation on the ground.
The new coronavirus has yet to be documented in the impoverished Arabian peninsula nation where conflict violence has killed more than 100,000 and left millions on the brink of starvation.
Following his call for a global ceasefire to focus on combating the coronavirus pandemic, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Wednesday urged Yemen's parties to end hostilities and restart peace talks last held in December 2018.
The Sunni Muslim coalition, which intervened in Yemen in March 2015, supports efforts for a ceasefire, de-escalation, confidence-building measures and work to prevent a coronavirus outbreak, spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said in a statement.
""The coalition's announcement ... is welcome. We are waiting for it to be applied practically,"" a senior Houthi official, Mohammed Ali al-Houthi, tweeted late on Wednesday.
Yemen had witnessed a lull in military action after Saudi Arabia and the Houthis launched back-channel talks late last year. But there has been a recent spike in violence that threatens fragile peace deals in vital port cities.
""We have a global coronavirus pandemic threatening to overwhelm an already broken health care system,"" said Tamuna Sabadze, country director at the International Rescue Committee, adding that Yemen is already battling a large cholera outbreak.
Millions are dependent on humanitarian aid in Yemen, which has been mired in conflict since the Houthis ousted the government from power in the capital, Sanaa, in late 2014. The group still controls most major urban centers despite years of war. 
The head of the Houthi political office said on Wednesday the movement was open to de-escalation efforts, including prisoner releases.
Mahdi al-Mashat, in comments carried by al-Masirah TV, then ordered the release of all Baha'i faith members imprisoned by the Houthis, including Hamed bin Haydara whose death sentence was upheld earlier this week by a Sanaa court.
The Baha'i International Community welcomed the decision, which it said in a statement applied to six people ""wrongfully imprisoned"" for religious beliefs. 
It said the order should lead to the lifting of charges made in 2018 against around 20 members of the faith, which regards its 19th-century founder as a prophet. Muslim countries, including Iran where the sect originated, consider it an heretical offshoot of Islam.

Police in Mexico City arrested 10 people on Tuesday night who tried to rob shops in four neighborhoods, the city's security ministry said in a statement.
Authorities have tried to reassure residents that this is not the beginning of a wave of looting, saying the supply of supply of food and medicine is guaranteed.
Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said at a news conference on Wednesday that authorities are conducting ""permanent surveillance of social networks in case there are any calls"" to loot and explained that the thieves targeting shops to steal televisions and the like ""has nothing to do with"" poverty.
That did little to assuage the fears of some shopkeepers as criminals organized heists on social networks and instant messaging platforms, such as WhatsApp. (O:FB)
""In the middle of this pandemic in Mexico, it's incredible people are still organizing looting,"" a shop owner in populous Mexico state, which neighbors capital Mexico City, said online.
""I ask authorities to vigilant because many business owners are afraid of being attacked by looters.""
The public security ministry of Mexico state said that on Tuesday it detected 29 Facebook accounts inciting residents to ransack stores that had closed due to the pandemic, which has so far infected 405 and killed five people in Mexico.
The head of the public security ministry of Mexico state, Maribel Cervantes, told local television station Milenio that the authority was coordinating with the Mexican retailers' association ANTAD to beef up security.
In the southeastern state of Quintana Roo, home to tourist hotspot Cancun, police chief Alberto Capella took to Twitter to warn alleged looters plotting on WhatsApp that authorities were onto their scheme.

""We are watching you, along with the other members of your WhatsApp chat. After identifying you, we will charge you,"" Capella said, directing his message to the administrator of the group.

WELLINGTON (Reuters) - A suspected white supremacist accused of killing 51 Muslim worshippers in New Zealand's worst mass shooting changed his plea to guilty in a surprise move on Thursday. 
Brenton Tarrant, who appeared by video link, admitted to 51 charges of murder, 40 charges of attempted murder and one charge of committing a terrorist act in a hastily called Christchurch High Court hearing.
""He has been convicted of each and every one of those charges,"" presiding judge Justice Cameron Mander said in minutes of the hearing released by the court.
""The entry of guilty pleas represents a very significant step towards bringing finality to this criminal proceeding,"" Justice Mander said.
Tarrant has been in police custody since March 15, 2019, when he was arrested and accused of using semi-automatic weapons to target Muslims attending Friday prayers at two mosques in Christchurch. The attack was streamed live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). 
Tarrant, a 29-year-old Australian, had previously pleaded not guilty to all charges.
Justice Mander said there was now no need for the six week trial that was previously due to begin on June 2.
The court will now sentence Tarrant on all 92 charges, but did not provide a date for that sentencing. Tarrant was remanded in custody until May 1. 
Due to a nationwide lockdown in place for the coronavirus outbreak, Thursday's court hearing took place with just 17 people in the courtroom, which included minimal staff, lawyers and some local media. An Iman for each of the two mosques attacked were also allowed to attend the hearing. 
New Zealand announced a nationwide lockdown starting on Thursday, to combat the spread of coronavirus.
The court placed a one-hour embargo on reporting the news in order to inform family members and victims about what had taken place before it was made public.
""The guilty plea today will provide some relief to the many people whose lives were shattered by what happened on March 15,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement.

""These guilty pleas and conviction bring accountability for what happened and also save the families who lost loved ones, those who were injured, and other witnesses, the ordeal of a trial,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The family of Robert Levinson, the former FBI agent who disappeared in March 2007 after traveling to an island controlled by Iran, said on Wednesday it now believes Levinson died in Iranian custody, based on information from U.S. officials.  
President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had not been told that Levinson was dead, but things did not look good and a lot of people thought Levinson had died.
White House national security adviser Robert O'Brien said in a statement later: ""While the investigation is ongoing, we believe that Bob Levinson may have passed away some time ago.""
Levinson's family said in a posting on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and a website: ""Today with aching hearts, we are sharing devastating news about Robert Levinson, the head of our family."" 
""We recently received information from US officials that has led both them and us to conclude that our wonderful husband and father died while in Iranian Custody. We don’t know when or how he died, only that it was prior to the COVID 19 pandemic,” the family said.
The family said they did not know when, or even if, Levinson's body would be returned to them, calling it ""the very definition of cruelty.""
Trump called Levinson ""a gentleman"" and ""outstanding."" He added, in apparent reference to what U.S. officials had told the family: ""They've been making the statement to the family, I believe.""
""It's not looking good; he wasn't well for years anyway, in Iran,"" Trump said. ""It's not looking promising ... we feel terribly for the family.""
""It's not looking great, but I won't accept that he’s dead,"" the president added. ""They haven't told us that he's dead, but a lot of people are thinking that that’s the case.""
O'Brien added in his statement: ""Iran must provide a complete accounting of what occurred with Bob Levinson before the United States can fully accept what happened in this case.""
Levinson disappeared after flying from Dubai to Kish Island in the Gulf in March 2007. There he met with Daoud Salahuddin, an American Islamic militant who fled to Iran while facing charges in the murder of an Iranian embassy official based in Washington.
Levinson, working then as a private investigator, was seeking information on alleged corruption involving former Iranian president Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and his family, said sources familiar with his work.
Months after he disappeared, U.S. government sources acknowledged that before traveling to Kish Island, Levinson had maintained an unorthodox contractual relationship with the analytical branch of the Central Intelligence Agency. A handful of CIA officials were forced out of the agency and several more were disciplined after an internal agency investigation.
The Iranian government has never publicly acknowledged any role in Levinson's abduction, though at the time of his disappearance a government-affiliated media outlet broadcast a story saying he was ""in the hands of Iranian security forces.""

Some U.S. investigators at least until recently believed Levinson was still alive, while officials at other U.S. agencies believe he died some time, perhaps years, ago.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Kosovo lawmakers dismissed the government of Prime Minister Albin Kurti in a no-confidence vote on Wednesday, triggering a political crisis as the Balkan country tries to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
With 82 votes against it in the 120-seat parliament, the Cabinet did not survive the vote initiated by coalition partner the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), less than two months since the government took power.
It remains unclear how the government will continue its work as the country cannot hold snap elections because of the spread of the respiratory disease.
The government was dismissed after a dispute over whether to declare a state of emergency to combat the coronavirus when the LDK filed a motion for a no-confidence vote after Kurti sacked LDK member Agim Veliu as interior minister.
Veliu had supported calls by Kosovo's president for a state of emergency to be declared to combat the coronavirus. Kurti said such a drastic move was not justified. 
""By firing the LDK minister without any consultation, the prime minister broke the governing coalition,"" said Arben Gashi, a member of the LDK.
Kosovo has reported 71 coronavirus cases. One person died after contracting the respiratory disease. 
The removal of the interior minister followed other disagreements, notably on whether a tariff of 100% on goods produced in Balkan rival Serbia should be abolished.
Kosovo introduced the tariff in November 2018, saying it would be abolished once Serbia recognised Kosovo. 
The move halted dialogue on normalising relations between Belgrade and Pristina and angered the European Union and the United States, which backed Kosovo's declaration of independence in 2008 following the wars that tore apart the former Yugoslavia.
Kurti decided to partially remove the tariffs, prompting the United States to halt $50 million in aid. 
Kurti said the reason behind his government's dismissal was to remove an obstacle to allowing Kosovo President Hashim Thaci and his Serbian counterpart, Aleksandar Vucic, to swap territories as part of the final deal between Pristina and Belgrade. 
In 2018, Thaci and Vucic signaled that they might agree to a land swap to resolve territorial claims the two countries have against each other, but both faced strong opposition to the idea domestically and abroad.

“The reason to dismiss my government is to allow the signing of an already reached deal to swap territories between Kosovo and Serbia,” Kurti told MPs before the vote.

419,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",London Zoo seeking donations to safeguard animals,"By Martyn Herman
LONDON (Reuters) - The world's oldest zoo is shut to the public for the first time since World War Two as London locks down because of the coronavirus pandemic, but for the roughly 18,000 animals housed there life, if a little quieter, must go on as normal.
London Zoo, opened to scientists in 1828 and to the public in 1847, is one of the British capital's most-loved attractions, but like everything else in the city it has been impacted by the ongoing crisis, raising concern about the animals' welfare.
Unlike a museum or an art gallery, it is not just a case of locking the doors.
Captive animals are needy, whether big beasts such as lions, gorillas, zebras and giraffes or the Madagascan hissing cockroaches, or everything else in between.
It is a costly, and labor-intensive, business, and without the revenue from daily tickets sales -- worth 27.8 million pounds last year from London Zoo and ZSL's Whipsnade Zoo -- a prolonged shutdown is a nightmare scenario.
Add in the logistical problems posed for the small army of zookeepers, vets, security and ground staff (none classified as key workers) in getting to the Regents Park site, if they have not been forced to self-isolate, and it is unsurprising London Zoo is appealing for donations.
""Ordinarily, we are entirely reliant on public support, so without people coming through the gates the income isn't coming in,"" ZSL's chief operating officer, Kathryn England, told Reuters on Wednesday. ""We are really having to find other ways for people to show their support for us and donate instead.
""What is important is that we have been planning for this, so that we can make sure our staff can keep coming in and putting the health and welfare of our animals first,"" she said. ""Our animals eat a lot and we have to make sure our supply chains continue, with top-quality food. Whether that's fruit and veg from Covent Garden, or meat, we need a continuous supply.""
To ensure they can get to work many of the zoo's 50 daily staff have opted to live in the zoo's Lion Lodges that usually house overnight guests experiencing a ""zoo sleepover"".
""They are not classified as key workers but they are absolutely essential to us,"" England said.
""They are a team of astonishingly dedicated staff,"" she said. ""Some are staying on site to make sure the animals get the care they need. We need to make sure we have all the staff in.""
To safeguard the health of the animals, zookeepers wear protective clothing, such as face masks and gloves.
With no crowds wandering around, some might suggest the animals will be enjoying some rare peace and quiet.
""The big cats don't seem to be bothered at all, like Bhanu our big lion, he's just lounging around in the sun,"" England said. ""But the pigmy goats and penguins are a bit confused, they like social interaction.""
While England is confident the shutdown will not endanger any of the animals, she said the loss of revenue was one of the biggest challengers the zoo has faced.

""The (public's) response has been overwhelming so far, but we are a charity and in a good year we would have 1 million people coming through the gates. We are really missing the crowds and we really want people to support us through out website http://www.zsl.org/zsl-london-zoo.""

The virus outbreak and government restrictions on all gatherings, intended to curb the spread of the virus, have forced many people in France and around the world to innovate, including the Catholic church in Carquefou, in northwest France.
For Wednesday's mass, the only people taking part in the service in person were Le Floc'h, an IT support person whose job was to make sure the live feed did not go down, and three Catholic nuns from a nearby religious community.
""They appreciate being able to connect with their priest and their usual church,"" the 43-year-old priest said of his parishioners viewing online, speaking to Reuters before the mass.
The Annunciation, one of the holiest dates in the Catholic calendar, marks the moment that, according to Catholic tradition, the Angel Gabriel told the Virgin Mary she was expecting a child.
Le Floc'h, in a prayer at the start of Wednesday's mass, made reference to the coronavirus outbreak that has killed some 1,100 people in France to date, with 22,300 people infected.
""We think of all the sick, the carers, and the people who are in isolation,"" said the priest. ""Amen.""
The livestream of the service featured a fixed shot of the church altar, with its 15th century Notre Dame de la Blanche, a wooden statue of the Virgin Mary. The livestream peaked at 175 views, according to YouTube data. 
The live feed was advertised in advance on the parish's Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. Parishioners were given the option of downloading the order of service and the hymn sheet for the mass.
Believers across France, now 9 days into a nationwide lockdown, marked the Annunciation in unfamiliar ways this year. 
The Catholic church hierarchy encouraged believers to place candles in their windows at 19:30 (1830 GMT), the same time church bells rang to mark the holy day.

""This common gesture will mark our coming together in thought and prayer for those who have died, for those who are sick and the people close to them, for the carers and all those who make life in our country possible,"" the church said in a statement.

425,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 03:30PM ET</span>",Lock 'em up or let 'em out? Coronavirus prompts wave of prisoner releases,"By Luke Baker
LONDON (Reuters) - The rapid spread of coronavirus is piling pressure on criminal justice systems globally and has led to a flood of prisoner releases, with the United States, Canada and Germany joining Iran in releasing thousands of detainees.
Germany's most populous state, North-Rhine Westphalia, announced on Wednesday it would release 1,000 prisoners who are close to the end of their sentences, with sex offenders and violent inmates excluded from the list.
The aim is to free up cells so that quarantined areas can be set up for inmates that contract the disease, with many expected to do so given the tight confinement in any prison facility and the ease with which the virus spreads.
In Canada, 1,000 inmates in the state of Ontario were released last week and lawyers are working with prosecutors to free many more from provincial jails by accelerating bail hearings, among other steps.
""The concern is that a jail sentence can potentially become a death sentence for those that are there,"" said Daniel Brown, a Toronto lawyer. 
The U.S. state of New Jersey plans to temporarily release around 1,000 low-risk inmates, and New York City's Board of Corrections, an independent oversight body, has called on the mayor to release around 2,000.
Similar steps are being taken in Britain, Poland and Italy, with authorities set to closely monitor those that are released to ensure it does not lead to a surge in criminal activity or fuel social unrest at a time of national unease. 
But while such measures are possible in many developed countries, and may help stem the spread of a disease that has infected more than 420,000 people and killed nearly 19,000, they pose serious challenges in other parts of the world.
In Iran, where around 190,000 people are incarcerated and the coronavirus has infected 25,000 people, the government has announced it will temporarily release 85,000 prisoners, with 10,000 of them being granted pardons.
Depending on how long the crisis lasts - and Iran is already talking about a second wave of infections - criminal justice experts say it may prove difficult to manage a large number of freed prisoners or reincarcerate them. 
""The longer this goes on and the more desperate the situation becomes, it may lead to bolder decisions that lead to the release of more violent or more dangerous criminals,"" said Keith Ditcham, a senior research fellow in organized crime and policing at Britain's Royal United Services Institute.
""What do you do when things return to normality? You have a number of undesirables either in your country or traveling globally ... It puts the whole law enforcement effort back by a significant margin.""
INSIDE OR OUTSIDE?
In some countries, the fear is that inmates won't be released. In Venezuela, human rights groups are concerned about the spread of COVID-19 among a prison population of 110,000 in conditions that are already highly unsanitary.
In Bogota, Colombia, a prison riot over coronavirus left 23 prisoners dead and scores injured, and similar unrest has struck detention facilities from Italy to Sri Lanka.
Sudan announced it was releasing more than 4,000 prisoners as a precaution against the disease.
In Brazil, some 1,400 prisoners escaped from four facilities last week ahead of a lockdown over coronavirus, with only around 600 recaptured so far, authorities said.
Even those calling for prisoners to be freed in the hope it will prevent deaths have faced problems. In Egypt, four women were detained a week ago after demonstrating for releases. They themselves were released after questioning. 

""What we're seeing is quite a seismic change in how law enforcement goes about its business in the coming months,"" said RUSI's Ditcham. ""The lesser of two evils may be to release all but the most violent and dangerous criminals.""

(Reuters) - On his delivery route through Orange County, California, Joseph Alvarado made 153 stops one day last week for Amazon.com Inc (O:AMZN), touching the inside and outside of his van, more than 225 packages, and dozens of customers’ doors and gates.
In a global coronavirus pandemic that has infected about 420,000 people and killed nearly 19,000, delivery drivers like Alvarado have become as essential as first responders, providing food and other basics for millions of people who are isolating themselves under government stay-home directives. But unlike traditional emergency workers, today’s delivery drivers typically have little or no health insurance, sick pay or job security - and many say they lack even the basics needed to stay safe on the job.
Alvarado said the van he drove wasn’t cleaned before or after his 10-hour shift, nor were the bins holding packages handled by warehouse workers and delivery drivers. Yet his company offered no gloves or masks, and only sporadically provided hand sanitizer. Under pressure to meet targets for delivery speed and volume, Alvarado and other drivers say they have little or no time to stop and wash their hands.
“I’m being exposed,” said Alvarado, 38, who has delivered Amazon packages for three years. “I would think that a company like Amazon that is filthy rich, doing great, not going anywhere anytime soon, would want to take care of its employees.”
Alvarado doesn’t actually work for Amazon. He works instead for Pacific Keys Logistics LLC, one of hundreds of companies that compete for coveted delivery contracts with the world’s largest online retailer. The logistics company could not be reached for comment.
To keep the work, such contractors must meet Amazon’s stringent performance standards under compensation schemes that effectively require the delivery companies to keep a tight rein on costs. Often, delivering Amazon packages constitutes their entire business.
Such arm’s-length employment arrangements have insulated Amazon and other companies from liability and the costs of health insurance and other benefits. The business model - also employed by upstart app-based delivery firms such as Instacart, Shipt Inc and Postmates - has proven popular with investors by allowing the companies to avoid nitty-gritty costs like vehicle repair and crash liabilities.
The coronavirus pandemic has revealed the precarious environment that has been a daily reality for these workers as they now take on much greater risks in delivering essential goods, said David Weil, dean of Brandeis University’s school of social policy and management and a former top Labor Department official in the Obama administration.
“It’s totally laid bare how vulnerable they are,” he said. “We are seeing there are millions of workers, who have no social safety net protections, who are now on the front lines of delivering food and delivering packages.”
Contract drivers who deliver for Amazon in the United States are paid an hourly rate starting at $15, according to the company. In written responses to questions from Reuters, Amazon said it requires its delivery contractors to offer healthcare coverage, but didn’t specify how much of the cost, if any, the firms cover. 
Some drivers say they opt out of the health coverage because they can’t afford the high out-of-pocket costs. Amazon said it required its contractors to offer drivers an unspecified amount of paid time off, but didn’t say whether they were guaranteed sick pay. The company also has a program known as Amazon Flex, where independent contractors sign up for time slots to take groceries or packages to customers' doorsteps in their own cars. 
Amazon said it is taking “extreme measures” to protect all workers, including contracted drivers. Such efforts include “tripling down on deep cleaning, procuring safety supplies that are available, and changing processes to ensure those in our buildings are keeping safe distances.”
Amazon said it is giving its contracted delivery companies hand sanitizer and wipes to allow drivers to clean their vehicles. Asked about drivers’ accounts that such supplies were unavailable, the company said some delivery sites “may on occasion see brief shortages.”
App-based delivery firms have partnered with major retailers such as Walmart Inc (N:WMT),  Kroger Co  (N:KR) and  Target  Corp (N:TGT), which owns Shipt. Instacart and Shipt don’t provide sick pay to drivers but both have said they will offer two weeks of financial assistance for those who test positive for COVID-19 or are placed into quarantine by health authorities.
Reuters interviewed more than a dozen delivery drivers for Amazon, Instacart, Postmates, Uber Eats, a food delivery service from ride-hailing firm  Uber Technologies Inc  (N:UBER), and others, many of whom said they believe the companies did not provide proper protection or support given the risks they are taking. 
The lack of sick pay and supplies can also pose a risk to consumers, especially if drivers show up to work sick or can’t frequently wash their hands, said Suzanne Judd, an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham’s school of public health.
“Touching gates, touching door knobs, those are all going to be potential points of exposure,” she said. “Hand sanitizer itself is not enough.”
Despite the risks, many drivers can’t quit as the economy crashes amid relentless daily reports of rising death totals, business closures and government stay-home directives. As the crisis deepened last week, Amazon announced plans for 100,000 new workers to handle surging demand. But those openings will likely be easily filled with the masses of workers laid off from other hard-hit sectors such as restaurants because Amazon is among the few companies that is hiring. The company has temporarily boosted the pay for warehouse workers and contract drivers by $2 an hour in response to the pandemic, but the raises expire at the end of April.
“It’s very sad because three weeks ago we were in a historically tight labor market,” said Matthew Bidwell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School who focuses on short-term working arrangements. “It was forcing employers for the first time in a long time to offer more perks and more benefits. They no longer have that pressure.""
Danny Gonzalez also delivers for Amazon in Orange County. After long shifts, his hands are blackened with grime from countless surfaces.
“Where do you go wash your hands when you’re in a vehicle?” said Gonzalez, 33, of Anaheim.
Dispatchers enforcing Amazon standards track his movements with GPS technology, sometimes questioning the time taken on stops. Realistically, he said, the targets leave no time for hand-washing. He also skips a lunch break and estimates he runs up to 12 miles a day in sprints from the truck to doorsteps.
“There’s no way you will complete a 280-package route in the eight hours or nine hours they want you to,” he said. “We’re just statistics to Amazon.”
The Amazon contractor that employs him, which he declined to name, offers health insurance that employees can purchase, but Gonzalez said he opted out because the costs would have eaten up nearly half his paycheck. Neither Gonzalez nor Alvarado have paid sick leave.
TREATED ‘LIKE A LEPER’
After the pandemic hit, Amazon announced it would set aside $25 million for contracted delivery drivers to apply for up to two weeks paid leave if they are diagnosed with COVID-19 or placed into quarantine by the government or Amazon. Other companies such as Uber, Postmates, Instacart and DoorDash have made similar pledges to help workers.
But the criteria make getting that paid time difficult, drivers said. Jonathan Perales, 25, a driver for Uber and Postmates in Texas, started coughing and feeling feverish earlier this month after picking up an ill passenger. The hospital he visited said he had symptoms of COVID-19, but declined to test him amid a national shortage of kits.
When he sought sick pay from Uber, the company told him he needed a positive coronavirus test or documentation from a medical professional ordering him to self-quarantine. No one at the hospital or the state health department was willing to submit such documentation to Uber on his behalf - which he said the company required - and another clinic refused to examine him when he showed up reporting coronavirus symptoms.
“I was stuck in an impossible situation,” Perales said. “I was trying to get tested, and I was trying to seek financial aid. I was being treated like a leper.”
Despite the illness, he needed the income to avoid an eviction, so he continued to work for Postmates for another two days. Uber shut down his account after he reported the symptoms, he said, which left him unable to pay his bill at the extended-stay motel where he had been living. He now lives in his car. Uber declined to comment on Perales’ case but said in a statement that drivers’ safety is “always our priority.” Postmates declined to comment. 
DRIVING 45 MILES FOR HAND SANITIZER
Ron Spigelman delivers for Instacart. The company hasn’t provided training or offered sanitation supplies or protective gear to wear in crowded stores, he said. He recently drove 45 miles to find hand sanitizer at a Dollar General (NYSE:DG) in the countryside near Tulsa, Oklahoma.
He thinks drivers should have access to hand-washing stations. “That way we feel more protected,” he said, “and I think the customers would feel more protected as well.”
In a statement, Instacart said it would soon distribute hand sanitizer and provide access to cleaning supplies in some stores. The company plans to add an additional 300,000 independent delivery contractors to handle skyrocketing demand.
Some drivers have stopped delivering as the crisis worsened. Laura Chelton, 48, drives for Amazon Flex in the Seattle area - site of the first outbreak in the United States. Last week, she noticed that no one was wiping down surfaces in the area at Whole Foods where she picked up orders. 

When she saw an older woman cough last week as she assembled grocery bags in that confined space - just eight by 10 feet - she decided that delivering groceries just wasn’t worth the risk.

428,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 01:15PM ET</span>","Costa Rica to transfer 2,600 U.S.-bound migrants from Panama to Nicaragua border","By Alvaro Murillo
SAN JOSE (Reuters) - Costa Rica's government has begun transferring about 2,600 migrants bound for the United States from its southern border with Panama to its frontier with Nicaragua, citing concerns that large crowds may speed up the spread of coronavirus.
Costa Rica has reported 177 confirmed coronavirus cases with two deaths so far and has taken stringent measures to curb the spread of the virus.
The first group of U.S.-bound migrants, hailing from Asia, Africa and Haiti, were transported on buses toward the Nicaragua border late on Tuesday night on orders of Costa Rica's immigration ministry, officials said. 
""In 2016, (Costa Rica's) southern border was severely affected by the massive influx of African and Haitian migrants. In the face of the coronavirus emergency, we cannot afford to repeat that situation,"" said Raquel Vargas, Costa Rica's director of immigration.
Most other Central American nations have closed their borders to prevent the spread of coronavirus, and over the past year Mexico has forbidden large groups of U.S.-bound migrants to enter the country in a bid to appease the United States.
The migrant transfers will continue through this week, Costa Rica's immigration ministry said. It was not clear if Nicaragua, whose borders remain open, would accept the migrants. 
Nicaragua's government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Health checks were performed on migrants prior to transporting them, and at present none of them are showing coronavirus symptoms, Vargas added.
In recent years, migrants who are not from Latin America have entered Costa Rica from Panama in a controlled and coordinated manner following a migration agreement signed between the two countries four years ago.
Since the coronavirus outbreak began, Costa Rica has beefed up surveillance at its border with Nicaragua.

429,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 12:46PM ET</span>","As virus explodes, world races to mask up","By Michael Shields, Carl O'Donnell, Roxanne Liu and Anthony Deutsch
ZURICH (Reuters) - Spiez Lab, a government-run institute in the Swiss mountains, was set up to protect the nation from nuclear, biological and chemical threats. ""For a world without weapons of mass destruction,"" runs its slogan.
It is now fighting another global menace - the coronavirus - by providing face masks, the demand for which is growing faster than the disease they're meant to fend off. Hospitals treating COVID-19, the pandemic caused by the virus, can need up to nine times the protective equipment they do when dealing with normal flu, according to the American Hospital Association. 
The Swiss lab acquires masks that are past their expiry dates, then tests them to see if they still work. ""If yes, they're being distributed to the health care system via military pharmacies,"" said spokesman Andreas Bucher.
So far, he said, Spiez Lab has distributed 10.2 million masks. That's a lot for an institute better known for its expertise on deadly nerve agents. But globally, it's a drop in an ocean of need. In Switzerland, whose population of 8.2 million is about the size of New York City, it would amount to less than 10 days' supply, based on estimates by the Swiss government.
Across the world, frontline medical staff are clamouring for face masks and other personal protective equipment (PPE). Even as China, the world's main supplier, comes back onstream, companies around the globe are battling a host of obstacles, from illness to freight costs, from hoarding to a supply squeeze on filter fabric.
In the United States, the new epicenter of the pandemic, shortages are so acute that health workers have taken to social media to appeal for help under the hashtag #GetMePPE. 
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said that over the next 18 months it aims to buy 500 million masks for the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation's supply of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is distributing masks, but it's ""not easy"" 
for the federal government to help states obtain the equipment, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday.
Frontline medical staff in many countries say shortages of masks and other equipment have left them vulnerable to catching the virus - which forces them into isolation and reduces staff numbers. Madrid's doctors' union has filed a lawsuit to try to force the regional health authority to deliver scrubs, masks and goggles to hospitals and other health centers. A spokesman for the authority declined to comment. 
Medical staff in the Netherlands blame the lack of masks for the high rates of coronavirus infection among them - the health ministry disputes that but acknowledges the shortage. Almost a quarter of the 2,994 people infected as of March 20 worked in health care, according to the last available data from the National Institute for Health.
Switzerland alone, a country of 8.6 million, needs 1.2 million masks a day, said Daniel Koch, head of the Swiss Federal Office of Health's communicable diseases division.
There are two main kinds of mask: The surgical masks worn routinely on many Asian streets, which can provide some protection; and the higher-standard respirators, often known by designations such as N95 or FFP (""filtering facepiece""), which are meant for medical procedures to protect workers from the droplets through which the virus spreads.
Demand for all of them has skyrocketed. 
U.S. hospitals are rapidly running down their supplies despite efforts to procure more masks from private and government sources, healthcare executives and industry spokespeople say.
Major providers of medical masks - including 3M (NYSE:MMM) Co., Owens & Minor Inc,  Cardinal Health  Inc (NYSE:CAH), and Medline Industries Inc. - say they are working multiple shifts a day and producing as much as four times their typical output, said David Gillan, a senior vice president at Vizient Inc, which helps healthcare providers manage their supply chains.
But many hospitals say they only have enough masks for several days, Gillan said.
PRADA AND PORSCHES
As unused masks age, the materials they are made of degrade so they offer decreasing protection: Spiez Lab identifies those that are still safe. Other institutions and companies across the world have also retooled their operations to produce face masks. The effort resembles the Allied munitions drives of World War Two.
Masks are being made in Germany by Zettl Automotive, a car supplier that usually makes seat covers for BMWs and Porsches; in Italy and Spain, by Prada and other fashion companies; and in the Czech republic, by a producer of boxer shorts and panties called Styx.
""We have completely switched production from underwear to masks,"" said its executive director Ruslan Skopal.
Such surgical masks, while they may help meet consumer demand, are not always helpful in hospitals. ""Everything we use in hospitals must be regulated,"" said Benito Almirante, head of infectious diseases at the Vall D'Hebron hospital in Barcelona. 
""The masks made in all these altruistic projects cannot be used in hospitals because they are not regulated. ... It's better these kinds of masks are used for going to the supermarket, leaving the regulation material for health workers.""
The real boost to global supply of such masks will come from China, the world's largest mask manufacturer which makes about half global production. It is now emerging from its own epidemic and ramping up production for both the domestic and international market.
By Feb. 29, the country was producing 116 million masks a day, China's state media CCTV reported on March 2, citing data obtained from National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). The NDRC told companies that it would buy and store any surplus output after the outbreak.
Even the China National Petroleum Corporation has joined the effort to produce face masks. It expects to be able to make 1.5 million a day by the end of March, Xinhua reported on Wednesday.
In February, at the peak of China's outbreak, the entire output of Shenzhen-based Allmed Medical Products's N95 masks was bought by the government.
Since resuming commercial export orders last week, Allmed has been flooded with overseas requests, but has only signed deals from North American and only with clients the company is familiar with or which are backed by governments, said a company representative.
Its factories in Hubei province, the epicenter of the virus, can produce up to 250,000 N95-standard masks a day, which is ""much higher"" than the pre-outbreak capacity, said the representative.
SMUGGLING AND BOTTLENECKS
Other problems remain. In some countries, manufacturing and distribution has been hampered by supply chain problems, a precipitous drop in available air freight, and export restrictions by governments desperate to hang on to dwindling supplies.
Other countries including India, South Korea, Taiwan, France and Germany have restricted or temporarily banned exports of medical equipment. Turkish authorities carried out simultaneous raids on the depots of face mask producers earlier this week to demand they sign contracts with the Health Ministry and stop hoarding stock, local media reported.
In Ukraine, which has banned mask exports, border guards last week arrested a man in a wetsuit who they said was trying to smuggle masks across a river into Romania. They have also seized thousands of masks at border checkpoints.
Some governments and multinational companies are donating shipments of masks to countries in need. But industrial mask-makers also face a bottleneck of a key component: Melt-blown polypropylene, the non-woven polymer fabric that forms the filter in most masks, which is made by smaller companies with limited capacity.
""Trying to find a supplier who hasn't sold out for the next six months is hard,"" said Christopher Dobbing, the CEO and founder of Cambridge Mask Co., a small producer in Britain. 
Prices were up to 15 times higher than when the pandemic began, said Dobbing.
Demand for his firm's masks had increased twelvefold, he added, ""and that is for people willing to buy a mask now for delivery in 8 to 10 weeks time.""
RE-USING MASKS
In one sign of the strain many countries face, the Dutch minister for medical care, Bruno Bruins, collapsed from exhaustion last week during questioning in parliament about face masks, and resigned the next day.
In the Netherlands as elsewhere, acute shortages have forced medical staff to use one mask with multiple patients or to buy masks usually used for construction work.
""Everyone just took matters into their own hands,"" said a doctor in the capital, Amsterdam, who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the issue.
In a statement to Reuters, a spokesman for the Dutch Health Ministry said it was ""working around the clock"" to address the shortage, which he blamed on the surge in demand.
The country's National Institute of Health, which sets the guidelines for safety gear, has asked doctors to keep used masks for re-use after cleaning.

430,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 12:36PM ET</span>","German cathedral dusts off relics of St Corona, patron of epidemics","AACHEN, Germany (Reuters) - Germany's Aachen Cathedral has dug out the relics of little-known Saint Corona, patron saint of resisting epidemics, from its treasure chamber and is polishing up her elaborate shrine to go on show once the coronavirus pandemic has passed.
The pandemic, confirmed to have infected nearly half a million people worldwide, including more than 30,000 in Germany, has boosted public interest in the Christian martyr, believed to have been killed by the Romans around 1,800 years ago.
The cathedral had planned even before the coronavirus outbreak to display St Corona's shrine this summer as part of an exhibition on gold craftsmanship. It is not clear when people will now be able to view the shrine due to tough restrictions on gatherings imposed to help combat the spread of the virus.
But experts are painstakingly cleaning the gold, bronze and ivory shrine, which has been hidden from public view for the last 25 years, in preparation for when it can go on display.
""We have brought the shrine out a bit earlier than planned and now we expect more interest due to the virus,"" said Aachen Cathedral spokeswoman Daniela Loevenich.
Corona is believed to have been only about 16 years old when the Romans killed her, probably in Syria, for professing the Christian faith.
The girl suffered a particularly excruciating death, according to legend. She was tied to two bent palm trees and then torn apart as the trunks were released.
""That is a very gruesome story and led to her becoming the patron of lumberjacks,"" said Brigitte Falk, head of Aachen Cathedral Treasure Chamber, adding that it was pure chance that she also became a patron saint for resisting epidemics. 
Corona's relics, brought to Aachen by King Otto III in 997, were kept in a tomb underneath a slab in the cathedral - which can still be seen - until 1911-12 when they were placed in the shrine, which is 93 centimetres tall and weighs 98 kilograms.
The Roman Catholic cathedral at Aachen, built by Emperor Charlemagne in the ninth century, is one of Europe's oldest. Charlemagne was buried there in 814 and it was used for the coronation of German kings and queens.  
While the cathedral stresses that Corona is patron saint of resisting all epidemics, not just this specific virus, the virus is so called because under a microscope, it looks like a globe with little globules, resembling a crown, said Falk. In Latin corona means crown or garland.

""Like many other saints, Saint Corona may be a source of hope in these difficult times,"" said Falk.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Five years ago the arrival of a wave of refugees caused much consternation and fueled support for Germany's far-right. Now, the country is turning to its migrant community to plug an anticipated shortage of medical staff battling the coronavirus.
The German government says it can double its number of intensive care beds, and even produce more ventilators but a medical staffing crunch is shaping up as the Achilles heel of its strategy to fight the coronavirus.
In Saxony, the heartland of the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD), the regional medical board is advertising for migrant doctors to help tackle an expected rise in cases.
""Foreign doctors who are in Saxony but do not yet have a license to practice medicine can help with corona(virus) care,"" read a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) appeal. https://www.facebook.com/185347338173082/posts/3576654775708971/?substory_index=0
The push to tap migrant medics in Saxony comes despite the AfD enjoying a surge in support in a regional election there last year, harnessing voter anger over refugees to come second behind Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives.
Merkel's 2015 decision to open Germany's borders to some 1 million migrants fleeing war in the Middle East - the defining moment of her chancellorship - was widely criticized by the AfD and even many of her own conservatives. 
A new film, 'Merkel - Anatomy of a Crisis', also takes a critical look at her handling of the refugee influx.
But the coronavirus epidemic means medics of all backgrounds are in demand.
Saxony's regional medical board reported on Monday that 300 volunteers had responded to its appeal for help, including ""many foreign doctors whose licensing procedures are not yet completed, whose help is very welcome.""
As of Tuesday, there were 31,554 cases of coronavirus in Germany, with 149 deaths, the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases said. The government says Germany is still at the beginning of the epidemic.
Shadi Shahda, 29, is one migrant medic ready to help.
He came to Germany last April on a visa for highly-qualified job seekers and with three years' experience as an ENT (ear, nose, throat) medical resident in Syria. But a language exam he needed to take this month to work as a doctor in Saxony was canceled due to the coronavirus. 

He jumped at the medical board's Facebook post and says: ""I am waiting for their call ... I was very happy when I saw that I could do something in the country where I am living.""

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The speaker of Israel's parliament, an ally of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, resigned on Wednesday, sharpening a battle with the Supreme Court over its concerns that democracy could be a casualty of the coronavirus crisis.
Yuli Edelstein's resignation removes a potential obstacle to plans by the opposition to enact a law that would bar Netanyahu, as an indicted suspect in three corruption cases, from forming a new government after Israel's March 2 election.
Edelstein, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, announced he was quitting in a speech to parliament, accusing the court of ""gross and arrogant meddling"" in legislative affairs by ordering him to schedule a vote for the speaker's position at Wednesday's Knesset session..
Likud rallied behind Edelstein even as parliament's legal adviser formally informed him he was violating the ruling, despite his resignation - noting it goes into effect only in 48 hours.
""We salute you, Yuli,"" Likud said on its Twitter feed.
Facing possible punitive measures, Edelstein said in a statement: ""I have no desire to be in contempt of court but my conscience does not allow me to respect the court's order.""
With Netanyahu's opponents, led by Benny Gantz's centrist Blue and White party, holding a slim majority in parliament after the national election, Edelstein was likely to have lost his post if a vote in the legislature had gone ahead.
Netanyahu, who has denied accusations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust, made no comment on the loss of an ally who could have run interference against legislation by Blue and White aimed at ending an 11-year tenure weakened by three inconclusive elections in less than a year.
Edelstein, a jailed dissident in the former Soviet Union, had cited the coronavirus crisis and pursuit of the Netanyahu's call for a ""national emergency government"" with Gantz for postponing a vote for the speaker's post. 
In a ruling on Monday, Chief Justice Esther Hayut said Edelstein's reasoning ""undercuts the foundations of the democratic process"".
After announcing he was stepping down, Edelstein adjourned parliament until Monday. Blue and White and a civil liberties group, the Movement for Quality Government in Israel, petitioned the court to hold him in contempt.
Netanyahu currently heads a caretaker government. His critics accused him of autocracy after he invoked a series of emergency regulations during the coronavirus crisis. The measures led to a two-month delay in the start of his trial.
Israel's longest-serving leader, Netanyahu, 70, has said he is committed to preserving democracy.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban said on Wednesday a release of prisoners by the Afghan government would begin by the end of March, and a senior Afghan government official confirmed the process would start ""within a week"".
The development could remove a key factor in the deadlock holding up negotiations between the Islamist militant group and the Afghan government under a U.S.-brokered peace process.
""The meeting decided that the release of the prisoners will practically start by the end of March,"" Suhail Shaheen, a Taliban spokesman, said on Twitter, referring to a virtual meeting that included Taliban and Afghan government officials.
Also at the gathering were American and Qatari officials and members of the International Red Cross, Shaheen said, adding that the Taliban would send a team to the Bagram detention center where many of its prisoners were held. 
The two sides have differed on prisoner releases with the Afghan government seeking a phased and conditional release and the Taliban wanting all prisoners freed in one go as envisaged in a deal signed with the United States in Doha last month.
It was not immediately clear how many prisoners would be released. The Taliban have demanded 5,000 as a precondition to talks, but Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said the government would release 1,500 initially.
The impasse threatened to derail a carefully negotiated peace process outlined in the agreement, including a pullout of foreign forces from Afghanistan after over 18 years of fighting.
The two sides have been speaking in recent days over Skype, officials have said, as the coronavirus pandemic has curbed international travel.
The decision on prisoners came just days after U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo flew to Kabul and Doha to try to salvage the peace process set in motion by February's troop withdrawal agreement.

The deal was supposed to lead to negotiations between the Taliban and the Afghan government for a peace arrangement. Bit has suffered setbacks due to the prisoner disagreement and a political feud between rival Afghan politicians that has held up the appointment of a negotiation team.

LONDON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, who is fighting extradition from Britain to the United States, was denied bail on Wednesday after his lawyers said he should be released because he was highly vulnerable to the coronavirus.
The 48-year-old, who is at Belmarsh Prison in London, is wanted by the United States on 18 criminal counts of conspiring to hack government computers and violating an espionage law. He says he could spend decades in prison if convicted.
His lawyer, Edward Fitzgerald, told Westminster Magistrates Court that Assange had suffered from four respiratory tract infections during the years he spent living in the Ecuadorean embassy in London. Fitzgerald also said Assange had heart problems which put him at increased risk.
""The emphasis is not on flight but survival,"" Fitzgerald said, adding that there was no serious risk of Assange absconding. He said that if Assange fell ill with the virus in prison, ""the risk could be fatal"".
But Judge Vanessa Baraitser rejected the arguments, noting that Assange himself was on record saying that he would rather commit suicide than face extradition to the United States.
“As matters stand today, this global pandemic does not as of itself provide grounds for Mr Assange’s release,"" she said.
Assange's past conduct showed how far he was prepared to go to avoid extradition proceedings, she added, and there were substantial grounds to believe that if released he would abscond again.
PARTNER AND CHILDREN
She was referring to the fact that Assange skipped bail and fled to the Ecuadorean embassy in 2012 to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he was wanted at the time to answer questions on alleged sex crimes. The allegations have since been dropped.
Assange remained holed up in the embassy for seven years. He was eventually dragged out after Ecuador revoked his asylum.
Fitzgerald told the court that Assange had a partner who had lived in Britain for more than 20 years and that if he were granted bail he would live with her. He added that the couple had children, though he did not give their ages.
WikiLeaks enraged the U.S. government a decade ago by publishing thousands of secret U.S. documents. Assange's supporters see him as a champion of free speech exposing abuses of power and hypocrisy by Washington. 
The U.S. authorities counter that he is not wanted because he embarrassed them but rather because he endangered informants, dissidents and rights activists in countries including Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan.
Fitzgerald said that with Belmarsh on lockdown, it was impossible for lawyers to speak to Assange to prepare his case for the second part of the extradition hearing, due to resume on May 18.
But Clair Dobbin, a lawyer representing the U.S. authorities, argued that the risk that Assange would once again abscond to avoid extradition was so high that it was insurmountable.
""Mr Assange judges himself above the law,"" Dobbin said. ""He has already demonstrated he is capable of going to any lengths to avoid that possibility (extradition to the United States)."" 
She also said the evidence suggested that the virus would not be critical for most patients. ""He is not one of the people to whom the virus presents a particular risk,"" she said of Assange.

With Britain under near lockdown because of the coronavirus outbreak, the hearing unfolded in unusual circumstances. Only the judge, Fitzgerald and a small number of reporters were present in person. Other lawyers listened in on a tele-conference call.

PARIS (Reuters) - A Parisian neighborhood has been left stuck in a World War Two time-warp after the makers of a 1940s-era film had to abandon their set before France went into a coronavirus lockdown.
War propaganda and Socialist posters are plastered on walls along the cobbled Rue Androuet, in the Montmartre district, now lined by a mock jeweler's store, tailor and off-license all in war-time decor. German road signs point toward medical facilities. 
""Just in case quarantined Paris wasn't disorienting enough: my neighborhood was being used as a film set when the lockdown hit. Now the whole block has been frozen in 1941,"" local resident Tim Mc Inerney wrote on Twitter.
Paris was a virtual ghost town on Wednesday, on the ninth day of an unprecedented peacetime lockdown ordered by President Emmanuel Macron to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Macron gave France's 67 million people just 16 hours notice, leaving the makers of the Adieu Monsieur Haffmann film no time to dismantle their set and return the street to the 21st century.
Directed by French filmmaker Fred Cavaye, the movie is an adaptation of the play of the same name, which tells the story of Joseph Haffmann, a Jewish jeweler forced into hiding to escape the Nazis.
Two neighboring streets, Rue Berthe and Rue des Trois Freres, had also been dressed by film-makers to look like a scene from wartime Paris. A police patrol enforcing the lockdown stopped to take photographs.
Paris fell under German occupation in mid 1940. The French government relocated to Vichy and the capital was governed by Hitler's military. During the occupation, a curfew was imposed, food was rationed, and coal for heating was in short supply. 
Jews in Paris were forced to wear the yellow Star of David badge. Thousands were rounded up by French police on German orders and sent to German concentration camps.

Cavaye could not immediately be reached for comment.

Workers wearing face masks and gloves swept and sprayed the walkways around the bases of the pyramids, as well as the ticket office and a visitor center - though the giant stone structures were not themselves cleaned.
All Egypt's famed archaeological sites and museums from the Egyptian museum in Cairo to the Valley of the Kings in Luxor have been shut since Monday as authorities try to prevent coronavirus from spreading. 
With passenger flights suspended -- except for those repatriating the last remaining tourists -- officials have been sterilizing hotels and tourist sites up and down the country.
""We started the first phase of disinfection, and there are other phases. We are in the process of disinfecting all tourist sites, though the artefacts themselves require specific materials and (cleaning) must be carried out by a specialised team of excavators,"" said Ashraf Mohie El-Din, director general of the pyramids area. 
""We are making use of this period to sanitize the entire area, but also to carry out some maintenance work and renovation to have this area ready to accept visitors again,"" he added. 
Egypt has so far reported more than 400 cases of coronavirus, including 21 deaths.

Most early cases were linked to a cruise ship on the Nile from which both foreign passengers and local crew tested positive, dealing a blow to the country's crucial tourism sector.

439,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 10:35AM ET</span>",Irish PM says new government can be formed in next two weeks,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - Acting Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Wednesday it would be possible to form a new government in the next two weeks, returning the focus to negotiations that have been sidelined by the outbreak of coronavirus.
Varadkar's Fine Gael agreed two weeks ago to step up talks with rivals Fianna Fail following the Feb. 8 election, but emergency measures to fight the health and economic crisis have taken precedence as confirmed coronavirus cases rose to 1,329.
Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have 37 and 35 seats respectively in the 160-seat parliament, which is sitting only intermittently, meaning they need the support of at least one smaller party or group of independent lawmakers to reach a majority.
""I do think it is possible to form a government in the next couple of weeks,"" Varadkar told a news conference on Wednesday.
""We're not there yet. We continue to negotiate with Fianna Fail. There are discussions happening today. We'd hope to get to the point where we can then approach other parties to see whether they are willing to form part of that new government.""
Ireland's fractured parliament passed a series of emergency measures last week and will do so again on Thursday. But Varadkar said there was concern about the ability to pass laws after next week once elections to the upper house are completed.
Ireland's upper house of parliament cannot be fully constituted until an additional selection of members are picked by a new prime minister.
For a new government to last a full term, Varadkar said, it would need a stable working majority of 82 to 85, which means having at least 10 more lawmakers willing to come on board.
Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, historic rivals on the center-right who have never formed a coalition together, both refuse to govern with the left-wing, pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein party, which surged to 37 seats in last month's election.

The Green Party, which has 12 seats, has been courted by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, but it is calling for a temporary national government encompassing the whole parliament while the coronavirus crisis continues.

This has become a daily ritual in eastern France as intensive care units there have been unable to cope with the numbers of critically-ill cases and have instead been transferring patients to nearby Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg.
As one patient on Tuesday was loaded onto a red-and-yellow helicopter of the French Civil Security agency, a helicopter crewman watched over, dressed in blue surgical scrubs, topped with an orange aviation helmet.
The area in eastern France around the city of Strasbourg has seen one of the biggest coronavirus clusters in France. Local doctors have warned that the healthcare system is at breaking point.
The so-called air bridge to fly coronavirus patients out of eastern France began at the weekend and has so far involved around 10 helicopters from France, Germany and Luxembourg.
One flight delivered a patient from a clinic in France's eastern Alsace region to a military hospital in Ulm, southern Germany. ""If everything goes well he will survive,"" said German Army colonel and doctor Matthias Helm.
Another flight brought a 64-year-old patient from Colmar in France's eastern Alsace region to Germany's Mannheim hospital.
""Our French colleagues are currently under excessive strain"", said Mannheim senior intensive care doctor Thomas Kirschning.
""Currently we have the advantage that we still have capacity and can prepare ourselves for a potential wave of cases. ""
France reported a cumulative 1,100 coronavirus deaths on Tuesday with 22,300 infected people.

The epidemic in eastern France led the French army to set up a field hospital with 30 intensive care beds. The field hospital admitted its first patient on Tuesday.

More than half of the travelers stuck at the airport, usually one of the world's busiest international hubs, were Algerian citizens, with others from Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Azerbaijan, a spokesperson for airport operator IGA said.
Turkey has halted flights to some 70 countries in an attempt to stem the spread of the coronavirus, which has infected more than 375,000 people worldwide and killed more than 16,000, according to data from World Health Organisation.
""There are around 1,500 Algerians people stranded at Istanbul Airport right now,"" the spokesperson said, adding that Algerian authorities were not accepting their return for now. 
Algeria's state carrier Air Algerie said on Monday that all passenger flights were suspended. A source at the airline said no final decision had been made on repatriation. ""It is up to the government to make a decision,"" the source said.
Video footage posted on social media this week appeared to show scuffles between police and passengers wearing medical masks at an Istanbul Airport terminal building.
The airport operator, along with Turkish Airlines and Turkish Red Crescent are providing meals and essentials for the people stuck at the airport, IGA said in a statement.

The Norwegian, who has Iranian heritage, was arrested in October 2018 over a suspected plot to kill an Iranian Arab opposition figure in Denmark.
In a statement, the state prosecutor said the man had now been charged with collecting and passing on information to an Iranian intelligence service for use in carrying out an assassination in Denmark. It said the suspect was also charged with attempted manslaughter.
The 40-year old Norwegian citizen has pleaded not guilty to all charges, his lawyer told Reuters. The trial is scheduled to begin in a Roskilde court on May 1. 
The alleged attempt to eliminate a leading member of the opposition Arab Struggle Movement for the Liberation of Ahvaz (ASMLA) was prevented after a major police operation in Denmark in September 2018 during which borders were temporarily closed.
In February, Danish police said they had arrested three leading members of ASMLA on suspicion of spying for Saudi Arabia. One of the arrested had been a target for assassination in September 2018, they said.
Iran's Shi'ite Muslim government has denied any connection with the alleged plot. Ahvaz is the main city in Khuzestan, a Sunni Muslim Arab-majority province in southwestern Iran.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Anton Scherbyna has been living in the security zone of a Moscow airport for nearly a week since returning from a honeymoon with his Russian wife only to fall foul of Russia's new ban on foreigners entering due to the coronavirus emergency.
The Ukrainian national, who works in Moscow as a teacher, now sleeps on a row of seats, eats airline food and uses Vnukovo airport's lavatory facilities to wash and stay clean. 
""The conditions are probably better than in a Russian prison, but worse than normal living conditions,"" Scherbyna, 31, told Reuters via Skype from the security zone.
Scherbyna is one of dozens of foreign nationals stranded at Moscow's airports after Russian authorities barred foreigners from entering until May 1 in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
Russia has so far reported 658 confirmed coronavirus cases and canceled many flights to and from the country. One person who tested positive for coronavirus has died. 
Sporting a goatee beard and a blue sweater, Scherbyna could fly back to his native Ukraine via Minsk or Istanbul, but said the remaining tickets were exorbitantly-priced and that it made no sense for him to fly there because he lives in Moscow.
With their honeymoon in Montenegro now a fast-fading memory, Scherbyna's wife has gone back to their Moscow home but is not allowed to visit him in the airport's security zone.
""I've started to think about ways to make money remotely,"" Scherbyna said. ""If I have to stay here longer, I will have to do this because we will be in a difficult financial situation like many others here.""
Scherbyna said airport employees had distributed blankets to those stranded but that little else was being done to resolve the situation. 
""If this is all being done against the virus, then you have a chance of catching it here in conditions in which there are lots of people flying out and new people finding themselves in my situation everyday.""
Several hundred citizens of Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have in recent days also been stranded at Moscow's four airports after their flights were canceled, but many managed to fly out later on charter flights.

Vnukovo Airport told Reuters it would not comment on the presence of passengers in its security zone, referring questions to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Foreign Ministry.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Daily life in Singapore has been broadly unhindered while authorities on the wealthy Southeast Asian island waged their widely praised campaign to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
But the buzz and bustle of the city state, as portrayed in recent Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) series 'Singapore Social', is finally quieting.
From Thursday, all bars and entertainment venues will close in an effort to contain a sharp rise to over 500 cases in recent days, while restaurants will stay open but with strict social distancing rules to keep customers apart.
""This is a challenge for everybody,"" Azrol Ishak, a manager at bar-restaurant Brewerkz said as some customers separated by cordoned off tables sipped drinks on a veranda overlooking the Singapore River. 
""Some of the restaurants are already (having) a very poor turnout and already closed down. We are still surviving...and try to sustain for another few months.""
Singapore was one of the hardest hit countries when the virus first spread from China earlier in the year, but strict contact tracing and quarantine measures appeared to have stemmed the contagion until outbreaks in Europe and the United States led to a second wave of imported cases and more domestic transmission.
Some countries like Italy and Britain have gone into complete lockdown, forcing people to stay home to slow the spread of a virus that has killed over 18,000 people globally.
The World Health Organisation's top emergency expert on Friday held up Singapore as an example why social distancing was not necessary if other containment measures are imposed.
""It never closed its schools, it didn't shut down its public health system, it didn't do lockdowns,"" Mike Ryan said. Offices and schools, with the exception of a few international schools, remain open in Singapore, but public gatherings of more than 10 people are prohibited under new rules imposed this week.
At chic French restaurant Merci Marcel in the Orchard Road shopping district, customers had their temperature taken and filled in travel declaration forms before dining at those tables not marked off with bright yellow tape.
Operations manager Nicolas Guidi said he has lost about 40% of covers due to regulations imposed in recent days preventing guests from sitting too close to each other.
""It's kind of a bit scary when you come into the restaurant. You come for the experience and you see all this yellow tape everywhere..but they (customers) are happy to comply,"" said Guidi.

""We have the chance as well to be in Singapore, where people have social responsibility.""

448,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 25, 2020 06:40AM ET</span>",Istanbul prosecutor indicts Saudi suspects for Khashoggi killing,"By Ezgi Erkoyun
ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Istanbul prosecutors said on Wednesday they had prepared an indictment against a close aide to Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and a former deputy head of general intelligence over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.
The prosecutor's office accused the two men of instigating Khashoggi's murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul and named 18 suspects it said actually carried out the killing, which caused a global uproar.
Khashoggi was last seen entering the consulate on Oct. 2, 2018, where he had gone to obtain documents for his impending wedding. Turkish officials said his body was dismembered and removed from the building, but his remains have not been found.
Some Western governments, as well as the CIA, said they believed Prince Mohammed had ordered the killing - an accusation Saudi officials have denied.
The indictment accuses former deputy head of Saudi Arabia's general intelligence Ahmed al-Asiri and former royal court adviser Saud al-Qahtani of having ""instigated premeditated murder with monstrous intent"", the prosecutor's office said.
It says the others suffocated Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post who had grown increasingly critical of Prince Mohammed's actions, after agreeing in advance that he should be killed if he did not return to Saudi Arabia with them.
The list of 18 suspected killers includes a 15-strong team which flew to Turkey to carry out the operation, and three intelligence officials.
Saudi Arabia's media ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SUSPECTS STILL FREE
Both Qahtani and Asiri were dismissed from their positions after Khashoggi's killing. Asiri was subsequently tried in Saudi Arabia but released due to insufficient evidence, a Saudi prosecutor said. Qahtani was investigated but was not charged. Sources have said he remained active in state matters. 
In December a Saudi court sentenced five people to death and three to jail for Khashoggi's killing in a trial which a U.N. rapporteur described as a mockery of justice because it did not target those she described as the masterminds of the operation.
The court did not identify those sentenced to death.
Wednesday's indictment was based on analysis of suspects' phone records, their entry and exit into Turkey and presence at the consulate, witness statements and analysis of Khashoggi's phone and computers, the prosecutor's office said. 
Khashoggi's killing, which Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan said was ordered at the ""highest levels"" of the Saudi government, has strained ties between Ankara and Riyadh.
Turkey accused Saudi officials of obstructing investigations at the consulate, while the Saudis have repeatedly said the Istanbul prosecutor has not complied with their requests to share information. 
Prince Mohammed has denied ordering the killing but said he bore ultimate responsibility as the kingdom’s de facto leader. Saudi Arabia initially denied any involvement in or knowledge of Khashoggi’s death but later changed its position multiple times.

Residents of the Libyan capital, seat of the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA), said the shelling was the worst in weeks, shaking doors and windows in the city center several miles from the front line in the southern suburbs. 
The Libyan National Army (LNA) of eastern commander Khalifa Haftar has been trying to capture Tripoli for almost a year, backed by the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Russia. The GNA is supported by Turkey and allied Syrian fighters. 
Pro-GNA forces launched an assault against LNA forces at the al-Watiya airbase, 125km (80 miles) west of Tripoli and the site of intense fighting at earlier stages of the conflict, both sides said on Wednesday. 
The pro-GNA forces said their operation was in response to the shelling of Tripoli and resulted in the capture of LNA fighters. A military source in the LNA said its air force had targeted pro-GNA forces trying to capture the base.
""Violent clashes are shaking al-Watiya airbase now,"" the LNA military source said. 
An escalation in the fighting could spell disaster for Libya's already fragmented and badly stretched health system in handling the coronavirus, after authorities confirmed the first case of the disease late on Tuesday. 
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres had called for a complete ceasefire in conflicts around the world as governments and local authorities struggle with a pandemic that has spread to most countries.

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Disposable rubber gloves are indispensable in the global fight against the new coronavirus, yet a month's lockdown in stricken Malaysia where three of every five gloves are made has upended the supply chain and threatens to hamstring hospitals worldwide.
The world's biggest maker of medical gloves by volume, Top Glove Corp Bhd, has the capacity to make 200 million gloves a day, but a supplier shutdown has left it with only two weeks' worth of boxes to ship them in, its founder told Reuters.
""We can't get our gloves to hospitals without cartons,"" Executive Chairman Lim Wee Chai said in an interview. ""Hospitals need our gloves. We can't just supply 50% of their requirement.""
The virus, which emerged in China at the end of last year, has left Malaysia with the highest number of infections in Southeast Asia at nearly 1,800 cases, with 17 deaths. To halt transmission, the government has ordered people to stay home from March 18 to April 14.
Glove makers and others eligible for exemption can operate half-staffed provided they meet strict safety conditions. Still, the Malaysian Rubber Glove Manufacturers Association (MARGMA) said it was lobbying ""almost every hour"" to return the industry to full strength to minimize risk to the global fight.
""We're shut down,"" said Evonna Lim, managing director at packaging supplier Etheos Imprint Technology. ""We fall under an exempted category but still need approval.""
Dr Celine Gounder, an infectious diseases specialist at the New York University School of Medicine, said she was using up to six times as many gloves as normal each day due to the number of patients with COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
""If we get to the point where there is a shortage of gloves, that's going to be a huge problem because then we cannot draw blood safely, we cannot do many medical procedures safely.""
GLOBAL CALL
With glove supplies dwindling, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on its website this month said some gloves could be used beyond their designated shelf life. On Tuesday, the United States lifted a ban on imports from Malaysian glove maker WRP Asia Pacific who it had previously accused of using forced labor.
Britain's Department of Health & Social Care has urged Malaysian authorities to prioritize the production and shipment of gloves that are of ""utmost criticality for fighting COVID-19,"" showed a letter dated March 20 to glove maker Supermax Corp and shared with Reuters.
MARGMA is considering rationing due to the ""extremely high demand,"" its president Denis Low told Reuters. ""You can produce as many gloves as you can but then there's nothing to pack them into.""
Under normal circumstances, Top Glove can meet less than 40% of its own packaging needs. For the remainder, it said just 23% of suppliers have gained approval to operate at half strength.
""We are lobbying almost every hour, we are putting in a lot of letters to the ministry,"" said Low. ""We are lobbying hard for the chemical suppliers and we want to ensure that the printers are also being given approval and any other supporting services, even transportation.""
In a statement, MARGMA said that as they were having to rely on half of their staff to work overtime during the lockdown, costs would rise by up to 30% and that buyers had agreed to bear that. 
Malaysia's Ministry of International Trade and Industry on Tuesday said it had received masses of applications to operate through the lockdown, and that it was seeking cooperation from industries to give way to those producing essential goods.
AUTOMATION
Developed economies are home to only a fifth of the world's population yet account for nearly 70% medical glove demand due to stringent medical standards. At 150, U.S. glove consumption per-capita is 20 times that of China, latest MARGMA data showed.
MARGMA expects demand to jump 16% to 345 billion gloves this year, with Malaysia's market share rising two percentage points to 65%. Thailand usually follows at about 18% and China at 9%.
Top Glove said orders have doubled since February and it sees sales rising by a fifth in the next six months. Its stock, with a market value of about $3.5 billion, has risen by a third this year versus a fall of 16% in the wider market.
The company, with customers in 195 economies, registered the highest net money inflow last week among listed Malaysian firms, along with peer Hartalega Holdings Bhd, showed MIDF Research data. Other glove makers include Kossan Rubber Industries Bhd and Careplus Group Bhd.
""We are fortunate enough to be in essential goods,"" said Lim. ""These few months and at least the next six months will be an all-time high in terms of sales volume, revenue and profit.""
With more than 80% of its 44 factories worldwide automated, Top Glove itself is less impacted by the lockdown than its more labor-intensive domestic suppliers. Packaging woes aside, however, ramping up production could turn under-supply into over-supply when the coronavirus outbreak finally subsides.

""This outbreak will create awareness and make humankind healthier,"" said Lim. ""People will pay more attention, they will invest more, they will buy more so demand will be more.""

Parliament was due to close for a three-week Easter break from March 31, but a motion on Wednesday's order paper proposes that it starts a week early, as fears grow that politicians and staff are being put at risk by continuing to work there.
It had already closed to visitors and reduced the number of lawmakers allowed in the House of Commons chamber to allow them to sit more spaced out in accordance with guidance on social distancing.
House of Commons speaker Lindsay Hoyle also said on Monday that any votes which took place would be adapted to avoid the usual process which can see hundreds of lawmakers crammed into a narrow room together as they are counted through.
The motion, put forward by House of Commons leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, states: ""That this House, at its rising today, do adjourn until Tuesday 21 April 2020."" 
Housing minister Robert Jenrick said that while most lawmakers wanted parliament to continue sitting to scrutinise the government, it was also important to protect the staff who work there.
""I am certain that parliament will return after the Easter holidays and I think it is really important, however deep and serious this crisis is, that parliament in some form continues to operate,"" he told BBC TV.

The upper chamber, the House of Lords, is expected to approve emergency legislation on Wednesday giving authorities sweeping powers to tackle the growing coronavirus outbreak.

BANGKOK (Reuters) - About 60,000 migrant workers living in Thailand have fled the country since authorities shut malls and many businesses at the weekend to curb the spread of the coronavirus, a Thai interior ministry official said on Wednesday.
Thailand’s latest measures have left many without jobs and prompted a mass exodus of a large number of the country’s four or five million migrant workers, mainly from Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.
Thailand has closed its land borders, told people to stay at home, and shuttered most businesses in an effort to suppress the virus. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha is set to invoke sweeping emergency powers on Thursday. 
A Thai interior ministry official told Reuters about 60,000 migrant workers from Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar had returned home as of Tuesday. Thailand has reported 934 cases of the virus, the second highest number reported in Southeast Asia.
Vast crowds gathered at the Myanmar border, carrying suitcases and luggage on their backs amid sometimes chaotic scenes as crowds scrambled over the gate.
“The state authorities are arranging to send the workers back to their respective states and regions by car, but some couldn’t wait and tried to pass the line,” said Ye Min from the Aid Alliance committee, a non-profit that helps migrant workers in Thailand.
He said about 30,000 had crossed in recent days through several gates. 
Citing official records, a lawmaker in Myanmar, Thant Zin Aung, said the number that had passed through just one checkpoint was 18,000, with similar numbers passing through three others.
Myanmar's government spokesman Zaw Htay rejected phone calls from Reuters seeking comment.
As he waited in line, Win Paing, a 24-year-old employee of a fish cannery, told Reuters by phone his family had asked him to come back.
“In Thailand, people are now stocking up on food but I didn’t have much money to stock up, so I just want to go home,” he said.
Myanmar reported its third case of the virus early Wednesday, in a 26-year-old man who flew from Britain via Bangkok. All of its confirmed cases so far have been imported. 
The returning workers were subjected to health checks and have been ordered to quarantine themselves in villages across the country for 14 days. 
At least 11 have been sent to hospital with high fever, according to local media reports.

Large numbers of workers have also crossed into Cambodia and Laos.

The epidemic has deepened enmity between Taiwan and China, which regards the democratic island as its sacred territory, to be brought under its control by force if necessary.
Taiwan's government says China has intentionally hampered its efforts to get virus information direct from the World Health Organization. China blocks Taiwan's WHO membership as it considers the island merely one of its provinces.
Taiwan has also been angered by stepped-up Chinese military drills near the island in recent weeks.
On Tuesday, Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang accused China of covering up the crisis in its early stages and not giving the world early enough warning.
Then on Wednesday, Cho Jung-tai, chairman of Taiwan's ruling Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), reiterated the cover-up accusation, adding that China had hoodwinked the WHO.
""Since the outbreak of the epidemic at the end of last year, China has covered it up and manipulated the WHO to pretend that everything is going well,"" Cho told a party meeting, according to a statement.
""The Chinese Communist Party regime's approach of maintaining stability and neglecting people's lives and health has caused the spread of the epidemic and seriously damaged China's carefully crafted image as a great power,"" he added.
China has strongly denied covering up the epidemic, and has said it ensures the island is provided with the information it needs to battle the virus. The WHO has also praised China's response to the epidemic.
In a statement late Tuesday, China's policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office said it was ""slander"" for Taiwan to suggest there was a cover up and that China has sent Taiwan 101 notifications to date, including information about its sharing of virus genome sequences with the WHO. 
""The use of the epidemic to stir up cross-Taiwan Strait confrontations at a time when the outbreak in Taiwan is picking up is shameless and disgusting,"" spokeswoman Zhu Fenglian said in comments carried by the official Xinhua news agency.
Taiwan swiftly stepped up checks and closed its borders to most Chinese visitors at the start of the outbreak, but over the past week it has seen an uptick of cases as infected people return from abroad, especially from Europe and the United States.

Taiwan now has 235 cases, although that is still far lower than the more than 80,000 cases recorded in China.

Afghan security forces had blocked off the area and were taking on the attackers, Interior Ministry spokesman Tariq Arian said in a message to journalists.
It was not immediately clear how many attackers there were or who they were. It was not known if there were any casualties.
Sikhs have been the target of attack by Islamist militants before in South Asia. A Taliban spokesman, in a message on Twitter, denied responsibility for the attack.
Narender Singh Khalsa, a member of parliament who represents the tiny Sikh community, said he had reports that four people had been killed and up to 200 people trapped inside the temple in the early morning attack.
""Three suicide bombers entered a dharamsala,"" he said, referring to a sanctuary area in a temple compound.
""The gunmen started their attack at a time when the dharamsala was full of worshippers,"" he said.
He said the Afghan security forces were clashing with the attackers.
The attack comes a day after the United States said it would cut its aid to the government by $1 billion over frustrations that feuding political leaders could not reach an agreement and form a team to negotiate with the Taliban.
The Interior Ministry spokesman said Afghan security forces had cleared one floor of the complex and were moving slowly to try and avoid civilian casualties.
Sikhs are a small religious minority in Afghanistan with numbers fewer than 300 families.
In 2018, a suicide bombing targeting the Sikh community and claimed by the Islamic State militant group killed more than a dozen people in the eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.
The United States last month struck a deal with the Taliban on the withdrawal of U.S.-led international troops but the agreement does not include Islamic State militants.

Meteorological authorities in Japan issued no tsunami alerts while U.S. authorities canceled a warning for Hawaii after the earthquake hit near the Kurils, situated between the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Okhotsk. 
""A tsunami wave arrived in Severo-Kurilsk at 1515 Sakhalin [region] time (0415 GMT),"" Russia's emergency services said. ""The wave height was about 50 cm (20 inches).""
Residents will remain in a safe zone on higher ground, the emergency services said, while the tsunami threat remains, adding a decision to cancel the alarm will be made by specialists after the low tide starts.
The U.S Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said the country's West Coast, Alaska and Canada's British Columbia didn't face any tsunami danger from the quake.
Some of the U.S. coastal areas may experience non-damaging sea level changes, the agency added.
The Japan Meteorological Association also said there might be slight tidal changes but said no warnings or even watch advisories had been issued.
The earthquake, 218 km (135 miles) south-southeast of the town of Severo-Kurilsk, struck at a depth of 56.7 km (35 miles), the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) said.
The USGS had initially said the quake measured 7.8, but revised that figure down to 7.5.
There were no immediate reports of damage or casualties.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia strongly objects to the formal indictment of Chinese-Australian writer Yang Hengjun for espionage , who continues to be held in ""unacceptable"" conditions, Foreign Minister Marise Payne said on Wednesday.
Yang, a former Chinese diplomat turned online journalist and blogger, was formally arrested in August 2019 on suspicion of espionage, seven months after he was originally detained in the southern city of Guangzhou.
Espionage is punishable by death in China. 
Australia denies that Yang has ever spied for them.
Already strained by Australia's decision to prohibit Huawei from its 5G broadband network and Canberra's allegations that Beijing is meddling in its domestic affairs - the detention of Yang has added to tensions.
Payne said Yang should be immediately released.
""The government strongly objects to the formal indictment of Australian citizen and academic Dr Yang Hengjun in China on suspicion of espionage,"" Payne said in an emailed statement.
Payne said Australian consular officials have been denied access to Yang since the end of 2019, which she described as unacceptable.
In December, Payne said Yang was being shackled in his prison cell.
The Chinese embassy in Canberra was not immediately available for comment but has in the past denied that Yang is being mistreated.
Previous diplomatic spats have resulted in disruptions to exports of coal and wine.
China is Australia's largest trading partner, but Canberra has become increasingly wary about Beijing’s influence within Australia and across the Pacific.
Reuters last year reported Canberra had determined that Beijing was responsible for a cyber-attack on Australia’s parliament and three largest political parties, just months out from an election.

The soldiers were attacked on Monday on the island village of Boma in the swampy Lake Chad zone in the west of the country, where the armies of Chad, Nigeria and Niger have been fighting the Islamist militants for years.
""I have taken part in many operations ... but never in our history have we lost so many men at one time,"" Deby said during a visit to the site on Tuesday.

BEIJING/MONTREAL (Reuters) - As the coronavirus spreads across the United States, Chinese students from wealthy families are persuading their parents to pay tens of thousands of dollars for seats on private jets to get home.
The alternative, in a world of locked borders and grounded commercial planes, is 60-hour flights with multiple transit hops over the Pacific. 
Jeff Gong, a lawyer in Shanghai, asked his daughter, a high school student in Wisconsin, if she wanted 180,000 yuan ($25,460) as pocket money or a ticket on a private flight home.
""My daughter begged me to get her back home ... She said 'No papa, I don't want the money, I want to go home',"" he told Reuters.
U.S.-based Chinese students are scrambling to get home as U.S. infections top 50,000 while new cases in China - where the flu-like virus emerged in humans late last year - have fallen to zero.
The sense of urgency is further heightened by the dramatic cutback in flight capacity. On Tuesday, 3,102 out of 3,800 planned commercial flights to and from China were canceled, according to aviation data provider VariFlight.
""(Education) agents and schools are the ones making contact on behalf of the Chinese families looking to group together to arrange a private charter, given the lack of airline flights,"" said Annelies Garcia, commercial director for Private Fly, a global booking service for charter flights.
But even the window for chartered flights is closing fast, further elevating prices. Beijing has banned all chartered flights from overseas and Shanghai is expected to follow suit soon. Hong Kong and Macau have blocked transit flights. 
U.S-based Air Charter Service can fly passengers from Los Angeles to Shanghai on a 14-seat Bombardier 6000 for 2.3 million yuan ($325,300), or about $23,000 for a spot. 
""We have arranged a number of private jets traveling from the U.S. to China repatriating Chinese nationals with routes including New York and Boston to Shanghai, San Jose to Hong Kong and Los Angeles to Guangzhou,"" said Glenn Phillips, a PR and advertising manager at Air Charter Service. 
""The prices range greatly depending on the positioning of the aircraft on the dates and time requested, and the exact route.""
But even the well-heeled have to wrestle with logistics.
Air charter providers have been notified informally that private jets registered in China are not allowed to land in the United States, and those registered in the United States cannot land in China, two sources at such firms told Reuters. 
""The Chinese government is reluctant to let people abroad to come back, though they cannot make it too obvious. We have received a lot of verbal guidance to restrict chartered flights these days and the door is closing rapidly,"" one of them said.
Jet operators circumvent the restrictions by either getting planes from other countries to run the U.S.-China routes or arranging transfers in Tokyo, they said.
""Operators of U.S. or Chinese-registered aircraft are not permitted to land in each other's countries at the moment, so for U.S.-China route inquiries, we are working with operators of long-range jets based elsewhere,"" said Private Fly's Garcia. 
The Civil Aviation Administration of China did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

Stephen Beach of St Budeaux Parish Church in Plymouth, southwest England, was getting his congregation to reflect on the experience of waiting in the final section of a sermon delivered from his home last week. 
""It's a great thing to pause in the presence of God and to ask the question: Lord God, what are you saying to us?,"" Beach said, warming to the theme.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean police took the unusual step of publicly identifying the 24-year-old accused leader of an online sexual blackmail ring after the case lead to a national outcry in a country still focused on battling a coronavirus outbreak.
Cho Ju-bin was identified by police as the central suspect in the case after more than 5 million South Koreans signed multiple petitions calling for authorities to release his name.
Cho is accused of organizing an online network that lured at least 74 women, including 16 underage girls, into what authorities have called ""virtual enslavement"" by blackmailing them into sending increasingly degrading and sometimes violent sexual imagery of themselves.
He is facing charges of violating the child protection act, the privacy act and the sexual abuse act, as well as abuse, threats, and coercion, according to police, who have now referred the case to prosecutors.
""I apologize to those who were hurt by me,"" Cho said as he was led away from a Seoul police station on Wednesday, but did not respond when asked by reporters whether he admitted to the charges.
""Thank you for ending the life of a demon that I couldn't stop,"" he said.
The case brought new pledges from police to investigate not only the organizers, but also participants of the chat rooms who paid as much as 1.5 million won ($1,210.12) to view the images.
""Through strict investigation, the police will entirely transform the social apathy to digital sex crime and strongly root out such crime from our society,"" Min Gap-ryong, the commissioner general of the Korean National Police Agency, said on Tuesday.
Min said police will mobilize ""all available power"" to investigate those who shared the videos of sexual exploitation.
He said police will strengthen cooperation with law enforcement in the United States, the United Kingdom and INTERPOL, as well as with global IT giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Twitter to track down digital crime on foreign servers.
The National Police Agency told reporters that 124 suspects had been arrested and 18 operators of chat rooms on Telegram and other social media had been detained as a result of investigations into such sexual crimes since last September. Cho is accused of being one of those 18 operators.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - An emergency aid package for Canadians facing economic harm from the coronavirus outbreak was stalled on Tuesday as a related move by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to gain new spending powers raised opposition concerns.
Legislators were meeting in Ottawa to approve a C$27 billion ($18.6 billion) cash injection.
To maintain social distancing in the face of the highly contagious respiratory illness, only about three dozen of the 338 members of the House of Commons convened to debate the legislation just hours before Ontario, the most populous of Canada's 10 provinces, shuts all non-essential businesses.
The number of people in Canada diagnosed with the novel coronavirus jumped to about 2,800 from just over 2,000 on Sunday, and the death toll hit 28, four more than the day before.
Discussion on the aid package was quickly suspended after the official opposition Conservative Party threatened to block the legislation, saying the Liberal government wanted to give itself the power to spend without parliamentary approval until the end of 2021.
""The government should not attempt to eliminate parliamentary oversight during a crisis,"" Conservative leader Andrew Scheer said. Trudeau's minority government requires opposition support to pass legislation.
Scheer later told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp that the emergency cash injection could quickly pass if the Trudeau government separated that vote from a debate about new powers.
""If they insist on dealing with both at the same time, they are making a choice to have a longer process,"" Scheer said. 
The crisis ""requires extreme flexibility and rapidity of response by governments,"" Trudeau told reporters outside his home, where he has been in quarantine since his wife tested positive for the disease almost two weeks ago. 
""We've been in close discussion with the opposition parties to find a way to both get that flexibility to be able to get measures out the door, and keep in place our democratic institutions and the values that are important to us all,"" Trudeau said. He gave no further details.
The package of measures will only become law once the Senate, or unelected upper chamber, has approved it.
As lawmakers wrangled behind closed doors, more Canadians lost their jobs. Air Canada said it would furlough up to 600 pilots, while privately held WestJet Airlines said 6,900 employees would leave the company.
Trudeau, upset by pictures of people flocking to beaches and parks despite repeated requests that they stay home, repeated that Ottawa could impose restrictions on movement if necessary.
Parks Canada said it was banning all motor vehicles from national parks to ""significantly reduce visitation.""

Trudeau last week pledged C$27 billion in direct support to families and businesses and said he was ready to do more. The government will provide C$55 billion ($38 billion) in additional aid through tax deferrals.

AMMAN (Reuters) - Jordanian Prime Minister Omar Razzaz said on Tuesday the government would allow people to go on foot to buy groceries in neighbourhood shops to ease daily life for the nearly 10 million inhabitants under a tight curfew to stem the spread of the coronavirus. 
The curfew was imposed on Saturday after King Abdullah enacted an emergency decree giving the government sweeping powers to enforce an army-imposed curfew and other measures that restrict civil and political liberties. The government justified the severe restrictions by saying that many people had flouted calls to stay at home, risking the fast spread of the virus.
Shops, bakeries and even pharmacies have since closed in a complete lockdown of businesses and commercial activity, and the army, which was deployed on streets across the country, warned that anyone leaving their homes would face up to a year in jail. 
Razzaz said that as of Wednesday people would be allowed to leave their homes from 10 a.m. to 18:00 p.m. to walk to corner shops, groceries, bakeries and pharmacies.
""I understand the worry and anxiety. ... The curfew is not a natural state that we have ever experienced before and reflects negatively and psychologically on us,"" Razazz said. 
Large supermarkets will reopen on Thursday to sell goods online and to be home-delivered, also to avoid crowding in public places, Razzaz said in a briefing. 
Razzaz warned any stampede or rush in any shops would prompt immediate closure. He said the ban on private vehicles would be maintained.
""Either there is discipline or we will close shops that we see congestion,"" he said.
Jordan a week ago closed land and sea border crossings with Syria, Iraq, Egypt and Israel, and suspended all incoming and outgoing flights.
The government brought in public transport buses on Tuesday to help bakeries sell bread in residential neighbourhoods across the country. But panic buying in some inner city areas erupted as people rushed from their homes for bread, which many Jordanians consume as a daily staple food item, witnesses said.

Health Minister Saad Jaber said on Tuesday that confirmed cases of the virus jumped to 153, with 26 new cases in the biggest daily rise since numbers began to steadily grow last week. There have been no deaths.

The National Centre for Disease Control, which operates in areas controlled by both major sides in the Libyan conflict, gave no further details in its statement on the coronavirus case. However, doctors said the patient was in a hospital in Tripoli. 
Both the internationally recognised government in Tripoli, in the west, and a rival administration ruling from Benghazi in the east have imposed lockdowns, stopped foreign travel and promised resources for the health service. 
The eastern-based Libyan National Army (LNA) has been trying to capture Tripoli since last year. Despite a ceasefire call by the United Nations last week to allow all sides to focus on preparing for the pandemic, fighting has continued, with heavy shelling and clashes on Tuesday.
""This is a health system that was close to collapse before you get the coronavirus,"" said Elizabeth Hoff, head of mission for the World Health Organization in Libya. 
Equipment for testing is limited, there is very little protective gear and there is a severe shortage of medical workers, particularly in rural areas, Hoff said. 
""There is a national plan, but funding has not yet been allocated for implementation,"" she said.
The committee in charge of fighting the flu-like disease announced early on Wednesday a ban on movement between cities and areas until further notice.
A blockade of oil ports by forces aligned with the LNA in eastern Libya has cut off most revenue to the Central Bank of Libya in Tripoli, which funds state institutions and the salaries of public workers across the country. 
A doctor in a medical centre in Tripoli said she had not been paid since last year. 
The parallel central bank in Benghazi, set up by the eastern administration, said on Tuesday it paid salaries to government workers in east Libyan areas for the first time this year, but a doctor said no money had arrived in his account.
Some medics in Benghazi had refused to work at a hospital over the lack of pay and adequate protective gear, a doctor there said, but the problem was later resolved. 
In Misrata, a port city held by forces loyal to the internationally recognised government in Tripoli to its west, cleaning companies disinfected parks and public gardens. 
Volunteers distributed face masks and gloves as people entered banks, where marks on the floor showed where to stand to ensure a safe distance from others waiting in line.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will not self-isolate after returning from Afghanistan and Qatar on Tuesday because neither country was on a U.S. government list calling for such precautions when he visited, a State Department medical official said.
The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said Pompeo's choreographed movements in both places and the prior screening of people who came in contact with him meant it was a low or no-risk environment for him to catch the disease.
Asked if Pompeo or his staff planned to self-quarantine for 14 days following their return Tuesday, the official told reporters in a call: ""No, they are not,"" and added: ""There's no intent to quarantine anyone because it's not indicated.""
However, Qatar was added to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Level 3 list on Tuesday, which says visitors ""should stay home for 14 days after returning from travel, monitor their health, and practice social distancing.""
The official made references to an earlier version of the CDC list, seemingly unaware of Tuesday's update.
The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether Qatar's addition to the list would change Pompeo's recommended behavior or lead to his self-isolation for two weeks.
Pompeo on Monday announced a $1 billion cut in U.S. aid to Afghanistan after he failed to convince Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and his political adversary Abdullah Abdullah to end a feud that has helped jeopardize a U.S.-led peace effort.
Pompeo met both men, both separately and together, while in Kabul on Monday and, on his way back to Washington, met for 75 minutes at a military base in Qatar with Taliban officials, including their top negotiator, Mullah Baradar Akhund.
The official stressed that Pompeo was in carefully controlled environments during his trip and that all those who flew with him aboard a U.S. government plane and met him in Afghanistan were screened for symptoms such as fever.
""According to the CDC guidance, this is either low or no risk,"" the official said. ""You can find in the guidance itself - that being within six feet for a prolonged period of time with a lab confirmed coronavirus patient. Okay, well we can all agree that didn't happen,"" he said.
A Reuters correspondent traveled with Pompeo on his plane to Afghanistan and Doha. Throughout the 51-hour trip, both the secretary and his staff, flew on helicopters, spent time in rooms with many officials and posed with U.S. personnel for photographers in settings where it was impossible to practise a full social distancing.

The official did not specifically address whether all those who met Pompeo in Qatar had been screened but said it was a ""very controlled environment.""

Millions of Canadians, many working from home amid a widening lockdown, tune in every day to televised updates by public health officials across the country. 
When British Columbia’s normally unflappable provincial health officer, Bonnie Henry, briefly broke down during a March 7 briefing, the outpouring of reaction made her a trending topic on Twitter.
It also inspired two Vancouver women to pen ""Dear Dr. Bonnie,"" a song that has amassed 13,000 views on YouTube.

Toronto’s medical officer of health, Eileen de Villa, has a Twitter fan account – for her scarves. 
The parody account @de_scarf has gained thousands of followers since launching last week on the social media site to track de Villa's daily neckwear.
One floral scarf, the account noted, was ""serving watercolour realness.""
Asked by reporters how many scarves she owned, de Villa said: ""I’m not sure. Many? But I’m happy to take suggestions if you have particular patterns that you’d like to recommend.""
Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, has made the phrase ""plank the curve"" a common household phrase for Canadians and a popular hashtag on social media.
Tam is at the center of Canadian government ads that began airing this week urging citizens to stay home. 
In Quebec, an online petition appealing for the province’s public health director, Horacio Arruda, to share his recipe for Portuguese tarts has collected over 1,500 signatures.
In Alberta, T-shirts with the face of Chief Medical Officer Deena Hinshaw and the words: ""We are in this together, even if we are far apart"" are being sold online.
All proceeds will be donated to local food banks, said the website’s organizers.

TORONTO/VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Canadian lawyers and government prosecutors are joining forces to get people out of provincial jails by accelerating bail hearings amid fears of a coronavirus outbreak in the close quarters.
Lawyers are volunteering to put together bail applications for people in detention, and for those with non-violent infractions, try to get them released based on time already served.
""The concern is that a jail sentence can potentially become a death sentence for those that are there,"" Toronto lawyer Daniel Brown said. ""What we see is really a team effort by all the justice participants to ensure that bail hearings proceed.""
About 1,000 Ontario inmates were released last week.
More than 2,100 people have been diagnosed with the virus in Canada, with 24 deaths. Globally, cases exceeded 377,000 as of early Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, including 16,500 fatalities.
Jails and prisons around the world have been scrambling to safeguard a captive population that includes many people with underlying medical problems. Many have limited or banned visits and, in some countries, have been releasing inmates early.
In Ontario, where two-thirds of the jail population is on remand, court cases dealing with smaller infractions, such as traffic violations, have been postponed.
""It’s not the time to throw somebody in jail for missing their appointment,” said lawyer Mark Gervin, vice president of British Columbia’s Criminal Defence Advocacy Society.

Swedish Thunberg said on Instagram she had now recovered from symptoms milder than her latest cold, and may not have suspected COVID-19 had it not been for her father, who had travelled with her, developing more severe symptoms. 
""Many (especially young people) might not notice any symptoms at all, or very mild symptoms. Then they don’t know they have the virus and can pass it on to people in risk groups,"" she said.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson ordered Britons on Monday to stay at home to halt the spread of coronavirus, imposing curbs on everyday life without precedent in peacetime.
It included banning gatherings of more than two people in public who do not live together and telling Britons to stay at least 2 meters away from people outside their household, prompting the question: what about couples who live apart? 
""I'm clearly going to start a new career here in relationship counselling,"" said Jenny Harries, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England, when asked about the issue at the government's daily news conference.
The government's advice is based on the fact that if one person in a household gets the virus, others are likely to as well, she said, meaning couples who do not live together should stay apart or risk spreading the disease.
""The alternative might be that for quite a significant period going forward they should just test the strength of their relationship ... test really carefully your strength of feeling,"" she said. 
""Stay with the household either together or apart, but keep it that way while we go forward because otherwise we will not all be working towards achieving our outcome.""

London has seen the most cases of coronavirus of any region in Britain and passengers are being forced to crush against other on services after the city's local government reduced the number of trains.
Health minister Matt Hancock said there was no reason why the transport system should be operating fewer services.
""We should have more tube trains running,"" he said at a news conference. ""There is no good reason in the information I have seen that the current levels of tube provision should be as low as they are."" 
Transport for London, which runs the tube network, has advised people not to travel unless their journey is essential and has cut services as workers are told to stay at home. But thousands of healthcare employees and others still rely on the underground system to get to work.
London mayor Sadiq Khan said it was almost impossible to add more tube services because many drivers and staff were on sick leave or being forced to self-isolate.
""We cannot run more services than we currently are,"" he said.
Earlier, Khan said the police might carry out spot checks on passengers using the tube amid warnings that tens of thousands of people are ignoring warnings to avoid public transport.
Khan said the police could be used to check individual passengers and ensure they qualify as key workers with a legitimate reason to use the transport network.

ALGIERS (Reuters) - An Algerian court has sentenced one of the most prominent figures in the protest movement that toppled longtime leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika to a year in prison, leading rights lawyers said on Tuesday.
Karim Tabbou was charged with ""weakening army morale"" last year after criticising the then army chief, Ahmed Gaed Salah, who died suddenly of a heart attack in late December. 
He had become the most prominent figure in the Hirak protest movement, which emerged in February 2019, shaking Algeria's deeply entrenched political establishment with weekly mass protests that forced Bouteflika to resign.
Abdelghani Badi, a rights lawyer, said in a video posted online that Tabbou had been sentenced to a year in prison, and had been unable to defend himself after suffering a medical problem.
""How can we prosecute someone who can't speak because he has had a stroke?"" he said in the video.
Another rights lawyer, Mustafa Bouchachi, told local media: ""This is a scandal"".
The justice ministry has not issued an official statement confirming either the verdict or the sentence. 
Protests continued after both Gaed Salah's death and the election of Bouteflika's replacement as president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, in a vote that was opposed by the demonstrators. 
The weekly mass marches stopped on Friday, however, after more than a year of continual protests, because of the coronavirus.

Starting this week, an Israeli startup company working with hospitals and academic institutions will sample voices of confirmed coronavirus patients through a mobile application in a research project led by the ministry. 
""These voice samples will be analyzed using an AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based algorithm in order to identify the unique vocal 'fingerprint', the ministry said in a statement.
The coronavirus affects the respiratory system and signs of distress can be reflected in the patterns of a person's voice and breathing.
Tal Wenderow, President and CEO of Vocalis Health, the company that developed the mobile app, said that the algorithm would be used for remote diagnosis and monitoring. 
At this stage, the app would only be used by medical staff together with the patients taking part in the study, but the company's website allows for anyone to take part and send a voice sample to the researchers. 
Researchers hope that healthcare systems would be able to use the data to prioritize testing and hospitalization, allowing patients with light symptoms to stay at home.
The ministry said the monitoring system ""can be conducted from afar, in order to prevent the spread of the disease and overburdening of the national healthcare system.""
Initial results of the study were expected within six weeks.
Israel has reported more than 1,600 coronavirus cases and three fatalities.

The Russian Dvinitsa-50 ship, part of Moscow's auxiliary fleet, was carrying at least three military ambulances along with a shipping container on its deck. 
Russia, which has provided military support for President Bashar al-Assad since 2015, operates a naval facility at Tartus in Syria and an airbase in Latakia.

The ship was prevented from leaving for a second time by Houthi forces, government-run SABA news agency said.
The ship had been scheduled to sail on Tuesday morning for the government-controlled port of Mokha to drop off government representatives who two weeks ago suspended their participation in a U.N.-mediated joint negotiating team discussing a truce and troop redeployment from the contested port city of Hodeidah. 
The United Nations has been holding meetings between the warring parties on board the ship for months. 
Houthi officials did not respond to a request for comment and the U.N. was not immediately available to comment. 
Yemen has been mired in conflict since the Houthi group, aligned with Iran, ousted the government from Sanaa in late 2014.
A military coalition led by Iran's arch enemy Saudi Arabia intervened to try to restore the government to power, but the Houthis still control most major urban centers.
Yemen has not reported any cases of coronavirus, but screening measures and closures have been implemented at airports and ports on both sides of the conflict.

Students started home classes on Monday after a week off school as part of measures to contain the spread of the virus, which has killed 37 people in Turkey.
An online teaching platform and three TV channels for primary, middle and high school students were set up to provide lessons at home.
But the channel for middle school students aged 12-15 broadcast an animated recreation of former premier Adnan Menderes being hanged, angering critics who said the subject was unsuitable for children and served ideological purposes.
Menderes, whom President Tayyip Erdogan cites as an inspiration, was executed after a 1960 military coup. Erdogan and his ruling AK Party (AKP) have often said Menderes, who was known for his authoritarian style, was unjustly executed.
The ministry has started an investigation into what Selcuk described as a mistake committed by officials rushing to prepare material. 
""There are documentaries between lessons. We are working into the night and there was an error with labeling,"" he said in interview with HaberGlobal television channel. 
The main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) accused the government of putting ideology before ethics. 
""How can you explain death to such small children through an execution?"" CHP Deputy Chairman Seyit Torun said on Twitter.
The pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party (HDP) criticized what it called ""pedagogically unacceptable"" problems on the first day of home schooling.
The clip showed a noose being put over Menderes' neck, a stool being kicked out from underneath him and then his feet hanging below, as a narrator recaps the events.

LONDON (Reuters) - A key modeling study from Singapore has found that putting multiple social lockdowns in place - including school closures - will have the biggest impact on curbing COVID-19, the pandemic disease caused by the new coronavirus.
Quarantining infected people and their family members, closing schools, and imposing workplace distancing and homeworking can all limit the spread, the study found, but a combination of all three is most effective in reducing cases.
The global number of confirmed cases passed 377,000 across 194 countries and territories as of 0200 GMT on Tuesday, according to a Reuters tally, with more than 16,500 reported deaths.
Singapore, which according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) data had reported 455 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and two deaths as of March 22, has imposed some social distancing recommendations but has not closed its schools. 
Elsewhere, millions of children have seen their schools closed in the United States, across much of Europe and in many other countries as governments have imposed strict social lockdown measures to stop people meeting and mingling in groups.
Published in the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal, the study, conducted by researchers from the National University of Singapore (NUS), looked at a simulated Singapore setting to analyze the potential impact of social distancing policies.
It found that while less effective than the combined three-pronged approach, quarantine plus workplace measures presented the next best option for reducing COVID-19 cases, followed by quarantine plus school closure, and then quarantine only. 

""The results of this study provide policy makers in Singapore and other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of enhanced outbreak control measures that could mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed effectively and in a timely manner,"" said Alex R Cook, an associate professor at NUS who co-led the work.

CAPE TOWN (Reuters) - When panic over the coronavirus spurred a run on hand sanitizer in Cape Town, gin maker Andre Pienaar realized there was something he could do with all the waste alcohol his small distillery produces.
He had 140 liters of the 70 percent ethanol waste - called ""gin heads"" in the trade - just sitting around, so he posted on social media that anyone who needed some could have it for free to turn into the hand wash at home.
""The response was crazy. It was finished in three hours and there was a limit of one liter per person,"" he told Reuters. He has now started selling the ethanol his Pienaar and Son Distilling Company is still producing.
""There is nothing on the shelves for people other than soap at the moment. It is just another option to help protect people,"" he said.
Across Africa, dwindling supplies of sanitizer and surgical masks could prove a boon for entrepreneurs seeking to plug shortages. Amateur chemists in Nigeria and Kenya are mixing up hand wash, while enterprising tailors in Rwanda are sewing their own masks.
Health officials warn that wearing masks in public won't protect you from the virus, and say sanitizer only works if it's more than 60 percent alcohol - and even then soap and water are better.
But those warnings have not stopped customers flocking to Alexander Nshimiyimana, a tailor based in Kigali's main market. He is using kitenge, a kaleidoscopic local fabric, to make masks that are not only cheaper but much prettier than the standard hospital-style ones.
""It is a kind of opportunity to some people to make money. It is also (an) opportunity to innovate,"" Nshimiyimana said.
The continent of 1.3 billion has recorded only around 1,100 cases in 43 countries, with 39 deaths, a fraction of the more than 305,000 people infected and more than 13,000 deaths worldwide. But there are concerns that Africa's creaky health infrastructure could be overrun as the virus spreads.
""A mask will not protect you from the infection, it will protect others if you wear it from getting infected should you have symptoms. So in this respect also a piece of cloth works,"" James Ayodele, spokesman of the Centre for Disease Control (CDC) Africa office.
Ayodele said that the CDC also advised against making sanitizer at home because it contains alcohol at a potentially dangerous high concentration.
But Moji Kusanu, a chef in Nigeria's commercial hub of Lagos, decided to respond to an obvious shortage - after prices shot up to 1,700 naira ($5.55) for a 200ml bottle, from 200 naira before.

""Sometimes, when you are out you cannot wash your hands. sanitizers can ... make a difference,"" she said

China announced on March 18 it was revoking the press accreditations of all American journalists in the China bureaus of the three newspapers that were due to expire at the end of 2020, effectively expelling them.
""We strongly urge the Chinese government to reverse its decision to force the Americans working for our news organizations to leave,"" the publishers of News Corp's (O:NWSA) Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post and the  New York Times  (N:NYT) said.

""Perhaps more than any major news event in modern history, this moment underscores the urgent importance of both probing, accurate, on-the-ground reporting from the centers of the pandemic and of sharing the information.""
The expulsions were the latest escalation in a dispute with the United States over media freedom and access, which last month saw the United States require that Chinese state media register as foreign embassies.
China then expelled three Wall Street Journal reporters - two Americans and an Australian - after the paper published an opinion column calling China the ""real sick man of Asia"".
The United States then cut the number of journalists allowed to work at four major Chinese state media outlets there from 160 to 100, citing a ""deepening crackdown"" on independent reporting in China.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel's Supreme Court ordered the speaker of the parliament on Monday to put into motion a move in parliament, which he had rejected, that could weaken close ally Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hold on power.
The rare court intervention in parliamentary procedure followed Yuli Edelstein's refusal to hold a vote on March 25 that would likely remove him as speaker and fast-track legislation to bar Netanyahu from forming a new government with a corruption trial looming.
Edelstein, a member of Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party, had cited the coronavirus crisis and the Israeli leader's call for a ""national emergency government"" as reasons for delaying a vote for the speaker's position, following an inconclusive national election on March 2.
Although no government has been formed to replace Netanyahu's caretaker coalition, a new parliament has been sworn in and Netanyahu's main rivals - the centrist Blue and White party and its allies, which include a coalition of Arab parties, control a slim majority - 61 of its 120 seats.
Hearing a petition from Blue and White and democracy advocacy groups on Monday to force Edelstein to schedule a vote for a new speaker, the court gave him until the evening to say whether he would be prepared to do so at a parliamentary session on Wednesday.
After the deadline passed, Edelstein took to Twitter with an emphatic no.
""With all due respect, I cannot agree to the ultimatum presented to me and Israel's parliament to hold the session no later than March 25,"" Edelstein wrote, saying that setting the legislature's agenda was the speaker's prerogative, not the court's.
Soon after that, the court issued a ruling instructing him to hold the vote within the next two days.
""The continued refusal to allow for a full vote in the Knesset for the election of a permanent Knesset speaker undercuts the foundations of the democratic process,"" Chief Justice Esther Hayut wrote in the ruling.
There was no immediate word from Edelstein whether he would obey the order.
Defiance of the ruling would put Israeli democracy to a new test amid allegations by Netanyahu's critics that he has taken a turn toward autocracy, Israeli political commentators said.
Netanyahu, 70, made no immediate public comment on the issue. Israel's attorney-general, who has indicted the prime minister on bribery, fraud and breach of trust charges that Netanyahu has denied, had backed Blue and White's position.

Leading members of Likud, including the justice minister - a Netanyahu appointee - had called on Edelstein to reject the court's call for a vote on Wednesday. But they stopped short of urging him to defy a formal ruling.

The report said the July 24-Aug. 9 Tokyo Olympics will likely be held in 2021 with the details to be worked out in the next four weeks.
""On the basis of the information the IOC has, postponement has been decided,” Pound told USA Today. ""The parameters going forward have not been determined, but the Games are not going to start on July 24, that much I know.""
Canadian Pound, a longtime IOC member, did not immediately respond when asked by Reuters to comment.
Pound's comments to USA Today come a day after the IOC said it was stepping up its ""scenario planning"" for the Tokyo 2020 Games -- including a possible postponement -- as the coronavirus pandemic spreads.
The Olympics has never been postponed or cancelled during peacetime.
Following the IOC's announcement, major sporting nations Australia and Canada withdrew from the Tokyo Games due to the coronavirus crisis.

More than 337,000 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 14,600 have died.

Macron has ordered the French to stay at home other than to buy groceries, travel to work, exercise or for medical care. However, some medical professionals have called for stricter measures.
""There will be no total lockdown,"" a source close to France's Chief Rabbi Haim Korsia, who took part in the meeting at the Elysee palace, told Reuters. ""(Macron) said (this) in essence, because that would cause more pain than healing.""
Macron's meeting with religious leaders also concluded that celebrations of the Christian holiday of Easter and the Jewish holiday of Passover would probably not be held this year, the source said.

""If the lockdown is maintained, which should be the case, places of worship will be inaccessible and family reunions won't be possible,"" the source added.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Her students are used to seeing her in the classrooms of Adrien Block Intermediate School 25 in New York City's Flushing neighborhood, but on Monday morning ""Miss Brooke"" appeared instead on their laptop and phone screens, sitting in her suburban kitchen.
""These are interesting times,"" Brooke Wacha, smiling calmly, told her students, among the 1.1 million children in the largest public school system in the United States, which began a grand, unwieldy experiment in remote learning as the coronavirus outbreak largely confines Americans to their homes.
""I'm hoping to make this process as easy as possible and I don't want to put any extra stress on the families,"" she said in the video she had uploaded to a private YouTube channel. ""So, just with this week, hang in there, work on figuring out the technology."" 
The city's school chancellor, Richard Carranza, predicted ""hiccups"" as the system is atomized, dispersed across countless apartments in the city's richest and poorest corners and linked only by the internet and occasional phonecalls. 
The challenges are enormous. Some city schools have no prior experience with remote learning. Not every student's parent or guardian is tech-savvy or even available in the day to supervise schoolwork. The school system serves many children with special needs, including those in the care of Wacha, who specializes in teaching children with autism and cognitive impairment.
Parents spoke of trying to find a quiet corner in cramped apartments for their children to crack on with assignments.
""My husband's going to be working from the kitchen counter and he's going to be on the phone,"" said Rosie Creamer, whose son, Charlie, is a 9-year-old fourth-grader at Manhattan's Public School 40. 
Charlie would have to sit at his desk in his room, and Creamer had resigned herself to having to sit with him, ""because if he can get out of doing it, he will."" 
New York is an epicenter of the pandemic with nearly 17,000 cases and more than 115 deaths. https://tmsnrt.rs/2w7hX9T
GOOGLE CLASSROOM
Classrooms closed a week ago in New York as COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus, accelerated through the crowded city, although families can still pick up meals from outside school buildings.
Since then, teachers have been busy revising their lesson plans and sharing tips with stressed parents on how they make children focus on their work. 
Many schools are using the Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Classroom service, posting assignments to be completed by students as and when they can during the week while confined at home with their families. City officials have had to lend out tens of thousands of school laptops so no child is left digitally marooned.
Mina Leisure, an English-language teacher at the Urban Assembly Gateway School for Technology in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen, said at least one of her students only had access to a smartphone, less than ideal for the writing assignments she was setting.
""I told him if you write on a piece of paper and take a picture on your phone, that's fine,"" she said.

Leisure's school has decided to set assignments on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and to spend Tuesdays and Thursdays checking in with students and parents. Her students, like much of their generation, seem allergic to speaking on the phone, so she anticipates a lot of conversing by text messages.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Usually it's the artists for whom a solo is the ultimate prize. Now it is the audience.
Starting this month, Russia's Perm Opera and Ballet Theatre will stream its performances online and allow just one spectator in the theater to watch in person.
Called ""One-On-One"", the project is designed to create a new kind of interaction with the public at a time when a growing number of coronavirus cases are limiting outings and gatherings. 
""We are ready to hold performances for one person because in the end ... one spectator has the same value as a full house,"" Marat Gatsalov, the theater's principal stage director, said in a statement. 
The theater, located in Perm, an industrial city 1,100 km (680 miles) east of Moscow, said it would shortly be accepting applications for those wanting to attend the performances alone. 
It said that one of the performers would choose the spectator in a draw, but that the chosen person would need to be screened by a doctor before entering the theater.
Russia has so far recorded 438 cases of the virus, as well as one coronavirus-related death. 
The authorities have barred foreign nationals from entering the country until May in an effort to stop the coronavirus from spreading further, and have canceled or heavily restricted public gatherings.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - A clearly unhappy Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said people defying advice to isolate themselves to fight a coronavirus outbreak should ""go home and stay home"" or face sanctions. 
Shortly after he spoke, the premier of Ontario - the most populous of Canada's 10 provinces - announced a two-week shutdown of non-essential businesses starting late on Tuesday.
The number of people diagnosed with the illness caused by the new coronavirus jumped to more than 2,000 from 1,430 on Sunday, and the death toll rose to 24 from 20, according to a tally of announcements from officials compiled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp.
Although Ottawa and the provinces have urged Canadians to stay at home, and in some cases put limits on gatherings, Trudeau said too many people were disregarding the advice.
""We've all seen the pictures online of people who seem to think they are invincible. Well, you're not,"" Trudeau said.
""Enough is enough. Go home and stay home ... we're going to make sure this happens, whether by educating people more on the risks or by enforcing the rules if that's needed,"" he told reporters outside his residence, where he has been confined since his wife was diagnosed with the virus.
Ontario premier Doug Ford echoed the complaint, saying it was unacceptable that people returning from winter breaks in Florida and elsewhere were not going into self-isolation for 14 days as required.
Ford spoke after announcing that only food stores, pharmacies and other essential shops could remain open.
""This was a very, very tough decision ... We must get ahead of this virus to beat this virus,"" he told reporters.
Federal and provincial officials said on Sunday that people ignoring advice to self-isolate or avoid large groups could be fined or arrested.
Trudeau is due to speak to the premiers on Monday to coordinate the messaging on self-isolation. All the provinces have imposed some sort of state of emergency.
He also said he would discuss with them what the government could do under the 1988 Emergencies Act, which allows Ottawa to impose strict limits on the movement of people.
Officials said last week the act would be a last resort, but Trudeau reiterated ""we haven't taken anything off the table.""

Legislators are due to return to Ottawa on Tuesday to pass a package of stimulus measures and tax relief to help with the toll of the pandemic worth a total of C$82 billion.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union urged its 27 members on Monday to unblock their borders and allow freight vehicles to cross from one country to another within 15 minutes to ensure the flow of basic supplies and medical equipment.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a video statement that measures introduced to slow the spread of the coronavirus had also slowed and sometimes paralyzed transport, causing delays and risking shortages.
""This weekend we had some crossing points with more than 40 kilometers of queues. This is a waiting time of up to 18 hours. This has to stop,"" she said.
Road transport, which accounts for 75% of freight shipments within the EU, has been particularly hit, notably at the Polish-German frontier after Warsaw's decision to shut its borders to non-Poles, leaving Latvians, Lithuanians and Estonians unable to return home.
German foreign minister Heiko Maas said on Monday many of the problems on that border had since been resolved and queues of traffic were now much shorter.
The EU executive has asked EU countries to designate major crossing points as ""green lane"" border crossings, including for rail, sea and air transport and on waterways.
Passage across such borders, the Commission said, should not exceed 15 minutes, including any checks or health screenings of transport workers. Health screenings should essentially take the form of temperature measurements, it said.
Additional crossings should be opened exclusively for goods transport if those designated become saturated.
The green lanes should be open to vehicles carrying any kind of goods. EU countries should also temporarily suspend any restrictions, such as bans on driving at weekends or during the night.
The Commission also said paperwork for transport workers should be reduced to enable them to cross borders more rapidly. For example, travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine periods should be waived for drivers not showing symptoms.
Drivers would still be expected to respect social distancing measures, such as staying in the cabins of their trucks to avoid social interaction.

The Commission's guidelines also seek close cooperation with Britain, which is in a Brexit transition period, and non-EU countries such as Switzerland and those of the western Balkans.

Footage on social media shows two squad cars cruising down a narrow street in the town of Algaida, lights flashing and sirens blaring, before pulling up to let the occupants spill out onto the road. 
""Do you feel like singing?"" one of the officers shouts, guitar in hand, before bursting into a spirited rendition of the Catalan children's song ""Joan Petit Quan Balla"". 
As his colleagues twirl and clap, residents come to their balconies to join in the festivities, whooping and cheering. 
The sight of the police serenading from ground level, which went viral in Spain and beyond, provides a mirror image of the balcony concerts that have sprung up across Italian and Spanish cities since both countries imposed restrictions on freedom of movement that keep their citizens cooped up inside. 
With just 400 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Monday, the Balearic Islands are one of Spain's least affected regions. However, the crackdown on international travel and widespread flight cancellations will weigh heavily on their tourism-dependent economy. 
As the song draws to a closing crescendo, the singer thanks his audience and leaves them with a final message of encouragement: ""Stay strong.""

As of Monday, Bulgaria had 190 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and three deaths. Like most other European nations, it has shut schools, restaurants and other public venues and imposed a temporary ban on foreign and domestic holiday trips.
President Rumen Radev on Sunday blocked some of the new measures, saying they would create more problems than solutions, and asked parliament to think again.
One of the amendments to the penal code would have imposed a fine of up to 10,000 levs ($5,520) and carried a jail term of up to three years for spreading ""false information"" about an epidemic. Radev said this could erode the right to free speech.
Lawmakers also agreed to remove from the legislation a clause aimed at preventing profiteering by requiring retailers to sell goods at the same prices as before the state of emergency was declared.
Radev had expressed concern that this threatened to block business activity and hinder expected falls in the price of fuel and electricity.
Prime Minister Boyko Borissov's center-right GERB party and its coalition partners have a majority in the parliament, but 118 lawmakers backed Radev's veto, while 14 were opposed and 56 abstained in the 240-member chamber.
It is only the second time that Radev, a former air force commander who was elected head of state more than three years ago, has successfully forced legislation to be amended.
The president has limited powers in Bulgaria and can only veto legislation once.

508,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 23, 2020 11:10AM ET</span>",Former Scottish First Minister Salmond cleared of sex charges,"LONDON (Reuters) - Former Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond, a figurehead of Scotland's independence movement, was cleared on Monday of committing multiple sex offences against nine women after a case that led to divisions in the nationalist movement.
Salmond, 65, was found not guilty by a jury at the High Court in Edinburgh of 12 charges including attempted rape, sexual assault and indecent assault. A charge of sexual assault with intent to rape was found not proven.
Salmond, who led the devolved Scottish government for seven years until 2014 and helped drive growing support for Scottish independence as leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), had denied any wrongdoing.
During the trial he said some of his behaviour had been inappropriate but he had not broken the law.
""Obviously above all I would like to thank my friends and family for standing by me over the last two years,"" an emotional Salmond, widely credited with helping push support for secession to record levels, said outside court.
""Whatever nightmare I've been in over these last two years is as of nothing compared to the nightmare that every single one of us is currently living through,"" he said in reference to the coronavirus crisis.
""People are dying, many more are going to die. God help us all."" 
In 2018, Salmond took legal action against the Scottish devolved government, now led by his successor Nicola Sturgeon, over how it handled a complaints process against him in a sexual harassment case.
He won a judicial review in January last year over how that case was handled by the Scottish government when it conceded it had acted unlawfully in probing the harassment claims.
The case has pitted the two most popular figures in the Scottish independence movement against one another and a dispute has continued to simmer between two factions in the nationalist party.
SNP lawmaker Joanna Cherry said there needed to be an independent inquiry into how the allegations against Salmond were handled by her party.
""Those of us who know him, and indeed many of the thousands of people who have met him over the years, did not recognise the man described in the evidence,"" Cherry said in a statement.
""This verdict of acquittal is the culmination of two very lengthy investigations by the Scottish Government and Police Scotland and two court cases. 

""In both cases, Mr Salmond has been vindicated and serious questions now arise about the background to these cases especially given the considerable sums of public money which have been expended.""

The General Commander of Mozambique's police, Bernardino Rafael, said that the insurgents attacked Mocimboa da Praia and its army barracks before dawn on Monday, wounding dozens of people.
Mocimboa da Praia is about 350 km (220 miles) by road from the city of Pemba in Mozambique's northernmost province of Cabo Delgado and is just south of the Afungi peninsula, where gas projects worth $60 billion are located.
The town was until recently the main airport for workers traveling to the site, until a landing strip was built at Afungi itself, and its port is also used for some cargo deliveries for the projects. 
""Mocimboa da Praia is currently an active combat zone,"" Rafael told reporters at the police headquarters in Maputo.
The army was doing all it could to restore security and warning people to stay away, he said. 
The insurgents started staging attacks in Cabo Delgado in 2017, threatening security in a nation set to become a global gas exporter following one of the biggest gas finds in a decade offshore of the province. 
Little is known about the insurgents, though initial attacks were claimed by a group known as Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jama. More recently, Islamic State has claimed a number of attacks.
More than 900 people have been reported killed in the province since 2017, according to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, an NGO. 
The frequency of attacks has been increasing, leaving some analysts concerned that the insurgency could be a growing threat and that it could cause disrupt the projects. 
Alexandre Raymakers, Senior Africa Analyst at global risk consultancy Verisk (NASDAQ:VRSK) Maplecroft, said the attack highlighted serious gaps in security and raised questions about Mozambique's ability to defend the developments. 
While Raymakers said the LNG infrastructure and personnel will remain ""aspirational targets"" for now, the insurgents will likely be emboldened by their successes and seek to increase the tempo of their operations. 
Exxon and Total did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The Czech customs impounded 700,000 facemasks and respirators on Tuesday, saying the shipment had been ordered by Czech medical authorities but an unnamed intermediary had demanded to hike the price. 
Later it emerged that part of the shipment - 101,600 facemasks - was a gift by the Red Cross in the eastern Chinese city of Qingtian to the Chinese community in Italy, Czech government officials said.
The Czechs expressed regret and promised to send a replacement for the confiscated material from China, adding a few thousand more, to be shipped by an evacuation bus for 43 Italians heading home.

KUTA, Indonesia (Reuters) - Travelers (NYSE:TRV) stranded by coronavirus in some of Southeast Asia's idyllic tourism hotspots are trying to extend visas as more countries enforce travel restrictions that in some cases make it impossible to go home.
The total number of stranded tourists is not known, but scenes of frustration are playing out in several countries.
On the Indonesian resort island of Bali - famed for its beaches, terraced rice fields and cultural sites - hundreds of tourists in face masks queued up outside the Ngurah Rai Immigration Office in the tourist area of Kuta seeking legal permission to extend their stay.
""We have to stay here as we have no choice,"" said Natalie Gisbert, a traveler from New Caledonia, the self-governing French territory in the South Pacific, who said her government was closing airports at home.
American visitor Felix Isuk, who works in Singapore, said he thought it was better to stay put in Southeast Asia than to return to the United States. 
""In the U.S. there are about 30,000 cases,"" Isuk said. ""So, I think if things or situation get worse here I'll go back to Singapore. So that's the main reason why I'm staying here in Indonesia.""
Indonesia has 579 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus that has swept the world, with 49 dead. The island of Bali has reported six of those confirmed cases and two of those deaths.
""A LITTLE BIT CRAZY""
In Thailand, the main immigration center in the capital Bangkok was crowded on Monday with hundreds of tourists and other foreign nationals trying to extend visas before they expired.
""I've been here since 8.30 a.m.!"" one man cried on being told officials could not process his application that afternoon. 
A long line snaked through the building, and many were told to come back another day.
The problems are by no means confined to Bangkok.
Rada Sereseanu and her husband, touring Southeast Asia in a camper van, had planned to drive into Myanmar but the German couple find themselves stuck in southern Thailand as the country shuts its land borders.
""We thought the situation would get better, but it seems to be getting a little bit crazy,"" Sereseanu said by telephone from near the seaside area of Hua Hin.
Thailand has seen sharp spikes in coronavirus cases, bringing its total number of cases to 721 from 147 in the last week.

Many British people venerate the National Health Service and the free care it provides. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned on Sunday that NHS could be ""overwhelmed"" by the coronavirus in just two weeks.

Bolsonaro stepped up his attacks on the governors in a Sunday night television interview, calling them ""job killers"" for ordering stores closed in an effort to slow the outbreak.
""This is a crisis much worse than what the coronavirus has caused in Brazil,"" the president told TV Record.
Brazilians, however, are giving the governors higher marks, according to a Datalfolha poll that found 54% of those polled rated governors' response to the pandemic as ""great"" or ""good"" while only 34% thought the same of the president.
Health Minister Luis Henrique Mandetta, who has contradicted Bolsonaro on the need to restrict public meetings, was also better rated than the president, with 55% seeing his work as ""great"" or ""good.""
The poll said 15% of those polled who voted for Bolsonaro in 2018 are regretting their decision. And 68% disapproved of Bolsonaro shaking hands with supporters outside the presidential palace on March 15, Datafolha said, when he was meant to be in isolation for suspicion of having the virus.
Coronavirus has been spreading fast in Brazil, with health ministry statistics showing 1,546 confirmed cases by Sunday, up from 234 cases a week before. The COVID-19 respiratory disease caused by the virus has killed 25 people, the ministry said.
In response, many of Brazil's states have closed shopping malls and schools, banned public meetings, soccer games and religious assemblies, while the biggest city Sao Paulo has begun a lockdown.
Despite his comments on the ""catastrophic"" impact the epidemic can have on the economy, Bolsonaro's government issued a decree on Monday allowing employers to suspend contracted employees for up to four months with no pay but not fire them. 
Companies will have to maintain health plans, and can negotiate a monthly compensation individually with workers, the decree published in the official government gazette said.

Datafolha polled 1,558 by telephone between March 18-20. The poll's margin of error is 3 percentage points up or down.

MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Moscow rebels amid fighting in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard. Russia has denied any involvement. 
The defendants - Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko - held senior posts in pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine in 2014, according to prosecutors. They face preliminary charges of murder and of causing an aircraft to crash. 
Prosecutors say the four men helped to arrange the Russian missile system used to shoot down MH17, a civilian aircraft, killing all onboard. Most of those killed were Dutch.
Pulatov did not appear in person but sent lawyers to represent him and they have told the court their client was not in any way involved in the crash. The other defendants are being tried in absentia. 
Pulatov's lawyers argued at the opening of the case on March 9 that they needed more time to read through all the court documents. On Monday, the Dutch judges agreed with them. 
""The court suspends the examination of the Pulatov case until June 8th, 10 a.m., and the defense will be able to speak at that time,"" presiding judge Hendrik Steenhuis said.
He said that meant the cases against the other three defendants, which are being tried simultaneously, would therefore also be suspended until that time.

Mithat Sancar told reporters security forces had besieged municipality buildings in the southeastern province of Batman, as well as those in the Egil, Silvan, Lice and Ergani districts of Diyarbakir province on Monday morning.
He said five co-mayors in four municipalities were detained. He did not give details about the mayor of Lice but said another co-mayor who had previously been dismissed was also being held.
President Tayyip Erdogan and his government accuse the HDP of having links to the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militant group, leading to prosecutions of thousands of its members and some leaders. The HDP denies such links.
The HDP appoints one male and one female as mayor to promote gender-equality, calling them co-mayors, although only one is recognized by the central government.
Sancar said the measures on Monday morning were similar to those taken when Ankara appointed trustees in other municipalities, adding that the party had not received official notification from the central government.
""We reject with hatred this vile attempt that does not shy away from showing enmity against Kurds even in these difficult days when the whole world is battling an epidemic,"" he said.
The Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Ankara has appointed trustees to 31 municipalities won by the HDP in March 2019 local elections, an HDP source said, adding that 21 co-mayors had been formally arrested so far, in addition to the six detained on Monday.
The former co-leaders of the HDP have both been jailed since 2016 on terrorism charges, with several other prominent members accused of supporting terrorism over what the government says are links to the PKK.

Kenya bought $23.2 million worth of frozen fish from China in 2018, according to the International Trade Center, almost all of its fish imports. Fishermen have long complained that the cheap imports were strangling local trade. 
The coronavirus has slowed Chinese imports. Nervous customers have turned to local fish. But Kenya will soon face shortages unless imports from China resume; it produces just over a third of what it consumes.
Kenyan fishermen like 38-year-old Maurice Misodhi, whose skin has been weathered by the sun and wind during two decades on the water, have had a bumper month. Based at Dunga Beach in Kisumu, customers want every fish he catches. 
Misodhi says the Chinese lockdown seemed to have dried up imports of cheaper Chinese fish. 
""As fishermen we can now smile, not because people are suffering from coronavirus, but because we can now sell our fish, and at a good price,"" he said.
The price of a kilo of Nile perch - 250 shillings ($2.50) a month ago - has shot up to 350 shillings.
Fish trader Mary Didi usually buys from Chinese suppliers but has now turned to Misodhi.
""The supply at the Chinese importers has gone down, and many of my customers were also scared of the Chinese fish, thinking they would contract the virus,"" she said. ""To keep the business running, I had to turn to fish from the lake."" 
Bob Otieno, chairman of Dunga Beach Management Unit, says sales have shot up. The beach registers a catch of between 1 and 1.5 tonnes of fish each day and sales have gone up from 50% of the catch to 90% in the last two weeks. Previously, fishermen would eat, barter or give away around half their catch. 
""We used to have many fishermen sell their catch at low prices because of competition from the Chinese fish,"" he said. 
Kenya produces 180,000 tonnes per year but consumes about 500,000 tonnes, according to 2019 government figures.
Christine Adhiambo, the government's assistant director of fisheries for the lake region, said the two biggest importers of Chinese fish had not shipped from China since November and were running down stocks. Kenya could face shortages soon, she said. 

""Kenya cannot satisfy its local fish demand,"" she said. ""That is why we heavily rely on supplements from China.""

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - For many in Santiago's Plaza Italia, ground zero for mass protests in Chile that have raged for months, the chaos seemed never to end. Bloody clashes with police forces, tear gas, hooded vandals, broken windows and graffiti were a daily event.
Then coronavirus hit.
The city of 6 million's central square, dubbed ""Plaza Dignity"" by throngs of angry protesters who dutifully gather here most evenings and weekends, has fallen silent. On Friday and Saturday evening, the few remaining demonstrators were repeatedly shouted down by drivers in passing vehicles who yelled at them to go home.
""First we need to stay alive, then we keep trying to change the world,"" said Enrique Cruz, a street vendor who said he supported the cause but recognized it was time to put it on hold. 
Though Chile has yet to declare a full lockdown, authorities shut bars, discos and restaurants last week. On Sunday, a night-time curfew took effect. 
Cases of coronavirus in Chile have surpassed 600 on the 20th day of the outbreak, seemingly overnight trumping talk of ailing pensions, piddling salaries and the high cost of public transport that have recently dominated discourse.
Few police patrolled the plaza last Friday night, the weekday evening that had in the past seen the largest and most violent protests. 
A handful of demonstrators huddled around a monument to Chilean war hero Manuel Baquedano, in the center of the plaza. Some wore hoods over their faces, others had swapped to surgical masks.
""We knew few people would come out, but we're still here,"" said José Miguel, a 37-year-old protester.
Chile's protests began in October over a hike in metro fares. In the months that followed, riots reeked havoc across the country, devastating the economy, sowing billions of dollars in damages and leading to thousands of arrests and injuries.
Protesters won a major concession late in 2019, when lawmakers agreed to hold a referendum on whether to draft a new constitution. 

The vote, originally slated for April 26, was rescheduled earlier this week for Oct. 25 as coronavirus fears took hold and upended priorities.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain sent in the army to deliver protective equipment to hospitals on Monday and told people to stay at home and heed warnings over social distancing or the government would bring in more extreme measures to stop the coronavirus spread.
With some doctors saying they felt like ""cannon fodder"", the government said the military would help ship millions of items of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks to healthcare workers who have complained of shortages.
So far, 281 Britons have died from coronavirus and, in the last few days, British authorities have rapidly stepped up action to try to limit the spread of the disease and prevent a repeat of the death toll seen in other countries where thousands have died.
However, there have been complaints from frontline medical staff about shortages of kit, saying they did not feel safe at work. In a letter pleading with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to increase PPE supplies, more than 6,000 frontline doctors said they were being asked to put their lives at risk with out-of-date masks, and low stocks of equipment.
Health Secretary Matt Hancock admitted there had been issues but promised action was being taken. He said the army would drive trucks throughout the day and night to get supplies to medical staff.
""It's like a war effort, it is a war against this virus and so the army have been incredibly helpful in getting those logistics so we can get the supplies to protect people on the front line,"" he told the BBC, saying the health service now had 12,000 ventilators, 7,000 more than at the start of the crisis.
Britain has brought in a series of measures to try to curb the spread of the virus. 
On Monday, a much-reduced rail service was introduced and jury trials were suspended, coming days after Johnson advised Britons to work from home if possible and ordered the closure of pubs, gyms and leisure centers.
ADVICE IGNORED
But advice to stay at home and avoid social gatherings went unheeded by millions at the weekend who took advantage of sunny weather to flocked to parks and beauty spots over the weekend, ignoring instructions to stay 2 meters (6 feet) apart. 
Emyr Williams (NYSE:WMB), chief executive of the Snowdonia National Park Authority in Wales, said the past 24 hours had been unprecedented.
""We have experienced the busiest visitor day in living memory. The area has been overwhelmed with visitors,"" he said.
The government warned that Britain would face a shutdown with curfews and travel restrictions if people continued to flout the advice.
""Well, we're perfectly prepared to do that if we need to because the objective here is really clear which is to stop the spread of the virus. Of course we will enforce and bring in further strong measures if we need to,"" Hancock told Sky News.
The government was also pondering whether to close all non-essential retail shops, the BBC's political editor reported. 
Some firms have already acted because of slowing demand, with clothing retailer Primark and department store John Lewis saying on Monday they would temporarily close all of their shops. 

It comes as Britain opened the first part of a 330 billion pound ($384 billion) loan guarantee scheme for businesses , which will help small and medium-sized firms borrow up to 5 million pounds to deal with coronavirus stoppages.

But temporary shelters being set up in the capital Manila are making life a little easier for those whose presence on the streets is in breach of coronavirus lockdown measures, putting them at risk of arrest.
Tents have since last week been set up at one shelter in a Manila gymnasium, where people wearing cloth masks napped on mats or read books, fanning themselves with sheets of cardboard. 
Not all those were permanently on the streets. Some had traveled from the countryside in search of work, but got stranded when the authorities shut down the capital, a city of at least 13 million people.
Social workers said the conditions were far better than on the streets.
""They are given meals three times a day regularly,"" said social worker Lourdes Penalosa.
""We have a good supply of diapers for babies and sanitary napkins for the women. They are also allowed to bathe every morning."" 
The Philippines has reported 462 cases of coronavirus and 33 deaths, but health authorities are concerned that the number of infections could be far greater, with only a limited number of tests carried out. 
Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte is seeking emergency powers to allow him to redistribute funds and order private and state-run businesses to help the fight against the spread.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union can start membership negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia, according to a draft decision by the bloc's 27 member states seen by Reuters on Monday and due to be finalised this week.
If approved as expected, the agreement would end two years of delays and signal new momentum for all six Western Balkan countries - Serbia, Kosovo, Montenegro, Albania, Bosnia and North Macedonia - seeking to join the EU.
North Macedonia and Albania had seen their hopes dashed last year as France and the Netherlands sounded scepticism over their track records on democracy and fighting corruption, fearful of allowing new members in at a time when the EU's cohesion was already damaged by Britain's departure from the bloc. 
But Paris and The Hague eased their objections last month and the plans to allow talks to start have gained momentum despite the coronavirus crisis, with Brussels eager to show its determination to bring the Balkans into the EU fold. 
""I don't think what is happening (with coronavirus) is going to alter the decision of the member states,"" EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell told reporters on Friday.
Borrell said he also telephoned Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic to reassure him of the EU's support after Vucic praised China for its help in fighting coronavirus in Serbia and questioned European solidarity. 
Greece was still not on board before the weekend with the decision, which requires unanimity of all EU members. But diplomatic sources said Athens has given its approval after the latest draft included stronger language on protecting Greek and other national minorities in Albania. 
If no country objects, the decision is expected to be formally adopted by the 27 EU members' Europe ministers at mid-week - in writing this time as face-to-face meetings have been suspended due to coronavirus risks - the sources added. 
French President Emmanuel Macron, who blocked the opening of talks with Skopje and Tirana in October, said in February he was willing to allow them to begin membership talks if the European Commission gave them a positive review and changed the way it admits new countries.
Brussels duly did, with a reform of the enlargement process presented in February, which France welcomed. 
EU governments, not just the EU Commission, now have more say over the process, ensuring hopefuls meet targets in economic, judicial and other reforms, and can reset the process if Balkan governments do not step up.

Unless postponed by the coronavirus outbreak, EU and Balkan leaders are due to hold a summit in Zagreb in May in a show of support for the six countries of the region.

Governor Yuriko Koike said the next three weeks were critical for whether Tokyo would see an ""overshoot"" - an explosive rise - in virus cases.
""It is possible that depending on developments, we may need to take strong measures such as a so-called lockdown of the city,"" Koike told a news conference.
""We must, in any case, avoid that. Therefore, I want to ask all of the people of Tokyo for your further cooperation.""
Warning that the virus could spread from young people to the elderly and others at risk of serious illness, she urged all residents to have a shared sense of crisis.
Koike said she agreed with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe that the postponement of the Olympic Games, due to open in Tokyo on July 24, would not be ruled out but added that their cancellation was unthinkable.

Tokyo has had 138 coronavirus cases including four deaths as of late Sunday. At the current rate of spread, the number is expected grow by 530 through April 8, according to experts advising the city.

New projects will be encouraged to use existing tailings dams, while relevant departments were asked to tighten their environmental and safety regulations for new mines, it said in its notice late on Friday. 
The ministry also asked local governments to cap the number of existing tailings dams within their region, possibly closing older ones if a new tailings dam was needed for mines considered ""strategic"" or critical to filling a supply shortage. 
The Ministry of Emergency Management also said it would work to gradually reduce the number of current tailings dams. Tailings dams that have been out of service for over three years or that have been abandoned must be shut down within a year. 
Local governments should also disclose the details of the tailings dams in their regions on their websites or local mainstream media at the beginning of each year, and companies should establish proper emergency response procedures in case of dam failures, the ministry said. 
The ministry also prohibited new tailings dams from being higher than 200 meters, within 1 km of residential areas or important facilities, or 3 km from the Yangtze or Yellow rivers. 
Tailings dams are the most common waste disposal methods for mining firms, whether they are extracting iron ore, copper or gold. They can tower dozens of meters high and stretch for several kilometers. 
China tops the world with nearly 8,000 tailings dams. It has been working on revising its guidelines for tailings dams since a dam failure last year at a Vale SA iron ore mine that killed more than 240 people in Brazil.

A culture of power abuse and impunity within the military came under the spotlight last month when a Thai soldier went on a shooting rampage killing 29 people, triggered by a dispute over a housing deal involving his superior officer.
The report outlined other abuses including incidents where commanders forced conscripts to jump into septic tanks or to eat ""like dogs"", using their mouths and not their hands.
It also described sexual humiliation where conscripts were forced by superiors to hold one another's penises.
""Abuses of new conscripts in the Thai military have long been an open secret. What our research shows is that such maltreatment is not the exception but the rule, and deliberately hushed within the military,"" said Clare Algar, Amnesty International's senior director for research, advocacy and policy.
A military spokesman said he had not reviewed the Amnesty report but that past abuses had been addressed.
""We are taking the issue of abuses seriously and any commander implicated will be transferred, face disciplinary action and criminal charges too,"" Defence Ministry spokesman Lieutenant General Kongcheep Tantrawanit said.
""In the past two to three years there have been very few cases, so some of the cases people talk about are maybe old information.""
Military service is compulsory in Thailand and each year, thousands of men over 21 take part in a recruitment lottery.
Speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, a 24-year-old former conscript described a punishment he once got after his drill sergeant caught him smoking.
""He made me crawl through a dirty ditch then later forced me into a ... position where I have to put my head and feet on the ground while raising my bottom up with hands behind my back,"" he said.
""Then the sergeant told 10 other conscript to hit me hard with broom sticks,"" he said.
About half of the 350,000-strong Royal Thai Armed Forces is made up of conscripts. 
While traditionally treated with deference, the military has faced criticism since seizing power in 2014, the 12th successful coup since 1932.

The army gave up direct rule last year, though the former coup leader remains prime minister after a disputed election.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain brought in the army on Monday to help deliver supplies of protective equipment to healthcare workers after doctors said they felt like ""cannon fodder"" and pleaded with the government to provide the right kit.
The distribution and delivery of millions of items of personal protective equipment (PPE) including masks will now be carried out by the army who will drive trucks throughout the day and night, health minister Matt Hancock said in a statement. 
Millions more items have been provided to hospitals, ambulance trust, GP practices, care homes and other health services in the last few days, he added, after complaints emerged from medical staff that they did not have enough kit.
In a letter pleading with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to increase PPE supplies, over 6,000 frontline doctors said they were being asked to put their lives at risk with out-of-date masks, and low stocks of equipment.
""We want to see action immediately,"" the letter in The Sunday Times said, adding that it was very upsetting to hear healthcare professionals say they felt like ""cannon fodder"". 
Hancock admitted to the BBC that there had been ""challenges"" and said that the authorities were trying to ""solve"" those problems.
Protective kit from the national stockpile reserved for pandemic influenza had now been released said the joint statement from the department of health and National Health Service on Monday. 
They said that supply of protective equipment was rising. 
""We are taking urgent action to ensure dedicated frontline NHS and social care staff – who are working tirelessly to tackle this outbreak – feel supported. Today they are getting millions more PPE kits as part of that promise,"" Hancock said. 
There was now enough supply of PPE available, added the statement, but acknowledged that there could be challenges in future due to unprecedented global demand plus the fact that most kit is made in China, where coronavirus hit production. 

""The NHS is working closely with the government, NHS Supply Chain and industry to continue to secure additional supplies,"" the authorities said in a statement.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia's capital Jakarta shut cinemas and other public entertainment on Monday at the start of a two-week emergency period to try to slow the accelerating spread of the coronavirus in Southeast Asia's biggest city. 
The new measures, which include urging people to work from home, still fall short of the tougher lockdowns imposed by neighbors amid concerns among some experts that the archipelago of 260 million people is not doing enough to contain the virus.
National police spokesman Muhammad Iqbal said 465,000 police across Indonesia would disperse any public gatherings ""for the sake of public safety"" though a photograph posted on social media of a packed commuter train in Jakarta quickly went viral.
President Joko Widodo on Monday offered his condolences after a medical association said six doctors and nurses had died after contracting the virus.
""I would like to thank them for their hard work, for their dedication in dealing with COVID-19,"" said Widodo, speaking at the opening of an emergency hospital on the site of the “Athlete’s Village” built for the 2018 Asian Games in Jakarta.
Indonesia has confirmed 514 cases of the virus and 48 deaths, mainly concentrated in Jakarta, whose governor on Friday admitted medical staff were already getting over-stretched.
Widodo said doctors and other medical staff would receive bonuses ranging from 5 million rupiah to 15 million rupiah ($300-$900) per month in regions that have declared an emergency. Aside from Jakarta, the East Java region has also declared an emergency. 
The president has so far resisted calls for tougher lockdowns due to concerns about the impact on businesses and the poor, many of whom are vendors plying their trade on the streets. 
The normally traffic-clogged streets of the city of 10 million were far quieter than usual on Monday and student volunteers at a crossing on a major road held up signs urging people to avoid crowds and stay home.
But Rocky Margiano Simanjuntak, 23, posted a photograph on social media from inside a packed early morning train on his way to work in the city at a bank.
""Government policies seem to be only half measures, just an appeal,"" Simanjuntak told Reuters via a message on his Instagram account, adding that public transport should not be limited unless authorities enforced rules to make people stay at home.

The commuter train company in a statement promised to return to normal operations to alleviate such crushes, but urged passengers to stay home.

MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippine Congress held a special session over the internet on Monday to debate a push by the country's strongman leader to adopt sweeping emergency powers, in a bid to avert chaos from a rapid spread of coronavirus.
With borders closed to foreigners and tens of millions of people on home quarantine, President Rodrigo Duterte wants the power to - where necessary - control supplies and public utilities, order businesses to help government, and pull funds from state enterprises and departmental budgets to redirect into emergency health needs.
If approved, the granting of the powers would be one of the most aggressive steps to tackle coronavirus as governments worldwide roll out stricter measures, including across Southeast Asia, which saw a more than doubling of cases in the past week to nearly 3,700, from 166 a month ago.
The Philippines has confirmed 396 cases and 33 deaths, but health officials acknowledge limited testing for the coronavirus means its already overstretched health system could be facing far more infections than the numbers indicate. 
""It is a step we were reluctant to take, but the circumstances and the experience of nations worldwide convinced us that we have no other choice,"" Duterte's Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea told a near-empty Congress, with most lawmakers streaming the session at home.
The Philippines was the first Southeast Asian country to adopt lockdown measures, but more are following suit as cases soar, with Vietnam and Malaysia deploying soldiers to help with quarantines or to enforce curbs on travel and gatherings.
Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, has joined Thailand and Cambodia in shutting bars, cinemas and public entertainment venues. 
A draft of Duterte's bill seen by Reuters seeks a ""unified national policy"" that would, if required, allow the government to temporarily take control of private utilities, telecoms and transport operators or businesses in the public interest, and force hotels, venues and rental properties to accommodate medical workers or quarantine facilities.
It could also control roads, prices, supplies and distribution of power, fuel and goods like food, water, cleaning products, clothing and medical supplies, imported or made domestically. 
It would also grant the treasury the ability to take back departmental funds to spend on critical or essential services. 
Duterte's has a supermajority in both chambers, so the bill is expected to pass, although the opposition is concerned about the scope of the powers and potential for abuse.
The government is playing down the extent of the powers that Duterte would have, wary of public unease over emergency decrees and draconian measures dating back to the 1970s, under the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos.

Medialdea said the measures would be rescinded when the virus was managed and many would be ""standby powers"" for if a crisis erupted and ""our most critical institutions are nearing a total shutdown"".

TORONTO/TOKYO (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee has decided to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games because of the coronavirus pandemic, IOC member Dick Pound said on Monday, as a window slowly began to open that would allow the showcase to be staged next year.
Major sporting nations Australia and Canada withdrew on Monday as organisers came under global pressure to postpone the event for the first time in its 124-year modern history.
Pound told Reuters that a one-year postponement looked like the best solution. This would mean the Games, scheduled for July 24-Aug. 9, are likely to be held in the summer of 2021.
""That's my conclusion (there will be a postponement),"" Pound said in a telephone interview, after Sunday's IOC statement saying it was stepping up its ""scenario planning"" for the Tokyo 2020 Games -- including a possible postponement.
""From reading IOC-speak in the communique, if you are going to cancel you simply cancel because there are no future plans,"" added Pound.
""But if you are going to carry on with the original objective (to stage the Games) there is no reason to issue a statement because you have already done that over the past several weeks.""
Japan and the IOC have said calling off the Games entirely is not an option. But finding a new date could be complicated as the summer 2021 calendar is already crowded, while 2022 will see the soccer World Cup and the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Pound said a large number of stakeholders from the organising committee, to athletes to broadcasters and sporting federations would all need to be consulted before a plan could be finalised but there were early signs of a willingness to accommodate a 2021 Summer Games.
World Athletics said on Monday they would be willing to move their 2021 world championships scheduled for Aug. 6-15 in Eugene, Oregon to clear a path for a 2021 Olympics. 
""World Athletics has already been in discussion with the Oregon 21 Organising Committee regarding the possibility the Olympic Games may move to next year and they in turn have held discussions with their key stakeholders and have reassured us they will work with all of their partners and stakeholders to ensure that Oregon is able to host the World Athletics Championships on alternative dates should that prove necessary,” athletics' global governing body said in a statement.
BALANCE TIPPING
An Olympics postponement would be a blow for host country Japan, which has pumped in more than $12 billion of investment, and huge sums are also at stake for sponsors and broadcasters. 
But a groundswell of concern from athletes - already struggling to train as gyms, stadiums and swimming pools close around the world - appeared to be tipping the balance, along with the cancellation of other major sports events. 
More than 337,000 people have been infected by the novel coronavirus worldwide and over 14,600 have died in a pandemic that the World Health Organisation said was accelerating.
The IOC and the Japanese government have both edged back from weeks of insistence that the Games would go ahead, announcing a month-long consultation.
The Olympics have never before been delayed, though they were cancelled altogether in 1916, 1940 and 1944 during the two world wars, and major Cold War boycotts disrupted the Moscow and Los Angeles Games in 1980 and 1984 respectively. 
""The moment the IOC indicates that it is thinking about other solutions, it has already decided to delay the Games,"" said French Olympic Committee president Denis Masseglia.
Canada and Australia both bluntly said they would not participate if the Games were not put back to 2021 and Britain may have followed suit. 
""We are in the midst of a global health crisis that is far more significant than sport,"" Canada's Olympic Committee and Paralympic Committee said in a statement.
A raft of other nations and sports bodies piled pressure on the IOC to make a quick decision.
Athletes were sad but broadly supported a delay.
""The right choice was made, but it doesn't make it any easier,"" said Canadian world champion swimmer Maggie MacNeil, who was hoping to make her Olympic debut in Tokyo. 
""Sometimes you just need a good hug.""
THE TIDE TURNS
Japanese authorities seemed to be bowing to the inevitable, despite the losses and logistics headaches it would entail.
""We may have no option but to consider postponing,"" Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who was hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending, told parliament.
The organising committee is already scaling back the torch relay to avoid crowds, national broadcaster NHK said. 
Japanese sponsors, from Toyota Motor Corp to Panasonic Corp, were watching nervously. But Tokyo stocks sensitive to the success of the Olympics surged on Monday, after sharp falls in prior weeks, thanks to expectations of a delay rather than a cancellation.
Ad agency Dentsu Group's shares jumped 12%.
Pound told Reuters the IOC had tried to hold fire in order to be able to present the hosts, sports federations and sponsors with a clear alternative plan.

""Probably what turned the tide in the last couple of days is the curve on the COVID-19 virus. It is getting very, very steep now and this is clearly not something that is going to be under control by June or July and probably not by the end of the year.""

536,By Bloomberg,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 10:33PM ET</span>",New Zealand Going Into Nationwide Isolation to Battle Virus,"(Bloomberg) -- New Zealand will go into a nationwide lockdown within two days as the government takes radical steps to limit the spread of coronavirus.
Every household will be required to go into self-isolation, all non-essential businesses will close and schools will be shut, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Monday in Wellington. The measures, which will remain in place for at least four weeks, are aimed at breaking the chain of community transmission, she said. Without them, her advice is that tens of thousands of lives will be at risk and health services would be inundated.
“These decisions will place the most significant restriction on New Zealanders’ movements in modern history,” Ardern said. “This is not a decision taken lightly. But this is our best chance to slow the virus and to save lives.”
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New Zealand jumped by 36 to 102 today, the Ministry of Health said. There are two cases that can’t be traced to travel and are assumed to be the first evidence of community transmission. The government’s steps to prevent the spread of the virus come as the central bank announced it will launch a large-scale asset purchase program to cushion the economic impact of the crisis.
The nation’s top-50 share index plunged 10% Monday, extending its decline since Feb. 21 to more than 30%.
Appearing with Ardern, Finance Minister Grant Robertson unveiled a range of new economic stimulus measures.
He said the government will expand its wage subsidy scheme to all affected businesses, lifting the cost to NZ$9.3 billion ($5.2 billion) from NZ$5.1 billion, to ensure all workers receive some form of income during the lockdown. Other measures include a freeze on rent increases and leveraging the Crown balance sheet to allow banks to extend lending to firms.
The government, the Reserve Bank and retail banks have also agreed in principle to significant support for mortgage holders, with details to be finalized, Robertson said.
Ardern said supermarkets, doctors, pharmacies, service stations and access to essential banking services will all remain available throughout New Zealand.
“If you do not have immediate needs, do not go to the supermarket,” she said. “It will be there for you today, tomorrow, and the day after that. We must give time for supermarkets to restock their shelves, there will be enough for everyone if we shop normally.”
However, over the next 48 hours all non-essential businesses in New Zealand must close. All bars, restaurants, cafes, gyms, cinemas, pools, museums, libraries, playgrounds and any other place where the public congregate must close their face-to-face function, Ardern said. No indoor or outdoor events can proceed.
“In short: we are all now preparing to go into self isolation as a nation,” she said. “If community transmission takes off in New Zealand the number of cases will double every five days. If that happens unchecked, our health system will be inundated, and tens of thousands New Zealanders will die.”
The government raised its virus alert system to three from two and said it will be lifted to four, the top level, in 48 hours.

538,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 07:55PM ET</span>",Coronavirus pandemic prompts rare questioning of Thai monarchy,"BANGKOK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic led to a rare surge of online posts in Thailand questioning the monarchy on Sunday and a government minister subsequently warned that inappropriate posts could lead to jail.
Insulting the monarchy is a crime, punishable by up to 15 years in prison.
A Thai-language hashtag that translates to #whydoweneedaking? was one of the top trending topics on Twitter in Thailand after an overseas Thai activist posted about King Maha Vajiralongkorn continuing to travel in Germany during the coronavirus crisis.
King Vajiralongkorn, 67, who was crowned last year, has a second home in Germany. He spends much of his time outside Thailand.
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in Thailand has risen 14-fold during March to 599 cases, the second highest-number in Southeast Asia after Malaysia, according to official data announced by national health authorities. One person has died.
The hashtag questioning the monarchy was used more than 1.2 million times in 24 hours by Sunday, according to data on Twitter based on hashtags trending for users in Thailand.
Thailand's Royal Palace did not respond to requests for comment on the posts.
On Twitter, Minister of Digital Economy and Society Puttipong Punnakanta posted a warning to citizens against breaking laws on online content, accompanied by an image of a handcuffed hand above a keyboard.
""I'd rather not comment,"" he told Reuters when asked whether his March 22 post was related to those about the monarchy.
""I didn't specify what this was about - this is a general reminder. We follow all issues, like fake news,"" he said. ""We are monitoring regularly as much as we can. We respect self-expression but if it causes damage, we will exercise the law.""
When asked whether the government would take action over the posts, government spokeswoman Narumon Pinyosinwat said the situation was being monitored, but any government action would depend on consultations with security agencies.
Among the first to use the hashtag was prominent Thai exile Somsak Jeamteerasakul, who posted on Saturday that the king was travelling in Germany while Thailand was dealing with the coronavirus outbreak. Reuters was unable to verify where the king had traveled during this period.
Thailand was the first country outside China to record a case of the virus in January, but reported only 42 infections before the start of March, according to statements from the Ministry of Public Health.
As cases have surged, more stringent control measures have been imposed. Those include requirements that anyone travelling from outside the country, including Thai citizens, needs special travel papers to fly to the country. 
The tourist industry that accounted for more than a tenth of gross domestic product has suffered heavily.
Provincial authorities announced on Saturday that the capital Bangkok will close malls for 22 days although supermarkets will be allowed to remain open. Bars in the city will remain closed for that period, as will schools. Other Thai provinces are increasingly applying restrictions.
Thailand has been a constitutional monarchy since a 1932 revolution ended absolute royal rule, but the monarchy remains a central part of traditional Thai culture. Some Thais consider the king to be semi-divine.
Open disparagement of the monarchy has been rare, but in the past year other Twitter criticism has included a #royalmotorcade hashtag about traffic jams caused by members of the royal family.
The king later ordered police to limit roadblocks for motorcades.

541,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 07:10PM ET</span>","Biden to start considering running mates, consulted Obama","By Trevor Hunnicutt
(Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Joe Biden said on Sunday he needed to start vetting possible running mates ""in a matter of weeks"" and that he discussed the pick with former President Barack Obama.
Biden's vice presidential options will include at least six or seven women who will be subjected to background checks to ensure there will not ""be any snafu,"" he told donors at a fundraising event held by telephone.
""I have to start that vetting process relatively soon, meaning in a matter of weeks,"" he said. ""I think there will be a group that is in excess of six or seven people who I'll look at.""
Biden said at a Democratic debate last week that he would pick a woman for the job, a qualification he reiterated on Sunday.
Biden also emphasized that the woman would have to agree with his fundamental view on policies, including healthcare, education and the need for expansive U.S. influence in the world. He said he shared that kind of common ground with Obama - whom he served as vice president - although they sometimes differed on tactics.
Above all, the person would need to be qualified to serve as president immediately.
""I've actually talked to Barack about this - the most important thing is that it has to be someone who, the day after they're picked, is prepared to be president of the United States of America if something happened,"" said Biden, 77.
Biden holds a strong lead over Senator Bernie Sanders, his lone remaining rival for the party's nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in November's election. 
Sidelined from campaigning in public because of the coronavirus crisis that has put nearly one in three Americans under orders to stay at home, Biden said he would start broadcasting on Monday morning from his home in Delaware.
Those briefings will give Biden a way to offer an alternative to the daily news conferences on the coronavirus held by Trump, whose disaster response Biden has criticized.
Biden added that the election should move forward as scheduled amid concerns the coronavirus may not be fully contained by November. A number of states have already pushed back presidential nominating contests because of the outbreak.
""I know there's a lot of rumors and speculation as to, is the other guy going to try to postpone the election in November and all that. There's no need to do that,"" Biden said. ""You know, we voted in the middle of the Civil War, we voted in the middle of World War One and Two.

""The idea of postponing the electoral process seems to me out of the question.""

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban and the Afghan government held a ""virtual"" meeting on prisoner releases on Sunday, officials said, offering some hope of a breakthrough on a matter that has deadlocked the two sides and threatened a nascent peace process.
The two sides have differed on the release of prisoners - the Afghan government wanting a phased and conditional release and the Taliban wanting all prisoners released in one go as envisaged in an agreement signed with the United States in Doha last month.
The impasse threatened to derail a carefully negotiated peace process outlined in the agreement, including a pullout of foreign forces from Afghanistan after over 18 years of fighting.
The two sides spoke for over two hours in a Skype meeting facilitated by the United States and Qatar, officials said.
""Prisoner releases by both sides is an important step in the peace process, as stated in the U.S.-Taliban agreement,"" U.S. special representative Zalmay Khalilzad tweeted.
""Everyone clearly understands the coronavirus threat makes prisoner releases that much more urgent,"" he said, adding that ""all sides conveyed their strong commitment to a reduction of violence, intra-Afghan negotiations, and a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire"".
The Taliban had previously refused to speak to the Afghan government until all prisoners were released.
""Both sides exchanged options on initial technical steps for the release of prisoners,"" an Afghanistan National Security Council statement said, adding that a reduction in violence, direct talks as well as a permanent ceasefire were also discussed.
The Afghan government and Taliban have clashed frequently in the last few days, including the storming of an Afghan military base on Friday that authorities blamed on the insurgent group. 

The Taliban's Doha office spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, also confirmed the meeting on Twitter but stressed that the discussion was only about the release of prisoners.

543,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 22, 2020 04:30PM ET</span>",Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak,"By Marisa Taylor
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Several months before the coronavirus pandemic began, the Trump administration eliminated a key American public health position in Beijing intended to help detect disease outbreaks in China, Reuters has learned.
The American disease expert, a medical epidemiologist embedded in China's disease control agency, left her post in July, according to four sources with knowledge of the issue. The first cases of the new coronavirus may have emerged as early as November, and as cases exploded, the Trump administration in February chastised China for censoring information about the outbreak and keeping U.S. experts from entering the country to help.
“It was heartbreaking to watch,” said Bao-Ping Zhu, a Chinese American who served in that role, which was funded by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between 2007 and 2011. “If someone had been there, public health officials and governments across the world could have moved much faster.”
Zhu and the other sources said the American expert, Dr. Linda Quick, was a trainer of Chinese field epidemiologists who were deployed to the epicenter of outbreaks to help track, investigate and contain diseases. 
As an American CDC employee, they said, Quick was in an ideal position to be the eyes and ears on the ground for the United States and other countries on the coronavirus outbreak, and might have alerted them to the growing threat weeks earlier.
No other foreign disease experts were embedded to lead the program after Quick left in July, according to the sources. Zhu said an embedded expert can often get word of outbreaks early, after forming close relationships with Chinese counterparts.
Zhu and the other sources said Quick could have provided real-time information to U.S. and other officials around the world during the first weeks of the outbreak, when they said the Chinese government tamped down on the release of information and provided erroneous assessments.
Quick left amid a bitter U.S. trade dispute with China when she learned her federally funded post, officially known as resident adviser to the U.S. Field Epidemiology Training Program in China, would be discontinued as of September, the sources said. The U.S. CDC said it first learned of a “cluster of 27 cases of pneumonia” of unexplained origin in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31.
Since then, the outbreak of the disease known as COVID-19 has spread rapidly worldwide, killing more than 13,600 people, infecting more than 317,000. The epidemic has overwhelmed healthcare systems in some countries, including Italy, and threatens to do so in the United States and elsewhere.
During a press briefing on Sunday shortly after this story was first published, President Donald Trump dismissed the Reuters report as similar to other stories regarding the CDC that he described as ""100 percent wrong,"" without addressing whether the role had been eliminated.
U.S. CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield maintained the agency's presence in China “is actually being augmented as we speak,” without elaborating. 
In a statement to Reuters before the report was published, the CDC said the elimination of the adviser position did not hinder Washington's ability to get information and “had absolutely nothing to do with CDC not learning of cases in China earlier.”
The agency said its decision not to have a resident adviser “started well before last summer and was due to China’s excellent technical capability and maturity of the program.”
The CDC said it has assigned two of its Chinese employees as “mentors” to help with the training program. The agency did not respond to questions about the mentors’ specific role or expertise.
The CDC would not make Quick, who still works for the agency, available for comment.
Asked for comment on Chinese transparency and responsiveness to the outbreak, China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs referred Reuters to remarks by spokesman Geng Shuang on Friday. Geng said the country “has adopted the strictest, most comprehensive, and most thorough prevention and control measures in an open, transparent, and responsible manner, and informed the (World Health Organization) and relevant countries and regions of the latest situation in a timely manner.”
One disease expert told Reuters he was skeptical that the U.S. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the Trump administration, given the Chinese government’s suppression of information.
“In the end, based on circumstances in China, it probably wouldn’t have made a big difference,” Scott McNabb, who was a CDC epidemiologist for 20 years and is now a research professor at Emory University. “The problem was how the Chinese handled it. What should have changed was the Chinese should have acknowledged it earlier and didn’t.”
ALERT FROM CHINA’S CDC
Alex Azar, secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Friday that his agency learned of the coronavirus in early January, based on Redfield’s conversations with “Chinese colleagues.”
Redfield learned that “this looks to be a novel coronavirus” from Dr. Gao Fu, the head of the China CDC, according to an HHS administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. “Dr. Redfield always talked to Dr. Gao,” the official said.
HHS and CDC did not make Azar or Redfield available for comment.
Zhu and other sources said U.S. leaders should not have been relying on the China CDC director for alerts and updates. In general, they said, officials in China downplayed the severity of the outbreak in the early weeks and did not acknowledge evidence of person-to-person transmission until Jan. 20.
After the epidemic exploded and China had imposed strict quarantines, Trump administration officials complained that the Chinese had censored information about the outbreak and that the United States had been unable to get American disease experts into the country to help contain the spread.
Azar told CNN on Feb. 14 that he and CDC director Redfield officially offered to send a CDC team into China on Jan. 6 but still had not received permission for them to enter the country. HHS oversees the CDC.
“Dr. Redfield and I made the offer on January 6th - 36 days ago, 60,000 cases and 1,300 deaths ago,” Azar said. “We made the offer to send the CDC experts in to assist their Chinese colleagues to get to the bottom of key scientific questions like, how transmissible is this disease? What is the severity? What is the incubation period and can there be asymptomatic transmission?”
Days later, the World Health Organization secured permission to send a team that included two U.S. experts. The team visited between Feb. 16th and 24th. By then, China had reported more than 75,000 cases.
On Feb. 25, the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak at home, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo accused China of mishandling the epidemic through its “censorship” of medical professionals and media.
Relations between the two countries have deteriorated since then, as Trump has labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese virus” - a description the Chinese have condemned as stigmatizing. Last week, the Chinese government announced that Americans from three U.S. news organizations, The New York Times, Washington Post and Wall Street Journal, would be expelled from China. 
ONCE ‘FRIENDS,’ NOW RIVALS
The decision to eliminate Quick’s job came as the CDC has scaled back the number of U.S. staffers in China over the last two years, the sources told Reuters.
“We had already withdrawn many technical public health experts,” the same expert said.
The CDC, however, disputed that staffing was a problem or that its information had been limited by the move. “It was not the staffing shortage that limited our ability” it said.
The U.S. CDC team in Beijing now includes three American citizens in permanent roles, an additional American who is temporary and around 10 Chinese nationals, the agency said. Of the Americans, one is an influenza expert with expertise in respiratory disease. COVID-19 is not influenza, though it can cause severe respiratory illness.
The CDC team, aside from Quick, was housed at U.S. Embassy facilities. No American CDC staffer besides Quick was embedded with China’s disease control agency, the sources said.
China in recent weeks has reported a dramatic slowdown in new cases, the result of drastic containment measures including the lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people.
Nevertheless, the infectious disease experts who spoke with Reuters said, the United States could use people like Quick with contacts on the ground, especially if fears of a second wave of infections materializes.
Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the CDC, said that if the U.S. resident adviser had still been in China, “it is possible that we would know more today about how this coronavirus is spreading and what works best to stop it.”
Dr. George Conway, a medical epidemiologist who knows Quick and had served as resident advisor between 2012 and 2015, said funding for the position had been tenuous for years because of a perennial debate among U.S health officials over whether China should be paying for funding its own training program.
Yet since the training program was launched in 2001, the sources familiar with it say, it has not only strengthened the ranks of Chinese epidemiologists in the field, but also fostered collegial relationships between public health officials in the two countries.
“We go there as credentialed diplomats and return home as close colleagues and often as friends,” Conway said.
In 2007, Dr. Robert Fontaine, a CDC epidemiologist and one of the longest serving U.S. officials in the adviser’s position, received China’s highest honor for outstanding contributions to public health due to his contribution as a foreigner in helping to detect and investigate clusters of pneumonia of unknown cause.
But since last year, Frieden and others said, growing tensions between the Trump administration and China’s leadership have apparently damaged the collaboration.
“The message from the administration was, 'Don’t work with China, they’re our rival,’” Frieden said.
Trump’s re-election campaign sent out a statement Sunday evening dismissing controversy about the CDC'S cut as a matter of politics. 

“Democrats are eager to politicize the coronavirus crisis and weaponize it against President Trump, the statement said. “In so doing, they're siding with the Chinese and providing cover for Beijing's cover-up.”

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - A Pakistani doctor who screened suspected coronavirus patients died on Sunday after testing positive for the virus, highlighting the danger to physicians who have threatened to strike unless access to protection equipment improves. 
Dr Osama Riaz, who was screening pilgrims who had returned to Pakistan from Iran, tested positive on Friday, the top health official in the country's northern Gilgit province, Shah Zaman, told Reuters by phone, adding he had subsequently died.
Pakistan, which borders Iran and China, two of the most affected countries, has reported three deaths and 658 infected patients, the highest number in South Asia.
With a broken healthcare system and the world's sixth-largest population of 208 million people, Pakistan remains in danger of a large scale spread of the virus, experts have warned. 
Besides Riaz a couple of more doctors have also shown symptoms, officials say.
""We request the government to immediately provide us personal protection equipment,"" Dr Asfandyar Khan, president of staff at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad, told a news conference on Friday. 
""It is like suicide to treat patients without protection,"" he said, adding: ""If infection spreads in hospitals, believe me no person will be ready to touch any patient.""
He threatened doctors would stop work if they and other healthcare staff aren't given necessary equipment by Monday.
Pakistan's health minister Zafar Mirza held a meeting with doctors' representatives on Saturday. ""Health workforce is my first priority,"" he said on Twitter. 
The chief of Pakistan's national disaster management department Lt. Gen. Muhammad Afzal said on Friday that 12,500 pieces of personal equipment had been procured. His spokesman Saqib Mumtaz said on Sunday the kits had been sent to hospitals. 
Ventilator shortage is another issue.
""We have 1,700 ventilators in public hospitals and another 600 in the private sector,"" said Afzal, adding an order had been made to procure 800 more.

He said an order for 200,000 N95 masks and 100,000 kits to test the virus had also been placed to enhance the country's capacity to cater to 900,000 people.

FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German chancellor Angela Merkel went into quarantine on Sunday after coming into contact with a coronavirus-infected doctor shortly after announcing more curbs on social interaction to slow the spread of the disease.
Merkel, 65, will continue her work from home and will submit to repeated tests over the next few days, her spokesman said in a statement, adding it was too soon for a conclusive test yet.
Merkel had on Friday afternoon received a vaccine shot against pneumococcus, a pneumonia-causing bacteria, from a doctor who later tested positive for coronavirus, according to the statement. 
Merkel earlier on Sunday said in a televised press briefing that Germany would ban public meetings of more than two people, amid a raft of further measures. 
""The great aim is to gain time in the fight against the virus,"" she said, citing an agreement between the federal government and regional states.
For at least the next two weeks, people will not be allowed to form groups of three or more in public unless they live together in the same household, or the gathering is work-related, she added.
Restaurants can only serve patrons via takeaway, while hairdressers and beauty, massage and tattoo parlours must close.
Governments in Europe, the epicenter of the global pandemic, have escalated their emergency responses amid a rising death toll. 
Italy banned travel within the country after freezing non-essential business activity. Spain wants to extend until April 11 a state of emergency it imposed this month. 
Regional states in Germany had previously taken differing approaches in the fight against the virus. Bavaria and smaller Saarland had gone furthest, imposing restrictions to keep people inside their homes save for a number of work-related exceptions.
""We are reducing public life and social interaction further and we are making sure to impose the same rules in principle across Germany,"" Merkel said. 
Last year, Merkel suffered several bouts of shaking at public events, sparking speculation about her health.
""I am aware of the responsibility of my office,"" she told reporters last July after the tremor episodes. ""I behave appropriately as far as my health is concerned ... I look after my health.""

Merkel has said she will not seek a fifth term as chancellor in federal elections due by October 2021. She has loomed large on the European stage since 2005, helping guide the EU through the euro zone crisis and opening Germany's doors to migrants fleeing war in the Middle East in 2015, a move that still divides the bloc and her country.

ATHENS (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee is stepping up its ""scenario planning"" for the Tokyo 2020 Games -- including a possible postponement -- as the coronavirus pandemic spreads, it said after an emergency meeting on Sunday.
The IOC will hold discussions that will include an option of putting back the July 24 start date or even moving the Games by a year or more due to the global coronavirus outbreak, but said cancelling the Games would not solve problems or help anybody.
""Therefore, cancellation is not on the agenda,"" the IOC said in a statement, adding that the detailed discussions would be completed within the next four weeks.
The Olympics has never been postponed or cancelled during peacetime but the IOC's decision to even consider postponement was met with relief from several major stakeholders, including World Athletics, the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and major national Olympic committees.
Under mounting pressure from athletes, federations and national committees to postpone the Games, the IOC did a partial U-turn on Sunday after long insisting, with Tokyo organisers, that the Games would go ahead as planned.
The IPC, whose Tokyo Paralympics are set for Aug. 25 to Sept. 6, said the IOC took the right decision under the circumstances.
""The next four weeks will provide time to see if the global health situation improves, while giving a window of opportunity to look into different scenarios should the dates of the Games need to be changed,"" IPC President Andrew Parsons said.
World Athletics, the sport's global governing body, said it was ready to work ""with the IOC and all sport on an alternative date"".
More than 13,000 people have died globally since the coronavirus outbreak began and its epicentre is now in Europe.
Opposition to holding the Games in July has risen sharply in the past 48 hours, with several major stakeholders such as U.S. Track and Field and UK Athletics along with several national Olympic committees, calling for a delay because of the pandemic.
They have raised several issues in the past week with the IOC, including athletes' inability to prepare due to restrictions caused by the virus and their overall safety.
Regarding the next steps in scenario planning, the IOC statement said: ""These scenarios relate to modifying existing operational plans for the Games to go ahead on 24 July 2020, and also for changes to the start date of the Games.
""The IOC will ... start detailed discussions to complete its assessment of the rapid development of the worldwide health situation and its impact on the Olympic Games, including the scenario of postponement.
""The IOC is confident that it will have finalised these discussions within the next four weeks.""
RAPID DECISION
The British Olympic Association welcomed the news but said a quick decision on the Games was now necessary.
""We welcome the IOC Executive Board decision to review the options in respect of a postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games,"" BOA chairman Hugh Robertson said.
""However, we urge rapid decision-making for the sake of athletes who still face significant uncertainty.
""Restrictions now in place have removed the ability of athletes to compete on a level playing field and it simply does not seem appropriate to continue on the present course towards the Olympic Games in the current environment.""
The USOPC, which has been supportive of the IOC's wait and see position, expressed a different tone to the latest update saying in a statement it welcomed some clarity but did little to address growing uncertainty and athlete anxiety.
""The progress reflected in today’s IOC update to the global athlete community is an important step in providing clarity, but our athlete community continues to face enormous ambiguity surrounding the 2020 Games in Tokyo,"" said USOPC chief executive Sarah Hirshland and USOPC athletes advisory council chair Han Xiao in a joint statement. 
""Having spent countless hours communicating with IOC leadership, our peers around the world, our NGBs and the athletes we serve, we know the difficult obstacles ahead and we are all appreciative that the IOC has heard our concerns and needs, and is working to address them as quickly as possible.""
In a letter addressed to athletes, IOC President Thomas Bach tried to explain the IOC's insistence in the past weeks to proceed as planned, saying moving the Games could not happen from one day to the next and many parts had to be looked at.
""I think I can feel with those among you who consider the situation to be unsatisfactory,"" Bach said.
""I know that this unprecedented situation leaves many of your questions open. I also know this rational approach may not be in line with the emotions many of you have to go through.
""A decision about a postponement today could not determine a new date for the Olympic Games because of the uncertain developments in both directions: an improvement ... in a number of countries ... or a deteriorating situation in other countries.""
Some athletes have already expressed their unwillingness to compete in Tokyo in July, among them German former world champion fencer Max Hartung, who heads the German Olympic Committee's athletes' commission.

Already qualified for the Olympics, he said on Saturday he was boycotting the Games for the safety of other athletes.

NAIROBI/FREETOWN/LAGOS (Reuters) - Hand sanitizer replaced holy water at Nairobi's Holy Family Basilica Catholic Church, and attendance was far lower than usual, but Sunday Mass went ahead.
""God's intention is that we worship him in the church,"" preached Father David Kamumue to about 300 people, instead of his usual congregation of some 5,000.
""Let us pray. May God keep us safe.""
In Kenya, where there have been seven confirmed cases of coronavirus, the government has imposed restrictions including closing schools and has urged people to practice social distancing as it tries to prevent the disease from spreading. 
For religious gatherings, authorities have asked churches to limit crowds as much as possible and encouraged people to pray from home. [nL8N2BE0O1]      
Globally, measures by authorities have included closing or limiting worship, disrupting Sunday services just before Easter. 
So far the confirmed incidence of the disease in Africa has been relatively small - almost 1,200 cases and more than 30 deaths, compared with a worldwide total that has reached more than 305,000 cases, with more than 13,000 deaths.
But part of Africa's battle to stop the virus from taking hold could be fought in its churches. It has the highest number of Christians of any continent, 631 million people as of 2018, or 45% of the continent's population, according to the Center for the Study of Global Christianity. 
As worshippers trickled into services across the continent on Sunday morning, temperatures were taken, hands were sanitized and people sat apart. 
In some places, measures were more extreme.
In Sierra Leone, which has included religious services in a list of banned gatherings, churches in the capital Freetown stood empty on Sunday. Some parishes found ways to broadcast their services so people could worship from home.
AN EMPTY CATHEDRAL
Behind the locked doors of Sacred Heart Cathedral in downtown Freetown, the country's oldest Catholic church, a priest and his deputy delivered a sermon to an empty room. 
A camera broadcast the sermon live over Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), while a microphone relayed the audio to Radio Maria — a church sponsored station broadcasting across the city.
""People need to hear the word of God now more than ever,"" said Father John Peter Bebeley who manages the radio station. ""If we can play our part in keeping this virus at bay while also providing consolation to people in these trying times, we have every responsibility to do that.""
Similar scenes have played out across the continent.
Churches in Ghana, South Africa, Liberia and other countries are moving to radio, television and the internet.
""If I go out there and I am infected, I won't have the opportunity to worship God next,"" said Chika Paul-Oboh, a finance manager in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos. 
""If I can stay alive to worship God, any medium is fine.""
Some worshippers disagreed with that stance.
""Nothing can stop me from not being in church,"" said Anna Ohere, a salon manager, who attends and works at another church in the Nigerian capital of Abuja. 
""I must be in church to serve my God, I can't be at home because of any one disease.""
THOUSANDS AT ABUJA CHURCH
On Sunday, thousands of people in Abuja flocked to the 100,000-capacity Dunamis Glory Dome, a squat, sprawling monolith.
The service, which was live-streamed on YouTube, was in open defiance of a government ban on gatherings of 50 people or more.
People stood side by side for hours, singing hymns and listening to the pastor, Paul Enenche, sermonise on the dangers of plagues. He acknowledged the ban on gatherings and the effects of coronavirus on Christianity everywhere.
""In most parts of the world churches are closed completely, but that devil is a liar,"" Enenche said. ""Church is our only hope. God is our only hope.""
However, the church will move towards home services for small groups and online worship, he said. 

He also announced a possible solution to skirt the ban on large gatherings: erecting canopies that would each hold 50 people.

The MV AidAmira's more than 1,700 passengers and crew had been unable to leave the ship since March 16, after a crew member on a separate cargo ship who shared a plane with six passengers on the liner showed symptoms of the coronavirus.
Port authorities quarantined the Italian-flagged AidAmira while the six passengers were tested for coronavirus. All tested negative for the respiratory illness, which has killed thousands worldwide since first emerging in China.
Authorities on Saturday bussed the first batch of 276 passengers directly to Cape Town international airport where they were flown out on special flights chartered by the German government, SAMSA spokesman Tebogo Ramatjie said. 
On Sunday, approximately 658 passengers were due to leave, with the last seen leaving on Monday. 
South Africa imposed new regulations from March 18 that banned all cruise liners from the country's ports and prohibited crew and travelers from getting on or off ships.
Another cruise liner, Norwegian Spirit, with 1,759 passengers onboard and already en-route to Cape Town before the new rules were implemented, will also need to conform to the new maritime regulations as South Africa looks to contain the spread of coronavirus, SAMSA said.
By Saturday, there were 240 confirmed cases of the virus, known as COVID-19, in South Africa. President Cyril Ramaphosa last week declared a state of disaster and was expected to address the nation again on Sunday.

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - The first batch of protective and medical equipment donated by Chinese billionaire and  Alibaba  (NYSE:BABA) co-founder Jack Ma was flown into the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa on Sunday, as coronavirus cases in Africa rose above 1,100.
The virus has spread more slowly in Africa than in Asia or Europe but has a foothold in 41 African nations and two territories. So far it has claimed 37 lives across the continent of 1.3 billion people.
The shipment is a much-needed boost to African healthcare systems that were already stretched before the coronavirus crisis, but nations will still need to ration supplies at a time of global scarcity. 
Only patients showing symptoms will be tested, the regional Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) said on Sunday. 
""The flight carried 5.4 million face masks, kits for 1.08 million detection tests, 40,000 sets of protective clothing and 60,000 sets of protective face shields,"" Ma's foundation said in a statement. 
""The faster we move, the earlier we can help."" 
The shipment had a sign attached with the slogan, ""when people are determined they can overcome anything"". 
The supplies will be distributed across Africa, with countries particularly ""vulnerable to the COVID-19 pandemic"" to receive theirs first, the statement said, adding that more supplies will be sent to Ethiopia in the coming weeks.
Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Twitter that the distribution of supplies will start on Monday. 
The ability to test for the virus is one of the key strategies to control the outbreak, Ethiopia health minister Lia Tadesse told reporters, hailing the aid initiative at a ceremony to receive the supplies.
Africa CDC warned that some coronavirus cases may be slipping through undetected. 

""More kits does not necessarily mean more tests. Tests are conducted on persons suspected to be infected,"" Africa CDC spokesman James Ayodele told Reuters.

MEXICO CITY/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major bust by U.S. drug authorities targeting Mexico's fastest-growing gang will likely do little to stem the rise of the ultra-violent Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) and its shadowy leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias 'El Mencho'.
Over the past decade, Oseguera, a 53-year-old former policeman, has masterminded the CJNG's emergence as a criminal empire spanning five continents and a rival to the Sinaloa Cartel of captured kingpin Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, now in a U.S. prison.
From the swathes of Mexico's western Jalisco state that he controls, Oseguera is accused of flooding U.S. streets with synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl, that cause tens of thousands of deaths every year.
El Mencho's success has made him a prized target, with U.S. authorities placing a $10 million bounty on his head in 2018.
The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) stepped up the fight last week with its largest swoop against the CJNG on U.S. soil, arresting more than 600 people accused of being linked to its sprawling criminal network.
U.S. authorities also struck two body blows against the assassin-turned-cartel boss last month, arresting his daughter in Washington and extraditing his son from Mexico to the United States.
""He's one of our number one targets,"" a senior DEA official told Reuters, citing soaring output from CJNG labs churning out heroin, methamphetamine and fentanyl for the United States. 
The DEA official, who asked not to be identified, said the agency estimates the CJNG produced about 106 metric tons of heroin in 2018, a four-fold rise from 2013, and was also making ""pharmaceutical grade"" methamphetamine pills in jungle labs.
The volumes were unprecedented in Mexico, the official said.
U.S. officials touted the success of last week's raids in disrupting the CJNG, saying they also made ""significant seizures of money and drugs"". 
But experts were skeptical, citing the scale of the CJNG's organization and its base in Mexico - where the U.S. government estimates it is present in three quarters of the states - built on violence and fear.
""It's not going to have an impact,"" said Mike Vigil, a former DEA chief of international operations. ""It would be tantamount to closing down a few franchises of McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) while the global chain continues to exist.""
'HE CONTROLS THE STATE'
Oseguera's ascent from a former foot soldier to one of Mexico's most feared capos has been marked by business acumen and a willingness to use grisly violence meted out by CJNG henchmen, including beheadings.
The Mexican state has not been spared. The cartel has massacred security forces, most recently in October, when alleged CJNG gunmen ambushed and killed 14 police officers in the western state of Michoacan.
In 2015, as Mexican forces closed in on Oseguera, tipped-off CJNG henchmen downed a military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade to buy time for their leader to escape.
The CJNG's expansion was helped by a balkanization of the cartels that followed the neutralization of capos over the past decade under the U.S.-backed ""Kingpin"" strategy employed by Mexico.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador assumed power in late 2018 vowing to adopt a less confrontational approach to tackling gang violence by focusing on the root causes of crime, poverty and corruption.
But El Mencho's turf wars with the Sinaloa Cartel have contributed to runaway levels of violence in Mexico. Murders hit an all-time high of 34,582 last year.
One senior Mexican security official said Oseguera was the most wanted organized crime leader in the country, along with his rival ""El Marro"", whose smaller Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel is accused of industrial-scale fuel theft from pipelines, threatening the president's goal of reviving state oil company Pemex.
Inside Jalisco, Oseguera has bought off hundreds of police to cover his back and operates with near-total impunity, according to Mexican and U.S. officials. 
""He's in an area where even Mexican authorities won't go into,"" said the senior DEA official. ""(He) controls almost the entire state.""
CAREFUL, PARANOID
Despite his reputation, Oseguera has kept a low profile and avoided the kind of media glare that washed over ""El Chapo"" Guzman.
""He's been careful and paranoid ... trying to stay off the radar,"" said Falko Ernst, an International Crisis Group analyst.
He has also learnt from the success of rivals, experts say.
Born in the rugged and impoverished Tierra Caliente region, famed for opium and marijuana plantations, Oseguera worked the fields as a boy with his avocado-farming family before joining the flood of young Mexicans into the United States in the 1980s. 
He became involved in the heroin business and was arrested by police in the early 1990s. He spent three years in a U.S. prison before being deported, according to the DEA and analysts.
Back in Mexico, El Mencho joined the police before enlisting with the Milenio Cartel, a satellite of Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel, eventually becoming a senior enforcer after stints as a sicario, or hitman.
""He received a Harvard-type education from some of the best cartel leaders,"" said Vigil.
In 2009, Oseguera tried to take charge of the Milenio Cartel when its boss was killed in an army raid. Rebuffed, he struck out alone, declared war on Sinaloa, and founded a new outfit in alliance with Los Cuinis, a gang of money launderers, according to security analysts and local media. 
That new cartel, the CJNG, would blend traditional Sinaloa-style drug trafficking with the ultra-violence of the Zetas Cartel, who used paramilitary tactics to diversify into criminal enterprises such as extortion and theft.
""Jalisco combines both those models,"" said cartel expert Ioan Grillo, author of book ""El Narco"". ""(He has) a very potent organization, and they will fight to protect him.""

ZAGREB (Reuters) - A large earthquake struck near the Croatian capital Zagreb on Sunday, leaving a teenager critically injured after an apartment building in the city collapsed, the GFZ German Research Center for Geosciences and a hospital official said.
Another minor was badly injured and the quake caused several fires and power blackouts in parts of the capital, hospital and emergency services said. 
Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic called on citizens to remain outside their homes amid potential aftershocks. Plenkovic and Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic also appealed for people rushing onto the streets to keep social distances from each other as the country struggles to contain the spread of coronavirus. So far, Croatia has reported 206 cases of the virus and one death.
""We will do our utmost to make the best estimate of what to do at the moment. There are protocols when it comes to an earthquake. But when it comes to an earthquake combined with the global pandemic, then it is a much more complicated situation,"" Bozinovic told local media.
Plenkovic said the quake, with a magnitude of 5.3 according to GFZ, was the biggest to hit Zagreb in 140 years. It struck 6 km north of the city and was felt across the Western Balkans.
Zarko Rasic, head of the Zagreb Emergency Medicine Institute, a children's hospital, said a 15-year-old was in a critical condition after being found by an emergency services team under a collapsed building and another minor had been admitted with head injuries from a falling roof. He did not give further details on the persons' identities.
The Zagreb Fire Department said firefighting and rescue operations were ongoing at several locations.
Plenkovic said the army had been called in to help clean up debris in Zagreb and urged citizens to ""stay outside and keep your distance"".
""The situation is contradictory, we invited people to stay at home to avoid spreading of the corona virus, and now we are advising them to leave their homes,"" Plenkovic told a press conference.
GFZ downgraded the magnitude of the quake from an initial reading of 6.0. 
""It lasted over 10 seconds. By far the strongest I have ever felt,"" one witness said, adding that it was followed by several aftershocks.
A Reuters reporter on the scene saw a church bell tower damaged, some buildings fell down as people fled apartments and took to the streets.
The government convened an urgent cabinet meeting and said it would hold another press conference on Sunday afternoon.

The U.S. Geological Survey said the quake measured 5.4, while the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) also reported 5.3 magnitude, followed by another 5.1 magnitude earthquake.

TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo 2020 organizers have started drafting possible alternatives to holding the Olympics this summer, two sources familiar with the talks said, in contrast to the Japanese government's stance that postponement is not an option.
While the coronavirus outbreak has disrupted sports events around the world, Japan has been steadfast in saying that the Games will go on. The top government spokesman on Wednesday said Tokyo wasn't preparing for postponement.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has staked his legacy as Japan's longest-serving premier on the Games and is hoping for a boom in tourism and consumer spending. At risk is more than $3 billion in domestic sponsorship, an Olympic record, and some $12 billion spent on preparations.
""Finally, we have been asked to make a simulation in case of a postponement,"" said one of the sources, an official close to the organizing committee who is involved in drafting the scenarios.
Both sources spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.
""We are making alternative plans - plan B, C, D - looking at different postponement time-frames,"" said the official, adding the scenarios included cost estimates for different delays.
Neither Tokyo 2020 organizers nor the International Olympic Committee (IOC) immediately responded to a request for comment. The government of Japan could not be reached for comment. 
The options, which include scaling back the Games or holding them without spectators, would be debated by the organizing committee at the end of March, the official said.
The second source, who is also close to the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, confirmed that postponement was being discussed, including delays of one or two years.
Some organizing staff were holding out hope for a delay of a month or 45 days, said the official involved in drafting the scenarios.
A final decision on postponement will have to come from the IOC but Japan's stance also matters. 
BOARD CONCERNS
The IOC and its powerful chief, Thomas Bach, say the Games will go ahead as planned, drawing fire from athletes who say that could be a health risk.
Two other insiders, both senior members of the Tokyo 2020 organizing committee, echoed those concerns. One of them, a board member of the organizing committee, said the decision to postpone should be made quickly.
""The more they push the decision away ... more and more preparations have to be made - this will cause cancellation fees to go through the roof,"" the board member said.
Bach recently appeared to shift his tone, saying the IOC was ""considering different scenarios"".
Japan's Nikkei newspaper said in a report on its website on Sunday that the IOC will hold a board meeting this week, as calls from sporting organizations for the event to be postponed gathered pace.
The official involved in drafting scenarios said a long delay could spark complaints from older athletes and require keeping sponsors on board for longer. Another headache is the Olympic village, due to be converted to flats after the Games.
The summer 2021 calendar is already crowded while 2022 will see the soccer World Cup and the Beijing Winter Olympics.
Japanese sponsors are nervous, company representatives have said privately. Major sponsors include Toyota Motor Corp (T:7203) and Panasonic Corp (T:6752).
""Of course companies are individually discussing what to do,"" said a representative of one of the more than 60 sponsors. ""No one wants to be the first to say anything about the possibility of a postponement.""
Japan Airlines Co (T:9201) discussed that there was an 80% chance the Olympics would not be held as scheduled on a recent internal conference call, a person briefed on the call said. 
A JAL spokesman said: ""Our preparations are underway for the Games to open as scheduled"".
In Tokyo, there is a sense delay may be inevitable. Finance Minister Taro Aso has compared Tokyo 2020 to the 1940 Olympics canceled by World War II, and the boycott of the 1980 Moscow Games. 

""It's a problem that's happened every 40 years,"" he said. ""It's the cursed Olympics - and that's a fact.""

French newspaper Liberation, citing sources in Macron's office, said Johnson's decision came after the French leader gave him an ultimatum on Friday morning, threatening an entry ban on any traveler from the UK if there were no new measures.

Macron ordered stringent restrictions on people's movement in France on Monday. Restaurants, bars and schools have been shut nationwide and people ordered to stay at home other than to buy groceries, travel to work, exercise or for medical care. 
Macron also pushed for European Union member states to close the bloc's external borders earlier this week.
The report echoed comments Macron's prime minister, Edouard Philippe, made in an interview on Tuesday.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Aviation Administration said late on Saturday it will close the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center and New York LaGuardia Control Tower overnight for cleaning after another person tested positive for COVID-19.
The FAA said an individual at La Guardia tested positive, prompting the temporary shutdown of the tower that it said should have minimal impact on flights.
The FAA said New York Air Route Traffic Control Center will close at 11:30 p.m. EDT until 6:30 a.m. for sanitization, while LaGuardia Control Tower will be closed from 11 p.m. EDT until 6 a.m. for sanitization.
The FAA said transatlantic services will be discontinued during the closure at New York Air Route Center and some flights may be held to avoid arriving during the cleaning.
Earlier on Saturday, the FAA temporarily halted flights arriving at New York City airports and Philadelphia after a trainee at the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center tested positive for COVID-19.
The FAA soon lifted the New York area ground stop order Saturday but some flights were delayed while flight management returned to normal. The positive test forced the FAA to close some air space sectors and reroute flights, the agency said.
Flightaware, a flight tracking website, said 600 flights had been canceled on Saturday at John F. Kennedy and Newark airports.
The FAA has had a series of issues this week due to cases of coronavirus at 10 U.S. facilities, forcing the cancellation of more than 2,000 flights and the closing of towers earlier this week at Chicago Midway and Las Vegas.
More than 1,500 flights have been canceled at Las Vegas, where the tower is still closed, including more than 500 on Saturday. Another 300 flights were canceled at Midway on Saturday, where the tower also remains closed.

The FAA on Friday temporarily closed the tower at New York's JFK, which led to some flight cancellations, and also shuttered part of the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center for cleaning after workers tested positive for the coronavirus.

A senior Trump administration official confirmed Trump sent the letter and said it was ""consistent with his efforts to engage global leaders during the ongoing pandemic.""
The president looks forward to continued communications with Chairman Kim, the official said.
Since Trump held a third summit with Kim last June and briefly stepped into North Korea from the demilitarized zone with South Korea, no progress has been made on the U.S. president's bid to get Pyongyang to give up its nuclear and missile programs.
North Korea has attempted a series of missile launches, including the launch of two apparent short-range missiles in the last day or so, as it tries to pressure the United States and its allies to lift economic sanctions.
North Korea state media KCNA said Kim had received a letter from Trump in which the U.S. president said he was impressed by the North Korean leader's efforts to defend his people from the coronavirus.
Trump ""expressed his intent to render cooperation in the anti-epidemic work, saying that he was impressed by the efforts made by the Chairman to defend his people from the serious threat of the epidemic,"" KCNA reported in a statement carried by Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong. It did not say when the letter was received. 
The letter said that despite good personal relations between the leaders, ""if impartiality and balance are not provided and unilateral and greedy intention is not taken away, the bilateral relations will continue to aggravate.""
The report came after North Korea's missile test on Saturday , which prompted South Korea to urge an immediate halt of ""inappropriate action"" in the face of the global pandemic.
In a separate dispatch on Sunday, KCNA said it was a test of a new tactical guided weapon, overseen by Kim Jong Un. 

The test ""clearly proved the characters of different flight trajectories and falling angles, accuracy of guided shells and their power"", KCNA said.

In an address to the nation, Diab said this would include patrols and checkpoints. 
He called on the Lebanese to go out only if absolutely necessary and warned that the rising number of infections ""foreshadows an imminent danger threatening society.""
The health ministry recorded on Saturday a 29% rise in cases from the day before, bringing the total to 230, Diab said. Four people have died in the past month. 
Lebanon's government declared a medical state of emergency earlier this week and ordered most of the country closed, including the airport.
Experts warn the country's healthcare system is ill-prepared, as a financial crisis and dollar shortages have for months drained it of critical supplies.

566,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 21, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",Army joins the production line as ventilator makers scramble to meet demand,"By John Miller and and Elvira Pollina
ZURICH (Reuters) - On March 6, Gianluca Preziosa, the head of an Italian ventilator maker, received an urgent request. The Italian authorities wanted his help for an all-out effort to meet a desperate need for ventilators.
Now, his Bologna-based company, Siare Engineering International Group s.r.l., has 25 army technicians working with its production supervisors to manage the expanded production and help assemble machines. The army also has made personnel available to the company’s suppliers, Preziosa said.
“Usually we produce 160 machines a month. The goal is to produce 2,000 in four months, so more than triple our monthly production,” Preziosa told Reuters in an interview. The executive added that companies involved in the supply chain of producing ventilators “cannot respond to the enormous demand because this is a niche industry.”
Siare belongs to a normally quiet corner of the medical equipment market that has found itself on the front line of the century’s biggest health crisis caused by the rapid spread of the new flu-like virus, which can lead to breathing difficulties and pneumonia in severe cases.
Ventilator makers are under pressure to sharply increase production even as the pandemic has disrupted the transport and supply of crucial parts, such as hoses, valves, motors and electronics – some of which come from China, the original epicenter of the outbreak that has killed more than 10,000 people across the globe.
Amid shortages, governments are turning to help from the military, enlisting other manufacturers and even looking to 3D printing in the hopes of ramping up production of the potentially life-saving breathing machines. In Italy, a team of doctors has developed a way to provide oxygen to two people from one ventilator, therefore doubling capacity, according to the Italian region of Emilia Romagna’s commissioner for coronavirus.
Ventilators, which cost tens of thousands of dollars, are mechanical breathing devices that can blow air and oxygen into the lungs. They are crucial for the care of people with lung failure, which can be one of the complications suffered by patients with severe COVID-19, the disease coronavirus causes. But they don’t necessarily save people.
""The mortality amongst the intensive care population is being estimated as 50 to 60%,"" said Rahuldeb Sarkar, a consultant physician in respiratory medicine and critical care in Britain. If a critically ill patient doesn’t get a ventilator, “he dies within a few hours.""
One of the world’s largest makers of ventilators, Swiss-based Hamilton Medical AG, expects to increase production to about 21,000 ventilators this year, up from 15,000 last year by deploying marketing staff on the production line, among other measures. But with many more orders than it can fulfill, the company faces difficult decisions on where to send them.
Hamilton Medical’s chief executive, Andreas Wieland, said the company is prioritizing those countries where the need is most dire, notably Italy. Hamilton Medical sent 400 ventilators to Italy last week and expects to send another shipment soon. But, he said, that also means turning some governments down, which has resulted in one country reacting aggressively by threatening to blacklist his company.
“We're trying not to deliver into a country that is merely stocking up reserves, where there is practically no virus, so they can prepare. We're trying to serve those where the emergency is most extreme.”
The global ventilators market is worth more than $1 billion annually, according to Hamilton Medical, which says it has roughly a quarter share of revenue. Other ventilator makers include U.S.-based ResMed Inc, Getinge AB of Sweden, Germany’s Draegerwerk AG, and China’s Beijing Aeonmed Co, Ltd.
Companies say demand has topped out in China but is surging, from Italy, elsewhere in Europe and the United States as the virus continues to spread. More than quarter of a million cases of coronavirus have been reported.
BOTTLENECKS
In Italy, where more than 4,000 people have died from the virus, hospitals are suffering severe shortages of ventilation and other equipment, as well as medical staff. The first products resulting from the army technicians’ work at Siare should start coming out from Saturday, a spokesman for Italy’s defense ministry said.
The Italian government has also purchased nearly 4,000 of the 5,000 units of ventilating and other equipment it tendered for earlier this month. In Germany, where hospitals had about 20,000 ventilators before the outbreak, the government has placed an order for 10,000 machines from Draegerwerk – the equivalent to a year’s normal production at the company. Demand in France, which is usually for about 1,000 to 1,500 ventilators annually, has increased to hundreds per week, said Christophe Hentze, director-general of the French unit of Löwenstein Medical Innovation GmbH, a German medical equipment maker, speaking on France Info radio. 
Britain’s health minister has said the country needs “as many ventilators as we can get our hands on.”
But getting the parts can be difficult at a time when some countries are shutting borders or taking steps to safeguard stocks of medical supplies.
Hamilton Medical's Wieland said Romanian authorities had in recent weeks halted a shipment of ventilator hoses that his company makes in a factory there on the ground that it could be important medical equipment. Wieland said he needed the intervention of the Swiss consulate in Romania before custom officials allowed it out.
""We had to use political channels to let them know that these products, by themselves, aren't valuable to them,"" Wieland said.
A spokesman for Switzerland’s foreign ministry said: 'Our ambassador in Bucharest was in contact with the Romanian authorities to contribute to the resolution of the situation.” Romanian officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Sweden’s Getinge has had experiences of “bottlenecks” at suppliers that it has so far managed to solve, partly with the help of politicians, said chief executive, Mattias Perjos. Getinge says it plans to increase output by 60%, from about 10,000 ventilators last year.
In China, medical device manufacturer Beijing Aeonmed relies on imports from countries including Switzerland, the United States and Netherlands for key components such as valves and turbines to make ventilators, said purchasing director Wang Xue. But the company’s international suppliers have experienced difficulties during the global outbreak in sourcing some basic parts to produce the components it needs.
“If the imported materials cannot be supplied in time, the production capacity of some [ventilator] models will be severely affected,” she said. “We are calling our foreign suppliers every day.” Beijing Aeonmed says it has tried to help its international suppliers to replace those previously foreign-made supportive components with China-made alternatives. The company said it has capacity to produce about 1,500 ventilators for overseas orders this month and hopes to increase that to 4,000 in April.
CAR MAKERS
Some countries, including Italy, Britain and the United States, are drafting automakers and aerospace manufacturers to ramp up ventilator production. Authorities hope big manufacturers can repurpose some factories and use digital design expertise, including 3D printing, to make up the expected shortfall in vital medical hardware.
In Britain, the government has turned to other manufacturers. McLaren Group Ltd., a conglomerate that includes a sports-car maker, is looking at how to design a simple version of a ventilator. Nissan Motor Co, is working with others to support existing ventilator producers.
On Friday, Britain said engineering companies had come up with an emergency ventilator prototype that could be approved next week.“We need as many as you can possibly make and we will buy them,” said Britain’s health minister Matt Hancock.
The British government has said it has increased its stocks to about 8,000 ventilators. The head of Britain's National Health Service told a parliamentary panel he expects that to increase to just under 12,000 over the next several weeks. 
BORDER BARRIERS
U.S. ventilator maker ResMed has reallocated resources away from producing other devices to meet demand that is more than four times normal levels, said its chief executive, Mick Farrell.
One issue has been restrictions on travel intended to stem the spread of coronavirus, which has affected ResMed’s Singapore factory which employs many workers from neighboring Malaysia. He said ResMed has appealed to the Malaysian government for an exemption so its workers can travel to Singapore.
In the United States, hospitals are considering re-deploying older ventilators, which still work but had been abandoned because they don't connect to modern electronic records systems, while the U.S. Department of Defense has donated 2,000 ventilators, said Nancy Foster, vice president of the American Hospital Association. “Hospitals are also looking into re-purposing the machines that administer anesthesia to be used as ventilators.""
The United States had equipment to provide ventilation to about 160,000 people, according to research compiled by the Johns Hopkins Center for Health and Security. The hardest hit states now are urgently seeking more. That includes New York state, which is looking to add to the roughly 5,000 to 6,000 it already has, a figure that Governor Andrew Cuomo has said meets only a fifth of the potential demand.

""No one really knows what the national need is. It really depends on how bad COVID-19 gets,"" said Chris Kiple, head of portable ventilator maker Ventec Life Systems Inc, in Bothell, Washington. “If it truly turns into a significant pandemic, we're really going to have to focus on ventilator supply until we can get a vaccine to really help save lives.""

COLOMBO/ISLAMABAD, March 21 (Reuters) - One prisoner died and three others were injured when fighting broke out on Saturday in a Sri Lankan jail over rumors of coronavirus, as governments across South Asia tightened restrictions on movement to try to stem infections.
The pandemic appears to have been slow to take off in the region, home to 1.9 billion people, but the rate of infections in Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Afghanistan is increasing.
As a whole, by 1400 GMT on Saturday, the region had registered 957 coronavirus cases and eight deaths.
Instructions to stay indoors are a challenge for millions of day laborers who can scarcely afford to stay at home, and there are fears that the region will prove particularly vulnerable because of its poor health facilities and overcrowded infrastructure.
In Sri Lanka, which has confirmed 76 cases, police arrested 110 people from various parts of the country for violating a weekend curfew, a police spokesman said.
In Anuradhapura prison, scene of frequent protests against ill-treatment in recent years, inmates fought staff, fearing that the virus had entered the jail.
""Contrary to rumors floating around, no one has tested positive at the Anuradhapura prison,"" said lawmaker Namal Rajapaksa.
FLIGHTS SUSPENDED
At Dum Dum, the largest jail in the eastern Indian state of West Bengal, police fired tear gas after prisoners attacked wardens and tried to start a fire after visits were banned because of the virus, a prison official said.
In neighboring Bangladesh, all incoming flights except those from China, Hong Kong and Thailand were to be banned from midnight onwards after 20 people tested positive, a senior civil aviation official said.
At Dhaka airport, authorities started marking the hands of passengers who had been instructed to follow home quarantine.
Pakistan, with 534 confirmed cases and three deaths, suspended all international flights for two weeks. Officials there said a self-quarantine program would continue for at least another 45 days.
In India's towns and cities, people were scrambling to buy essential commodities ahead of a day-long curfew on Sunday promoted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a way of practicing social isolation.
India is also banning all incoming international flights from 2001 GMT on Sunday.
With over 1.3 billion people, India has confirmed 283 cases of coronavirus, but has tested only 15,000 samples in 70 state-run labs, according to a senior health ministry official in New Delhi, one of the lowest testing rates in the world.
""At this point we really don't know what is the extent of the spread,"" the official said, on condition of anonymity.
Indian Railways, which carries more than 25 million passengers every day, said some people had tested positive after traveling by train, forcing officials to try to track down fellow passengers.

Marchal is due to arrive in France around midday on Saturday, the official said. 
French President Emmanuel Macron urged Iran to also release French citizen Fariba Adelkhah, who is still imprisoned, the official added. Adelkhah also holds an Iranian passport. 
Iran and France have agreed to swap Marchal, held on security charges, and an Iranian detained by Paris over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions against Tehran, Iranian state media reported on Friday.
France has released Jalal Ruhollahnejad, an Iranian engineer wanted by U.S. authorities over sanctions charges, state broadcaster IRIB has reported.
France had demanded that Iran release Marchal, a senior researcher at Sciences Po university whose arrest was reported by Paris in mid-October.
In May, a French court approved the extradition of Rouhollahnejad to the United States to face charges of attempting to illegally import U.S. technology for military purposes on behalf of an Iranian company which U.S. officials said was linked to the elite Revolutionary Guards.
The detentions have complicated ties between the two countries during a period when Macron was seeking to defuse tensions between Washington and Tehran.
Iran Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals in recent years, mostly on espionage charges. 
The detentions have coincided with a protracted standoff with Western powers prompted by a U.S. decision to withdraw from an international agreement to curb Iranian nuclear activities.

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Lockdowns and panic food buying due to the coronavirus pandemic could ignite world food inflation even though there are ample supplies of staple grains and oilseeds in key exporting nations, a senior economist at FAO and agricultural analysts said.
The world's richest nations poured unprecedented aid into the global economy as coronavirus cases ballooned across Europe and the United States, with the number of deaths in Italy outstripping those in mainland China, where the virus originated.
With over 270,000 infections and more than 11,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with periods such as World War Two and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. 
""All you need is panic buying from big importers such as millers or governments to create a crisis,"" said Abdolreza Abbassian, chief economist at the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
""It is not a supply issue, but it is a behavioral change over food security,"" he told Reuters by phone from Rome, the FAO headquarters. ""What if bulk buyers think they can't get wheat or rice shipments in May or June? That is what could lead to a global food supply crisis.""
Graphic: Stocks of global crop staples - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/9160/9141/GlobalStocksofFoodStaples.png
Consumers across the world from Singapore to the United States have queued at super markets in recent weeks to stock up on items ranging from rice and hand sanitizers to toilet paper.
The global benchmark Chicago wheat futures rose more than 6% this week, the biggest weekly gain in nine months, while rice prices in Thailand, the world's 2nd largest exporter of the grain, have climbed to the highest since August 2013.
France's grain industry is scrambling to find enough trucks and staff to keep factories and ports running as the panic buying of pasta and flour coincides with a surge in wheat exports.
Restrictions imposed by some European Union countries at their borders with other member states in response to the pandemic are also disrupting food supplies, representatives of the industry and farmers said.
However, global wheat stocks at the end of the crop marketing year in June are projected to rise to 287.14 million tonnes, up from 277.57 million tonnes a year ago, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) estimates.
Graphic: Stocks of crop and food staples - https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/7/9161/9142/StackCropStapleStocks.png
World rice stocks are projected at 182.3 million tonnes as compared with 175.3 million tonnes a year ago.
FOOD IN THE RIGHT PLACE
Logistics are likely to be a major global issue, analysts said.
""There is about 140 million tonnes of corn that goes in ethanol in the United States and some of that can used for food as it won't be needed for fuel, given the drop in oil prices,"" said Ole Houe, director of advisory services at brokerage IKON Commodities
""The concern is having food at the right time in the right place.""
Asian buyers were inactive this week with uncertainty looming in the market.
""We are not sure about the demand. What it is going to look like in June or July?"" said one Singapore-based purchasing manager at a flour milling company that has operations across Southeast Asia. ""Restaurant business is down, and as a result demand is a bit soft right now.""
Asian wheat importers, including the region's top importer Indonesia, have been taking a bulk of the cargoes from the Black Sea region amid a global oversupply.
Oil exporting nations in the Middle East, which are also net grain importers, are likely to feel more financial pain with crude losing more than 60% of its value this year.
""Net oil exporters' capacity to buy grains has dropped given the fall in oil prices and depreciation in currencies,"" said FAO's Abbassian.

""There will be less capacity to take policy actions to boost economies.""

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden's campaign in February spent less than one-third the amount spent by rival Democrat Bernie Sanders, according to disclosures by the campaigns filed on Friday.
Despite being outspent, Biden's campaign finished the month surging at the polls with a victory in the February 29 nomination contest in South Carolina. 
Since early March, the former vice president has led the Democratic contest to be the nominee to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November presidential election.
In February, Biden's campaign spend $13.1 million, compared to $45.8 million spent by Sanders. His campaign manager said this week he was reassessing his bid.
The presidential race has changed dramatically since February, however, as a deadly coronavirus outbreak has led campaigns to suspend rallies and fundraisers.
The outbreak is also causing swaths of the U.S. economy to shut down as state and local officials order businesses closed and, increasingly, people to stay in their homes.
The outbreak could lead campaigns to rely more on television and digital advertising. 
Biden spent only around $5 million on ads in February, compared to more than $26 million spent by Sanders.
With Sanders' future in question, a potential match-up of Biden versus Trump has come into view. At present, the Republican appears to have a substantial funding advantage.

Biden finished the month with $12.1 million in the bank. Trump's campaign, which has been burning through the money it raises much more slowly than Biden's campaign, ended the month $94.4 million in cash.

The 39-year-old leader said in a televised address that she will keep schools open for now, in a similar policy employed in neighboring Australia.
""Schools will be closed if there is a case that affects a school, as we have been doing to date,"" Ardern said.
""Sending children home at this stage, though, doesn't necessarily reduce transmission in the community,"" she said, ""but I can assure you we are constantly monitoring these settings to keep children safe. As a mum, I can assure you that is my key consideration.""
Announcing a new alert system, Ardern said New Zealand was at level two, where the virus is contained but the risks are growing as there are more cases. She urged those aged over 70 to stay home as much as possible.
Earlier in the day, New Zealand's director-general of health, Ashley Bloomfield, said there were 14 new cases of COVID-19 in the country in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 53.
While the policies being enacted in New Zealand and Australia are unprecedented there, and include a ban on non-residents from entering, they are less stringent than measures being employed in parts of Europe and North America which have suffered higher rates of infection and are in lock-down. 
New Zealand and Australia are also gateways to small Pacific islands, which are now starting to grapple with the epidemic. French Polynesia and Guam are among the hardest hit island countries in the Pacific, although COVID-19 cases have also been recorded in Fiji and New Caledonia.

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada will turn back asylum seekers who walk over the U.S.-Canada border, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Friday, as economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak intensified and a ban on non-essential travel across the world's longest undefended border was set to come into effect. 
More than 500,000 applications for Canadian unemployment benefits were made so far this week, versus just under 27,000 in the same week last year, Trudeau said. The monthly number of unemployment insurance claims last year averaged 239,000. 
""This is of course an unprecedented situation and it is putting a lot of pressure on our system, but we’re on it,"" he told reporters outside his house, where he has been in isolation since his wife tested positive for the virus last week.
Air Canada, the country's largest carrier, said on Friday it will temporarily lay off more than 5,100 employees.
The jobless claims indicate an unemployment rate over the next two months ""probably the likes of which we have not seen in the post-war era,"" said Bank of Montreal Chief Economist Douglas Porter. 
The Bank of Canada on Friday said it would take additional measures to help ensure financial markets continue operating smoothly ""given the rapidly evolving uncertainty"". 
Canada's tally of reported cases of the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus has surpassed 1,000, along with 12 deaths. 
It closed its borders to most foreign nationals and agreed with the United States this week to close their shared border. A notice from the U.S. Homeland Security Department (DHS) said restrictions will begin at 11:59 p.m. EDT Friday and last until April 20. 
Trudeau said the measure to return asylum seekers who walk into Canada outside official border stations was a temporary one to protect the health of Canadians during the coronavirus outbreak.
Thousands have illegally crossed the Canada-U.S. border to file refugee claims in recent years, spurred by tougher U.S. immigration policies under President Donald Trump’s administration. 
The Canadian Council for Refugees said it was ""shocked"" at the decision to turn back migrants. 
As the border deadline approached, traffic was already snarled on some crossings early on Friday owing to stepped-up screening measures by the Canada Border Service Agency.
In a relief for Canada's agriculture sector, temporary foreign workers are exempt from the restrictions.

Trudeau's government has pledged C$27 billion ($18.6 billion) in support, which could blow out the fiscal deficit and lead to higher government borrowing by nearly 40%, according to Reuters calculations.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. State Department employees have complained about the U.S. ambassador to South Africa's failure to self-isolate immediately after returning from a U.S. visit when she attended a March 7 Mar-a-Lago event, some of whose attendees have tested positive for coronavirus, according to messages reviewed by Reuters.
Among those at the event were U.S. President Donald Trump, who has tested negative for the Covid-19 disease, and U.S. Senator Lindsay Graham, who decided to quarantine himself after learning a Brazilian official there fell ill with it. 
The State Department employees were worried the ambassador, Lana Marks, might infect her staff, personnel on a U.S. Navy ship she visited this week, and South Africans before she decided on Thursday to self-isolate.
""We are concerned (Marks) is endangering her staff and South Africans by having returned to South Africa and choosing to not self-quarantine after admitting to having attended an event with an individual who then tested positive for COVID-19 and knowing it before she returned to South Africa,"" said one message.
Another said Marks told Pretoria embassy staff on Thursday she had attended the Mar-a-Lago event but minimized the chances of her exposure even as she decided to limit her contact.
""She described attendees at the same event had tested positive but thought that her risk to contract COVID-19 to be minimal based on the distance between the infected person and herself,"" it said. ""She then described how starting today she would limit her meetings to no more than 10 people.""
It was not clear why Marks, a political appointee and former fashion executive, limited her contacts on Thursday. The State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
On her personal Twitter feed, Marks on Thursday said she had decided to quarantine herself but did not address why she did not do so earlier.
Marks on March 8 posted a photo with U.S. national security adviser Robert O'Brien against a backdrop matching a tapestry at Mar-a-Lago captioned ""a wonderful evening last night.""
On March 16 she posted a photo of herself aboard the USS Carney with Cape Town's iconic Table Mountain in the background.
Ambassador Eric Rubin, head of the U.S. diplomat's union, the American Foreign Service Association, said U.S. officials abroad deserved to have their health and safety protected.

Cuba is renowned for its preparedness in advance of natural disasters such as epidemics, and for its medical prowess. It sends its doctors to health crises around the world, including to ebola outbreak in West Africa in 2014-2016.
With the world's highest ratios of physicians to population, according to the World Bank, Cuba has tens of thousands of doctors as well as medicine students going door to door to monitor local communities. 
""Closing the centers for work and teaching create a situation of tension and stress that is known to diminish the body's immune system,"" the health ministry's epidemiology chief, Francisco Durán García, said on state-run TV this week.
Cuban officials have said the island's hot climate could slow propagation of the virus and a state-run tourism agency has even promoted the island as a safe destination. 
Cuba has also boasted that it produces a drug that helped curb the coronavirus outbreak in China, although some experts doubted whether it was effective as a mass treatment.
Cuba has the ""manpower, the drugs, and a proven and effective approach to face health challenges"", Cuba's Foreign Ministry's General Director for U.S. Affairs Carlos Fernandez de Cossio tweeted.
Many Cubans trust authorities' assurances they have the situation under control, in a country where the state has a monopoly of mass media. But some are concerned about the government's decision to keep borders, schools and workplaces open and to encourage tourism.
On Wednesday, authorities reported the first death from coronavirus in Cuba, an 61-year old Italian tourist. The number of cases has steadily risen over the past week to 16 confirmed, all imported, and 523 hospitalized on suspicion of having it.
Critics note that Cuba has the oldest population in Latin America and the elderly are especially vulnerable to the disease. Increased internet access on the island has generated more concern as citizens have been able to evaluate other countries' approaches.
""They should close the borders already because cases are coming from abroad,"" said Luis Rodriguez, 48, who drives a ""coco taxi"" - a three-wheeled scooter under an egg-shaped booth - in Havana. ""It will be difficult because we live from tourism but health comes first.""
    The cash-strapped nation, which received more than 4 million visitors last year, says the number of cases and lack of local transmission does not yet warrant closing borders.
Instead, they are monitoring travelers at airports. Residents entering the country will have to self quarantine for 14 days under measures due on Friday, according to Communist Party newspaper Granma.
""In the case of tourists, staying in hotels will be favored (over bed-and-breakfasts), where there are all the conditions to increase epidemiological vigilance and medical supervision,"" it wrote.
Critics question the efficacy of these checks, especially since people can be infected without showing symptoms.
""When we arrived at the airport ... they just asked us if we had been coughing or had fever, although we came from France where there have been thousands of cases already,"" said Jules Lhuissier, a 28-year-old medical student on France, who arrived on holiday in Havana five days ago.
        
NO CURFEW, CLOSURES YET
While life in Havana has continued much as normal, some private business owners have chosen to suspend operations.
""We are closing next week because we cannot be a place for the virus to propagate,"" said Nelson Rodriguez Tamayo, owner of a buzzing cafe in the colonial Old Havana. ""We are thinking about doing delivery"".
Others are voluntarily keeping their children at home. 
One source said authorities would on Friday order private restaurants and bed-and-breakfasts to close and announce fiscal benefits for them.
Many Cubans also worry about the lack of protective equipment and hygiene products in a country under U.S. sanctions, which faces shortages of many basic goods. Adequate hand-washing is also problematic for many who face sporadic outages of running water, and Cuba is recommending that citizens make their own face masks.
Shortages mean Cubans have to typically spend hours in queues when they go shopping, complicating social distancing.

""There is no way to shop online here, so if I don't queue up how do I get by?"" asked Eddy Zamora, 36, queuing outside a supermarket. ""And I don't have the money to stock up.""

The government later said in a statement the lockdown would come into force on Sunday and last until April 4.
The North African country, which has already shut down cafes, restaurants and mosques, has so far reported 54 confirmed cases of coronavirus and one death.
Tunisian banks will postpone the repayment of loans by poorer citizens by six months to help alleviate the social and economic impact of the crisis, banking sources said.

""I call on Tunisians to stay at home and to go out only to meet the most urgent needs... The state will provide food and vital services such as health and security.""
Tunisia now expects an economic recession, prompting the central bank on Tuesday to cut its key interest rate by 100 basis points.

Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh has said the government had reduced its growth forecast this year to 1% from 2.7%. The government is expected to announce soon an aid package for struggling companies and individuals.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will allow temporary foreign workers with valid visas to enter the country, officials said on Friday, offering possible salvation to the agriculture industry even as Ottawa moves to limit the spread of a coronavirus outbreak.
Canada's labor-strapped farms rely heavily on nearly 60,000 temporary foreign workers to help plant and harvest crops like fruit and vegetables. They also account for about 3% of meat and seafood processors' labor force.
Ottawa this week said it would close its borders to all foreign nationals, except U.S. citizens, prompting industry concerns about the potential damage to this year's harvest.
Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland told reporters that ""valid work and student visas to come to Canada will be respected... and that includes temporary foreign workers.""
Those individuals, like all persons entering Canada from abroad, will be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon arrival, she added.
Many of the workers come to Canada via the Seasonal Agriculture Worker Program. It allows farmers to hire workers from Mexico or certain Caribbean countries for a maximum of eight months, provided they can offer workers a minimum of 240 hours of work within a period of six weeks or less.
Farm groups said a lack of workers would challenge Canada's agriculture supply chain.
In a notice sent on Wednesday, the groups sent a document to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his cabinet outlining suggested ways to get workers from countries whose borders or airports are shut to Canada, including the use of chartered flights, said sources with direct knowledge of the file.
The proposal laid out how farmers could maintain operational health and safety and ensure workers, who often live in close-quarters on farms, could self-isolate for 14-days upon arrival, the sources said.
A senior government official told Reuters on Thursday all options were on the table and discussions with provincial counterparts were ongoing.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday came close to blaming Iran for a rocket attack in Iraq last week in which two American troops and a British service member were killed.
""Maybe we shouldn't say yet,"" said Trump when the question was posed to Pompeo at a White House news conference. Said Pompeo: ""Let me just get back to you on the answer to that.""
The Pentagon said last week that Trump had authorized the U.S. military to respond to the March 11 rocket attack in Iraq. Trump has been preoccupied with addressing the coronavirus pandemic.
The United States has blamed Iran-backed militia for the attack but has not yet said whether it was linked to the Iranian leadership in Tehran.
Tensions have been running high between the two longtime adversaries since Trump ordered a U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani on Jan. 3.
When Pompeo was asked about whether Iran was responsible, Trump interjected: ""We know plenty.""
Pompeo added: ""We’ve made clear that the Iraqi Shi'a militias are funded, trained and equipped by the Iranians. We've urged the Iranians not to do that. We’ve told the Iranians that they will be held responsible for those attacks when they threaten American lives.""
Despite the tensions, the United States has offered humanitarian assistance to Iran while it struggles with the coronavirus outbreak. Iran is one of the countries outside China that has been most affected by the pandemic. On Friday, Iran said its death toll from the outbreak rose to 1,433.
Pompeo suggested that tough U.S. sanctions on Iran would continue over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs despite some appeals for them to be relaxed due to the virus.
""The whole world should know that humanitarian assistance into Iran is wide open. It's not sanctioned,"" he said.
""There is no sanction on medicines going to Iran, there's no sanctions on humanitarian assistance going into that country. They've got a terrible problem there and we want that humanitarian medical health-care assistance to get to the people of Iran,"" he said.
Trump said in a message to Iran to mark the Nowruz holiday that ""the people of Iran have made it clear that they want leadership that represents them, not the interests of its corrupt regime.""
""The Iranian people deserve leaders who listen to, respect, and invest in them, not leaders who target and persecute them while wasting money to advance their nuclear ambitions and test more missiles,"" he said.

584,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 04:10PM ET</span>",Canada's stretched hospitals brace for impact,"By Allison Martell and Moira Warburton
TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's health system is preparing for an influx of coronavirus patients in the midst of a long-running bed shortage, calling doctors out of retirement and ramping down any treatment that can wait. 
A shortage of beds during periods of peak demand, like the flu season, is a longstanding problem in the publicly funded system. While health spending has risen gradually in recent years, beds have not kept pace with population growth.
""You've got people in broom closets and auditoriums and conference rooms across the country,"" said Michael Gardam, chief of staff at one Ontario's newest hospitals, the 656-bed Humber River Hospital.
Canada has 925 cases of the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, and 12 deaths.
A preliminary model published by Canadian researchers this week estimated that if cases increase by 7.5 percent each day, Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, will run out of ICU beds and ventilators in about 37 days. 
Between Sunday and Thursday, daily case counts grew an average of 16% a day. 
In British Columbia, which has seen the most virus-linked deaths in Canada, the majority of hospitals are running between 110% and 140% of their official capacity, said Christine Sorensen, president of the BC Nurses' Union.
Most current Canadian hospitals were built between the 1940-1960s, under a federal program. Budget cuts forced closures, and in recent years, growing demand for long-term care has further strained the system.
Canada had 12.9 adult intensive care beds per 100,000 people, according to a study based on 2013-14 data, with variations across the country. British Columbia had only 10.5 beds, and the Atlantic province of Newfoundland and Labrador had 21.8, according to a report from Canadian Institute for Health Information.
Quebec's government recently said it has 1,000 ICU beds, or 11.8 per 100,000. 
In contrast, the United States had 34.7 ICU beds per 100,000 as of 2009, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information. 
CARE BY EMAIL AND IN HOTELS
With little time left to prepare, officials are moving to make the most of what they have.
British Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons put a call out to doctors who retired in the last two years to re-register under a special emergency class. 
Ontario told hospitals this week to ramp down elective surgeries and non-urgent treatment. It also said it would invest C$100 million to increase capacity, but it is not clear how quickly that can be done. 
An Ontario committee set up to address the crisis is looking at how to move more patients out of hospitals and into long-term care or home with care, a document obtained by Reuters showed.
Alberta is enabling doctors to bill for phone consultations, in an effort to keep patients at home. 
Its College of Physicians and Surgeons told doctors that unregulated technology, like email and texting, may be justified under the ""extraordinary circumstances.""
Some hospitals have the capacity to re-open beds that have been closed over the years, said Michael Hurley, president of the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions, but that is not occurring quickly enough.
""So far we haven't talked about approaching this virus with the intensity that the Chinese have,"" said Hurley, citing China's move to open up thousands of hospital beds in a matter of days to handle the influx of coronavirus patients. China assembled new hospitals in Wuhan using prefabricated buildings.
One top priority will be protecting healthcare workers, for their own safety and so they can continue to see patients.
""It's going to be a burden on the staff; it's going to be a burden on the system,"" said Paul-Émile Cloutier, president of hospital advocacy group HealthCareCAN. 
""The challenges of COVID-19 underscore the challenges that already exist in the system.""

Hundreds of thousands of cast and crew around the world have lost work amid the crisis. That includes electricians, carpenters, drivers and other hourly workers.
The world's largest streaming media service said most of the fund would be given to the hardest-hit people on its own productions. The assistance will be provided in addition to the two weeks pay the company already had promised for workers on productions that were suspended last week.
The company also said $15 million of the fund would go to third parties and non-profit organizations that were providing emergency relief to out-of-work crew and cast in countries where Netflix has a large production base. 
""This community has supported Netflix through the good times, and we want to help them through these hard times, especially while governments are still figuring out what economic support they will provide,"" Netflix Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos said in a blog post.

WASHINGTON / MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The United States and Mexico have agreed to restrict non-essential travel over their shared border in an effort to limit the spread of the new coronavirus, U.S. President Donald Trump said during a news conference at the White House on Friday.
Flanked by top U.S. officials, Trump also announced that his administration would invoke a health-focused statute to block migrants from either border from entering the United States illegally, saying illegal immigration threatens ""to create a perfect storm"" in combination with the virus.
The ""non-essential"" travel measures will restrict tourism at the border. The measures against illegal immigration mean the United States can rapidly return Central Americans and Mexican migrants it arrests, the Mexican Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said earlier, speaking in Mexico City.
Ebrard said he had agreed with U.S. counterparts that trade, work and medical trips would not be restricted at the border. Those comments were echoed on Fox News by Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf.
Roughly 3 million personal vehicles crossed legally each month in 2019 between San Diego, California, and the Mexican border city of Tijuana, according to U.S. Department of Transportation data.
A U.S. official said the restrictions would not impact rail or trucking shipments across the border. 
Trump has said for weeks he was considering southern border restrictions to contain coronavirus, with infection fears adding to his ongoing campaign against migration ahead of the 2020 presidential election. 
The United States so far has many more confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths than Mexico. 
While Mexico already allows the United States to send it Latin American migrants, mainly to await U.S. asylum hearings in Mexican territory, the decision to allow a rapid turn around of Central Americans appeared to be a new concession. 
Ebrard said Mexico will not allow the United States to return other nationalities to Mexico under the new immigration measures, which he said only applied to border apprehensions, not other deportations. 
He said about 1,200 Mexicans are currently apprehended illegally crossing the border each day, and about 120 Central Americans. 

The United States was aiming to send those migrants back to Mexico within a day, down from a three-day turn around currently, he said.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - It's more than 10 months until Christmas, but as the global coronavirus pandemic takes hold in the United States, Margaret Haskell put out a call on her community Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) group in New Jersey for people to hang their outdoor holiday lights back up.
""We are all finding new ways to virtually connect but many of us can't shake the feeling of isolation and loneliness,"" Haskell, 37, from South Orange, told Reuters. ""My thought was that this would be a way to let each other know that we are still here, that life is still going on inside our houses.""
More than 12,500 people across the United States have been diagnosed with the COVID-19 illness and over 200 have died, with Washington state and New York worst hit so far.
Americans are being told to stay home and practise social distancing in a bid to slow the spread of the virus, so people are coming up with creative ways to cope with isolation, lift each others spirits, and get to know their neighbors. 
Viral videos of people in Italy and Spain singing or taking part in mass exercise classes from their balconies during coronavirus lockdowns have provided inspiration.
Residents of a neighborhood of Jersey City, New Jersey, have started coming out at 6 p.m. to play whatever instruments are on hand, from guitars and toy drums to egg shakers - but all at a safe distance from each other.   
""We're called the Lockdown Jam Band,"" said Shanee Helfer. In Jersey City, residents have been asked to remain indoors after 8 p.m.
In Boston, a man appeared in his window to sing Neil Diamond's ""Sweet Caroline,"" an anthem long sung during breaks at Red Sox baseball games, a video widely circulated online showed.
""Hands, not touching hands,"" he sang, tweaking the lyrics to follow public health guidance. ""Reaching out, not touching me, not touching you."" A neighbor at a nearby window and passersby on the street joined in.
'BREATHE DEEPLY. SCREAM'
New Yorkers are getting to know their neighbors - virtually, of course. 
In the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bedford-Stuyvesant, a support group on the messaging app Slack has quickly grown to more than 1,000 members since it was set up on March 12. People are sharing recipes to try while stuck at home, information about which businesses are still open, and who needs help with groceries or medications.
""I think it has been kind of an emotional balm for a lot of people,"" said Benjamin Krusling, a 29-year-old writer and artist, and one of the group's organizers. ""What's the most helpful for people I've talked to who have joined is just kind of knowing... we're all going through this thing together.""
In Washington, more than 1,500 people on Facebook have said they want to participate in an event on Monday evening designed to allow people to express their frustration with the pandemic. 
The instructions for the event - named DC Area Primal Scream - are simple: ""Step outside if you can (six feet from your neighbor, please). Head to the roof or the balcony, or stick your head out a window. Breathe deeply. Scream.""
And social distancing does not mean no more happy hours. About a dozen neighbors in Portland, Oregon, drew circles on the ground six feet apart for each guest at their street party with a difference to stand in, said Leslie Garey, 51. 
""Everyone visited and drank from their circles,"" Garey said. ""We plan to do it often.""
For working parents now stuck at home with their children, people are looking for ways to entertain them in the new era of social distancing.
In Jackson Heights, Queens, neighbors on a block are using shared Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) docs to organize a home-schooling collective, asking work-from-home parents to teach classes in their area of expertise to kids of all ages. But some parents balked at including their kids in groups.
""People have gotten more nervous and cautious about even small social gatherings,"" said Benjamin Tausig, a music professor and crossword constructor who offered classes in both subjects. ""Any contact outside one's family might depend a lot on levels of trust.""
More than 150 rainbows have popped up in windows of Brooklyn brownstones, high-rise apartment buildings, storefronts and in courtyards as a symbol of hope for children of all ages and inspired by similar efforts in Italy and Spain. 

Marisa Migdal, 35, shared the idea in a Brooklyn parents Facebook group. ""Everything feels so overwhelming and scary right now,"" Migdal said. ""It is nice to feel connected. It adds a reminder that everything is going to be okay.""

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson effectively closed down the United Kingdom on Friday, ordering pubs, restaurants, theaters, cinemas and gyms to shut their doors in a bid to slow down the accelerating spread of the coronavirus.
As the coronavirus outbreak sweeps across the world, governments, companies and investors are grappling with the biggest public health crisis since the 1918 influenza pandemic, panicked populations and imploding financial markets.
Johnson said he understood just how wrenching it was to take away the ancient rights of the British people to go to the pub but that it was absolutely essential to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
""I do accept that what we're doing is extraordinary: we're taking away the ancient, inalienable right of free-born people of the United Kingdom to go to the pub, and I can understand how people feel about that,"" Johnson said. ""It's a huge wrench.""
""It's a huge wrench to do that, everybody understands that,"" he said. ""It's heartbreaking to think of the businesses that will face difficulties as a result of the measures this country has had to take.""
The United Kingdom so far has 3,983 confirmed cases of coronavirus, after 66,976 people were tested, though the government's scientists say it is raging across London, partly as some people are not obeying government advice to isolate. 
At total of 177 people with the virus have died so far across the country.
Johnson said pubs, restaurants, theaters, nigthtclubs, cinemas and gyms and leisure centers were being asked to close on Friday night and to stay shut indefinitely.
""We are telling cafes, bars and restaurants to close tonight as soon as they reasonably can and not to open tomorrow,"" Johnson told reporters in Downing Street. ""Though to be clear, they can continue to provide takeout services.
""Some people may of course be tempted to go out tonight, and I say to those people, 'please don't,'"" Johnson said.
Johnson's finance minister Rishi Sunak launched a gigantic stimulus package to stabilize Britain's virus-hit economy on Friday, including the government paying the wages of workers up and down the country.

SAINT-JACUT-DE-LA-MER, France (Reuters) - In the Brittany village of Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer, resentment is simmering at the city-dwellers who this week fled their Parisian pads for their seaside bolt-holes and who, in the minds of locals, may have brought the coronavirus with them.
Affluent neighbourhoods of Paris emptied this week after President Emmanuel Macron gave France notice of an impending lockdown meant to halt the spread of the outbreak.
As in Italy, where earlier in March people from the wealthy Lombardy region headed south to beat a quarantine in the north, the exodus has raised fears in provincial France that the spread of the outbreak will accelerate in areas hitherto not exposed.
One pensioner who gave his name as Daniel said the holiday homes around him had filled up overnight after Macron's national address on Monday, when he declared ""war"" on the virus and issued unprecedented restrictions on public life.
""They behave like they're on holiday,"" said the 74-year-old, declining to give his full name for fear of creating a rift with his neighbours. ""There's no doubt all this movement of people is going to quicken the spread of the virus.""
It is relatively common for city dwellers in France to own a house in the country, and the practice has helped countless rural villages survive. The 900-strong population of Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer grows ten-fold in the summer.
But the exodus has amplified tensions in France around city dwellers who treat the countryside like their playground and then leave when it suits.
Brittany has registered 297 confirmed coronavirus cases out of 11,000 cases nationwide, according to the national health body. 
But some doctors in provincial towns and cities say they now fear a wave of infections that will place an already-strained healthcare system under severe stress - an sentiment echoed in villages.
""We can't take in everybody,"" said David, an unemployed inhabitant of Saint-Jacut-de-la-Mer.
BEACH BAN
An estimated 17% of Parisians left the capital in the 48 hours after Macron announced the confinement measures, according to Martin Hirsch, head of the Paris hospitals network. The unofficial figure was based on power consumption. 
Locals had been particularly vexed by the sight of their city neighbours jogging in groups along the beaches, violating the president's orders to exercise alone to minimise the risk of transmission.
From the Atlantic coast to the French Riviera, police are now enforcing local orders prohibiting access to beaches. 
Macron and his government have expressed irritation this week at the lax attitude of some French towards the restrictions on public life, which demand people stay in their homes unless to buy food, go to work or seek medical care.
The owner of the La Goelette pizzeria in the village, forced to close during the lockdown, said she emphasized with city residents who wanted to escape the confines of their apartments.
""We all want to look after ourselves,"" she said. ""If everyone respects the rules and stays indoors, it doesn't bother me.""
A retired lawyer from Versailles just outside Paris, who gave her name as Isabelle, said she and her husband had been checking on their holiday home after the winter when the lockdown was announced and decided to stay. 
""It goes without saying that we're better off here than in the Paris region,"" she said. ""People at this time are generally welcoming, as long as everyone keeps their distance and stays indoors.""

The move marks a significant change in tactics from the Liberal government, which earlier this week had said those traversing the frontier would be put into quarantine.
""This is a temporary measure which we'll put in place for as long as the coronavirus crisis lasts. These are exceptional measures to protect citizens,"" Trudeau told a news conference.
Since 2017 around 50,000 people have crossed the border into Canada, many saying they want to evade U.S. President Donald Trump's crackdown on refugees and illegal immigrants.
""The people who crossed up until today will be in isolation ... but in future those trying to cross will be turned back to U.S. authorities,"" said Trudeau.

Ottawa, he added, had been working with Washington for several years to find a way of stopping the flow of people, many of whom have the right to stay in the United States.

596,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 12:26PM ET</span>","Coronavirus spreads fear, isolation, death to elderly worldwide","By Linda So, Joseph Tanfani, Tim Cocks and Tim Kelly
(Reuters) - Grace Dowell, a 63-year-old grandmother, has stopped grocery shopping and canceled all her doctor’s appointments. No one is allowed into her rural Maryland home. Every piece of mail is disinfected.
Dowell decided last week that strict isolation was the only way to protect herself, her husband and her mother from COVID-19, the virus that has killed more than 10,000 people across the globe and is proving especially deadly for the elderly.
Dowell, a retired labor union worker, has rheumatoid arthritis and a compromised immune system. Her husband Donald, 74, suffers from emphysema. Her mother, Margaret Hildebrandt, 93, also has a lung disease and needs oxygen. Dowell took over her mother’s care from a visiting nurse because she worried an outsider could contaminate the home.
“If my mom gets this, she’d be gone in a day,” said Dowell, who wears a baby-monitor and answers her mother’s calls for help through the night. “My mom beat cancer nine times. I don’t want her to die from this.”
The elderly are especially vulnerable in the global pandemic and health officials and governments are increasingly calling for extreme measures to safeguard them. Across the globe, many cities have all but shut down as officials issue dire warnings for younger people - who can carry the virus without knowing it - to avoid their parents and grandparents. But this growing isolation of the elderly has spawned its own crisis, as families try to balance the need to care for loved ones with directives to stay away, shifting the burden to overstretched governments and medical facilities.
Studies suggest the severity of coronavirus rises with age. In Italy, which now has the world’s highest death count, the average age of those dying is 80, according to a study by the Italian national institute of health. In China, where the pandemic started, people 70 and older accounted for just 12 percent of all infections but more than half of all deaths, according to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. In the United States, people 65 and older have thus far accounted for 31 percent of cases, 53 percent of intensive care hospitalizations and 80 percent of deaths, according to U.S. government data. 
Beyond the grim statistics, the pandemic has spawned countless small dramas of isolation and anxiety across the globe. In a village in Lebanon, a grandmother walled herself off in her home, unable to properly grieve her dead husband. In Spain, nursery home workers produced a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) video so residents could reassure their loved ones. And in Colombia - where the government on Tuesday ordered citizens 70 and over to stay inside until May 31 - seniors stocked up on supplies for two months of isolation.
“They need to take these measures because many people are taking the situation lightly,” said shopper Carlos Manrique, 74, as he loaded up on potatoes, eggs and rice at a supermarket in Bogota. “I’m taking care of myself, as God orders.”
Just as often, older people greeted the epidemic with defiance.
“I am not worried about the coronavirus at all,” said Yutaka Kobayashi, 85, who refuses to wear a mask while working in his Tokyo shoe store. “People of my generation were made to wash their hands by their mothers and grandmothers.”
‘HELLO GRAN, HOW ARE YOU?’
In Italy, where more than 3,400 people have died since the outbreak came to light on Feb. 21, local officials fret about the psychological state of elderly people confined to their homes for weeks in a government lockdown. The town of San Casciano in Val di Pesa launched an initiative called “Ciao Nonna, come stai?” or “Hello Gran, how are you?” urging all young people to call elderly relatives – or even older people they don’t know.
One nursing home, Nuestra Casa La Grande in Navares de Enmedio, Spain, recorded a video of 24 elderly residents and posted it on Facebook, encouraging each other to blow kisses to the camera for their loved ones.
Jonathan Barrios, a 24-year-old student living with his parents in La Parla, Madrid, said he doesn’t dare see his grandparents, who live on the same street. His 80-year-old grandfather has lung cancer. His grandmother, 70, has symptoms of the virus - a fever, cough and difficulty breathing - but can’t get tested because of a shortage of kits.
“I feel strange and frustrated,” Barrios said. “All I can do for my grandparents is to call them.”
The forced isolation perhaps cuts deepest for those in mourning. Joey Ayoub, a Lebanese researcher, said his grandfather died this week of problems unrelated to the coronavirus. He worries for his grandmother, who suddenly lives alone.
Only six or seven people attended her husband’s funeral, which Ayoub said would otherwise have attracted “dozens and dozens.” They all sat at a distance from one another during a rushed service.
""She can't mourn properly,” he said. “She cannot do it with friends.”
‘IF I GET IT, I GET IT’
Some families have been hit hard when senior care centers closed, forcing them to take off work to watch over relatives. In the central Japan city of Nagoya, the mayor asked 126 such facilities to shut down for two weeks after a cluster of coronavirus cases was found at one of them.
Japan has already weathered serious outbreaks of the virus and has huge numbers of people at risk - more than 28 percent of the nation’s population is 65 or over. But now, some people are venturing out again.
""If I get it, I get it,” said Kazuko Mori, 74, a part-time cleaner in suburban Ichikawa, which had clusters of cases originating at a sports gym and an elderly daycare service. “If you get too nervous about it all, that isn't good, either.""
Many elderly people said they can’t follow government directives to stay home.
In Kibera, a settlement of densely packed neighborhoods where few homes have running water in Kenya’s capital Nairobi, volunteers knocked on doors to tell people – especially the elderly – about the coronavirus. In one courtyard filled with children, Fatima Juma listened intently as Zulela Abdul explained the risks to her and handed over a small bottle of hand sanitizer.
Juma, who says she’s about 82, had heard of the disease on television but didn’t know its symptoms. She was fine with washing her hands but rejected the idea of social distancing. She takes care of her grandchildren, the youngest one two years old, while their parents worked. She also needed to see her friends, she said.
“This government directive is not good for me. I need to go to the market,” she said firmly, bangles flashing in the sunlight. “If there is a death outside, I need to go and console that person.”
In Communist-run Cuba, which has Latin America’s oldest population, many people are forced to work long after retirement age to supplement meager pensions. Even in normal times, they endure long lines at stores and pharmacies.
""I am very worried because I have asthma, and if I get it, I will die,"" said Maria Torres Hernandez, 75, waiting alongside dozens of others outside a pharmacy in central Havana that had just received its ration of supplies. “I have to look after myself.”
Angel Pupo Osorio, 80, works as a parking attendant in Havana to supplement his $12-a-month pension, and can’t afford to quit. So far, the disease hasn’t hit his neighborhood.
“I’m going to continue working as long as I can, out of necessity,” said Pupo, wearing his uniform, a scarlet jacket and cap.
‘ISOLATE MYSELF HOW?’
Lucy Mayimela, a 68-year-old grandmother, first heard about the coronavirus on Monday when she made a trip to buy spinach for her fruit and vegetable stand in Kliptown, on the outskirts of Johannesburg. The farmer selling it to her wore a mask and insisted everyone repeatedly wash their hands before touching anything.
Mayimela laughed bitterly at a suggestion she heard on the radio that she should isolate herself at home.
“Isolate myself how?” she scoffed.
She lives in a small shack with six relatives, in a community with a single wash basin and toilet for dozens of people. The produce stand she has run for 36 years provides her family’s only income.

“I’ll end up dying of hunger” if people stay indoors, she said. “If God wants me to die, then it’s my time.”

Turkish-born Gokmen Tanis, 38, had shown no remorse and was fully responsible for his actions, despite having low intelligence and a personality disorder, the judges said.
The attack by Tanis on March 18, 2019, came just days after a lone gunman killed 50 people in mass shootings at two mosques in the city of Christchurch, New Zealand. 
""The suspect stepped into a tram in broad daylight and there sowed death and destruction,"" Presiding Judge Ruud Velhuisen said reading the ruling out in court.
Tanis, a resident of the Netherlands since 1993, did not know his victims, who ranged in age from 19 to 74.
He had tried to justify his actions afterward by saying it was ""us against you, us Muslims against you 'democrats'"", the judge said in the ruling. Tanis had used the term 'democrats' to describe Dutch people or non-Muslims.
Tanis had yelled, cursed, spat at judges and taunted victims' family members during his trial, but did not address questions put to him by judges or victims' families in an intelligible way. 
His lawyer had acknowledged Tanis was culpable, but had argued he should not be sentenced to life in prison, given his reduced mental capacity.

(Reuters) - New Jersey's governor was expected on Saturday to follow four other states - California, New York, Illinois and Connecticut - demanding that millions of Americans close up shop and stay home to slow the spread of coronavirus infections.
The sweeping state-by-state public health restrictions, unprecedented in breadth and scope, added to the distance being experienced among ordinary Americans.
""I know people want to hear it's only going to be a matter of weeks and then everything's going to be fine,"" New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference on Saturday. ""I don't believe it's going to be a matter of weeks. I believe it is going to be a matter of months."" 
Meanwhile, the global pandemic seemed to close in on the highest levels of power in the nation's capital.
An aide to U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, leading the White House task force formed to combat the outbreak, tested positive for the virus, but neither President Donald Trump nor Pence have had close contact with the individual, Pence's press secretary, Katie Miller, said in a statement late on Friday.
Pence's office was notified of the positive test on Friday evening, and officials were seeking to determine who the staffer might have exposed, Miller said. 
The aide was not publicly identified, and the vice president's office did not immediately respond to a request for further details of the diagnosis or whether Pence would be tested.
""He's recovering and has very, very mild symptoms,"" Pence's chief of staff Marc Short told CNN on Saturday. 
The White House said last week that Pence did not require testing after dining with a Brazilian delegation, at least one member of which later tested positive for the respiratory illness. Trump has tested negative for the virus, his doctor said last week.
Two members of the U.S. House of Representatives tested positive on Wednesday, becoming the first members of Congress known to have contracted the disease, which has killed 266 people in the United States.
The total number of known U.S. coronavirus cases has risen exponentially in recent days, climbing past 19,000 in a surge that health officials attributed in large part to an increase in diagnostic testing. More than 270 Americans have died.

Cuomo said New York state was sending 1 million N95 respirator masks to New York City on Saturday. He said the state has identified 6,000 ventilators for purchase, which he described as a major step, but added that it needs 30,000. 
""We are literally scouring the globe for medical supplies,"" the governor said. New York state has recorded 10,356 cases, he said, 6,211 of them in New York City.
SOCIAL-DISTANCING GOES STATEWIDE
Expanding on social-distancing measures increasingly adopted at the local level, California Governor Gavin Newsom instituted the first statewide directive requiring residents to remain indoors except for trips to grocery stores, pharmacies, gas stations and other ""essential businesses.""
Newsom's order, announced late on Thursday, made allowances for the state's 40 million people to venture outside for exercise so long as they kept their distance from others.
On Friday, his counterparts in New York state, Illinois and Connecticut followed suit, and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy said he planned to issue similar directives on Saturday.
The five states where governors have banned or will soon ban non-essential businesses and press residents to stay inside are home to 84 million people combined, about a quarter of the entire U.S. population and account for nearly a third of the nation's economy.
The state directives were for the most part issued without strict enforcement mechanisms to back them up.
""What we want is for people to be in compliance and we're going to do everything that we can to educate them,"" Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said at a briefing on Saturday. Police officers would ""admonish"" those found to be on non-essential outings to go home, she said.
""That's what we hope is the end of any kind of contact that anyone might have with the police department,"" Lightfoot said.
Cuomo said there will be a civil fine and mandatory closure for any business that is not in compliance.
Even before the flurry of statewide stay-at-home orders, the pandemic had virtually paralyzed parts of the U.S. economy and upended lifestyles over the past week, as school districts and colleges canceled classes and many companies were shuttered, either voluntarily or by local government mandates.

Washington state, which documented the first known U.S. coronavirus case in January and now accounts for the greatest number of deaths - 83 as of Friday - has since March 16 closed bars, restaurants, recreation venues and entertainment facilities, while banning all gatherings of more than 50 people.

KABUL (Reuters) - At least 27 security personnel were killed when a military base was stormed in Afghanistan on Thursday, in one of the biggest attacks since a violence reduction agreement was signed between the United States and the Taliban last month.
The Afghan government blamed the attack on the Taliban, with whom the United States signed a peace deal last month for an eventual pullout of foreign forces from Afghanistan in exchange for reduced violence by the militant group.
As part of the agreement, the Taliban was also supposed to begin talks with a delegation of Afghan leaders for sustained peace in the country – but the process never took off after disagreement on the release of prisoners.
Armed Taliban fighters stormed a joint military base of the Afghan National Defense Forces in the southern province of Zabul late Thursday night, according to a member of the provincial council, Haji Atta Jan Haqbayan.
The clash continued till the early hours of Friday, leaving 27 members of the Afghan forces dead, Haqbayan said, adding that the Taliban fighters left the area after capturing weapons and ammunition.
The Taliban did not respond to requests for comment. 
“The attack happened with the help of infiltrators,” a spokesman for the Zabul provincial governor said.
The Afghan defense ministry also said infiltrators within the Afghan forces helped carry out the attack, adding that the incident was being investigated. 
The defense ministry put the death toll at 17.
The government earlier on Thursday said it was ordering its forces to switch to an “active defense posture” as Taliban attacks continued.
“This heinous act of the Taliban is a clear example of their commitment for continued violence and against the Afghan peace process,” Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for the Afghan president, said on Twitter.

Regional authorities will be allowed to make exceptions in lower-risk situations.
""Today we will announce a new rule. From next week, whoever enters Portugal must stay in isolation for 14 days,"" Graca Freitas, head of the DGS health directorate, told a news conference.
She did not specify exactly when the measure would come into effect or whether breaking it would be considered a crime.
Other countries across the globe, from Singapore to Israel, have adopted similar preventive measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
""Health authorities in the region where people are arriving will be allowed to conduct a more precise evaluation of the risk and make exceptions,"" Freitas said.
Portugal has 1,020 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with six reported deaths, far below other southern European countries such as Italy and Spain.
Portugal declared a state of emergency on Wednesday to combat the outbreak, closing non-essential businesses and implementing capacity restrictions for those remaining open.
On Friday, people queued at pharmacies and supermarkets, one meter apart on otherwise deserted streets, stocking up on food and medicine.
But some of the elderly were not happy they had to wait alongside everybody else.
""They are not protecting the elderly at all,"" 77-year-old Manuel Vidigal told Reuters. ""They are not protecting us because we are still queuing. We don't have priority.""
People aged over 70 were urged only to leave home to grab essential goods. All other citizens should avoid leaving their homes but can go to work, assist their families and accompany minors for recreation, among other essential activities, the government said.

The health ministry expects cases of the virus to rise exponentially until at least the end of April.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina went into full lockdown mode on Friday, with streets in Buenos Aires largely deserted, while workers and school kids in the capital logged on remotely to offices, classrooms and even digital dancing lessons, after a mandatory quarantine was imposed.
On Thursday President Alberto Fernandez announced the isolation measure to keep all but essential workers in their homes until the end of March in what he called ""a fight against an invisible enemy to save lives.""
""In the face of this crisis there is no place for individualistic attitudes, we need to maintain social distancing by avoiding leaving our homes... Faced with this threat, we are all responsible. Our destinies depends on each other.""
Argentina has so far registered 128 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with three deaths. The government has shut borders to non-residents, restricted long-distance domestic travel and curtailed large events.
In the capital few cars circulated with some buses running to allow people involved in essential sectors including health care and food to get around. Some small shops were open for groceries and medicines.
Geraldine Cunto, 38, a television executive at the city's famous Hipodromo race track, said she had moved in with her parents, both 73, when Fernandez announced the quarantine. 
""This is the house l grew up in, so last night when the quarantine countdown was on, they asked me to please be with them. I packed my things and left immediately to what feels like going back 25 years in time,"" Cunto said.
Living under the same roof for the first time in years had so far been an interesting experience.
""My mom probably cleaned the house 100 times in 10 hours and will have to understand the concept of relaxing!"" she said.
The lockdown was a shock for others.
""I spend much of the day outside normally. From here to a week without leaving it will affect me a lot,"" said 36-year-old lawyer Gonzalo Miri. ""It totally changes my routine.""
Alejo Ortega, a 44-year-old business development consultant, said he was already struggling to juggle helping noisy kids with digital homework, cooking for the family, dealing with bumpy internet connections and focusing on his day job. 
Mónica Tepfer, a 37-year-old lawyer, said however she had all the tools to maintain - in part - her normal life.
""Yesterday I took an digital class from my masters degree and today I even had my dance lesson online.""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - A cafe in Thailand has started using a pulley system to serve coffee on wheels as coronavirus infections force businesses to practice social distancing. 
Thailand has reported more than 300 coronavirus cases since January, but more than half were found this week alone, heightening fears of contracting the disease through physical contact. 
To beat the fear, Art of Coffee in Bangkok has installed a rope and pulley system to serve drinks at a one-meter (three-foot) distance to limit contact between staff and customers. 
    ""I took this idea from social distancing in China. We heard that it works in curbing the outbreak of the disease and preventing new infections,"" said Apirak Chamraksin, the cafe's 39-year-old owner. 
The shop has also put up a sign saying it prefers electronic payments rather than cash, so staff do not have to handle notes and coins. Many believe some of Thailand's earlier cases contracted the virus via banknotes received from infected tourists. 
On the other end of the counter, customer Nopparattorn Promkaew waited as a cart carrying his iced coffee was pulled towards him. A bottle of hand sanitizer was placed nearby. 
He welcomed the initiative because the distance helped eliminate physical contact, even though the shop's staff already wear face masks and rubber gloves. 

""At first, I was a little worried about physical contact with others. But after seeing what the cafe did, I think they pay attention to customers' concerns. I'm very happy about it,"" he said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Opponents of Vladimir Putin's plans to amend the constitution so that he can run for president again in 2024 said on Friday they had been forced to scale back protests this weekend due to coronavirus, but would press ahead with some demonstrations.
Putin's changes, which have already been approved by both houses of parliament, would overturn a current constitutional ban on him running for president again in 2024, allowing him to potentially stay in power until 2036.
The changes are due to be put to a nationwide vote on April 22. That vote is for now still going ahead despite the suspension due to coronavirus of most other public events and restrictions on mass gatherings. 
The decision to postpone protests shows how coronavirus is compounding an already difficult situation for the anti-Kremlin opposition, which is divided over how to respond to Putin's constitutional shake-up. 
Critics had planned to take to the streets of Moscow and St Petersburg on Sunday to express their disgust over what some critics have called a constitutional coup, but said on Friday that those protests would be postponed due to coronavirus.
Protests in nine other towns and cities would take place on Sunday however, organizers said in a statement, but would be subject to government rules limiting the size of public gatherings due to coronavirus risks.
Russia has so far recorded 199 coronavirus cases and one person diagnosed with the virus has died.
Prominent opposition politician Alexei Navalny, who last summer helped bring up to 60,000 people to the streets of central Moscow, on Thursday said coronavirus was hobbling the opposition's attempts to mount a proper protest movement against the changes.
Navalny, who argued it would be irresponsible to organize mass demonstrations because of coronavirus risks, called for a boycott of the vote on Putin's changes. 
""The only tactic can be not recognizing the vote and its outcome,"" said Navalny, predicting it would be falsified and that taking part was a waste of people's time.
Other opposition figures, who want people to take part but vote no, have called for the vote to be postponed. 
""The coronavirus epidemic has become such a big threat that even (Kremlin) loyalists are sounding the alarm,"" Andrei Pivovarov, a co-ordinator of the 'vote no' campaign, wrote. 
""...Organizing a nationwide vote on constitutional amendments is like holding a party during a plague.""
Putin though, when earlier this month explaining his decision to back changing the constitution in a way that favored himself, cited coronavirus as one of the reasons why he needed to be allowed to have the option of extending his rule. 

""I strongly believe that a strong presidential vertical for our country, for Russia, is absolutely necessary,"" said Putin.

LONDON (Reuters) - The City of London's pubs emptied this week after the government advised people to work from home and avoid socialising, a devastating blow to businesses that have oiled the wheels of professions like finance, insurance and the law for centuries. 
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said people should stay away from pubs, clubs and cafes to slow the outbreak of coronavirus, which is advancing fastest in the capital.
But despite rumours and reports of an imminent shutdown, he has not so far ordered them to close as other countries including Ireland have done, leaving businesses in a limbo of needing to keep trading but with barely anybody to serve.
The Punch Tavern, an ornately tiled Victorian pub in London's Fleet Street and once a key watering hole for newspaper journalists, had three drinkers in on Thursday afternoon. They had called in to have ""one last drink in London"".
Thursday is usually the busiest day, general manager Paul Riley told Reuters, with the pub full of professionals from banks and legal chambers along with tourists.
""We've had five tables, 15-20 covers. Normally on this particular day we'll do anything like 500 covers through the day,"" he said.
He had already had to let two of his staff go and now needed to know what help would be coming from government.
""We were hoping that government would step in and say there's a compensation package,"" he said. ""I know every industry has been hit, but our industry has been directly affected because we rely on groups of people.""
The manager of another City pub, which is owned by a major brewer, said he had already lost 85-90% of sales.
""It is frustrating because the government is advising people not to go to places, but they are not saying the places should just close,"" he said. 
""We know we are going to lose money but we have to stay open because we've got to make a living.""
He said he had been told to slash workers' hours, close his kitchen early and clamp down on expenditure, including even turning off lights to cut electricity bills.
""My staff are worried because they can't pay their rent, they can't pay their bills,"" he said. ""I'm hoping by Friday at the latest we get an announcement from the government about what is going to happen.""
Johnson's advice has created a moral dilemma for drinkers: do they carry on supporting businesses that need their money but by doing so, possibly encourage the spread of the virus.
NO STANDING AT THE BAR
Tim Martin, chairman of JD Wetherspoon, one of Britain's biggest pub chains, said they should stay open.
""You can have rules such as no standing at the bar, cleaning down surfaces every half hour and so on,"" he told reporters on Friday. ""Closure is far more draconian. We don't think - as far as we understand it - it brings health benefits. It certainly doesn't bring economic benefits."" 
He said a recession had already started in a ""big, big way"" in the hospitality industry.
""The advice from the prime minister has caused pub trade and restaurant trade to drop a lot, and we have to have a look in the next few weeks,"" he said when asked about Wetherspoon's prospects.
He interpreted Johnson's advice as saying people should not be crowding ""cheek by jowl"" in pubs, rather than avoiding them. 
""Pubs and restaurants are part of the architecture of the country where people can buy drinks, buy food,"" he said.
""If you go out don't stand at the bar, sit at a table by yourself and have lunch, go to the loo and then go home, which a lot of people rely on doing, then we are happy enough.""
Ian Brooking, an energy company owner who was drinking in the Punch with his son and a colleague, said the advice about social interaction set the coronavirus crisis apart.
""That's the fundamental difference between this crisis and other crises: you can't come together,"" he said.
""If this was a wartime environment, this place would be heaving with people. Humans need interaction.""
General Manager Riley said if it was over in a few months, the Punch would bounce back. 
""Our regulars will come back,"" he said. ""Our clients are right on the doorstep and if you're strong beforehand and you have a good reputation, which we have, you will expect them to come out.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - Union leaders representing South Korean support workers for the U.S. military demonstrated on Friday outside the United States embassy as a disagreement over cost-sharing threatens to relegate thousands of employees to unpaid leave next month.
The longtime allies are embroiled in a dispute over how much each should pay to support the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War that ended in an armistice, rather than a peace treaty.
About 30 union leaders at Friday's gathering, limited by Seoul's curbs on protests over coronavirus fears, urged the United States to stop using workers' jobs as a negotiating tool, and demanded better protections in South Korean labor law.
""The United States should immediately stop this illegal behavior that takes an ally's military situation and the livelihood of the laborers as hostage,"" said Kim Dong-myeong, the head of the Federation of Korean Trade Unions.
U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly demanded that South Korea pay much more than its current contribution of about $900 million to the troop costs.
The two countries held a seventh round talks in Los Angeles this week, nearly three months after the last ""special measures agreement"" expired at the end of 2019, but on Friday, South Korea said they ended with no agreement.
""The two sides still have differences in their positions, but they agreed to continue close consultations to minimize the absence of an agreement and contribute to the South Korea-U.S. alliance,"" the foreign ministry said in a statement.
With no new pact, many of the almost 9,000 South Koreans employed by the U.S. military command will be placed on unpaid leave at the beginning of April, though U.S. officials have said they will cover the payroll for any workers deemed essential.
""Once the unpaid leave for the 9,000 begins, not only will it threaten the survival of our South Korean workers, but also make a gap in U.S. Forces Korea's mission,"" Choe Ung-sik, president of the USFK Korean Employees Union, told Reuters.
""A gap in USFK's mission is a threat to South Korea's security.""
USFK commander Gen. Robert Abrams met Choe last month and said allocated funds would run out by March 31.
""Without an agreed upon Special Measures Agreement, USFK is out of money and must prepare for a potential furlough,"" he added, the USFK said in a statement.

Barcelona's airport is nearly empty, as are airports across Spain, because of a partial lockdown imposed to fight the coronavirus epidemic.
The police bomb squad Tedax confirmed there were no explosives in the car.
Regional police tweeted a picture of a gray car inside the terminal, with all its doors open and two officers, one with a dog, checking it.
""When they were detained, they made an Islamist-type proclamation and we do not know yet what their intention was,"" regional police chief Eduard Sallent told a news conference.

SHANGHAI/SHENZHEN, China (Reuters) - Expatriates living in China, who left in droves when the coronavirus outbreak hit in earnest in late January, face rising hurdles as they rush to return and avoid being stranded overseas. 
As countries around the globe go into lockdown even as local cases in China fall sharply, expats face flight cancellations, quarantine policies that differ by city and change by the day and lock-downs in their home countries.
On Friday, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways said it was cutting capacity by 96 percent in April and May. 
Ivana Hauserova, based in Shanghai, left in early February.
""We were afraid for our daughter, what would happen if one of us was sent to quarantine,"" she said from the Czech Republic. ""Europe was safe at that time.""
Since then, countries such as Italy, France, Spain and the United States have seen case numbers soar.
Now, Hauserova wants to return to China as she feels people in her home country are not taking the virus seriously enough.
But she has had two flights cancelled and worries she won't be able to go back to Shanghai.
""Honestly, now I regret that I left Shanghai,"" she said.
QUARANTINE 
As containing imported cases becomes China's priority, quarantining and testing overseas arrivals is increasingly stringent.
Expat chatgroups, once awash with tips on how to leave China, now thrum with tips on how to get back.
Last week Beijing said all people flying into the capital would be quarantined at government-designated facilities for 14 days at the traveller's cost, but Shanghai is only selectively quarantining arrivals from high-risk countries. 
""We're just really exhausted trying to predict the policy, because it changes every day,"" said Naiwen Ting, a U.S. citizen who left with her family on Jan 20 for a three week holiday in Australia that has turned into a two-month sojourn. 
""You're travelling, without it ending, with a suitcase,"" said Ting, who wants to return to her fashion business in Shanghai.
Increasingly scarce flights are in some cases becoming prohibitively expensive. This week, economy class flights from Australia to Shanghai cost between 9,500 yuan ($1,343) and 10,000 yuan, more than double the usual roughly 4,000 yuan. 
""BUSINESS IS PICKING UP""
Waiting times on arrival have soared as China tries to catalog travel histories to help stem imported cases.
American Joanie Murta arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday and said it took over eight hours of queueing to get through checks while crossing into the mainland at the Shenzhen Bay border checkpoint, where there was no soap or water in the bathrooms.
More than 245,000 people have been infected by the virus across the world and over 10,000 have died.
Some expats are trying to slip through the closing doors by re-routing to places not on China's high-risk list and staying there for 14 days to avoid quarantine.
One Belgian expat who declined to be named said he plans to return to Shanghai on Saturday, having stayed in Taiwan for two weeks to try and side-step quarantine policy in the city after staying in France.
""Now business is picking up, they are opening their stores again ... it's a good moment for me to come back,"" he said.

""We've got a moat, and we're not afraid to use it,"" read the front page of Tasmania's The Mercury newspaper on Friday, after state premier Peter Gutwein declared a state of emergency and the ""toughest border restrictions in Australia"". 
Australia requires all people returning from overseas to self-isolate for 14-days and is banning all foreigners and non-residents from entering from Friday night, but no other state has imposed restrictions on domestic travel.
As of Friday, Tasmania had 10 cases of COVID-19, with no fatalities. The national total is 785 cases and 7 deaths.
The restrictions however will not apply to the Aurora Australis, carrying 55 Antarctic expeditioners and 26 crew, which is due to dock on Tuesday. Many of the expeditioners have spent 12 months living on sub-Antarctic Macquarie Island conducting scientific research.
""They have been in splendid isolation,"" said Australian Antarctic Division operations manager Robb Clifton.
As well as people travelling directly from Australia's bases in Antarctica, Tasmania will exempt health, emergency and transport workers from its quarantine requirement.
Australia's three bases on the Antarctic continent, Mawson, Davis and Casey, have been ""completely cut off,"" Clifton said.
""These expeditioners and the people on the International Space Station are probably the most secure people in the human population,"" he said.
Tasmania is a one-hour flight or 10-hour ferry crossing from the mainland city of Melbourne, 445 km (275 miles) away.
Forty per cent of the island is wilderness or protected areas.
Qantas Airways is reducing flights to Tasmania from March 29, but the island's ferry service will continue to carry freight to and from the mainland.
""We will have the essential supplies we need,"" Gutwein told local media.
Tourism, international students, seafood and dairy are Tasmania's major exports, with China a major customer.
Tasmania-based Huon Aquaculture , which produces 19,000 tonnes of fish a year from coastal salmon farms, is classified as an ""essential service"" under the new border rules, which gives it priority access to freight space.
Online sales for Huon's salmon doubled in March as anxiety over food supply gripped mainland Australia. 
""Remember that everyone has to eat,"" founder Peter Bender said in an email to staff. 
""People might be unable to go to the pub, the movies, or visit a sporting venue but they still have to eat.""

WASHINGTON/DUBAI (Reuters) - The United States sent Iran a blunt message this week: the spread of the coronavirus will not save it from U.S. sanctions that are choking off its oil revenues and isolating its economy.
Iran is the Middle Eastern nation worst hit by coronavirus, with its death toll climbing to 1,284 and one person dying from it every 10 minutes and 50 becoming infected every hour, the health ministry said.
The United States, which argues that its ""maximum pressure"" campaign to curb Iran's nuclear, missile and regional activities does not stop the flow of humanitarian goods, imposed new sanctions this week.
The Trump administration blacklisted five companies based in the United Arab Emirates, three in mainland China, three in Hong Kong and one in South Africa for trade in Iran's petrochemicals.
""Washington's increased pressure against Iran is a crime against humanity,"" an Iranian official told Reuters. ""All the world should help each other to overcome this disease.""
Some analysts suggested the Trump administration should do more to speed the flow of humanitarian goods into Iran, though they saw little evidence to suggest this was in the offing. 
""Our policy of maximum pressure on the regime continues,"" Brian Hook, the U.S. Special Representative for Iranian Affairs, told reporters. ""U.S. sanctions are not preventing aid from getting to Iran.""
On Monday, China called on the United States to give Iran sanctions relief for humanitarian reasons but U.S. officials, foreign diplomats and analysts saw no signs of this.
""While Iran is an epicenter of this virus outbreak and facing true economic catastrophe ... there will be no relief on sanctions,"" said Elizabeth Rosenberg of the Center for a New American Security think tank.
Hook said Washington sent a diplomatic note to Tehran offering help with coronavirus ""and it was quickly rejected.""
He also blamed Iran's leadership for its coronavirus woes, saying that Iran ""spends billions on terrorism and foreign wars"" and that if it spent one tenth of this ""on a better health care system, the Iranian people would have been much better off.""
In what might be a gesture to Washington, Tehran released U.S. citizen Michael White from its custody though he must stay in Iran.
Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution think tank said Iran allowing White or other detained U.S. citizens to fly home might appeal to President Donald Trump.
""I still don't believe this administration wants to provide a lot of leeway to the Iranian authorities but that doesn't mean they can't or shouldn't be looking for every opportunity to"" get medical supplies into Iran, she said.
The outbreak in Iran was likely to spread as Iranians travel for the Nowruz new year's celebration, she added, saying this could hurt U.S. security partners across the region.
""Iran is Italy, only on steroids,"" Maloney said, alluding to the outbreak in Italy, whose coronavirus death toll on Thursday overtook that of China, where the virus emerged.
Mark Dubowitz, an Iran hawk with the Foundation for Defense of Democracies policy group, said Washington could send medical goods to Iran via private groups but should not ease sanctions.
""At the very time Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias in Iraq are killing Americans and Brits and others, this would be exactly the wrong time to be providing any kind of economic relief to the regime,"" he said, referring to last week's attack on a military camp in Iraq that killed one British and two U.S. personnel.. 
""We should be sending medical supplies directly to Iranians through non-governmental organizations and bypass the regime.""
Iranians appeared to have mixed feelings about whether Washington was making its outbreak worse.
""America's sanctions are preventing Iran from getting necessary medicine and equipment to fight against this virus. They have to lift it,"" said dentist Arash Hosseini, 52, in Tehran.

But Twitter user @fnikjoo, suggested sanctions relief would just provide ""Money to support more terrorists in the region and beyond.""

619,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 04:25AM ET</span>",Coronavirus stokes fear among Venezuelan migrants in Latin America,"By Oliver Griffin, Javier Andres Rojas and Marco Aquino
BOGOTA/LIMA (Reuters) - For millions of Venezuelan migrants who fled the crisis in their homeland, many struggling daily in countries across Latin America to afford food and rent, the spread of coronavirus threatens to bring new hardship.
More than 4 million Venezuelans have left their country since 2015, as economic and political upheaval caused shortages of food and basic goods as well as the collapse of the health and education systems. 
From Buenos Aires to Bogota, many of these emigrees scrape a living hawking goods on the streets of Latin American cities, working as cab drivers or waiting on tables in restaurants. 
Most lack access to healthcare and state welfare, and have no savings to fall back on if they cannot work. With countries across the region imposing quarantines, curfews and border closures to stem the spread of coronavirus, many migrants now fear they will be trapped and more vulnerable than before.
""We left one country for the welfare of the children but we aren't going to stay without knowing if we have access to health care,"" said Maricarmel Luho, 25, who fled Venezuela with her husband and four children to neighboring Colombia, where they survive by begging and selling items such as candies.
With Colombia, which has confirmed more than 100 cases of the disease and imposed a quarantine on the capital Bogota, Luho says she is already hard-pressed to afford basic necessities. 
""What scares us is that we get sick with coronavirus and no one will provide us with medical treatment.""
In Colombia and other countries like Mexico only emergency medical care is available to Venezuelan migrants who have irregular immigration status.
The informally employed generally get by without health insurance, sending meager earnings to relatives in Venezuela who live off remittances.
Even those with more stable work fear the coronavirus, which has led to the deaths of more than 8,700 people worldwide.
""We don't know what's going to happen to our jobs,"" said Jhoel Colmenares, a 24-year-old bartender working in Bogota who comes from the northern Venezuelan city of Barquisimeto. ""I work in a restaurant and don't know if they might close because of a quarantine.""
Colombia's health system is poorly equipped to handle migrants sick with coronavirus, the International Rescue Committee said this week.
Moreover, lack of secure access to food, shelter and running water could make migrants a vector for spreading the disease, it said. 
Many Venezuelans fear that they may experience worse levels of xenophobia once the virus spreads, said Juan Carlos Viloria, a doctor originally from Caracas who now lives in Colombia, home to some 1.7 million Venezuelans. 
""We still don't have an infected Venezuelan migrant but once we do, (xenophobia) will be much greater,"" Viloria said. ""Nobody will want to give shelter to them.""
OVERBURDENED HOSPITALS
In Peru, where there are more than 230 confirmed cases, the government has suspended constitutional rights such as freedom of movement and assembly and declared nightly curfews. 
Venezuelans who depend on street-selling are out of work. 
""They cannot go outside,"" said Rene Cobenas, who runs a shelter for migrants in Lima. ""They don't have money for day-to-day needs.""
President Martin Vizcarra has promised a payment of 380 soles ($106) to Peru's poorest 3 million families, but the measure does not extend to Venezuelans.
The tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants who have crossed into Brazil are luckier - they have full access to the public health system.
In the border state of Roraima, 40% of the hospital beds are occupied by Venezuelans. At the Boa Vista maternity hospital, a daily average of 10 babies are born to Venezuelan mothers.
Roraima this week closed its border to Venezuelans in an effort to relieve the overwhelmed health system in anticipation of the virus reaching the state.
""Today our public services, not just health but also education and public security, are totally overburdened,"" said Ricardo Amaral, a spokesman for Roraima's governor. 
Officially, about 650,000 Venezuelans have crossed the border into Roraima, but actual figures may exceed 1 million given that many do not register to stay in Brazil and simply continue on to other South American nations.
On Thursday, hygiene kits and soap were handed out to migrants at the Boa Vista bus station, a meeting point for Venezuelans seeking work and a place to sleep if they are not among the 7,000 already in shelters.
In Venezuela, which has fewer than 50 confirmed cases, President Nicolas Maduro has asked people to stay home in a social quarantine that could worsen the country's humanitarian crisis.
As they wait for news of further measures, Venezuelans abroad were doing their best to keep working.
""I'll be honest, we are very afraid,"" said Yaniris Cantillo, 26, who sells juice to vehicles stopped at traffic lights in Bogota. ""If they order mandatory isolation or we have to do a quarantine, we don't know what we will do.""
""If we don't go out, we don't eat.""

Qatar in 2018 eliminated exit visas for many foreign migrant workers. But the reform did not apply to domestic workers, government and public institution staff, the oil and gas sector, and workers employed at sea and in agriculture.
The Gulf state, which hopes the 2022 World Cup will boost its economy and development, is eager to show it is creating a modern system that protects all expatriate workers.
The decision removing exit visa requirements, ""is applicable to employees of the ministries, public bodies, institutions and other government agencies, oil and gas sector and its subsidiaries, marine vessels in the waters of the State of Qatar, agriculture and irrigation and private office,"" according an interior ministry statement citing foreign ministry spokeswoman Lolwah Alkhater.
The decision, to be implemented from Saturday, excludes ""5% of the employees in these sectors, who will continue to submit an application with their employers to obtain an exit permit,"" said the statement.

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan, which has won global praise for its effective action against the coronavirus, is rolling out a mobile phone-based ""electronic fence"" that uses location-tracking to ensure people who are quarantined stay in their homes.
Governments around the world are combining technology and human efforts to enforce quarantines that require people who have been exposed to the virus to stay in their homes, but Taiwan's system is believed to be the first to use mobile phone tracking for that purpose.
""The goal is to stop people from running around and spreading the infection,"" said Jyan Hong-wei, head of Taiwan's Department of Cyber Security, who leads efforts to work with telecom carriers to combat the virus.
The system monitors phone signals to alert police and local officials if those in home quarantine move away from their address or turn off their phones. Jyan said authorities will contact or visit those who trigger an alert within 15 minutes.
Officials also call twice a day to ensure people don't avoid tracking by leaving their phones at home. 
Privacy concerns have limited the use of location data for anti-coronavirus efforts in countries such as the United States. But the system has drawn few complaints in Taiwan, which has reported only reported 108 cases of the virus, compared with more than 80,900 in neighbouring China.
Many Asian countries are on a war footing to prevent further spread after a surge of infections among people travelling from other countries, especially Europe.
In Hong Kong, location-tracking wristbands are given to those put under quarantine. In Singapore, the government uses text messages to contact people, who must click on a link to prove they are at home.
Thailand has rolled out a mobile app that anyone arriving at an airport must download to help monitor where they have been in the event that they test positive for the virus. Vietnam's capital, Hanoi, this week also launched a mobile app to help track cases, and it could be used to enforce quarantines.
Other countries, including South Korea and Israel, are using satellite-based phone tracking for so-called contact tracing to see where infected individuals might have passed SARS-CoV-2 to others. China has used a wide range of methods to monitor the health and whereabouts of people and enforce restrictions on movement.
Taiwan's electronic fence has drawn some complaints for its intrusiveness. 
""It's creepy that the government is teaming up with telecommunications companies to track our phones,"" said a flight attendant in Taipei who was put under 14-day quarantine after returning from Europe in mid-March. 
The woman, who identified herself as Xiaomei, said she was scolded by a local administrator after failing to pick up a check-in phone call in the morning when she was asleep. 
""They said the police will come to me if I missed another phone call,"" she said. ""I'm treated like a prisoner.""
Quarantine violators can be fined up to T$1 million ($32,955).

More than 670 infections in the region have been linked to the gathering last month at a mosque on the outskirts of the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur. A total of 16,000 people of many nationalities attended the four-day event.
Reuters reported on Thursday that authorities were trying to track down an estimated 2,000 Rohingya who had attended the gathering. Rights groups said ""several hundred"" Rohingya attended and that the overall estimate included other refugees, such as ethnic Burmese Muslims.
Refugees are considered illegal immigrants in Malaysia and activists say they may fear coming forward for testing.
""We have increased awareness and have advised the Rohingya to get tested,"" said Bo Min Naing, president of the Rohingya Society in Malaysia, estimating that 400-600 Rohingya attended the gathering.
He has been sending voice messages to fellow Rohingya on the coronavirus and urging them to get tested if they attended the Feb. 27-March 1 gathering.
Rights activist Lilianne Fan said leaders of the Burmese Muslim community living in Malaysia have agreed to get participants of the mosque gathering to present themselves for testing, though some ""do fear arrest and other repercussions"".
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) said on its website it had requested the government not to arrest any refugee or asylum seeker without documents or with expired documents as the agency had postponed all appointments, amid two-week movement curbs in the country to contain the spread of the virus.
Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The UNHCR has also written to community leaders and urged them to get all refugees who participated in the mosque activities to immediately contact health authorities without fearing arrests, the leaders said.
Around 4,000 of the 14,500 Malaysia residents who attended have yet to be screened for coronavirus, the government said on Thursday.
There were 1,500 other participants from countries including Brunei, Cambodia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and the Philippines.
""As you can imagine, given the circumstances where the healthcare systems are over-stretched at this time, we have not received any official notifications of refugees and asylum-seekers who have been infected or who have been tested,"" UNHCR Malaysia told Reuters in an email.

Malaysia has 900 coronavirus cases in all, the highest in Southeast Asia, 576 of them linked to the mosque event.

624,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 20, 2020 12:40AM ET</span>","Delayed by sanctions, border checks, first medical aid trickles into North Korea","By Ju-min Park and Sangmi Cha
SEOUL (Reuters) - The first shipments of international medical aid are due to arrive at North Korea's borders this week to shore up its defenses against the coronavirus, but strict border controls could mean the stream of supplies remains a trickle.
Some aid organizations had to get emergency sanction exemptions from the United Nations to clear the way for the shipments and are now navigating North Korea's border controls imposed in a bid to shut out the virus.
North Korea has reported no confirmed cases of the new coronavirus that was first detected in China late last year, though a top U.S military official said last week he is ""fairly certain"" there were infections in North Korea.
North Korea is especially vulnerable to an outbreak, as its health system lacks resources, in part, aid organizations say, because of international sanctions imposed over its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
Aid groups have made urgent pleas for the United Nations to grant sanctions exemptions and it has approved six-month waivers for the World Health Organization, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and Doctors without Borders to send thermometers, portable ventilators, resuscitators, gloves, face shields, surgical masks, gowns and goggles.
The U.N. children's fund, UNICEF, which said it did not need a waiver to import personal protective equipment such as gloves, protective suits and respiratory protective equipment, expected its first shipment to be delivered to North Korea by land from China this week.
But North Korea's own strict border quarantine measures have kept some initial shipments waiting, humanitarian sources say.
More supplies of items from masks to test machines, sent by international agencies, were being held up in China, despite North Korea asking for them, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. They declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. 
""North Koreans need assistance and have asked for it, but things are now on hold,"" one source from a humanitarian group said. 
The North's state-run KCNA news agency reported on March 13 that as part of ""super strong prevention measures"" all imported goods were being quarantined for 10 days. State media has shown workers in protective gear disinfecting trains and trucks.
Maya Zahran, media coordinator at Doctors without Borders, told Reuters their supplies had arrived in Beijing and the border city of Dandong, and North Korean authorities had agreed to facilitate the transport despite the border closures.
She said she could not confirm when the supplies would reach North Korea. 
The IFRC said it was working hard to send ""urgently required goods"", but had to consider ""restrictions on incoming goods"" to North Korea. The federation did not say when it expected its shipment to arrive.
The WHO did not respond to calls from Reuters. 
IMPROVISED HEALTH SYSTEM
Experts say the planned supplies to help contain the coronavirus in North Korea are far short of what it needs.
Harvard Medical School’s Kee Park, who has worked on health care projects in North Korea, said a lack of testing equipment may mean infections are going undiscovered.
""To confirm it you have to actually do confirmatory diagnostic testing,"" he said.
North Korea has said it is monitoring thousands of people with possible symptoms. Russia said it had donated 1,500 coronavirus test kits at North Korea's request. 
""We should do everything in our power to provide help without delay,"" Park said. ""Because this is an emergency situation.""
North Korea has a high number of doctors per capita, and the authoritarian government is capable of controlling or blocking the movement of people.
But its health system is chronically under-resourced, defectors and foreign medical experts said. 
Garment factories were manufacturing masks instead of clothes, state media reported.
On Tuesday, leader Kim Jong Un broke ground for a big new hospital in the capital, Pyongyang. He lamented the poor health sector and ordered that the facility be completed by October.
Many North Korean defectors say sick people have to rely on smuggled medicine or illicit drugs for treatment. 
John Linton, head of International Health Care Centre at Severance Hospital in Seoul, said some doctors scoured mountains for medicinal herbs.
North Korea has made ""indirect"" requests to South Korean aid groups for supplies including masks, said Linton, who has worked on building operating rooms and tuberculosis projects in North Korea. He did not know if any had been sent.
Sanctions prohibit the import of computers or metal objects to North Korea, which restricts it ability to repair medical equipment, Linton said.
""IV fluid is actually made in hospitals,"" he said. ""Beer bottles or whatever bottles are used as containers for IV fluids, made at home.""

While Taiwan has only reported 108 cases of the virus, large rises in recent days from people returning from overseas has prompted some people to rush to supermarkets to stock up, even as the government says there is no need to panic and it will punish hoarding and profiteering.
Writing on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page late on Thursday in a post entitled ""Buy as much as possible, there's plenty of goods"", Taiwan Premier Su Tseng-chang said it was the ideal opportunity to buy more Taiwanese products in a boon for the economy.
""Taiwan is a kingdom of fruits, a kingdom of fisheries, and a big food processing country. During the Wuhan pneumonia epidemic, as the economy is slowing down, of course the government encourages everyone to enthusiastically buy,"" he wrote.
Speaking to reporters on Friday, Su said there were lots of supplies in Taiwan, including of toilet paper which has sold out in many countries.
""If people aren't spending outside and want to cook for themselves at home, buy more vegetables and fruit, buy more Taiwanese agricultural products, cheer on the farmers. This is a great thing,"" he said, adding that the island's farmers would welcome the support.
Su is well-known for his wry sense of humour.
During a brief toilet paper panic last month, he called for calm saying people ""only have one butt-hole,"" to widespread amusement across the island.
Export-reliant Taiwan's economy has been buffeted by the virus. On Thursday the central bank cut interest rates for the first time in more than four years to a new low and shaved its outlook for economic growth this year to 1.92% from 2.57% forecasted in December.
The government is also rolling out a T$60 billion ($1.98 billion) stimulus package.

RENTON, Washington (Reuters) - Doctors in Seattle have been reduced to making their own face masks out of sheets of plastic, after a global shortage of medical protective gear has hit Washington state, an epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in the United States.
Ahead of an anticipated shortage of medical supplies, hospital staff met in a conference room south of Seattle to make homemade masks for the doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals on the frontline of tackling the coronavirus outbreak.
""We're days away from running out of the equipment we need,"" said Melissa Tizon, Associate Vice President of Providence St. Joseph Health, which runs 51 hospitals across five western states. ""We're expecting more shipments later on but until then we've got to improvise.""
With coronavirus cases surging past 13,000 in the United State, health care workers are dealing with not only a shortage of masks but also surgical gowns and protective eye gear.
President Donald Trump, speaking about medical gear at a White House briefing on Thursday, said ""millions of masks"" were in production, but did not give details.
""We have helped out, and there are right now millions of masks being made. But this is really for the local governments, governors and people within the state, depending on the way they divided it up. And they'll do that, and they're doing a very good job of it.""
When asked by a reporter at the briefing why the increased production of masks was not reaching hospitals, Trump said the medical system was ""obsolete"" and the production system ""wasn't meant for this"" emergency.
""Nobody knew there'd be a pandemic or an epidemic of this proportion,"" Trump said. ""Nobody has ever seen anything like this before.""
Vice President Mike Pence said at the same briefing, ""We've vastly increased the supply of medical masks, and we're going to continue to put a priority on making sure that we're calling on industry at every level.""
Meanwhile, many hospitals in other states have issued emergency calls for private companies to donate face masks and other items that can be used as medical protective gear.
The Illinois Health and Hospital Association on Thursday, made that plea to help the state's 200 hospitals, asking for donations of masks from construction companies, dentists, veterinarians and any other group that might have the masks, called N95s.

""Hospitals all over the state are in jeopardy of potentially running out of critically needed protective medical supplies,"" said the associations president and chief executive officer A.J. Wilhelmi.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India hanged four men on Friday who were convicted for the rape and murder of a young woman on a bus in New Delhi in 2012, in a case that shocked the world and shamed the country over its appalling record for crimes against women.
The men were executed at dawn in Tihar jail, on the outskirts of the capital, two prison officials said.
Hundreds of police were deployed outside the jail to control a crowd that waited to celebrate the execution. Some held placards that read ""Justice for women"" and ""Hang the culprits"".
The crime, which happened on the night of December 16, 2012, sparked massive protests and global outrage. The victim was dubbed Nirbhaya - the fearless one - by the Indian press, as she could not be named under Indian law.
""Today, justice has been done after seven years,"" the victim's mother told reporters outside the prison. ""I salute Indian judiciary and thank god for hearing our prayers...my daughter's soul can now rest in peace."" 
Six men were arrested for the brutal attack. One suspect, Ram Singh, was found dead in his jail cell in March 2013, having apparently taken his own life.
Another, who was aged 17 at the time, was released in 2015 after serving three years in a reform facility - the maximum term possible for a juvenile in India.
The four hanged on Friday were gym instructor Vinay Sharma, bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, fruit-seller Pawan Gupta and unemployed Mukesh Singh, who were all sentenced to death by a fast-track court in 2013.
In 2017, the Supreme Court upheld death sentences against four men, with judges ruling the crime met the ""rarest of the rare"" standard required to justify capital punishment in India.  
India's president rejected pleas for clemency from the condemned men, after the Supreme Court dismissed their pleas for a review of the death sentences. 
Attacked on a moving bus and left for dead on roadside, the victim, a 23-year-old physiotherapy student, clung to life for two weeks before succumbing to her injuries. She died in a hospital in Singapore, where she had been transferred in a desperate attempt to save her. 
Outrage over her death led to India passing tough new laws against sexual violence, including the death penalty for rape in some cases.
Still, one woman reported a rape every 15 minutes on average in India in 2018, according to government data released last month, underlining the country's reputation as one of the worst places in the world to be female.
Women reported almost 34,000 rapes in 2018, barely changed from the year before. Just over 85% led to charges, and 27% to convictions, according to the annual crime report released by the federal home ministry.

Activists say the government statistics understate the number of rapes as it is still considered a taboo by conservative Indians to report sexual violence.

630,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 08:00PM ET</span>",Ireland's Fianna Fail sees no new government for at least a month,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The leader of Ireland's Fianna Fail said he did not think a new government would be formed by the Easter holidays in the middle of next month as lawmakers put almost all their resources into the worsening coronavirus outbreak.
Acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael party agreed last week to step up coalition talks with rivals Fianna Fail, as both said the spread of the virus had increased the urgency in forming a new government which can command a majority.
Ireland has since shut schools, universities, childcare facilities and pubs and while talks between the two parties took place over the last two days, Martin said the emergency measures needed to fight the health crisis clearly took precedence.
""At this stage I don't see it by Easter, because of the range of activity around the COVID (coronavirus) issue. It's not within my gift to give you a timetable,"" Martin told Ireland's Virgin Media television station in an interview.
Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have 37 and 35 seats respectively in the fractured 160-seat parliament, meaning they need the support of at least one smaller party or group of independent lawmakers to reach a majority.
Both center-right parties steadfastly refuse to govern with the left-wing, pro-Irish unity Sinn Fein, which surged to 37 seats at the Feb. 8 election. 
The Green Party, who are next on 12 seats and have been courted by Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, have called on all parties to suspend talks on forming a new administration and instead build a temporary national government.
Martin again rejected that proposal but said he ""would love"" the Greens be part of the next government. 
The Fianna Fail leader said decisions to ""very significantly reboot"" the economy once the worst of outbreak had passed would need to be taken by a new government.
That view was shared by Fine Gael when it said earlier on Thursday that it ""will lead the rebuilding of the Irish economy again"".

There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack in the town of Tarkint, which is about 125 km (78 miles) north of the city of Gao. Mali's army has repeatedly suffered heavy casualties from jihadist fighters active in the area with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State. 
The army said earlier in the day that just two soldiers had died but tweeted later that the death toll had ""heavily evolved"" to 29 killed and five wounded. 
Vast swathes of central and northern Mali are effectively lawless, used by the jihadists as a base for attacks in Mali and into neighboring Niger and Burkina Faso, where security has deteriorated markedly over the past year. 
Former colonial power France has had thousands of troops across the semi-arid band beneath the Sahara Desert known as the Sahel, but French officials acknowledge they have failed to slow the violence. 
French army chief Francois Lecointre told senators last month that the Malian, Nigerien and Burkinabe armies were losing the equivalent of one battalion per year to the militants' attacks.

PRISTINA (Reuters) - People across Kosovo went to their balconies banging pots in a protest to urge ruling parties to deal with coronavirus and end a political crisis which may bring down the government next week.
A coalition partner in the Kosovo government said on Wednesday it will file a motion for a no-confidence vote in the government following the sacking of the interior minister over a dispute whether to declare a state of emergency to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
Isa Mustafa, the leader of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), said the sacking was a culmination of differences between the coalition partners on whether a tariff of 100% on goods produced in Serbia should be abolished.
""They are looking after their business. It is not time for revenge they have to look after people,"" said Gazmend Vokshi, 60, an architect. 
""If they continue like this they (politicians) will not have time to look after us and there will be a lot of victims,"" said Naim Miftari, 34.
Kosovo has registered 20 people with the virus since last Friday when the first case was reported.
It has already closed all schools, borders, flights, bars and restaurants. Only supermarkets and pharmacies remain open.
Most of the people with coronavirus came from Italy or are related to someone who returned from Italy.
Mustafa's LDK and Vetevendosje, the party of Prime Minister Albin Kurti, formed the government less than two months ago.
With 29 members in the 120-seat Parliament, Kurti's Cabinet is unlikely to survive the vote.
Kosovo introduced the tariff in November 2018, saying it would be abolished once Belgrade recognized Kosovo. The move halted the dialogue on normalizing relations between Belgrade and Pristina and angered the European Union and the United States, which backed Kosovo's declaration of independence.
Last week, the United States halted some $50 million in aid to Kosovo over its refusal to lift the tariffs.
Serbia, which lost control over Kosovo after the NATO bombing in 1999, refuses to recognize the independence of its former province, and considers Kosovo an integral part of its territory despite the 2008 declaration of independence.
But in order to progress on its path toward the European Union accession process, Serbia has to normalize ties with Pristina and eventually recognize Kosovo, allowing it to become a member of the United Nations.

""Amazon Pantry is not accepting new orders at this time while we work to fulfill open orders and restock items following increased demand,"" a company spokesperson said.
The service, which sells non-perishable groceries from cereals to soaps, has seen huge demand despite consumers thronging supermarkets and grocery stores for everything from toilet papers and canned foods. 
Amazon did not say when the service will be back, but said it was working with partners to get the items back in stock as quickly as possible. 

The move comes after the company resorted to receive only vital supplies at its U.S. and UK and other European warehouses until April 5, as it tries to free up space for medical and household goods in high demand.

CREMONA, Italy (Reuters) - Doctor Romano Paolucci, who came out of retirement to help at a hospital in Italy's coronavirus epicenter, says one of the hardest things for him is not so much seeing people die - he is used to that. 
It is seeing them die alone, without a loved one by their side, often having to say their final farewell over a scratchy cell phone line.
Paolucci is one of 70 doctors working long and exhausting shifts at the small Oglio Po Hospital, which until only a month ago was a normal provincial institution treating everything from tonsils to tumors.
Now, it has been totally converted to treat coronavirus as Cremona province became the fourth-worst impacted province in Italy.
""I would say that we are at the end of our strength. This is a small hospital and we are taking in a lot of people ... capacity is filled,"" he said in a hallway amid the sounds of ventilators pumping oxygen, equipment beeping, and colleagues bustling.
More of that type of noise would be music to his ears.
""We do not have sufficient resources and especially staff because apart from everything else, now the staff are beginning to get sick,"" he said.
While medical staff work exhausting shifts of 12 hour or more and struggle to keep the patients alive, they also have to deal with the heartbreak of people dying without a loved one by their side, a measure necessary to contain the virus. 
""We have started a service in which we contact relatives on the phone to explain to them what is happening. So there is at least some contact,"" he said. 
""Patients who are able to call themselves use their cell phones but the older patients aren't able to because they are just not used to it. So we try and keep in contact with the family.""
COUNTING THE DEAD
Nearly every inch of the hospital has been turned over to the coronavirus emergency, said Doctor Daniela Ferrari (NYSE:RACE). There is no longer a paediatric ward or a cardiology ward and only three beds have been kept aside for emergency surgery.
Six of the nine surgeons tested positive and had to go home, she said, adding that the hospital had a rate of about 20 percent of staff infected.
Daniela Confalonieri, a nurse at the an San Raffaele hospital in the Lombardy regional capital of Milan, is also worried about sick medical staff. 
""We too are working in a situation of total emergency. The problem is that so many of our staff are at home as they are (have tested) positive. So that leaves a handful of us to run everything,"" she said on a video posted on the internet. 
""Psychological tension has gone through the roof. Unfortunately we can't contain the situation in Lombardy, there's a high level of contagion and we're not even counting the dead any more,"" she said.
Officials in Rome are counting the dead, however, and every evening at 6 p.m. the grim news is read to a weary public that has been in a national lockdown for more than a week. 
The toll rose on Thursday to 2,168 in Lombardy, the most affected area, and 3,405 nationwide, overtaking the total number of deaths so far registered in China.
Back at the Cremona hospital, nurse Luca Dall' Asta, spoke for many medical staff on the front lines. 

""We have the right spirit even if we are very tired but we try and keep ourselves going amongst ourselves and give it everything we've got because now isn't the time for polemics. We just have to work and move forward,"" he said.

With over 242,000 infections and nearly 10,000 deaths, the epidemic has stunned the world and drawn comparisons with painful periods such as World War Two, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu.
U.N. chief Antonio Guterres warned that a global recession, ""perhaps of record dimensions"", was a near certainty.
""This is a moment that demands coordinated, decisive, and innovative policy action from the world's leading economies,"" Guterres told reporters via a video conference. ""We are in an unprecedented situation and the normal rules no longer apply.""
Tourism and airlines have been particularly battered, as the world's citizens hunker down to minimize contact and curb the spread of the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness. But few sectors have been spared by a crisis threatening a lengthy global recession.
The United States is urging Americans not to travel abroad at all and could announce restrictions at the U.S.-Mexican border on Friday. They would be similar to the closure of the U.S.-Canada border to non-essential traffic.
Markets have suffered routs unseen since the 2008 financial debacle, with investors rushing to the U.S. dollar as a safe haven. Wall Street tried to bounce back on Thursday. The benchmark S&P 500 (SPX) closed up 0.5%, still around 30% off highs reached last month. U.S. oil prices posted their largest one-day gain ever, rising 25%. (N) [O/R]
Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Asia have slashed interest rates and opened liquidity taps to try to stabilise economies hit by quarantined consumers, broken supply chains, disrupted transport and paralysed businesses.
The virus, thought to have originated from wildlife in mainland China late last year, has jumped to 172 other nations and territories with more than 20,000 new cases reported in the past 24 hours - a new daily record.
Cases in Germany, Iran and Spain rose to more than 12,000 each. An official in Tehran tweeted that the coronavirus was killing one person every 10 minutes.

""I am certain we are up to that challenge,"" she added.
Italian soldiers transported corpses overnight from an overwhelmed cemetery in Europe's worst-hit nation where 3,405 people have died, more than in mainland China. Germany's military was also preparing to help. 
Supermarkets in many countries were besieged with shoppers stocking up on food staples and hygiene products. Some rationed sales and fixed special hours for the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to severe illness. 
Solidarity projects were springing up in some of the world's poorest corners. In Kenya's Kibera slum, volunteers with plastic drums of water and boxes of soap on motorbikes set up handwashing stations for people without clean water.
Russia reported its first coronavirus death on Thursday.
Amid the gloom, China provided a ray of hope as it reported zero new local transmissions of the virus, a sign of success for its draconian containment policies since January. Imported cases accounted for all 34 new infections in China.
In the United States, where President Donald Trump had initially played down the coronavirus threat, infections surged with over 11,500 known cases and at least 186 deaths. 
Trump has infuriated Beijing's Communist Party rulers by rebuking it for not acting faster and drawn accusations of racism by referring to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"".
“We continue our relentless effort to defeat the Chinese virus,"" he said in opening remarks at a briefing on Thursday.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Hundreds of Bahraini pilgrims are stranded in Iran, epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East, as Bahrain struggles to evacuate its citizens from a country with which it has no diplomatic ties.
Jamal, who has been in the Shi'ite holy city of Mashhad with his wife and daughter since early February, told Reuters he was awaiting news of repatriation plans after a government-chartered flight was delayed last Thursday and again this Thursday.
""Yesterday we were ready to leave and then at the last moment they said the flight was canceled without any explanation,"" the 62-year-old man, who declined to give his last name, said by telephone from his hotel.
Bahrain said the company from which its health ministry had leased an airplane to conduct a second repatriation flight had backed out and authorities were seeking alternatives ""as soon as possible"", state news agency BNA said on Wednesday.
There are no direct flights between Bahrain and Iran, its regional arch-foe, where the death toll from the coronavirus now exceeds 1,200. 
Bahrain repatriated 165 people last week on an Omani airplane. Authorities have said around 85 of them have so far tested positive for the virus.
FEARS FOR ELDERLY PILGRIMS
Many Bahrainis go to Iran via Oman and Dubai on pilgrimage to Shi'ite holy cities such as Mashhad and Qom, where the outbreak in Iran began.
Bahraini national Reda Ali said his elderly father had died on pilgrimage in Mashhad last week from a heart attack. He now fears for his 75-year-old mother, who he said has pre-existing conditions, and for his brother.
""I fear a lot for those (pilgrims)... Most are old or retired people,"" he told Reuters from Bahrain, voicing concern about the availability of medicine in Iran, which has been hit by Western sanctions.
""Many families in Bahrain fear for the unknown fate of their families,"" he said, criticizing Bahraini authorities for what he described as a lack of coordination or communication.
Bahraini authorities have tasked a foundation under the Justice and Islamic Affairs Ministry to cover the costs of nationals stranded abroad, BNA said. 
Bahrain, which has reported 269 coronavirus cases, most of them linked to travel to Iran, has criticized the Islamic Republic for not stamping Bahraini citizens' passports.
The two countries have long-standing differences. Manama accuses Tehran of backing Shi'ite-led opposition in the Gulf Arab island state, which is ruled by a Sunni Muslim royal family. Iran denies the charges.
For Jamal the priority is to return home.
""We remain in our rooms most of the time, we are fine. It's just the anxiety of what's happening in Iran and all the delays of our evacuation.""

MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government on Thursday ordered the closure of all the country's hotels and promised to implement special measures in nursing homes after a surge in the country's coronavirus cases and deaths. 
Officials reported deaths had jumped by more than a third on Thursday to 767, while the number of cases rose by a quarter to 17,149, making Spain the second worst-hit country in Europe after Italy. 
The government decreed all hotels and other tourist accommodation be shut within seven days to ""guarantee the containment of the pandemic,"" a further hit to the country's already ailing tourism sector. 
Spain, the second most visited country in the world in 2018, has already closed its land borders to all but its nationals and residents.
Long-term boarding houses were exempted from the closure, but still subjected to a state of emergency imposed by the government almost a week ago that bars people from all but essential outings. 
""The toughest moments are still to come, those moments when we will continue to see an increase in the number of cases,"" Health Minister Salvador Illa said earlier on Thursday. 
Several thousand troops have been deployed in dozens of cities across the country to help with decontamination efforts, triage and policing. Army units were deployed for the first time on Thursday in the independence-minded region of Catalonia, for disinfection tasks at Barcelona's airport and port.
Authorities said 49 people had been arrested for flouting the movement bans in the past few hours.
The restrictions were giving ""very good results"" almost a week in, Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos told reporters. Road traffic has fallen to one-tenth from the same period in 2019, air traffic by more than a half, while medium- and long- distance trains had only a 2% occupancy, he said, adding there were no plans to fully shut down air traffic. 
Nursing homes have come under the spotlight during the crisis, with prosecutors in Madrid opening an investigation on Wednesday into more than 17 coronavirus-related deaths at a nursing home where patients had been locked down without access to hospital care.
The authorities have not specified how many people have died in nursing homes but the prosecutor general's office said on Thursday it was also looking into the issue, as similar cases were reported at other facilities and nurses said they did not have enough protective gloves and masks. 
Deputy Prime Minister Pablo Iglesias said nursing homes had to be urgently equipped with proper medical facilities and staff, calling it ""an absolute priority."" 
FISCAL HELP
Fernando Simon, the head of the health emergency centre, said Spain was ""probably slowly approaching the peak of cases.""
In downtown Madrid, the Ayre Gran Hotel Colon opened its doors on Thursday after fitting its rooms with medical equipment. Hotels in Madrid have offered 60,000 beds to the health service, authorities said.
The government has promised that no one in a ""difficult situation"" would have home utility services cut for nonpayment.
The epidemic continued to hammer the labour market with IAG (LON:ICAG)'s Iberia airlines proposing temporarily laying off up to 90% of its flying staff for three months, and carmaker Nissan saying it would indefinitely send home up to 3,000 workers.
In an interview with Antena 3 TV, Economy Minister Nadia Calvino called for an EU-wide fiscal response, after praising the latest European Central Bank's bond purchase scheme to help blunt the impact of the disease 
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Wednesday predicted an economic slump this year in Spain, although he said a 200 billion euro ($220 billion) package of measures to help companies and protect workers and other vulnerable groups could bolster a swift recovery.
Spain's main stock index Ibex 35 closed 1.55% higher after days of volatile swings, and Spanish 10-year bond yield fell from Wednesday's 13-month highs to below 1%.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that he expected the closure of the U.S.-Canada border to take effect overnight on Friday and was working with domestic carriers to bring home citizens stranded overseas.
Canada, which closed its borders this week to most foreign nationals, agreed with the United States to close their shared border to ""non-essential traffic"" to curb transmission of the novel coronavirus.
Canada has more than 800 cases of the COVID-19 respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, and 12 deaths. Some 55,000 people have been tested across the country, Chief Medical Officer Theresa Tam said. 
""What continues to concern us is the day-by-day sharp increase in cases and reports from provinces of new cases with no links to travel,"" Tam told reporters.
Globally, there are over 236,000 infections and more than 9,700 deaths.
Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne, 49, went into self-isolation after showing ""new, flu-like symptoms"" and was awaiting test results.
Canada's indigenous communities, already facing poor healthcare options, are closing their own lands' borders to limit coronavirus exposure. 
The Canadian government said this week it would provide C$27 billion ($18.6 billion) in direct support to families and businesses affected by the virus. Quebec said on Thursday it would make C$2.5 billion available to businesses in loans and loan guarantees.
Ottawa was also examining invoking the rarely used 1988 Emergencies Act, which would allow Ottawa to override provinces and restrict the movement of people and goods.
Trudeau said on Thursday he may utilize the military to help with procurement of supplies and urged Canadians to keep practicing social distancing.
""These are difficult and extraordinary times in which Canadians are taking difficult and extraordinary measures,"" Trudeau told reporters outside his house, where he is in self-isolation after his wife tested positive for the coronavirus.
Many of the more than 3 million Canadians based overseas want to return home, officials said, and some need government help as commercial flights become limited. 
 Air Canada  (TO:AC) said on Thursday it was holding talks with Ottawa to operate charter flights from international destinations to return stranded Canadians. 
The carrier plans to suspend most international and U.S. transborder flights by March 31 because of travel restrictions. 
The prime minister urged Canadians to donate blood, after the agency responsible for the country's blood system said it had seen a spike in canceled appointments. 
PROCURING SUPPLIES
Ottawa wants to accelerate procurement of medical supplies, officials said on Thursday, including more masks for healthcare workers. 
""We have been able to get the swabs and the other things that the provinces needed,"" Tam said. ""There’s been a request at least, in the shorter term, for 7 million and we got suppliers to cover about 75% of that.""
Ottawa has not received any requests for ventilators from provincial health authorities but has been acquiring some for its stockpile, Tam said. 
 Magna International Inc  (TO:MG), a major Canadian auto parts maker, has promised to help with the potential production of ventilators, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said.
""We can't rely on importing these ventilators,"" said Ford. ""We have the people, we have the capacity, and we're going to start manufacturing in Ontario.""
A Magna spokeswoman said they ""aren't currently planning for this."" 
Some Canadian distilleries and breweries have started producing hand sanitizers to meet higher demand.
The country's oil industry faces deeper spending cuts because of the twin shocks of the global coronavirus spread and a crude oil price war.

644,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 11:17AM ET</span>",Palestinians defy leaders' health crisis ban on work in settlements,"By Rami Ayyub and Ammar Awad
RAMAT GIVAT ZEEV, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinians on Thursday defied their government's call to cease work in Israeli settlements over coronavirus concerns, saying bringing money home to their families came first.
More than 500 cases of infection have been confirmed in Israel, and nearly 50 in the occupied West Bank, where the Palestinian Authority (PA) exercises limited self-rule.
Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammad Shtayyeh asked the some 25,000 Palestinians who work in settlements in East Jerusalem and the West Bank - areas Israel captured in a 1967 war - to stay home from Thursday as part of efforts to reduce transmission.
But in the West Bank settlement of Ramat Givat Zeev, Palestinian day laborers dismissed the PA's order and shrugged off virus fears.
""You have to adapt, put yourself in a bit of danger so you can provide food for your children,"" said Omar Hamad, a construction supervisor from Ramallah. ""We have rent, we have expenses, we have lots of things."" 
The wrangling sheds a light on how workers in the interwoven Israeli and Palestinian economies might push back on coronavirus restrictions that could threaten their jobs and income.
Palestinian laborers earn relatively higher incomes in Israel, where some 100,000 work, and in the settlements than in Palestinian cities.
Their salaries made up 14% of the Palestinians' $18 billion gross national income in 2018, according to Raja Khalidi, director general of the Palestine Economic Policy Research Institute. 
Khalidi was skeptical the PA would enforce the settlement work ban, which would be hard to implement without cooperation from Israel.
""The (PA) cannot pay the price of cutting off the livelihoods"" of Palestinians working in settlements, he said, especially with unemployment in Palestinian cities in the West Bank hovering around 15%.
""They would be unemployed and have to fend for themselves in an otherwise hostile and depressed economic environment,"" Khalidi said.
For its part, Israel has made no effort to ban the entry of Palestinians with work permits. But the laborers face new restrictions as both the PA and Israel try to limit peoples' movements during the health crisis.
The Palestinian Authority has imposed curfews in Bethlehem and other West Bank cities under its control. It has given workers with jobs in Israel until March 22 to find housing there, after which the PA intends to ban cross-border travel.
Israeli authorities said that due to the health crisis Palestinians with work permits, who typically return home to the West Bank daily, will be allowed to stay in Israel for up to two months, depending on the nature of their work. 

Employers will be responsible for finding housing for the Palestinian workers, COGAT, Israel's military liaison to the Palestinians, said.

645,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 11:05AM ET</span>","U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard ends Democratic presidential bid, endorses Biden","By Doina Chiacu and Joseph Ax
(Reuters) - U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, an Iraq War veteran who campaigned to end ""forever wars,"" dropped her long-shot bid for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination on Thursday and endorsed front-runner Joe Biden in a video posted to Twitter.
""Although I may not agree with the vice president on every issue, I know that he has a good heart, and he's motivated by his love for our country and the American people,"" said Gabbard, 38. She has served as a congresswoman from Hawaii since 2013 and is the first Hindu elected to Congress.
The endorsement was something of a surprise given Gabbard's past support for Biden's main rival, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. But she noted that recent state nominating contests had made it clear that Democratic voters had chosen the former vice president to take on Republican President Donald Trump in November's general election.
On Twitter, Biden thanked Gabbard for her service to the country as a veteran and a congresswoman. ""I’m grateful to have her support and look forward to working with her to restore honor and decency to the White House,"" he wrote.
Despite remaining mired far behind Biden and Sanders, Gabbard had stayed in the race even as better-known rivals dropped out. In all nine state contests over the last two weeks, she finished behind other contenders who had already abandoned their campaigns but still appeared on ballots.
Gabbard earned her only two delegates by finishing second in American Samoa, where she was born. Biden has won at least 971 delegates of the 1,991 needed to clinch the nomination in July, while Sanders has collected 737, according to Edison Research - an advantage for Biden widely seen as virtually unassailable.
A major in the Hawaii National Guard who was deployed in Iraq from 2004 to 2005, Gabbard is a fierce opponent of what she calls ""forever wars."" Despite her liberal views on most other issues, she has won praise from some Trump supporters and conservative media outlets, where she frequently appears as a commentator.
She has consistently opposed U.S. intervention in Syria, going so far as to meet secretly with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in January 2017 during Democratic President Barack Obama's administration, sparking fierce criticism from some in her own party.
She became embroiled in an ugly war of words in October after 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said Gabbard was being ""groomed"" to disrupt the 2020 election as a third-party candidate.

In January, Gabbard sued for defamation, seeking at least $50 million in damages from Clinton for harming her reputation by allegedly suggesting she was a Russian asset.

649,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",California issues 'stay home' order; U.S. death toll hits 200,"By Dan Whitcomb and David Shepardson
LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON, (Reuters) - California issued an unprecedented statewide 'stay at home"" order on Thursday for its 40 million residents and Washington warned Americans to return home or stay abroad indefinitely, as the number of coronavirus deaths in the country hit 200. 
Governor Gavin Newsom's directive, effective immediately, marks the largest and most sweeping government clampdown yet in the worsening public health crisis brought on by the COVID-19 outbreak, which he predicted could infect more than half the state within eight weeks.
As authorities ramped up measures to keep the virus from spreading, Washington could announce restrictions on travel across the U.S.-Mexico border as soon as Friday, limiting crossings to essential travel, two officials briefed on the matter said. That would follow a similar measure on Wednesday closing the border with Canada.
The fast-spreading respiratory illness has shattered most patterns of American life: shuttering schools and businesses, prompting millions to work from home, forcing many out of jobs and sharply curtailing travel.
The U.S. State Department told citizens that if they travel internationally, ""your travel plans may be severely disrupted, and you may be forced to remain outside of the United States for an indefinite timeframe.""
STIMULUS PACKAGE
With the economy swooning, Senate Republicans unveiled a $1 trillion economic stimulus plan to provide funds directly to businesses and the American public. President Donald Trump has been eagerly calling for that package.
It would be Congress' third emergency coronavirus bill following a $105 billion-plus plan covering free coronavirus testing, paid sick leave and expanded safety-net spending, and an $8.3 billion measure to combat the spread of the highly contagious pathogen and develop vaccines.
The plunging stock market and surging U.S. death toll has caused Trump to sharply change his tone on the disease this week, demanding urgent action after spending weeks downplaying the risks. 
Over 13,000 people across the United States have been diagnosed with the illness called COVID-19 and 200 have died, with the largest numbers so far in Washington state, New York and California. https://tmsnrt.rs/3dkIMIL
Newsom said his 'stay at home' order was essential as modelling showed 56% of California's 40 million people would contract the virus in the next eight weeks, and require nearly 20,000 more hospital beds than the state could provide.
""We are confident the people of California will abide by it, they will meet this moment,"" Newsom, a first-term Democrat told a news briefing from the state capital in Sacramento.
Los Angeles, as the nation's second-largest city, would likely be ""disproportionately impacted"" in the coming weeks, he said.
Two Los Angeles Lakers players have the coronavirus, the NBA franchise said on Thursday, after four players from the Brooklyn Nets tested positive for the disease a day earlier.
The virus has taken the greatest toll in Washington state, which reported eight more deaths on Thursday, bringing the toll there to 74.
Hospitals across the country say they face shortages of medical gear, with doctors in Seattle reduced to making their own face masks out of sheets of plastic.
""We're days away from running out of the equipment we need,"" said Melissa Tizon, Associate Vice President of Providence St. Joseph Health, which runs 51 hospitals across five western states. ""We're expecting more shipments later on but until then we've got to improvise.""
TEST DELAYS 
With the United States slow to roll out mass testing for the virus that has infected more than 244,000 people worldwide, officials fear the number of known cases of the respiratory illness that can lead to pneumonia lags far behind reality.
There are no approved treatments or vaccines for COVID-19, but several options are being tested.
New York City, where many young people last weekend packed local bars and restaurants, has been eerily deserted after nightfall.
""It's a skater's dream,"" said Dyanna Hernandez, 20, who had joined a dozen friends in Manhattan's Union Square (NYSE:SQ) to enjoy the freedom of what she called a ""ghost city"" after three days stuck at home. ""I can't really be quarantined.""
The epidemic, which has killed over 10,000 globally so far, has drawn comparisons with traumatic periods such as World War Two, the 2008 financial crisis and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.
The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged by the most since 2012 to a 2-1/2-year high last week, as companies in the services sector laid off workers with businesses shutting down due to the pandemic.
Katie Vetere, 32, general manager of One 53, a small restaurant near Princeton, New Jersey, applied for benefits for the first time in her life after the restaurant was forced to shut down when state authorities banned table service.
Vetere expects her benefits to be less than half her regular weekly paycheck. 

""I go from 'I'm sad' to 'I'm scared' to 'I'm angry,'"" she said. ""Do I consider my job lost? I don't know.""

Lee Broster has been running a wholesale food company catering to hotels and restaurants, but as they have been emptied by the coronavirus outbreak, he has laid off half his staff of 12 and switched to retail, delivering fruit, vegetables, bread and dairy products directly to people's homes.
""Shifting away from a business we have known about for six years is quite demanding,"" the 44-year-old Briton said at his warehouse in Prague while loading orders. ""But there is nothing else we can do. We have to change and adapt.""
Broster, whose company generated sales of 40 million Czech crowns ($1.56 million) last year, is adding more products to his online site to serve residents shuttered in their homes.
The Czech Republic has reported 572 cases of coronavirus infections with no deaths so far. The nation of 10.7 million has shut its borders and gone into virtual lockdown, like most other European countries, to try to contain the contagion.
This has dealt a crushing blow to Prague, one of the most visited locations in Europe and which drew nearly eight million tourists in 2018. Tourism accounts for about 3 percent of the Czech economy.
""A BIG LEARNING PERIOD""
British tour guide Tori Burton has turned to generating material for her comedy career as she waits for the tourists, and with them a big chunk of her income, to return.

Others are seeking new opportunities on the internet.
English teacher Megan Newnham, 29, moved to online lessons to attempt to replace about half the income she lost when the government tightened restrictions on people leaving their homes. 
The American, who has lived in Prague for three years, is now searching worldwide for online teaching work and contacting former students and employers to drum up business.
""People are concerned about getting their basic needs met and paying for their own expenses rather than language lessons, which might be seen as an extra expense,"" she said.

652,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 08:55AM ET</span>","Faced with shortages, EU plans stockpiling medical gear","BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission decided on Thursday to set up a stockpile of face masks, intensive care equipment and other essential medical gear to tackle shortages in Europe in the face of booming demand caused by the coronavirus crisis.
The measure comes after EU countries failed for weeks to find a seller of face masks and goggles after they launched a joint procurement for these items at the beginning of March.
The new strategic reserve would be complementary to joint procurement efforts which are underway, the EU commissioner for crisis management Janez Lenarcic told a news conference. 
It remains unclear when the needed equipment could be bought, given the current strain on manufacturers which are mostly based in China and other Asian countries.
To help Europe cope with the most immediate needs, China has offered to send 2.2 million masks and 50,000 testing kits to the EU, the head of the EU Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Wednesday. 
The stockpile will be funded almost entirely with EU money, with a small fraction being covered with national resources of EU states. 
The Commission said it had 10 million euros ($10.7 million) already available to build the reserve, and could use another 40 million euros if EU governments and lawmakers backed the extra spending.
The actual purchase of needed equipment would be carried out by one of the 27 EU states, which will also host the stockpile.
Many states have already offered to set up the reserve in their territory, Lenarcic said, a predictable move after France, Germany and a few other EU states which produce personal protective gear temporarily restricted exports to other EU nations at the beginning of the crisis, fearing shortages at home.
Among the gear that the EU intends to stockpile is reusable masks, vaccines, drugs, laboratory supplies and intensive care medical equipment such as breathing ventilators.
Under separate joint procurement procedures, the EU is currently assessing offers for gloves and body protection equipment, and is also already seeking to buy ventilators and laboratory equipment, including testing kits.
Joint procurements are meant to facilitate purchases, lower prices and avoid harmful competition among member states.
Many are also trying to acquire protective gear on their own. Last week China sent face masks to Italy, the European country worst-hit by the virus.

653,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 19, 2020 08:10AM ET</span>",'There are no funerals:' Death in quarantine leaves nowhere to grieve,"By Angelo Amante, Parisa Hafezi and Hayoung Choi
(Reuters) - Struck down by coronavirus at the age of 83, the long life of Alfredo Visioli ended with a short ceremony at a graveyard near Cremona, his hometown in northern Italy.
""They buried him like that, without a funeral, without his loved ones, with just a blessing from the priest,"" said his granddaughter Marta Manfredi who couldn't attend. Like most of the old man's family - like most of Italy - she was confined to her home.
""When all this is over,"" she vows, ""we will give him a real funeral.""
Everywhere the coronavirus has struck, regardless of culture or religion, ancient rituals to honor the dead and comfort the bereaved have been cut short or abandoned for fear of spreading it further. 
The virus, which has killed nearly 9,000 people worldwide, is reshaping many aspects of death, from the practicalities of handling infected bodies to meeting the spiritual and emotional needs of those left behind. 
In Ireland, the health authority is advising mortuary workers to put face masks on dead bodies to reduce even the minor risk of infection. In Italy, a funeral company is using video links to allow quarantined families to watch a priest bless the deceased. And in South Korea, fear of the virus has caused such a drop in the number of mourners that funeral caterers are struggling for business. 
There is little time for ceremony in hard-hit cities such as Bergamo, northeast of Milan, where the mortuaries are full and the crematorium is working around the clock, said Giacomo Angeloni, a local official in charge of cemeteries.
Bergamo, home to about 120,000 people, has been dealing with 5-6 times the number of dead it would in normal times, he said.
Italy has now reported nearly 3,000 deaths from COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus - the highest outside China where the virus first emerged. The Italian army sent 50 troops and 15 trucks to Bergamo on Wednesday to take bodies to less overwhelmed provinces. 
A ban on gatherings has shattered the vital rituals that help us grieve, said Andy Langford, the chief operating officer of Cruse Bereavement Care, a British charity providing free care and counseling to those in grief.
""Funerals allow a community to come together, express emotion, talk about that person and formally say goodbye,"" he said. 
""When you feel you have no control over how you can grieve, and over how you can experience those last moments with someone, that can complicate how you grieve and make you feel worse,"" he said.
EXTRA STAFF
In Iran as in northern Italy, hospital and funeral workers are overwhelmed with bodies, as the virus has torn across the country, killing 1,284 people and infecting thousands, according to state TV. 
The authorities have hired new people to dig graves, said a manager at Tehran's Behesht-e Zahra cemetery. ""We work day and night,"" he said. ""I have never seen such a sad situation. There are no funerals.""
Most corpses arrive by truck and are buried without the ritual washing that Islam dictates, he said. 
Some Iranians suspect that the official haste to bury them has more to do with obscuring the spiraling death toll than halting the spread of the virus. 
Deaths from COVID-19 have been recorded as heart attacks or lung infections, a hospital worker in Kashan, a city about a three-hour drive from Tehran, told Reuters.
""The officials are lying about the death toll,"" the worker said. ""I have seen dozens of corpses in the past few days, but they have told us not to talk about it."" Two nurses at Iranian hospitals also told Reuters they thought the death toll was higher than the official tally.
Iranian authorities have rejected allegations of a cover-up, and President Hassan Rouhani, in a televised speech on Mar. 18, said his government had been ""honest and straightforward with the nation."" 
INFECTION RISK
In several countries, clusters of infection have followed funerals. In South Korea, where more than 90 people have died, the government has urged the families of COVID-19 victims to cremate their loved ones first, and hold the funeral later. 
Korean funerals usually take place in hospitals, and involve three days of prayers and feasting. Most of the country's early cases were linked to a church in Daegu city and a hospital in a nearby county. In February, several members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus attended a funeral at the hospital for the brother of the church's founder.
Since the outbreak, the number of mourners at funerals has plunged by 90%, regardless of whether the deceased had the virus, said Choi Min-ho, secretary general of the Korea Funeral Association.
""The culture of funerals has changed significantly,"" he said. ""A handful of mourners quickly offer condolences and leave the place without dining together out of infection worries."" 
Condolence money, traditionally handed over in cash, is now sent via bank transfer, he added.
Authorities in Wuhan, the epicenter of China's outbreak and location of the majority of its deaths, quickly identified the funeral business as a potential source of transmission.
The local civil affairs bureau in late January ordered all funerals for confirmed COVID-19 victims to be handled at a single funeral home in the city's Hankou district. Mourning ceremonies, usually boisterous social events in China, were curtailed along with all other public gatherings. 
Those restrictions are still in place, even though the number of new cases has dwindled in recent weeks. Bereaved families are not even allowed to see the bodies of their loved ones, a worker at the funeral home told Reuters.
In China, the ashes of the deceased tend to be kept in funeral homes until they are taken to a family plot on public holidays such as the Tomb Sweeping Festival in April. That's also canceled this year. 
""DEATH MANAGEMENT""
In Spain, too, a large cluster of cases has been traced to a funeral in the northern town of Vitoria in late February. At least 60 people who attended tested positive after the event, said local media reports. 
With over 600 deaths, Spain is the second-worst hit country in Europe after Italy, and most people are now confined to their homes. Referring to these restrictions, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called coronavirus a ""cruel"" disease that paralyses the human need to socialize. 
In Ireland, up to 100 guests are still allowed at all funerals - for now. But most families are opting for small private ceremonies and encouraging others to express their condolences online through websites such as RIP.ie, where death notices and funeral invitations are usually posted.
Open casket funerals are out for any victim of coronavirus, and ""the family should be advised not to kiss the deceased,"" according to new guidelines from Ireland's Health and Safety Executive to its funeral directors.
The risk of catching coronavirus from a dead body is slim, public health officials say, but some countries are recommending extra measures. 
Israel has reported no coronavirus deaths, but its health ministry says the deceased should be double-wrapped in impermeable plastic. Ritual washing and rites will be performed in full protective gear and the corpse re-wrapped in plastic for burial. Normally Israel's Jewish dead are laid to rest in a cloth smock and shroud.
Ireland's guidelines advise workers in funeral parlors to put face masks on dead bodies before moving them, in case they ""expel a very small amount of air and viral droplets from the lungs"" and infect the living. 
In Britain, where the pandemic is still gathering pace, there is widespread anxiety about the likely death toll. 
Britain has been slower in implementing the strict measures seen elsewhere in Europe, and expert estimates of how many will die from COVID-19 have ranged wildly from the tens to the hundreds of thousands.
An emergency bill to tackle the virus, which has killed 104 people in Britain, includes a number of measures the government says will ""streamline the death management process."" The measures include allowing funeral directors to register a death on behalf of a self-isolating family.
Deborah Smith, a spokesperson for the National Association of Funeral Directors, said the bill will help the profession ""preserve the dignity of those who die and care for their bereaved families with compassion - even if they are not able to have the kind of funeral they would have wanted.""
Smith would not be drawn on the expected numbers, but said ""funeral directors are preparing for a variety of scenarios."" 
""NOT ALONE""
One scenario is already playing out in Wuhan. 
Last month, a worker at the funeral home in Hankou district, identifying himself only as Huang, wrote an essay that was circulated on social media. He said funeral workers were as overwhelmed as the city's medics but had received less recognition.
He said staff had worked without a break since the start of the epidemic. ""Some of our employees don't even drink water because they need to go to the toilet and it's difficult to take off the protective clothing,"" he wrote.
Half a world away, in the virus-stricken Italian town of Bergamo, funeral workers wage a near-identical struggle.
""It's like being in a war with an invisible enemy,"" said Roberta Caprini, a partner in Centro Funerario Bergamasco, a funeral service in Bergamo. ""We've been working without interruption for two weeks and sleeping 3-4 hours a night when we manage it. Everyone in our area, us included, has lost someone or have someone sick in their home.""
Bergamo's Church of All Saints has become a makeshift mortuary, its pews pushed aside to accommodate the dead. Caprini said she had counted at least 60 coffins when she visited on Tuesday.
She spoke of the ""real torture"" felt by families who watched sick relatives taken away to hospital and never saw them again. Her company has arranged video links to burials, to allow families to watch the priest bless the deceased.
Sometimes, she said, they drive the hearses past the bereaved family's home, so mourners ""can at least come down at the moment and offer a quick prayer.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - World finance leaders tried to lift confidence with emergency measures to pour cash into panic-stricken markets on Thursday, as investors everywhere dumped assets, switching to dollars amid the escalating coronavirus pandemic.
Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Asia have slashed interest rates and opened liquidity taps to stabilize economies left almost comatose, with quarantined consumers, broken supply chains, paralyzed transportation and depleted shops.
While finance ministers and central bankers adopted similar strategies, markets and nations where borders were being closed and cities placed in virtual lockdown were further alarmed by bickering between global powers - the United States and China.
There were almost 219,000 cases of coronavirus reported globally, including over 8,900 deaths linked to the virus. Over 20,000 of those cases were reported in the past 24 hours, a new daily record.
China, where the epidemic first started in December, provided a glimmer of hope, as it reported zero new local transmissions of virus, though imported cases surged, accounting for all 34 new cases on Wednesday.
While the economic crisis spawned by the pandemic caused carnage in stock markets, almost every currency, except the euro and safe-haven yen, collapsed against the dollar.
The European Central Bank launched new bond purchases worth 750 billion euros ($817 billion) at an emergency meeting late on Wednesday, in a bid to prevent a deep recession that threatened to outdo the 2008-09 global financial crisis. 
""Extraordinary times require extraordinary action,"" ECB President Christine Lagarde said, amid concerns that the strains from burgeoning crisis could eventually tear apart the euro zone as a single currency bloc. 
In the United States, the Federal Reserve rolled out its third emergency credit program in two days, aimed at keeping the $3.8 trillion money market mutual fund industry functioning if investors made rapid withdrawals.
On Sunday, the Fed slashed interest rates to near zero and pledged hundreds of billions of dollars in asset purchases, while President Donald Trump's administration drew up a $1 trillion stimulus and rescue proposal.
U.S. infections were closing in on 8,000, with the death toll climbing to at least 151. Millions of Americans were staying at home.
The desperate state of industry was writ large in Detroit, where the big three automakers -  Ford Motor Co  (N:F), General Motors Co (N:GM) and  Fiat  Chrysler Automobiles NV (MI:FCHA) (N:FCAU) - confirmed they would be shutting U.S. plants, as well as factories in Canada and Mexico.
The United Kingdom was bracing for the virtual shut down of London as underground train stations across the capital closed and Prime Minister Boris Johnson mulled tougher measures to slow the contagion, with schools set to shut on Friday.
The British pound  plunged to its lowest level against the dollar since 1985, as Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said he would not rule anything out when asked about printing money to give to individuals.
Australia made a historic foray into quantitative easing after an out-of-schedule meeting on Thursday and cut interest rates for the second time in a month.
""Really nothing is off the table,"" Australia central bank Governor Philip Lowe said. ""We are in extraordinary times and we're prepared to do whatever is necessary.""
South Korea warned of a global credit crunch and said it was setting up crisis funds to stabilize markets.
""We're in this phase where investors are just looking to liquidate,"" said Prashant Newnaha, senior interest rate strategist at TD Securities in Singapore.
Central banks in emerging countries from Brazil to India have stepped in this week to buy government bonds to prevent a jump in borrowing costs that would put more pressure on their economies. 
Despite those moves, which together with other liquidity injections and stimulus announced in recent weeks reached levels unseen since World War Two, nearly every stock market in Asia was in the red, with Seoul, Jakarta and Manila hitting daily loss limits that trigger the suspension of trade.
The Philippines bourse was down 24% at one point. The Philippine central bank cut its policy rate be 50 basis points and said it was ready to deploy other policy tools as needed. Indonesia and Taiwan also cut rates.

WAR OF WORDS
J.P. Morgan economists forecast the U.S. economy to shrink 14% in the next quarter, and the Chinese economy to drop more than 40% in the current one, one of the most dire calls yet on the potential scale of the fallout. 
But, it was not just the dire state of the economy that panicked investors. Tensions between the world's two biggest superpowers reached some of their most elevated levels and other powers were locking heads over their reactions to the outbreak.
Trump ratcheted up his rhetoric against China over the coronavirus on Wednesday, saying Beijing should have acted faster to warn the world and dismissing criticism that his labeling it the ""Chinese virus"" was racist.
Trump's language added to strains between the world's top two economies as their war of words widened to include the global pandemic and media freedoms.
A European Union document seen by Reuters said Russian media have deployed a ""significant disinformation campaign"" against the West to worsen the coronavirus impact, generate panic and sow distrust.
Russia reported its first coronavirus death on Thursday.
In contrast, scientists and health experts in China believe the worst could be over, and its cities were slowly coming back to life, with more people going back to work, with the government saying it will provide financial support to exporters and the service industry.
Germany, Iran and Spain reported over 12,000 cases each, while 12 other countries confirmed between 1,000-10,000 cases each. The virus has reached 172 countries and territories.
Governments around the globe, from the United States and Britain to the emerging world have been criticized for acting too slowly to stop the spread.
In Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro initially labeled the virus ""a fantasy"", more members of the country's political elite fell ill. On Wednesday night, housebound protesters banged pots and pans, shouting ""Bolsonaro out!"" from their windows.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The Japanese doctor who created a media firestorm with videos criticizing the quarantine of a coronavirus-stricken cruise ship said he now believes the Tokyo 2020 Olympics should not go on.
Kentaro Iwata, a professor of infectious disease at Kobe University, said on his blog on Thursday that it's not clear that the outbreak in Japan will have subsided by the planned start of the Games in July. Also, the flood of foreign visitors could exacerbate the spread of the disease, known as COVID-19.
Japanese government officials have said the Olympics will go ahead as scheduled and will not be held behind closed doors.
""The Olympics are not just a mass gathering, but a mass gathering from all over the world, while COVID is a global pandemic,"" Iwata wrote. ""These two things don't go together.""
Iwata boarded the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship in February and his YouTube videos decrying the conditions there garnered more than a million views.
Iwata said that bureaucrats, and not infectious disease professionals, were running the quarantine, and that basic protocols on zoning and the use of protective gear were not followed.
Japan has recorded more than 1,600 cases of the virus, including about 700 from the Diamond Princess. Thirty nine people have died, including seven from the liner.
The virus has spread around the world, with more than 218,000 confirmed cases and 8,900 deaths."

The infectious disease experts, due to meet Thursday evening, were expected to recommend controls stay in place in worst-affected regions, while elsewhere schools could be re-opened and there could be a resumption of sporting events, the report said.
The eyes of the world are on Japan to see if the government will step back from its determination to press ahead with the Olympics. Organizers have repeatedly said the July 24 to Aug. 9 Games will go on as scheduled but with the rapid spread of the coronavirus bringing the sports world to a virtual standstill fears are growing the Olympics may be canceled or postponed.
The governor of Hokkaido, the prefecture with the highest number of infections, said his administration was scaling back its response to the outbreak, ending the emergency on Thursday to move to a new phase.
""We will end the emergency declaration as scheduled on March 19 and from the 20th move to a new stage to overcome the crisis of coronavirus infections,"" Hokkaido governor Naomichi Suzuki told reporters on Wednesday.
Hokkaido had seen 154 infections as of Wednesday. Japan overall has had 923 cases and 32 deaths, according to the latest NHK tally. Among Japan's 47 prefectures, 22 have had fewer than 5 coronavirus cases, according to health ministry data.
The virus has infected more than 200,000 people and killed 8,000 globally with the most serious spread now taking place in Europe as China, where the virus originated late last year, was succeeding in bringing its epidemic under control.
The United States and most of Europe have enacted travel bans and put major cities on lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus.
Japan has closed schools and canceled many sporting events, but has thus far refrained from putting firm restrictions on travel, businesses and restaurants.
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the government will listen to what the experts panel says before deciding what to do about school closures and public events."

(Reuters) - Former movie producer Harvey Weinstein on Wednesday was transferred to a maximum security prison in upstate New York to serve a 23-year sentence for sexual assault and rape.
Weinstein, 67, was taken to the Wende Correctional Facility, located in Alden, east of Buffalo, according to the New York state Department of Corrections website.
Weinstein's earliest release date is Nov. 9, 2039, according to the website.
Weinstein, once one of Hollywood's most influential men, was found guilty on Feb. 24 by a Manhattan jury of sexually assaulting a former production assistant and raping a former aspiring actress. His conviction was hailed as a victory for the #MeToo movement against sexual misconduct by powerful men.
Prosecutors portrayed Weinstein as a serial predator who had manipulated women with promises of career advancement in Hollywood, coaxing them to hotel rooms or private apartments and then overpowering and violently attacking them.  
More than 100 women, including famous actresses, accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct stretching back decades. He has denied the allegations, saying any sex was consensual. 
Weinstein faces separate sexual assault charges in Los Angeles.
After his sentencing on March 11, Weinstein was taken to New York's Rikers Island jail. Hours later, he was transported to Bellevue Hospital in Manhattan for ongoing heart problems, but was sent back to Rikers earlier this week, his spokesman Juda Engelmayer said.
The defense expects to file an appeal in July.  
Mark David Chapman, who murdered Beatle John Lennon in 1980, served some of his time at Wende Correctional Facility, as did Robert Chambers, dubbed the ""Preppie killer,"" who strangled 18-year-old Jennifer Levin in New York City’s Central Park in 1986.
The prison has sex offender treatment programs, according to the Department of Corrections website.
Weinstein won an Academy Award for producing ""Shakespeare in Love"" and was responsible for other acclaimed films including ""Pulp Fiction,"" ""The English Patient"" and ""Gangs of New York."" He turns 68 on Thursday."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend and longtime associate of Jeffrey Epstein, has sued the late financier's estate, seeking to recoup legal fees to defend against women's claims that she helped recruit them for Epstein's alleged sex-trafficking scheme.
In a complaint filed with the Superior Court in the U.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein's estate is being probated, Maxwell said she ""had no involvement in or knowledge of -Epstein's alleged misconduct,"" but the financier repeatedly promised to support her financially.
Maxwell is also seeking reimbursement for security costs, saying she ""receives regular threats to her life and safety,"" requiring her to hire personal security services and ""find safe accommodation.""
The complaint was dated March 12 and obtained by Reuters on Wednesday.
A lawyer for Epstein's estate did not immediately respond on Wednesday to requests for comment. The estate was valued at $636.1 million before the recent global markets plunge. Epstein owned two private islands in the Virgin Islands.
Maxwell has kept a low profile, with even lawyers for some Epstein accusers unable to find her, since the financier's arrest last July on charges he abused and trafficked in women and girls from 2002 to 2005 in Manhattan and Florida.
Epstein, who pleaded not guilty, died on Aug. 10 last year at age 66, five weeks after his arrest and two days after signing his will, by hanging himself in his Manhattan jail cell.
Federal prosecutors in Manhattan are investigating others who may have had roles in his alleged misconduct.
Maxwell, whose father was late British media publisher Robert Maxwell, said Epstein employed her from 1999 to 2006, when she managed homes in New York, Florida, New Mexico, Paris and the Virgin Islands.
She said their employment relationship ""formed a legal and special relationship"" that obligated the estate to indemnify her, and that one of its executors ""made assurances"" it would do so, but the estate has ignored her Nov. 22 reimbursement claim.
Denise George, the U.S. Virgin Islands' attorney general, sued the estate in January, saying Epstein's sexual misconduct there stretched from 2001 to 2018 and included raping and trafficking in dozens of women and girls. The estate has been trying to resolve differences with George so it can begin compensating Epstein's victims.
At least two dozen Epstein accusers have filed civil lawsuits against the estate. Some named Maxwell and other alleged enablers of Epstein's abuses as defendants.
The compensation fund for Epstein's victims is overseen by Kenneth Feinberg and Jordana Feldman, who worked on a fund for victims of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The number of Mexicans crossing illegally into the United States has risen over the past week, migrant shelters said, in part driven by rumors the United States will seal the border as it seeks to fight the coronavirus spread.
Representatives of four migrant shelters in northern Mexico told Reuters that they had seen an uptick in Mexican migrants heading to the border.
""There are more people crossing the desert,"" said Marla Conrad, a social worker for the Kino border initiative in the city of Nogales, close to the U.S. border.
Reuters was unable to determine how many had crossed.
Conrad said that, among other factors, some of the migrants she spoke to said they had accelerated travel plans over the last week in anticipation the United States would implement stricter measures at the border. 
U.S. President Donald Trump has warned of pending measures to tighten security at the border as his government seeks to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. 
On Wednesday, he said his administration will use a health-focused statute to swiftly remove migrants or asylum seekers who cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally.
He also said the U.S.-Canada border would shut to ""non-essential traffic.""
The Trump administration is also considering immediately returning any foreigners caught at the U.S.-Mexico border to Mexico, arguing the step is necessary to combat the fast-spreading coronavirus, two administration sources told Reuters on Tuesday.
The administration has been very sensitive to even slight increases in border apprehensions. 
After a peak in May last year of more than 133,000 overall apprehensions led to threats of tariffs from Trump, Mexico stepped up containment of migrants from neighboring Central American nations. 
Apprehensions fell steadily for eight months but ticked up to around 30,000 in February, according to Customs and Border Protection figures.
The Department of Homeland Security and CBP did not immediately respond to a request for information about border apprehensions in March.
The United States has reported just over 4,700 coronavirus cases and 87 deaths, paralyzing the country. In Mexico, there have been 82 confirmed cases of coronavirus and no deaths.
Mexico's foreign ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will pardon 10,000 prisoners including political ones in honor of the Iranian new year on Friday, state TV reported.
""Those who will be pardoned will not return to jail ... almost half of those security-related prisoners will be pardoned as well,"" judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili told state TV on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Esmaili said Iran had temporarily freed about 85,000 people from jail, including political prisoners, in response to the coronavirus epidemic. 
""A large number of prisoners who have been temporarily freed do not need to return to jail after the leader's pardon,"" Esmaili said. 
""The unprecedented point is that the pardon also includes the security-related prisoners with less than five-year jail sentences,"" Esmaili said.
Esmaili did not say whether it would include British-Iranian aid worker Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who was released on Tuesday for two weeks. 
Iran said it had 189,500 people in prison, according to a report that the U.N. Special Rapporteur on human rights in Iran, Javaid Rehman, submitted to the Human Rights Council in January. They are believed to include hundreds arrested during or after anti-government protests in November.
The coronavirus outbreak has prompted calls from the United Nations and the United States for political prisoners, including dozens of dual nationals and foreigners, to be released from Iran's overcrowded and disease-ridden jails.
Washington has warned Iran that it would hold the Tehran government directly responsible for any American deaths in jail.
Iran’s elite Revolutionary Guards have arrested dozens of dual nationals and foreigners over recent years, including citizens of the United States, Britain, Canada, Australia, Austria, France, Sweden, the Netherlands and Lebanon.
Tehran denies it holds people on political grounds, and has mainly accused foreign prisoners of espionage.
In June 2019, Iran released Nizar Zakka, a Lebanese businessman with U.S. permanent residency, after four years in prison. Last year, Iran also released Xiyue Wang, a U.S. citizen who had been held for three years on spying charges. 
Rights activists have accused Iran of arresting a number of dual nationals to try to win concessions from other countries - a charge the Islamic Republic has regularly dismissed.
Tehran has called for the release of about several dozen Iranians held in U.S. prisons, mostly for violating sanctions imposed on Iran over its nuclear program.
Frictions have risen between longtime foes Iran and the United States since 2018, when Washington quit Iran’s nuclear deal with six world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Tehran's economy.

Tehran has since gradually scaled back its commitments to the 2015 nuclear deal, under which most sanctions on the country were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing its sensitive nuclear work.

The reform passed through parliament late on Wednesday by a vote of 68 to 51.
The legislation modernizes abortion laws in place since 1977 and proposes that a woman should have access to abortion until 20 weeks of pregnancy, with advice from her doctor.
After 20 weeks, a pregnant woman would require a test and two doctors will have to agree an abortion is the right decision. These conditions for post-20 week pregnancy were tougher than the government's original proposal.
Under the old law abortion was an offence in New Zealand, and a woman could only legally get an abortion if two doctors certified that continuing the pregnancy would result in danger to her mental or physical health.
“For over forty years abortion has been the only medical procedure considered a crime in New Zealand. But from now abortions will be rightly treated as a health issue,” Minister of Justice Andrew Little said in a statement after the law was passed.
The passing of the bill is seen as a win for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's center-left coalition party, ahead of a general election in September.
Decriminalizing abortion was one of Ardern's campaign promises when she was elected in 2017 but plans to change the laws were delayed as lawmakers argued over the bill.
New Zealand is the latest country to liberalize abortion laws. South Korea's high court overturned a ban on abortion in April, while Ireland legalized abortion in a referendum.
In the United States some conservative-leaning states have taken action to curb abortion rights, however."

PRISTINA (Reuters) - A coalition partner in the Kosovo government will file a motion for a no-confidence vote in the government following the sacking of the interior minister over a dispute whether to declare a state of emergency to halt the spread of the coronavirus.
Isa Mustafa, the leader of the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), said the sacking of the interior minister was a culmination of differences between the coalition partners on whether a tariff of 100% on goods produced in Serbia should be abolished.
Kosovo introduced the tariff in November 2018, saying it would be abolished once Belgrade recognised Kosovo. The move halted the dialogue on normalising relations between Belgrade and Pristina and angered the European Union and the United States, which backed Kosovo's declaration of independence.
Last week, the United States halted some $50 million in aid to Kosovo over its refusal to lift the tariffs.
""We will file a motion for a no-confidence vote in the Parliament,” Mustafa told journalists after a party meeting. “Our main disagreement is the worsening relations with our partner, the U.S. We don’t see any perspective for the future of this country without the presence and support of the United States.”
Mustafa's LDK and Vetevendosje, the party of Prime Minister Albin Kurti, formed the government less than two months ago following lengthy coalition talks.
With 29 members in the 120-seat Parliament, Kurti's Cabinet is unlikely to survive the vote.
Serbia, which lost control over Kosovo after the NATO bombing in 1999, refuses to recognise the independence of its former province, and considers Kosovo an integral part of its territory despite the 2008 declaration of independence.
But in order to progress on its path towards the European Union accession process, Serbia has to normalise ties with Pristina and eventually recognise Kosovo, allowing it to become a member of the United Nations.
Belgrade refuses to continue the EU-sponsored dialogue with Pristina unless tariffs are removed. Together with its traditional ally Russia it has been blocking Kosovo's membership in international organisations including the United Nations.
The United States and the EU have pressured Kosovo to lift the tariffs and resume the dialogue with Pristina. U.S. officials have said Washington may take additional measures against Kosovo such as pulling out some 650 U.S. peacekeepers if Pristina refuses to lift the tariffs.
Kurti said Kosovo would remove the tariffs partially and with some conditions, but Washington said that was not enough."

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico has asked Interpol to issue a red notice calling for the arrest of a former official who led the controversial probe into the 2014 disappearance and suspected murder of 43 student teachers, the attorney general's office said.
Experts and parents of the victims have accused Tomas Zeron, who lead Mexico's criminal investigation agency until his resignation in 2016, of manipulating the probe.
Zeron, who has denied wrongdoing, was thought to be in Canada, said a person familiar with the case who requested anonymity because it is still under investigation. Interpol's red notices ask authorities worldwide to detain certain people pending possible extradition or other legal action.
Interpol did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
""For us, the order to arrest Zeron is very significant, this should have been done from the start,"" said Felipe de la Cruz, father of one of the missing students.
Their abduction and apparent massacre is widely believed to have been committed by corrupt police working with a violent drug gang.
Mexican prosecutors said last September that they would probe the handling of the case by Zeron as well as former attorney general Jesus Murillo and top aide Jose Aaron Perez Carro.
The government's inability to find the remains of the students and hold their attackers accountable battered the reputation of then-president Enrique Pena Nieto.
Current President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has criticized how the case was handled, while a special prosecutor in his administration said authorities would ""start from scratch"" to unravel what happened.
The official account from his predecessor's government states a drug gang killed the students after mistaking them for members of a rival group. It said the killers then incinerated their remains before dumping them in a nearby river.
Zeron's team said in October 2014 that in the river it found a bone fragment belonging to the only one of the 43 students whose remains have been definitively identified.
However, a team of independent experts that picked holes in the account said that Zeron had visited the location a day earlier with an alleged gang member, without notifying the man's lawyer or filing a report on his visit."

Slavi Angelov, 47, an editor-in-chief of the 168 Hours weekly newspaper and a veteran criminal reporter, was hospitalized with severe injuries on the head and legs. He has undergone surgery but his life was not in danger, officials said.
Police and prosecutors are investigating the assault, which they say was most likely linked to Angelov's work. Journalists at his publication said they were going through his latest stories to seek clues on possible attackers.
Angelov is known for his in-depth stories on Bulgaria's criminal underground since 1990s and for his reporting on environmental corruption issues.
The attack was decried by a number of domestic and international journalist organizations, demanding a swift and a transparent investigation in the country, which ranked 111th in the World Press Freedom Index of Reporters Without Borders.
""Authorities must ensure that those who attack journalists are held to account; impunity in such cases only encourages more attacks,"" said the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists."

Britain formally left the bloc on Jan. 31, but under the terms of an exit agreement most practical aspects of how Britain interacts with the 27 EU member states have remained unchanged.
""This evening the UK and EU have exchanged draft legal texts. We are sharing ours in confidence as a negotiating document, as part of the ongoing negotiating process,"" the British government spokesman said.
""Teams will now analyze each other’s texts and we expect further conversations between the teams next week.""
The drafts include a proposed free trade agreement and key annexes, and proposed agreements on aviation safety, air transport and civil nuclear industries.
The coronavirus crisis has raised doubts about whether it was still realistic for the two sides to reach agreement before the Dec. 31 deadline, which was already considered an ambitious goal before the crisis struck.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier that Brexit was not being discussed much in his Downing Street office at the moment, given the demands of the response to the coronavirus crisis, but he had no intention of moving the deadline."

EMS, Switzerland (Reuters) - Britain faces a ""massive shortage"" of ventilators that will be needed to treat critically ill patients suffering from coronavirus, after it failed to invest enough in intensive care equipment, a leading ventilator manufacturer said on Wednesday.
""England is very poorly equipped,"" said Andreas Wieland, chief executive of Hamilton Medical in Switzerland, which says it is the world's largest ventilator maker.
""They're going to have a massive shortage, once the virus really arrives there,"" he told Reuters in an interview.
Ventilators, running in the thousands of dollars per unit, are used to help people with respiratory difficulties to breathe. They are high-tech versions of the ""iron lungs"" that kept people alive into the 1950s during fierce polio epidemics.
Worldwide, the devices have become shorthand for the rapid advance of the disease -- and the desperation of officials who fear their stocks are inadequate. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the 3,000 devices in his state where 20 people have died are a fraction of what he'd like to have.
""The entire world is trying to buy ventilators,"" Cuomo said, according to a transcript published on Wednesday, adding he is hoping to tap a U.S. federal government stockpile.
Germany's  Draegerwerk  (DE:DRWG_p) last week got a government order for 10,000, equal to a typical year's production. 
Wieland's company in the Swiss Alps has boosted normal production of some 15,000 ventilators annually by 30-40% and now can produce about 80 ventilators daily. 
He has shifted his 1,400 employees to seven-day work weeks as well as borrowed workers from other companies in the Rhine River valley where his two-year-old ventilator plant is located.
Last week, Hamilton Medical shipped 400 ventilators to Italy, whose intensive care units have been overwhelmed by more than 35,000 cases of the rapidly spreading virus and almost 3,000 deaths. 
About 50% of those with coronavirus in Italy accepted into intensive care units are dying, compared with typical mortality rates of 12% to 16% in such units.
Wieland said a similar outbreak in Britain, now with more than 2,600 cases and about 100 deaths, would swamp the system there, too. 
""They are not well equipped with ventilators and intensive care stations,"" he said. ""They invested very little, and I think now they will pay the price.""
UK health minister Matt Hancock has acknowledged the existing stock of 5,000 ventilators is inadequate.
""NO NUMBER TOO HIGH""
""We think we need many times more than that and we are saying if you produce a ventilator then we will buy it,"" he said earlier this week. ""No number is too high.""
Wieland said he was in ""close contact"" with UK medical leaders and aimed to prioritize shipments there soon, though for now Italy was taking precedence. 
But he also has orders from the United States, Turkey, France and China, where in January he stocked up on components in anticipation of rising demand as the virus spread from its origins in Wuhan. 
The UK's Intensive Care Society, an organization of medical professionals, did not immediately return emails and phone calls from Reuters seeking comment on the nation's readiness for a possible explosion of coronavirus cases.   
""We are likely to need more,"" a National Health Service spokesman told Reuters. ""Engineers have already been tasked with developing plans to produce more ventilators in the UK, at speed.""
Hamilton CEO Wieland is skeptical, however, of the British government's recent call for manufacturers from other industries including Ford, Honda and Rolls Royce (LON:RR) to help make equipment including ventilators.

""I wish them the best of luck,"" Wieland said. ""I do not believe anything will come of it. These devices are very complex. It takes us four to five years"" to develop a new product.

BONN/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Two British bankers were handed a suspended jail sentence on Wednesday and one was told to pay a 14 million euro penalty in Germany's biggest post-war fraud trial of a scam involving multi-billion-euro trades to get bogus tax reclaims.
The ruling is the first criminal conviction for what judge Roland Zickler dubbed ""a collective case of thievery from state coffers"", activity that thrived during the years after the financial crash and as banks were bailed out by the state.
German state prosecutor Anne Brorhilker had outlined criminal charges against Martin Shields and fellow British banker Nicholas Diable, who she said organized a network of traders and lenders to make double tax reclaims with sham share trades.
Brorhilker outlined more than 30 instances of double-tax reclaims totaling 447 million euros ($485.75 million).
The court ordered Shields to pay 14 million euros, clawing back profits he had made. He received a suspended jail sentence of one year and 10 months. The judges imposed a one-year suspended jail term on Diable.
""I have made mistakes,"" Shields told the court during the trial. ""I have learned my lesson.""
Diable told judges that his wedding, honeymoon, career and birth of his children had been overshadowed by the investigation, expressing regret that he had taken part in the so-called ""cum-ex"" scheme.
The trial comes after a years-long probe into the sham trades, fuelling a public outcry over the government's failure to stop a scam that cost Germany more than 5 billion euros. Experts believe most of the money will not be recovered.
The conviction, however, potentially paves the way for the prosecutions of others in the network of big global banks, hedge funds and investors who profited."

Some 24,000 people responded to a call for retired doctors, nurses, therapists and university students with sufficient skills to register with the health service so they can be pressed into service as they are needed in the weeks ahead.
Around 65,000 nurses and midwives are practicing in Ireland with 15,000 doctors registered to work, 7,000 of whom are currently doing so, according to their registering boards.
On Monday, Health Minister Simon Harris said there would be no financial limits to the recruitment program and no constraint on the numbers to be hired, telling prospective candidates: ""Your country needs you.""
""The huge response to this call is a testament to the solidarity of Irish people and we wish to thank those who have put themselves forward to work with us during these unprecedented circumstances,"" Health Service Executive National Director of Human Resources Anne Marie Hoey said in a statement.
The recruitment effort is drawing doctors and nurses back to the country from Canada and Australia, where many young Irish medical professionals find work after they complete their training in Ireland.
On Tuesday, Anthony O'Connor, a doctor and member of the Irish Medical Organization's consultant committee, told national broadcaster RTE he knew of an Irish doctor in Perth, along with 24 colleagues, intending to return to ""serve their country"".
Other recruits include Roisin Doherty, the wife of the Sinn Fein party's finance spokesperson, Pearse Doherty, who is returning to work as a nurse. Simon Mills, a doctor-turned-barrister, took to Twitter on Wednesday to announce a return to his old profession.
Ireland has 292 confirmed cases of coronavirus but Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Tuesday the government expects that to rise to at least 15,000 by the end of the month. The total number of confirmed cases in British-ruled Northern Ireland is 68."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday urged all German citizens to help fight the spread of the coronavirus by sticking to rules aimed at reducing direct social contact and avoiding as many new infections as possible.
""It is serious. Take it seriously,"" Merkel said in a televised speech. ""Since German reunification, actually, since World War Two, there has never been a challenge for our country in which acting in solidarity was so very crucial.""
Merkel appealed to citizens to abide by the unprecedented rules restricting public life, agreed with the 16 federal states earlier this week, adding: ""As the government, we will always re-examine what can be corrected, but also what may still be necessary.""
Her government has advised the country's 16 regions to shut schools and daycare facilities until the end of the Easter holiday. Shops, except for grocery stores, bakeries, pharmacies banks and other essential businesses have been shut.
Earlier on Wednesday, the first German town imposed a curfew to slow the spread of the coronavirus, officials said, though the nearly 7,000 citizens of Mitterteich in southern Bavaria are still allowed to buy groceries, go to work and visit the doctor.
The curfew will last until April 2, said authorities in the district of Tirschenreuth, close to the Czech border. 
In her speech, Merkel said she was well aware that the restrictions on the freedom of movement were hard to accept for many Germans, especially after having witnessed Communist rule in the East and the wall that divided the country.
But she insisted every citizen had to do her and his part to contain the spread of the disease and that this also applied to the government.
""We can and will use whatever it takes to help our entrepreneurs and workers through this difficult and testing time,"" Merkel said.
Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who earlier tweeted that he was working from home due to a heavy cold and was ""getting tested to be on the safe side"", said that the government was looking at additional steps to help firms hit by the virus.
""If, for example, rent has to be paid for business premises that cannot be opened because of the coronavirus, then it will be necessary for us to help,"" he told Die Zeit newspaper, adding that Berlin could also help airlines, cruise operators and trade fair businesses.
Scholz and Economy Minister Peter Altmaier already promised half a trillion euros in guarantees for business last Friday - and more if needed.
Germany's Robert Koch Institute said there were 8,198 cases of coronavirus in Europe's largest economy and at least 12 deaths.
The institute's president, Lothar Wieler, told reporters that if Germany does not manage to reduce contact between people for several weeks ""then it's possible that up to 10 million people in Germany will become infected"".
That would overburden the health service, he added.

Merkel's address to the nation was the first time in nearly 15 years in office that she had spoken to the country other than in her annual New Year's address.

Separately, the department also named five Iranian nuclear scientists who the Commerce Department said it sanctioned on Tuesday for having taken part in Iran’s pre-2004 nuclear weapons program and who continue to be employed by the Iranian state.
The Trump administration on Tuesday had said it would blacklist the seven companies and five individuals but did not name them.
The announcements appeared designed to signal Washington would not ease its campaign of choking off Tehran's ability to export its oil, despite appeals from China and others that it do so on humanitarian grounds because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The U.S. ""maximum pressure"" campaign, instituted after Trump in 2018 unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal Iran struck with six major world powers, aims to force Tehran to limit its nuclear, missile and regional activities.
The State Department identified the firms targeted as Hong Kong-based Mcfly Plastic Hk Ltd, Saturn Oasis Co, Sea Charming Shipping Company Ltd; Chinese companies Dalian Golden Sun Import & Export Co. Ltd., Tianyi International (Dalian) Co. Ltd. and Aoxing Ship Management (Shanghai) Ltd. and South Africa's SPI International Proprietary Ltd.
It also said it had targeted two entities which own or control SPI International and had knowledge of its sanctionable activities: South African company Main Street 1095 and Iranian entity Armed Forces Social Security Investment Company.
Further, the agency targeted Mohammad Hassan Toulai, managing director of Iran's Armed Forces Social Security Investment Company; Hossein Tavakkoli, director of SPI International; and Reza Ebadzadeh Semnani, director of Main Street 1095.
All of these entities and individuals were added to the U.S. Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals list, blocking their assets under U.S. jurisdiction and generally barring U.S. persons from dealing with them. 
The department also named five Iranian nuclear scientists who were added to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List as Aref Bali Lashak, Sayyed Mohammad Mehdi Hadavi, Kamran Daneshjou, Mehdi Teranchi and Ali Mehdipour Omrani.
Presence on the Entity List means the foreign parties are barred from receiving some or all items subject to U.S. export regulations unless the exporter secures a license, according to the department.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With Bernie Sanders on the ropes in the race for the Democratic Party nomination, Joe Biden can turn his attention now to a November matchup against Republican Donald Trump, backed by momentum in states that decide U.S. presidential elections.
Biden dominated Sanders in Tuesday's contests in three states, including Florida and Arizona, both known as political battlegrounds because their voters can swing to either party and so decide who takes the White House.
Defying the coronavirus that has upended life in America as in the rest of the world, turnout was robust in both states - many people voted early - suggesting that enthusiasm to defeat Trump remains high among Democrats.
Broad swaths of voters ensured Biden's success. Edison Research said these included women, African Americans and white rural voters. It was the same last week when Biden won Michigan, also likely to be decisive in the Nov. 3 election.
Perhaps most significant is that the centrist former vice president, 77, appears to be reaching the same moderate suburban voters who helped Democrats seize control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2018 congressional elections.
""We are seeing turnout spike in affluent, highly-educated suburban areas – precisely the kinds of places where the GOP has slipped since 2016 and where at least some formerly Republican voters appear to be more open to voting Democratic than in the past,"" said Kyle Kondik, an analyst at the University of Virginia Center for Politics.
While Kondik warned that primary voting is not always a reliable indicator of general election turnout, Biden's success could bode well in a battle with Trump, 73, the former businessman and reality TV star seeking a second four-year term.
Democrats have placed Arizona, Florida and Michigan at the top of their target list since 2016, when Trump took all three states. Former President Barack Obama, a Democrat and Biden's former boss, won all three in his 2012 re-election campaign.
SUBURBAN SLAM
Biden crushed Sanders on Tuesday in the areas around such cities as Miami, Orlando and Tampa in Florida. With votes still being counted in Arizona, he was up by 10 percentage points over Sanders in all-important Maricopa County, home to 60% of the state's population.
Biden showed similar dominance last week in the suburbs around Detroit, areas critical in November's election.
Turnout in Florida was up slightly over 2016 despite many voters staying home because of the pandemic. In Arizona, the number of mail-in ballots returned before the primary, 480,000, surpassed the number of total votes cast four years ago.
In a Democratic race once defined by such rabble-rousing outsiders as U.S. Senators Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, Biden has trumpeted his many decades in government to project the image of a calm steward amidst a national emergency.
Voters favored him over Sanders to handle a crisis by more than 2-to-1 in Florida and Arizona, according to Edison Research interviews.
Priorities USA Action, a top Democratic super PAC, said the coronavirus crisis, with the economy reeling and American daily life being dramatically refashioned, means trouble for Trump.
“We can’t predict the future of this pandemic, but Trump’s disastrous handling of the response so far makes him more vulnerable everywhere regardless of demographics,” said Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for the group, which plans to spend millions of dollars in support of Biden.
Biden on Tuesday improved his performance with Latino voters key to Democrats' fortunes. In his victory remarks, he appealed also to younger voters drawn to the more liberal Sanders for his policies on climate change, education and economic reform.
THE VIRUS AND THE VOTE
Opinion polls conducted by NBC News and Monmouth University show Biden with a slight edge in a head-to-head contest with Trump in Arizona.
The news has been worse for Trump in Florida, where a poll this month showed 40% of voters believe he deserves a second term, and that was before the coronavirus outbreak intensified.
That said, Fernand Amandi, whose Miami-based firm conducted the Florida poll, suggested the pandemic now affords Trump, who has been on national TV almost daily, an opportunity to right his ship in competitive states.
“The coronavirus can reshape the race a dozen times between now and Election Day,” Amandi said.
A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday showed 47% of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the crisis as the U.S. government has become increasingly proactive, up 9 percentage points from early March.
Aides say Trump adopted a more serious tone toward the threat after repeated warnings from his coronavirus team of advisers about the dangers facing the country in view of how the virus exploded in Italy and elsewhere.
Some Republicans say privately they view Biden as a formidable opponent.
One official close to the White House described him as seemingly ""an acceptable alternative to Trump,"" a candidate who could appeal to suburban women who have trended away from the Republican Party in the age of Trump but who would be reluctant to vote for Sanders, a democratic socialist.
""My view was always that Biden was the biggest threat,"" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
But with the coronavirus likely being the only thing on voters' minds at the moment, any strategic plans on both sides may seem secondary and almost irrelevant, Amandi said.
If the crisis extends deep into the year, he said, ""coronavirus will be on the ballot - and the accountability for it.”"

VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria will spend up to 38 billion euros ($42 billion) to secure jobs and keep companies afloat, Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said on Wednesday, joining other European countries providing more funds to limit the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.
Roughly 1,650 people in Austria have been infected and four have died from the virus.
The country has minimized air traffic, put ski regions under lockdown, closed its schools and most shops, urged Austrians to self-isolate, and introduced border controls with Italy, Switzerland and Liechtenstein.
From midnight, Austria will also make checks at the German border, a measure that its northern neighbour introduced on Monday.
""The border controls to Germany will be introduced today at midnight,"" said Markus Wallner, governor of the province of Vorarlberg, which borders all three states, on Wednesday evening. ""This is an Austria-wide measure.""
Such controls could significantly slow down traffic on the Brenner Pass, a vital link between northern and southern Europe and in particular between Germany and Italy.
Austria's government will provide another 9 billion euros in guarantees and warranties, 15 billion euros in emergency aid and 10 billion euros in tax deferrals in addition to an already announced 4 billion euro aid package, the chancellor said.
""With the clear goal, no matter what it takes, we try to support the people in our country,"" Kurz told a news conference.
""My political conviction is that the state must be frugal with tax money in good times so that there are opportunities to help in bad times. That time is now,"" Kurz said.
The 38 billion package equals 9.5% of the country's 2019 gross domestic product.
The funds are intended to ensure the existence of very small companies as well as to provide larger and very large companies with the necessary means to avoid financial difficulties, finance minister Gernot Bluemel said.
The finance minister issued a draft budget earlier on Wednesday that includes a small deficit instead of the initially hoped-for surplus. Bluemel said it was not possible to predict how much further the shortfall will widen.
""This is an exceptional situation also in budgetary terms. There is only one priority: to do what is necessary to help,"" the minister said, adding that the government would provide any amount of money that was needed.
Austria already has relaxed its short-time work regulation to make it as easy as possible for companies to keep their staff instead of firing them.
Among large Austrian companies, hit hard by restrictions are Austrian Airlines, which has applied for short-time working for all its 7,000 staff and Magna Steyr, a unit of Canada's Magna International with around 10,000 employees in Austria, which has stopped local production for two weeks, according to media reports.
Strabag, one of Austria's largest construction firms, said on Wednesday it would stop construction operations countrywide.
Gastein Valley, Großarltal and Flachau, ski areas in the western province of Salzburg, on Wednesday joined other popular places including Ischgl and St. Anton in Tyrol that were put under lockdown."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said on Wednesday the coronavirus pandemic adds urgency to prisoner releases agreed by Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's government and the Taliban and that they should begin ""as soon as possible.""
""No prisoners have been released to date despite the commitment to do so expressed by both sides,"" U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said on Twitter. 
Khalilzad's comments illustrated how the coronavirus pandemic is affecting one of U.S. President Donald Trump's top foreign policy priorities.
The prisoner releases were slated to have started last week as part of a U.S.-led effort to end America's longest war and bring peace to Afghanistan after decades of strife. But the releases were stalled by disagreements over the numbers of detainees to be freed and guarantees they would not return to fighting.
""The United States would like to see prisoner releases begin as soon as possible in line with the U.S.-Taliban agreement,"" Khalilzad wrote in a Twitter thread, referring to a Feb. 29 deal he signed with the insurgents for a U.S. troop withdrawal.
""Coronavirus makes prisoner releases urgent; time is of the essence,"" he continued, adding that the United States understood from consultations with both sides that they could ""work together and focus on technical steps"" for freeing detainees.

While face-to-face are meetings are preferable, ""Coronavirus and the resulting travel restrictions likely requires virtual engagement now,"" he said, and urged both sides ""to avoid provocative media statements.""

PRAGUE (Reuters) - The former first lady and wife of the late Vaclav Havel uses old theater drapes. Boy Scouts work with donated material, while others cut up old T-shirts as Czechs create home-made masks to fight the coronavirus.
Even before the government ordered people to wear masks or use something else to cover their mouths and noses when in public from midnight on Wednesday, Czechs had already ramped up their own home production lines.
Pictures on social media showed people waiting in line several meters apart in front of fabric stores while former first lady Dagmar Havlova began making masks from theater drapes and discarded linen from a villa she shared with president Havel. 
""We are not enough and we are tired,"" Havlova posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB). ""We need mainly seamstresses now. If you are from Prague and can work, let us know.""
The country has reported 464 cases of coronavirus infections with no deaths so far. Like other EU countries, the Czech Republic has shut borders and virtually locked the nation down to try to contain coronavirus contagion.
The order to wear masks in public came with the nation of 10.7 million facing a shortage of protective supplies, forcing many Czechs to produce their own following anger that front-line healthcare workers often lacked protective gear.
The government - which ordered fabric shops to remain open so people could buy material - has dispatched planes to China to bring back protective equipment and Czech billionaire Petr Kellner's PPF investment group donated supplies. 
""It's a spontaneous reaction to the situation,"" said Pavel Strnad, 32, who posted signs around the neighborhood asking for material he and his family could use to sew masks. ""We are sewing from t-shirts and other fabrics that we have at home.""
Many like the Strnads are donating masks to senior citizens or medical professionals after reports that many healthcare facilities and doctors' offices lacked protective gear. 
A survey from the association representing social service providers found nearly half the group's members had run out of masks while the group representing general practitioners recommended they shut down if offices lacked protective gear.
Researchers at Prague's technical university vowed to share technology they had developed to produce masks using a 3D printer while Boy Scout leaders called troops into action.

""We started when we were asked if we could do something like this and we said only if we did it ourselves,"" said Jiri Robenek, a scout leader from the Moravian region. ""When we have enough to distribute, we deliver them straight to where they are needed.""

The Russian trade and industry ministry issued the order to restaurants and bars this week, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Wednesday.
It said restaurants and bars also needed to 'strongly advise clients older than 60 years' to avoid visiting and to ensure customers washed their hands with soap before making an order.
The Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers said its members' sales had fallen by up to 90% recently and that some Moscow restaurants were poised to switch to food deliveries instead, suspending in-house operations.
Igor Bukharov, the federation's head, called the situation an emergency in a letter to Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin in which he asked the government to support the sector.
If things continue as they are it could fuel unemployment and reduce average real incomes, something President Vladimir Putin has said he wants to increase as a priority.
There are 130,000 eateries in Russia, 12,000 of which are in Moscow, according to Sergei Mironov, Bukharov's deputy and a restaurant founder himself.
""It's not possible to just close and then reopen a restaurant. Rotten food, rent, salaries - this all simply means they will shut down,"" he said.
Over 1.3 million people, or around 2% of Russia's total workforce, work in hotels, restaurants, beauty or sports facilities, according to Renaissance Capital and the state statistics service.
Further and stricter quarantine measures would trigger a spike in the jobless rate, cut incomes and lead to a harsher economic slowdown, said Sofia Donets, chief economist at RenCap.
Darya Ezhova, a fitness instructor from Moscow, has already seen a three-fold drop in personal workout classes in the past few days.
""Everyone has mortgages or needs to rent a place. I'm afraid that if everything shuts down in April, there will be no salary in May. I have some money set aside, but I'll may need to borrow from my mother,"" she said.
Russia has 147 confirmed coronavirus cases, most of them in Moscow."

A Voice of Vietnam radio report said Sung A Sinh and Lau A Lenh had attempted to establish their own country in Dien Bien province's Muong Nhe district in 2018 and 2019, with its own currency and army.
Twelve other people were also sentenced in the case to terms of up to 20 years.
Despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness to social change, Vietnam's ruling Communist Party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism.
The activities of the men ""are dangerous to the society, infringing upon the political regime of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam,"" the radio quoted the presiding judge as saying.

TOKYO (Reuters) - First, the cancellation in 1940. Then, the mass boycott in Moscow in 1980.
Forty years on, the upcoming Tokyo Games are the ""cursed Olympics"" once again, Japan's finance minister said, in remarks that could stir controversy at a time when his government is scrambling to quash speculation that the coronavirus epidemic could derail the world's biggest sporting event this year.
""It's a problem that's happened every 40 years - it's the cursed Olympics - and that's a fact,"" Taro Aso, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said in a parliamentary committee on Wednesday.
Japan had won the bid to host the Summer and Winter Olympics in 1940 - in Tokyo and Sapporo, respectively - but both Games were canceled due to the Second World War.
A close ally of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and a former premier himself, Aso is known for his staying power despite his penchant for gaffes that have insulted people, including doctors, women and Alzheimer's patients, over the decades.
Abe has staked his legacy as the longest-serving Japanese leader on staging a successful Games and bringing a massive jolt - estimated at $2.3 billion - to the stagnant economy with tourism and consumer spending.
But every passing day of the new coronavirus pandemic has brought more calls for a rethink of this year's Games, scheduled to open on July 24.
The International Olympic Committee, along with Tokyo's organizing committee and Japanese government, has said it is not considering a cancellation or postponement, even as other major events have been postponed, including, on Tuesday, soccer's Euro 2020 and Copa America.
The new coronavirus has so far killed more than 8,200 people and infected more than 200,000, with the epicenter now in Europe. Japan saw 40 new infections on Wednesday for a total of 1,629 cases, including about 700 from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo last month, Kyodo News reported."

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukraine's government imposed a state of emergency in the region surrounding the capital Kiev on Wednesday as Prime Minister Denys Shmygal warned of a national economic crisis due to the global fallout from the coronavirus epidemic.
The authorities have already imposed nationwide restrictions on shops, restaurants, theaters and transport in an effort to contain the coronavirus, which has infected 14 people so far, including one lawmaker. Two have died. 
It was not immediately clear what extra measures would be imposed on the Kiev region, but legislation allows steps including restricting people's movement, a ban on strikes, and special orders on distributing food and other essentials. 
The state of emergency does not affect the capital city itself yet, the interior ministry said, but such a decision could be taken later on Wednesday or Thursday. 
The infected lawmaker, Serhii Shakhov, who is not affiliated with any major political party, is in self-isolation after contracting the virus. People with whom he has recently been in contact will be tested. 
IMF TALKS
Shmygal's government, which took office after a sweeping reshuffle earlier this month, is holding talks with the International Monetary Fund on financial support and has received ""pretty positive"" messages, the prime minister said. 
Apart from the coronavirus, ""we must prepare the country for other challenges ... There may be an economic crisis in Ukraine,"" Shmygal said at a televised cabinet meeting. 
""We are moving forward regarding financial support from this international organization (the IMF). We hope for a positive result in the near future. The IMF messages are pretty positive today,"" he said.
Ukraine is one of Europe's poorest countries and its economy has been supported by IMF deals since the 2014 annexation of Crimea by Russia and the outbreak of a conflict against Moscow-backed forces that has killed more than 13,000 people. 
A new $5.5 billion IMF deal was provisionally agreed in December, but the money has not been disbursed yet and is contingent on the government passing reforms and making progress in a long-standing fight against corruption. 
The turbulence from the coronavirus has weighed on the hryvnia currency, which slipped to 27 to the dollar this week for the first time since June last year.
Restrictions across Europe have also caused a shortage of U.S. dollar bills in Ukraine, prompting major banks to temporarily switch to online transactions to exchange hryvnias for dollars. The central bank said a new delivery of dollar bills would reach Ukraine in the coming days. 
Separately Ukrainian police have appealed to citizens to phone a hotline to help identify people spreading false information about the coronavirus on social media. 

False stories have spread, including that the authorities have banned children from leaving their homes, and that helicopters are spraying disinfectant in cities at night, police said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russians spooked by the coronavirus epidemic have started hoarding a trusty national staple that has helped them get through multiple crises in their troubled history: buckwheat.
Cheap, filling and beloved by Russians as a side dish or as a meal in itself, buckwheat - ""grechka"" in Russian - was sold out in many Moscow supermarkets late on Tuesday or, at best, available only in expensive brands.
""This is the third shop without buckwheat,"" said Olga, 35, at a grocery store in Moscow. ""We don't like it and we don't usually eat it, but people are grabbing it and herd mentality is a factor. What if we don't know something they know.""
Russians have turned to buckwheat in times of crisis before. In 2014, supermarket shelves quickly emptied of buckwheat when rumors about damaged crops in Siberia compounded fears over an oil price slump, the then plunging rouble and Western sanctions.
In the dwindling days of the Soviet Union when food shortages kicked in people also fell back on buckwheat.
Russia has reported 147 cases of the coronavirus so far and no deaths, less than many other European countries. But the figure has risen sharply in recent days.
President Vladimir Putin told Russians on Tuesday that the situation was under control and urged them not to unnecessarily hoard groceries they could end up throwing away.
But that does not appear to have stopped the run on buckwheat.
One 69-year-old woman from Moscow who declined to give her name said she had made a panic purchase of buckwheat after noticing numerous people hauling shopping bags home.
""It's just a bit scary, everyone's carrying plastic bags and it made be feel uneasy that we don't have any reserves so I bought two packs of buckwheat,"" she said.
Another shopper in western Moscow grew angry at the sight of empty shelves usually stocked with buckwheat. As he heard a routine ""see you soon"" from a cashier upon leaving the store, he replied: ""You'll only see me if you bring back buckwheat.""
Boiled up like rice and easy to prepare, buckwheat is bland in taste and can be served up on its own with butter, linseed oil or milk, or as a side to accompany vegetables, fish or meat.
PRICE COMPLAINTS
The Federal Antimonopoly Service said people had begun complaining about rising prices for buckwheat, as well as for sugar and flour, the RIA news agency reported.
Russians consume around 440,000 tonnes of buckwheat a year and in times of uncertainty the cereal, which is grown and harvested domestically, often tops panic-buy shopping lists.
""It's the same consumer response as with toilet paper in Europe,"" said Alexander Korbut, deputy head of the Russian Grain Union.
""During periods of consumer panic, there is high demand for buckwheat and it is the first to disappear from supermarket shelves,"" said Dmitry Rylko, head of the IKAR agriculture consultancy.
But there is no threat of a shortage, he said, pointing to large stockpiles left over from previous harvest seasons as well as last year's crop that was enough to provide 433,000 tonnes of ready-to-consume buckwheat.
""There is a stereotype about keeping grocery products in stock which historically developed in the psychology of Soviet consumers: salt, sugar, matches, pasta, and buckwheat,"" Korbut told Reuters."

KAMPALA (Reuters) - A retired Ugandan general seeking to unseat veteran President Yoweri Museveni was charged on Wednesday with treason and unlawful possession of weapons, a case underscoring an ongoing crackdown on opposition figures ahead of elections next year.
Henry Tumukunde, who has also served as a security minister and intelligence chief, pleaded not guilty to the charges in a Kampala court and was remanded to a maximum-security prison with the next hearing set for March 30.
Tumukunde was detained last week alongside several members of his family and political allies, some of whom have since been released.
He has been accused of uttering statements meant to incite neighboring Rwanda to invade Uganda and overthrow its government, according to a charge sheet seen by Reuters.
Uganda and its southwestern neighbor Rwanda are at odds over various political and economic disputes.
Rwandan President Paul Kagame accuses Uganda of supporting dissidents sworn to ousting him from power. He closed Rwanda's border with Uganda in February last year; Angola-led diplomatic efforts to resolve the standoff have been to no avail.
While appearing on a talkshow on Ugandan NBS television on March 4, Tumukunde said: ""If I was Rwanda I would wish to support people who want to cause change in Uganda.""
Museveni, who took power in a 1986 coup, is widely expected to seek re-election in a vote due early next year.
His party is under pressure from the increasing popularity of musician-turned-lawmaker Robert Kyagulanyi, better known as Bobi Wine, who has amassed a large following among youth wooed by blunt criticism of the government leavening his lyrics.
Opposition leaders and rights groups have accused Museveni's government of cracking down systematically on its critics with the use of intimidation, detentions, torture and tear-gassing of rallies to discourage dissent.
Ugandan officials deny all such accusations, saying most arrests and detentions are carried out in the course of enforcing public order management laws."

People in central Madrid, summoned by a call on social media, appeared on balconies and on roof terraces to bang metal pans. Spaniards have been confined to their homes since Saturday for all but essential outings to stem the spread of the virus in the second worst-hit country in Europe.
King Felipe said on Sunday he had renounced his inheritance from his father, former King Juan Carlos, and stripped the ex-monarch of his palace allowance.
A Swiss newspaper has reported that while he was king, Juan Carlos accepted $100 million from Saudi Arabia. Juan Carlos, who abdicated in 2014 after nearly 40 years on the throne, has not commented on the report.
The royal household said in a statement that Juan Carlos had not told his son about the Saudi funds.

Spaniards have been coming to their balconies to cheer health workers during the lockdown, which has seen some of the toughest restrictions on movement in Europe.

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis has put a further spotlight on the Italian health services' struggle to cope with the coronavirus outbreak, by backing a prominent journalist's complaint that tax dodgers were partly to blame.
The comment came as Italy's chronically under-funded public hospitals have been pushed to breaking point at the epicenter of the contagion in the north and as others in less affluent regions scrambled to prepare for an onslaught.
Francis, who is secluded in the Vatican and holding his general audiences over the internet instead of before crowds in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ), spoke in an interview conducted by phone and published in the Rome newspaper La Repubblica on Wednesday.
He said he was ""very impressed"" by an article by journalist Fabio Fazio, who listed 15 lessons he learned from coronavirus crisis, and quoted one of them in its entirety.
Fazio wrote that the crisis should spur people to appreciate what really matters in life, such as personal relationships, solidarity and respect for the environment and to demand that politicians govern with responsibility.
""It has become evident that those who do not pay taxes do not only commit a felony but also a crime: if there are not enough hospital beds and artificial respirators, it is also their fault,"" Francis quoted verbatim from the article.
According to Italian Treasury figures last September, tax dodgers cost the country 109 billion euros on average each year between 2013 and 2015. Italy has the highest level of Value Added Tax evasion in the EU, the European Commission says.
The death toll in Italy rose to 2,503 on Tuesday and at his Wednesday audience Francis, who has condemned tax evasion in the past, praised Italian medical staff and volunteers who he said were risking their lives to help the sick.
Italy spends more of its budget on healthcare than any sector apart from pensions and has been cutting health costs for decades.
Under pressure to curb the euro zone’s second-largest public debt, Italian governments have slashed funding for regions and in turn regional authorities have targeted health spending, one of the largest items on their own budget.
As a result, the number of hospital beds per inhabitant in Italy has fallen to among the lowest in the euro zone.
Over the past three weeks, 1,135 people have needed intensive care in Lombardy, the northern region hardest hit. It has only 800 intensive care beds, according to Giacomo Grasselli, head of the intensive care unit at Milan's Policlinico hospital.
Authorities have been working to set up hundreds of intensive care beds in a specially created spaces in Milan and Rome but are still waiting for sufficient respirators and qualified personnel."

Police said last week the military had filed a lawsuit against Reuters and a local lawmaker for criminal defamation weeks after objecting to a news story about two Rohingya Muslim women, who died as a result of shelling in Rakhine state.
""We have withdrawn the case because of the mediation and request of the Myanmar Press Council,"" military spokesman Zaw Min Tun said by phone. ""We acknowledge and value the role of the media in the multi-party democracy system.""
Police in Rakhine state, where the case was filed, were not available to confirm the case had been withdrawn.
The press council, which adjudicates disputes between authorities and news media, said the army had withdrawn the case against Reuters and a lawsuit filed last year against an editor for local news website The Irrawaddy.
""In the future, if there is something unsatisfactory... we request organizations to send a complaint to the press council first instead of opening a case or suing,"" it said in a statement that welcomed the army's decision.
A Reuters spokesman said: ""We welcome the resolution of this matter via the Press Council. Reuters will continue to report on Myanmar in a fair, independent and responsible way, as we do all around the world.""
Both Reuters and The Irrawaddy had been facing lawsuits filed under section 66D of the Telecommunications Act, which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison and has been used to jail government critics.
The case against Reuters followed an army complaint about a story published on Jan. 25 in which the lawmaker was quoted as saying that the military’s artillery fire had caused the deaths of the two Rohingya women.
After publication, the army said its artillery fire had not killed the women or caused other civilian injuries and blamed insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA), who are fighting for greater autonomy in Rakhine state. The AA blamed the army.
The army held a news conference on Feb. 4 to complain about the story, after which Reuters updated the story to reflect the army’s position.
COMPLAINT
The army subsequently filed a complaint to the press council objecting to the article. It later brought the criminal defamation case against Reuters and the lawmaker, Maung Kyaw Zan.
The army did not comment on whether the case against him had also been withdrawn. Maung Kyaw Zan told Reuters he had heard nothing about his case so far.
The army filed a complaint against Ye Ni, an editor for The Irrawaddy, in April 2019 also over coverage of conflict in Rakhine state. Ye Ni said he was ""very pleased"" with the withdrawal of the lawsuit and the reasons given by the military.
Rakhine is the western region from which more than 750,000 Rohingya Muslims fled in 2017 following a military crackdown.
More recently, it has been engulfed by a new conflict between government troops and the insurgent Arakan Army, which recruits from the mostly Buddhist Rakhine majority population, and is fighting for greater autonomy.
Myanmar is facing charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice in the Hague over the crackdown against the Rohingya. The army denies genocide, saying it was fighting a legitimate battle against Rohingya militants who attacked first.
Two Reuters reporters were released from a Myanmar jail last May after spending more than 18 months behind bars, accused of breaking the official secrets act in a case that sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates.
Before their arrest in December 2017, they had been working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in Rakhine state."

The euro zone country's four-party government will be appointed on Saturday, replacing a center-left administration led by the Smer party which was in power for 12 out of the past 14 years.
""We are entering an extraordinarily difficult period but if we remain responsible and tenacious, we will make it,"" prime minister designate Igor Matovic said, referring to the spread of the coronavirus.
Slovakia had 105 cases of the disease as of Wednesday. It imposed a ban on international passenger travel, closed schools and most shops, and large factories including the car industry have also announced closures.
Sulik, head of the Freedom and Solidarity party and a former parliamentary speaker, will also become economy minister.
Sulik, 52, has been a proponent of budget responsibility. His party triggered the fall of a previous center-right cabinet in 2011 by opposing the bailout of Greece.

AL-ULA, Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - Exile Iranian musicians critical of religious hardliners in Tehran converged this month to perform in the most unlikely locale: Saudi Arabia.
Taking place amid heightened tensions between the regional enemies, the event was promoted as cultural dialogue but also allowed the kingdom a subtle dig at Tehran, with Saudi-owned MBC Persia airing the concerts for Iranian viewers.
The concerts in the al-Ula desert site were among the last big public events in Saudi Arabia before authorities imposed a virtual lockdown to curb the spread of coronavirus.
They featured two of Iran's most celebrated singers, Ebi and Leila Forouhar, alongside stars like Sasy, Arash and Andy.
""Never. I never thought one day I would be able to sing in Saudi Arabia ... but I'm very, very happy that I'm here,"" Ebi, who flew in from Los Angeles, told Reuters.
Some of the performers have previously attracted scorn from Iranian authorities, including for some overtly political tunes, and their Saudi tour drew criticism on social media.
""If someone goes and sings in Saudi Arabia, which is the symbol of hostility (against Iran) and the direct source of many problems of Iranians, the most polite word to describe this person is 'traitor',"" tweeted one user.
Ebi, whom fans describe as ""Iran's Frank Sinatra"", sang in Farsi, drawing applause from a dancing crowd of Saudis and invited Iranian guests that only partially filled the 500-capacity theatre.
He dedicated one song to women, including two bandmates on stage: ""I wish one day the ladies in my country are allowed to perform on a stage.""
Saudi Arabia has enacted social reforms to open up the conservative Muslim kingdom, including allowing concerts and letting women drive and enter sports stadiums.
Yet it remains locked in a decades-long rivalry with Iran that has played out in regional conflicts.
Asked about the concerts' political undertone, performers and attendees said they preferred to focus on the tunes.
""I try not to get so much involved into the politics,"" said Swedish-Iranian pop singer Arash. ""This is not my work, my work is to make people happy.""
Wisam Kabli, a 30-year-old consumer goods importer from Jeddah, said he came to learn something new and that geopolitics should be set aside at least for an evening.

BEIJING (Reuters) - China defended its decision on Wednesday to expel American journalists from three U.S. newspapers and bar them even from working in Hong Kong, saying the measure falls within the central government's purview over diplomatic affairs.
Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang also warned that China would be compelled to take further action against American media and journalists in China if the United States did not ""correct its mistakes"".
""The U.S. has said that all options are on the table. Today, I can also tell the U.S. that all options are on the table for China,"" Geng told a regular daily press briefing.
In the early hours of Wednesday, Beijing announced the expulsion of the journalists as retaliation for U.S. actions against Chinese media organisations, sharply escalating a tit-for-tat between Beijing and Washington over press freedom.
The decision, which comes amid increasing bitterness in rivalry between the United States and China, also raised questions about Hong Kong's autonomy under a ""one country, two systems"" agreement that sets out the former British colony's autonomy from the mainland.
But under Hong Kong's Basic Law, as its mini constitution is known, Beijing is ultimately responsible for foreign affairs and defence in Hong Kong.
Geng said the expulsions were in response to U.S. actions and that the decision to oust the journalists, and block them from Hong Kong, fell under Beijing's diplomatic authority.
China said it would expel U.S. correspondents with the  New York Times  (N:NYT), News Corp's (O:NWSA) Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020, and those affected would also not be allowed to work as journalists in Hong Kong.
In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of, or barred from, China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.
The Hong Kong government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The expulsion is expected to affect at least 13 journalists, according to the Foreign Correspondents Club of China, which said it ""deplores"" China's decision.
Geng declined to say how many journalists were affected by the decision.
The dispute has spiralled quickly.
Last month, Washington forced Chinese state media firms to register as foreign embassies.
Beijing then expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the ""real sick man of Asia"".
The United States then slashed the number of journalists allowed to work there at four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. It cited a ""deepening crackdown"" on independent reporting in China.
The Foreign Correspondents’ Club in Hong Kong said it was alarmed at the decision to expel the journalists and even more concerned that they would be banned from working as journalists in Hong Kong.
It said Hong Kong must provide assurances that foreign journalists working in Hong Kong and those applying to work in the city would continue to be issued employment visas without interference from the Chinese government."

GAZA (Reuters) - ""Dear world, how is the lockdown? Gaza.""
A sly dig at the international community, this is just one among a torrent of social media posts that has emerged from the blockaded Gaza Strip in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
The sight of a world locking itself down seems to have unleashed a wellspring of emotions in Gaza, from sardonic political commentary to schadenfreude, emerging from Palestinian denizens of the tiny coastal enclave that has for years lived with enforced isolation and confinement.
""Have you got bored with your quarantine, the closure of your crossings, your airports and your trade? We in Gaza have been living this for 14 years,"" one social media user posted this week.
“Oh world, welcome into our permanent reality,” he added.
Gaza, measuring 375 square kilometers (145 square miles) is home to around two million Palestinians, more than half of them refugees.
Along 90% of its land and sea boundaries its access to the outside world is controlled by Israel, and by Egypt on its narrow southern border.
An Israeli-led blockade has put restrictions on the movement of people and goods for years, amid security concerns following the 2007 takeover of Gaza by the Islamist militant group Hamas, and three subsequent wars which killed thousands of Palestinians and around 100 Israelis.
The irony is not lost on Gazans that the restrictions they chafe against may also have contributed to slowing the entry of coronavirus, with no cases reported thus far in Gaza.
But prolonged closure and isolation have contributed to the crippling of Gaza's economy, with unemployment at 52 percent and poverty levels of over 50 percent.
Standing in his empty metal factory in northern Gaza City, businessman Youssef Sharaf recalled the years when he used to be able to export electric heaters to Israel and the West Bank.
""I had 70 people working here, today I only have one,"" Sharaf told Reuters. Although the underlying causes of his closure were man-made, he empathized with those facing shutdown because of disease.
""It is tough,"" he said. ""May God be with them.""
But in Gaza's small but resilient high-tech sector, the obstacles that stop travel abroad also forced the early adoption of teleconferencing and other practices that world is now catching up with.
At Gaza Sky Geeks, an incubator for young entrepreneurs, computer programmers and web developers work remotely with international firms.
""Because of the years-long blockade on us, Gaza people better understand the current situation in world countries,"" said Angham Abu Abed, 24, a computer engineer who works with a software company in Britain.

""We hope the blockade on us will end, and we hope the virus will disappear from the world.""

HONG KONG (Reuters) - Officers from China's top internal security force - the People's Armed Police – joined Hong Kong police on the frontlines to observe anti-government protests that peaked last year, according to a senior foreign diplomat and an opposition politician.
Hong Kong police took PAP officers to monitor the protesters and their tactics as part of a wider effort by the paramilitary force to deepen its understanding of the Hong Kong situation, they said.
""I'm aware that Hong Kong police officers have taken Chinese security forces to the front during protests, apparently in an observation role,"" veteran democratic legislator James To told Reuters. 
To said he had reason to believe the Chinese forces included members of locally-based PAP units.
The foreign diplomat, who requested anonymity and declined to be quoted due to sensitivity over commenting on security matters, also said PAP officers accompanied police to the frontlines. 
Responding to questions from Reuters, the Chinese Defence Ministry said the PAP was not stationed in Hong Kong, while a Hong Kong police spokesman said they ""stress that there is no such visit or observation by any members of the mainland law enforcement agencies"".
The State Council Information Office and the Central Government's Hong Kong Liaison Office did not respond to Reuters' questions.
The diplomat and three other foreign envoys, however, estimated that China's government had ramped up the paramilitary People's Armed Police (PAP) presence in Hong Kong to as many as 4,000 personnel - far more than previously known estimates.
Their assessments were based on intense scrutiny of the security forces' response to the pro-democracy protests, which began last June, but have ebbed this year amid the ongoing coronavirus crisis.
Reuters had reported in September that an unknown number of PAP were among a surge in Chinese security forces moved quietly into bases across the city last year as Hong Kong's government struggled to contain the mounting political unrest.
The rapidly-modernized PAP is the mainland's core paramilitary and anti-riot force and operates separately from China's People's Liberation Army (PLA).  
Under 2018 reforms, both the PAP and PLA are under the ultimate command of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who sits at the apex of the Communist Party's Central Military Commission.
While both Beijing and local Hong Kong authorities have been relatively open about the low-key role of the PLA in the city, they have never confirmed the presence of the PAP. 
Some local legal experts and politicians fear the presence of the PAP - which has been devoted to internal security in mainland China - breaches the laws that protect Hong Kong's autonomy under Chinese rule.
Those laws provide for Beijing control over foreign affairs and defense, but give Hong Kong its own government, law enforcement bodies and legal system.
""I think the police and government should make clear what has been going on to ensure one country-two systems is being respected,"" To said, adding that he believed the PAP presence would remain in the city for the foreseeable future.
Lawrence Li, a spokesman for the Hong Kong government's security bureau, said outside law enforcement agencies, including from the mainland, did not have the authority to enforce laws within Hong Kong. 
Neither To nor the foreign diplomats saw any sign yet that the PAP have taken enforcement measures in Hong Kong, or deployed from their bases in other than observation roles.
 
FORCE TO RECKON WITH
But the diplomats said that taken together with the numbers of PLA troops that also expanded last year, the estimated 12,000-strong force marks the largest ever Chinese security deployment in Hong Kong. 
The PAP units are concentrated within PLA bases at the former British military forts at Stonecutters Island and Stanley on southern Hong Kong island - both shielded from public view, the diplomatic sources said. 
The size of the force has stayed relatively static in recent months, they said. 
The often violent street protests erupted over a now scrapped extradition bill that could have sent people to mainland China for trial, but they later broadened into wider calls for democracy.
While they have subsided during the health scare, many people expect the protests to resume ahead of local legislative elections in September.
Diplomatic envoys and security analysts say they are closely watching the PAP in Hong Kong, because they believe it, rather than the army, would spearhead any crackdown should the Communist Party leadership in Beijing choose to intervene in future protests.
They believe any such deployment remains unlikely, however, given Hong Kong's large and well equipped police force and the likely international impact of any such move. 
Formed in 1982, the PAP was used to suppress insurrection and riots in restive mainland regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.
Singapore-based military analyst Alexander Neill said the deployment of the PAP force to Hong Kong was a sign Beijing sees protests in the city as a vital issue of domestic security.
""Looking at it through that lens, it is a Chinese internal security problem and that is what the PAP is there for. That is their role, so I think they are going to be in Hong Kong for some time yet,"" Neill said. 
   
ANTI-RIOT DRILLS    
The PAP have their own vehicles, including amphibious armored personnel carriers, bulldozers and barbed-wired laying trucks. They stage frequent and extensive anti-riot drills on the bases, the diplomatic sources said.
While they share PLA facilities, they operate separately.
PLA commanders appear at some government and diplomatic functions as part of their traditionally symbolic role in Hong Kong, but the PAP has no such public role.
The Hong Kong police are preparing to take a tougher line against any resurgence in the demonstrations ahead of the elections in September, officials have said. 
And the government's budget announced last month boosted spending on police by 25 per cent to HK$25 billion ($3.31 billion), which will partly fund recruitment of 2,500 more officers for a force already 30,000-strong.

Assistant police commissioner Yuen Yuk-kin told reporters earlier this month that authorities were increasing monitoring of what he described as ""local terrorism,"" a threat he said was ""gaining steam"".

BEIJING/WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - China withdrew the press credentials of American journalists at three U.S. newspapers on Wednesday, intensifying a bitter fight between the world's top two economies over the spread of coronavirus and press freedoms.
The move comes after Beijing expelled three Wall Street Journal correspondents - two Americans and an Australian - last month following an opinion column by the newspaper that called China the ""real sick man of Asia.""
The day before, the United States had announced that it would begin treating five Chinese state-run media entities with U.S. operations the same as foreign embassies.
China denounced the newspaper's column as racist and, after the newspaper declined to apologize, revoked the visas of the three reporters in Beijing. Another reporter with the paper had to leave last year after China declined to renew his visa.
Then, in early March, Washington said it was slashing the number of Chinese nationals permitted to work at the U.S. offices of four major Chinese state-owned media outlets to 100, from 160 previously. It cited a ""deepening crackdown"" on independent reporting inside China.
As the tit-for-tat battle escalated, Beijing on Wednesday announced that American journalists with press credentials expiring this year who work with the  New York Times  (N:NYT), the News Corp-owned (O:NWSA) Wall Street Journal, and the Washington Post, would not be permitted to work in mainland China, Hong Kong or Macau. It said they must hand back their press cards within ten days. It was not immediately clear how many journalists were affected.
It also said the China branches of the three papers plus the Voice of America broadcaster and Time magazine must ""declare in written form information about their staff, finance, operation and real estate in China.""
Beijing said it was retaliating against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists. 
A striking aspect of Beijing's response was its decision to bar the journalists from working in Hong Kong and Macau, two semi-autonomous territories of China with their own media accreditation rules. In the past, foreign journalists kicked out of China were allowed to work in Hong Kong.
This raised questions about Hong Kong's autonomy under the ""one country, two systems"" agreement that still prevails between the territory and the mainland.
""There's no precedent for China dictating who can and can’t report from Hong Kong openly,"" said Steven Butler, the Committee to Protect Journalists' Asia program coordinator. ""It very seriously erodes Hong Kong’s autonomy and freedom of the press.""
The latest development follows a war of words between Washington and Beijing over the outbreak of the new coronavirus that causes the sometimes fatal, highly contagious respiratory illness COVID-19. The virus originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year and has so far killed 7,400 people across the world, and almost brought normal life to a standstill.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference that Beijing's move on Wednesday would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in ""incredibly challenging"" times brought about by the coronavirus.
""I regret China's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people,"" he said. ""This is unfortunate... I hope they'll reconsider.""
Media executives denounced the move.
""We unequivocally condemn any action by China to expel U.S. reporters,"" said Washington Post Executive Editor Marty Baron in a statement. ""The Chinese government's decision is particularly regrettable because it comes in the midst of an unprecedented global crisis, when clear and reliable information about the international response to COVID-19 is essential.""
Dean Baquet, executive editor at The New York Times, also condemned the decision.
""It is a grave mistake for China to move backwards and cut itself off from several of the world's top news organizations,"" he said.
Matt Murray, Editor in Chief at The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones Newswires, said: ""We oppose government interference with a free press anywhere in the world. Our commitment to reporting fully and deeply on China is unchanged.""
Time Editor in Chief and CEO Edward Felsenthal said: ""We oppose any effort by the Chinese government or any other government to expel reporters or intimidate those whose job is to provide accurate information, especially during this crucial period for the world."" 
A representative of Voice of America was not immediately reachable.
Beijing said on Wednesday that its actions ""are entirely necessary and reciprocal countermeasures that China is compelled to take in response to the unreasonable oppression the Chinese media organizations experience in the United States.""
Pompeo said he did not think Beijing's latest move was a balanced response. ""This isn't apples to apples,"" he said, charging that the Chinese journalists who had faced restrictions were part of ""propaganda outlets.""

(Reuters) - Yelitza Morles was in Florida with her 13-year-old daughter when she heard on Saturday that her flight home to Venezuela had been canceled due to her country's ban on international flights to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
She made it as far as Panama City aboard a Copa Airlines flight, where the pair and at least four other Venezuelans found themselves stranded in the airport, hit by the wave of travel restrictions sweeping Latin America.
Panama will not let any foreigners past the airport gates and Venezuela will not allow any flights from Panama.
""I understand they are taking care of Venezuelans, but they are also leaving some of us stranded,"" she told Reuters.
In scenes reminiscent of Tom Hank's confinement in an airport in the movie 'The Terminal', an official told them they might be stuck there for 30 days until the restrictions were lifted.
Even worse, the official told them hours later that the airport might close soon, leaving them with nowhere to go, according to a Reuters witness.
The governments of Panama and Venezuela did not return a request for comment.
Venezuela had organized a humanitarian flight on Sunday for passengers stranded in Panama, but the six Venezuelans landed at the airport after that.
Their plight has been repeated across Latin America as nations have slammed borders shut. Stranded passengers have taken to social media to complain.
In Peru, which shut its borders completely, several Brazilians said they had been stranded without a flight home or a bed to sleep in. In Mexico, an Argentine woman said she had made it to the airport only for her flight to Buenos Aires to be canceled as the country shut its borders.
Airline industry group ALTA said Colombia, Paraguay, Chile, Argentina, Honduras, Guatemala, Bolivia, Panama and El Salvador had also restricted flights into their territories, some completely.
As a result, the continent is experiencing an unprecedented reduction in air connectivity. The region's largest carrier, LATAM Airlines Group, canceled 90% of international flights.
""SEE YOU IN APRIL""
Brayan Groterol was stranded in Panama on Tuesday with his girlfriend on their way back from Mexico to Caracas.
An airport official offered the six Venezuelans the opportunity to travel to Cuba, which still has flights to Caracas. They could get to Havana for free but would have to pay their way to Caracas.
""But I don't have any money, or anyone to buy me a ticket,"" Groterol said.
The other two Venezuelas, a mother and daughter who declined to give their names, left on a flight to Bogota in the afternoon because they also have Colombian citizenship, although they do not live there.
Morles said the Venezuelan government had forgotten about them. She is asking Panama to let her in on a humanitarian visa, so she can find shelter. The airport offered to return her to Orlando, Florida, but Morles says she does not have the money to survive in the United States.
With no solution in sight, her daughter video-called her father in Venezuela.
""See you in April,"" she said."

Delays have hit a wide range of projects including the F-35 fighter jet, offshore patrol vessels and battlefield communication systems.
A report by National Audit Office (NAO) found about a third of the military's 32 most important projects are behind schedule. The new equipment is on average more than two years late before it can be at full operating capability, the report said.
Failure to deliver these projects on time will lead to overuse of existing assets and increase costs, it added.
""Things need to change and change fast. There are risks to national security if not,"" said Meg Hillier, who chairs parliament's public accounts committee. ""The whole culture needs an overhaul.""
The watchdog's conclusions come after Prime minister Boris Johnson announced a review of Britain's defense and security strategy, which will include a focus on military procurement.
Dominic Cummings, Johnson's senior adviser, a critic of past procurement, last year described the military procurement process as a farce and accused the forces of ""squandering billions of pounds"" on unnecessary hardware.
According to the NAO report, a persistent problem is equipment delivered either late or faulty by suppliers.
The military's delivery teams are under-resourced and lack essential skills, contributing to delays, the report said. Six of the 32 projects face shortfalls of more than 20% in their program teams.
""It is essential that the MoD improves the way it introduces important new defense capabilities into service,"" said Gareth Davies, head of the NAO.
""This includes ensuring that pressure to be seen to deliver quickly does not lead to it accepting incomplete projects."""

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq's president named little-known former regional governor Adnan al-Zurfi as prime minister-designate on Tuesday in another bid to overcome months of unrest and deadlock, but powerful Shi'ite blocs quickly lined up to reject his nomination.
Zurfi now has 30 days to try and form a government which must then survive a vote of confidence in Iraq's deeply divided parliament.
He is the second man chosen to succeed Adel Abdul Mahdi, who resigned as prime minister in November amid mass anti-government protests. The next candidate, Mohammed Allawi, quit on March 1, accusing parties of obstructing him.
Lawmakers told Reuters that President Barham Salih had named Zurfi only after larger rival Shi'ite political parties failed to agree on one candidate.
Some of those same groups rounded on the new candidate, who is head of the small Nasr parliamentary group of former prime minister Haider al-Abadi, a U.S. ally.
""We hold the president fully responsible for the repercussions of these provocative steps,"" read a statement from the Fatih alliance, which represents mostly Iran-backed Shi’ite militia leaders in parliament.
""He's an American joker and we reject him"", said Hassan Salim, a lawmaker from Asaib Ahl al-Haq Iranian-backed group which the United States designated as a terrorist organization in January.
Zurfi lived in the United States as a refugee in the 1990s after fleeing the regime of Saddam Hussein and is seen as a comparatively secular figure in a country long dominated by sectarian parties.
After Saddam's overthrow, he served as governor of the predominantly Shi'ite Najaf province during the U.S. occupation.
Zurfi will have to deal with both the powerful Iran-backed groups and with protesters who have been camping out for months, demanding an overhaul of the whole political elite.
President Salih called on Zurfi to work on holding ""early fair elections"" and to meet protests' demands.
Hours before the nomination, two rockets fell inside Basmaya military camp to the south of Baghdad, which houses U.S.-led coalition troops, without causing any damage on injuries."

The cancellation covers the ANZAC Dawn Service, the Australian Lone Pine Service and the New Zealand Service at Chunuk Bair, New Zealand said in a statement.
ANZAC Day commemorates the bloody battle on the Gallipoli peninsula in Turkey during World War One. On April 25, 1915, thousands of troops from the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) were among a larger Allied force that landed on the Gallipoli peninsula, an ill-fated campaign that would claim more than 130,000 lives.
While the Gallipoli campaign against the Turks failed, the landing date of April 25 has become a major day of remembrance in Australia and New Zealand for their troops killed in all military conflicts.
Turkish authorities who host the events have been advised of the cancellation. The Gallipoli ANZAC Day services are jointly organized by Australia and New Zealand.
""The Gallipoli services in particular have become a pilgrimage of sorts for many New Zealanders. But with global travel restrictions and isolation requirements in place in most countries it is simply not practical to hold this year’s event,” New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in the statement.
Australia and New Zealand have banned big gatherings in the country and this week asked their citizens currently traveling overseas to consider returning home while commercial travel options remain available."

BELGRADE (Reuters) - Serbia will ban people older than 70 from leaving their homes at any time and impose a night curfew on almost everyone else in a bid to halt the spread of coronavirus, President Aleksandar Vucic said, adding the measures take effect on Wednesday.
Health authorities in the Balkan country have so far reported 72 cases of infection and tested 374 people. There have been no fatalities.
In a live TV address to the nation, a somber looking Vucic said on Tuesday that the ""poor discipline"" of pensioners, many of whom scrambled to collect pensions and run errands after a state of emergency was declared on Sunday, prompted authorities to impose tough restrictions.
""From 10 AM tomorrow (Wednesday) in all urban areas it is absolutely forbidden to go out on the street to all persons over 65 and over 70 in rural areas ... due to sowing season,"" he said. ""An all-out curfew is in place for everyone, except those working night shifts from 8 PM until 5 AM.""
Vucic said local authorities and younger people will bring food and supplies to pensioners and that the government will allocate special shops where elderly will be allowed to purchase in the early morning hours.
Serbia has already imposed an array of restrictions, including the closure of kindergartens, schools and universities until the end of the semester, and a ban on entry to foreigners. It also plans to shut down all bus and train passenger traffic in two to three days, Vucic said.
Under the new set of restrictions, the Serbian military will take over all border crossings and maintain guard at over a dozen state-operated camps for illegal migrants from Asia and the Middle East.
Vucic, who earlier in the day met Chen Bo, the Chinese ambassador to Belgrade, also said Serbia had sought aid from China, which is already a major investor in the Balkan country. During his address he repeatedly called Chinese leader Xi Jinping his ""brother.""
""To avoid the worst case scenario ... we need you (China) to send us whatever you can ... we need your expertise as well,"" Vucic told Chen Bo, Chinese ambassador to Serbia.
Speaking in fluent Serbian, Chen Bo said that ""by the end of the week our experts will arrive.""

BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia could further restrict international and national flights and limit passenger transport by road in a bid to contain coronavirus, the transport minister said on Tuesday.
Governments throughout the world have implemented draconian containment measures from halting travel to stopping sport and scrambled to contain the devastating economic impact as the flu-like disease, which originated in China, has raced across the world.
More than 187,000 people have been infected and nearly 7,500 have died.
Colombia, which has 65 cases of the virus and as yet no confirmed deaths, has already barred anyone who is not a citizen or a resident from entering the country by air and completely shuttered land and waterway borders.
The country's transport sector accounts for some 4.9% of its $265 billion GDP.
""I cannot rule out any scenario. Our obligation is to have it simulated and have it clear the type of decisions we would need to take in the moment for health reasons,"" Transport Minister Angela Maria Orozco told Reuters in an interview.
Politicians like Bogota mayor Claudia Lopez have called for all international flights to be cancel, a measure Orozco did not rule out.
""It depends on the phase, how the contagion and pandemic increase and obviously the phase we are in compared to other countries,"" Orozco said, adding the Andean country is using other countries' experiences to inform its decisions.
There has already been a notable reduction in domestic passenger transport by air and road, the minister said.
Though activity is also down at principal shipping ports like Buenaventura on the Pacific Coast, Colombia will not be restricting the entrance or exit of goods, she added.
Air cargo transport has also not been suspended, Orozco said, though crews are not allowed to disembark.
There are not yet figures on losses in Colombia's transport sector due to COVID-19, Orozco said, but airlines in particular are facing a ""critical"" situation.
Global airlines on Tuesday demanded urgent tax relief to avoid multiple bankruptcies as coronavirus disruption continued its spread across the global industry.
""Just looking at my sector this will have an enormous economic impact,"" she said."

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria has banned street protests over the coronavirus, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune said on Tuesday, bringing to an end a year of unprecedented mass demonstrations that brought down the veteran president and convulsed the state.
Speaking in a televised address after meeting government ministers and security officials, Tebboune said gatherings and marches were prohibited.
""The lives of citizens are above all considerations even if this requires restricting some freedoms,"" he said.
Algeria has confirmed 60 cases of the coronavirus including five deaths, mostly in the town of Blida, south of the capital, and has restricted much foreign travel and closed mosques.
The protest movement, known as the Hirak, exploded onto the streets in February 2019 as it became clear that octogenarian leader Abdelaziz Bouteflika would seek another term as president after 20 years in the job.
Demonstrators quickly moved from demanding he step aside to insisting that the entire ruling elite that had run Algeria since independence from France in 1962 must also quit.
In April, as hundreds of thousands of people continued to march through the streets of major cities, Bouteflika gave in. He resigned hours after the powerful army chief, Ahmed Gaed Salah, said he should go.
With Bouteflika out of power, the authorities began detaining many of his closest allies on corruption charges in the biggest purge of the ruling class for decades, but the protesters viewed the reforms as cosmetic and would not yield.
As they started to demand the army's withdrawal from politics and Gaed Salah's resignation, the army chief pushed for a new election to replace Bouteflika.
The protesters opposed that, saying any vote would be illegitimate while the old elite still held sway. But the election went ahead in December, putting Tebboune into power.
Days later, Gaed Salah died suddenly of a heart attack, meaning all Algeria's most prominent figures from a year before, men who had dominated power for decades, had left the scene.
Tebboune offered talks with the protesters and promised to change the constitution, but the street demonstrations continued, though with what witnesses said were smaller numbers.
As the coronavirus arrived in North Africa this month, some protesters said they would no longer march for the sake of public health, but thousands still took to the streets."

Concord Management and Consulting LLC was accused of funding a propaganda operation to tilt the 2016 vote in favor of President Donald Trump. The case was set to be tried next month, but the case was dismissed on Monday at the request of U.S. prosecutors.
Prosecutors questioned the merit of holding the trial, saying Concord had tried to use case evidence to discredit the investigation, refused to cooperate and that there were also challenges raised by some evidence being classified as secret.
The firm's executive, Evgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with ties to President Vladimir Putin and who was also charged in the case, was not expected to attend the trial in the United States. 
On Tuesday, Concord hailed the dismissal of the case as a victory and said it was proof the case had been based on lies aimed at blaming Russia for the United States's own domestic problems. 
""A $50 billion Concord vs U.S. lawsuit for unlawful prosecution and sanctions is currently being drawn up,"" it said in a statement. 
Prigozhin and Concord were both charged in 2018, along with 12 other individuals and two other entities, with conspiracy to defraud the United States for their alleged role in election meddling aimed at sowing discord in the United States.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Roadblocks across Venezuela snarled the transportation of goods on Tuesday and businesses in the capital Caracas reported that food deliveries failed to arrive, in signs that a national coronavirus quarantine could worsen a humanitarian crisis.
President Nicolas Maduro on Monday expanded a limited quarantine to the whole of the South American nation, which has been hit by U.S. sanctions, after detecting 16 new cases of coronavirus for a total of 33.
Medical experts warn that the decay of Venezuela's health system during a six-year economic collapse will hamper Maduro's attempts to control the spread of the virus, which has already killed more than 7,400 people around the world.
According to a letter published by the foreign ministry on Tuesday, Maduro has asked the International Monetary Fund for $5 billion in emergency financing to ""strengthen"" the health system against the virus, the first time he has sought IMF aid during his seven years as president.
Venezuelan authorities said the quarantine barred movement between states, with exceptions for transport, health and food delivery services.
But according to Reuters witnesses in seven states, security forces at checkpoints were holding up trucks carrying food, gasoline and other basic goods between regions.
At the border between Caracas and Miranda state, a dozen armed soldiers wearing face masks were blocking traffic and turning back most vehicles. Several dozen heavy goods vehicles were queuing to enter Caracas as soldiers searched their cargo, though a Reuters reporter saw none pass.
""We are stuck with a very limited supply of fuel and food,"" said Carlos Albornoz, head of an association of Venezuelan meat and milk producers.
Abornoz said authorities were stopping producers from delivering food across the whole country, and so far the government had not issued them with any sort of permission to pass through checkpoints unhindered.
Caracas' main food distribution center, the Coche market, on Tuesday morning opened four hours late, delaying food dispatches across the capital, producers said, adding that markets in other states faced the same problems.
Inside Caracas, the military and police also cut off access to key thoroughfares, restricting movement for residents, who Maduro had ordered to stay at home.
But many Venezuelans said they could not afford to stay indoors as they relied on daily income to buy enough food to feed their families.
Businesses in Caracas reported on Tuesday that expected food deliveries had failed to arrive. The owner of a delicatessen in the up-scale Chacao district told Reuters his delivery truck, loaded with cheese and milk from the western state of Zulia, was stuck at checkpoints en-route.
At another market in Caracas, the Bicentenary market, several hundred people queued to enter, most wearing masks, anxious to buy supplies.
""I don't know what's going to happen to us,"" said Jose Errera, a 33-year-old metro worker.
""It's not a secret that a country like ours does not have the right conditions to deal with a pandemic,"" he said, citing the example of Italy, which despite a developed health system has reported over 2,000 deaths from the virus.
The impact of the quarantine was also felt in Venezuela's struggling health sector.
Some health professionals said they could not reach the hospitals where they work because of the roadblocks. Ana Rosario Contreras, president of Caracas' nursing school, said she registered at least five cases of nurses who were unable to work this morning, despite carrying identification.
In the states of Zulia and Tachira, bordering Colombia, the lock-down also worsened long-standing shortages of petrol as authorities shut most gas stations to all customers, except government officials, doctors and vehicles transporting food.
""Everything is shut, there's no movement between states, and even less by the border,"" said Juan Restrepo, head of a group coordinating transport between Venezuela and Colombia. ""We're desperate because we need to work."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Panic buying by British shoppers over coronavirus is getting worse despite appeals for calm, and supermarket bosses are concerned the government is yet to get to grips with the magnitude of the crisis, industry sources told Reuters.
On Sunday the food industry appealed to shoppers to stop panic buying, placing adverts in national newspapers. But it hasn't worked. 
Shelves were on Tuesday stripped bare of items such as eggs and chicken, while freezer chests were emptied. 
""It's getting worse,"" said a source at one of Britain's major supermarket groups.
Britain's big grocers, including market leader  Tesco  (L:TSCO), Sainsbury's (L:SBRY), Asda (N:WMT), and Morrisons (L:MRW), along with discounters Aldi and Lidl, have struggled for over a week to keep shelves stocked.
Britons have been stockpiling cupboard items such as dried pasta, flour, canned food, toilet rolls and hand sanitizer.
Store trading levels have been close to those only seen at Christmas, the busiest time of the year, while online grocery operations have been struggling to meet vast demand.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday shut down social life in Britain and advised the most vulnerable to isolate for 12 weeks, prompting another step-up in grocery trade on Tuesday. 
""The level of panic buying is definitely not getting any better,"" said a second source at another major UK supermarket group.
Aldi on Monday became the first grocer to introduce rationing, limiting customers to buying four items of any one product during each visit.
The supermarket industry says it is working closely with suppliers to keep food moving through the system and is making more deliveries to stores to get shelves re-stocked. 
It says supplies are still coming in from Europe, despite lock-downs in Italy, Spain and France.
MORE HELP
The government says it is speaking to supermarket CEOs about their response to coronavirus. Prime Minister Johnson said there was no reason to stockpile as food supplies were safe.
However, the first source said the government was only just starting to understand the enormity of the crisis for the supermarket industry. 
""They're in asking questions mode, they're certainly not in telling us anything mode. They're trying to understand what we're seeing rather than telling us to do anything specific.""
The second source added: ""Government are asking questions, listening and planning, but we'd appreciate a bit more help to get things moving.""
The source said the government could help by lifting restrictions on driver hours and relaxing Groceries Supply Code of Practice (GSCOP) regulations which slow the industry down.
Reuters reported on Monday that supermarket groups are working on plans to streamline their operations by cutting cafes, counters and other services to enable a depleted workforce to maintain basic provisions.

In-store cafes will start to close in the next few days. Supermarkets are also rationalizing ranges, reducing the number of pack sizes and different product options.

The three Baltic countries - Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - have criticized Poland for preventing their citizens in transit from returning home, since passage for foreigners was barred by Warsaw from Sunday morning.
While introducing border controls is allowed under the rules of the European Union's free-movement Schengen zone, EU members must accept their own citizens returning home and ensure transit for other EU nationals seeking to go back to their homeland.
Lithuania estimates around 420 vehicles with Lithuanian number plates were stuck on the German-Polish border on Monday, and some people protested by blockading roads leading to Poland, the country's foreign affairs ministry spokesman said.
Estonia's government said it had agreed with ferry company Tallink to arrange a cruise ship to collect people from Sassnitz harbor in Germany late on Wednesday.
On Tuesday, Poland agreed to let buses and vans from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia pass through its territory in five ""convoys"" of about twenty cars each, stopping only at designated gas stations, Lithuania said.
Poland provided five small ferries to transport cars directly to the Lithuanian port of Klaipeda, and Lithuania booked a train to return people from Germany through Poland without stopping, Lithuania said.
Lithuanian Prime Minister Saulius Skvernelis told reporters on Tuesday that Polish authorities had assured him they will keep letting vans and buses pass in regulated convoys, but cars must use ferries.
Swedish company Stena line will run a ferry trip from Travemünde to Liepaja in Latvia late on Wednesday evening and a couple of additional trips on Monday and Tuesday next week.

China announced earlier it was retaliating against U.S. restrictions on Chinese journalists, with actions that include rescinding the credentials of American correspondents with the New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Washington Post that expire by the end of this year.
Pompeo told reporters at a State Department news conference the move would deprive the world and the Chinese people of information in ""incredibly challenging"" times brought about by the coronavirus. 
Early this month, Washington said it was slashing the number of Chinese nationals permitted to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state-owned media outlets in retaliation for what it called Beijing's ""long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.""
Pompeo said he did not think Beijing's move was a balanced response. ""This isn't apples to apples,"" he said, charging that the Chinese journalists were part of ""propaganda outlets.""
""The Chinese will tell you they want more information and people to know about the country and yet they continue to take action like the one you see today where they deny the world the capacity to know what's really going on inside another country,"" Pompeo said.
""I regret China's decision today to further foreclose the world's ability to conduct the free press operations that frankly would be really good for the Chinese people... in these incredibly challenging global times, where more information, more transparency, are what will save lives. This is unfortunate... I hope they'll reconsider.""
The executive editor of the Washington Post, Marty Baron, condemned the Chinese move, calling it ""particularly regrettable"" when clear and reliable information about the global response to the coronavirus pandemic was needed.

""Severely limiting the flow of that information, which China now seeks to do, only aggravates the situation,"" he said in a statement.

PARIS (Reuters) - All health professionals in France are expected to be supplied with respiratory masks in the next two days, the French health minister said on Tuesday, after the government ordered a requisition of the protective gear to try and combat shortages.
Earlier this month, French president Emmanuel Macron said the state would seize masks being produced on French soil to end shortages in some hospitals, doctors' practices and chemists, as countries across Europe fight the coronavirus outbreak.
""Lorries are getting to the 25 regions where needs are the most pressing,"" Minister Oliver Veran told reporters, adding all regions would benefit from these deliveries by Thursday. He did not provide figures.
The masks will not, however, be made available to the public.
Germany also said earlier in March it was limiting exports of respiratory masks. The German decree was amended on Saturday, a day after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said limits placed on exports of medical equipment by countries including France and Germany undermined the EU single market.
The coronavirus outbreak has triggered a massive surge in demand for protective gear and shortages soon became acute as China, where the virus originated, accounted for more than half of global production of masks, according to the World Health Organization.
Many health professionals in France have criticized the shortages as the country fights the coronavirus and entered a unprecedented lockdown on Tuesday. Supermarket workers have also asked to be provided with masks as their stores remain open, although they have not had access to them so far.
Sources at several mask maufacturers in France told Reuters that they increased production, adding that their clients overseas had expressed discontent about the export ban however.
When asked about the situation in France, a spokeswoman with U.S 3M (NYSE:MMM), a leading masks manufacturer, said last week it was urging governments around the world to better work together, adding ""barriers put up by some"" were ""impeding its efforts.""
Last week, European Union industry chief Thierry Breton said his teams had started overseeing production of masks and other protective equipment to address shortages across the bloc."

Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was arrested in April 2016 at a Tehran airport as she headed back to Britain with her daughter after a family visit.
She was sentenced to five years in jail after being convicted of plotting to overthrow Iran's clerical establishment.
Her husband Richard, who has set up the ""Free Nazanin"" campaign group and lobbied the British government to secure his wife's release, said in a statement she had been temporarily released on furlough from Evin Prison and was now staying at her parents' home in West Tehran.
""Unfortunately, Nazanin will be exceptionally required to wear an ankle tag during the furlough, which her parents have now hired from the authorities,"" Richard Ratcliffe said. ""Nazanin’s movements will be restricted to 300 meters from her parents’ home."" 
Earlier this month Ratcliffe said he feared his wife had contracted coronavirus but the Iranian judiciary said she was in good health. 
On Tuesday, a judiciary spokesman said Iran had temporarily freed about 85,000 people from jail, including political prisoners, in response to the coronavirus epidemic.
""I am relieved that Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was today temporarily released into the care of her family in Iran,"" British foreign minister Dominic Raab said in a statement.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Publican David Chawke should have been frantically pulling pints on Tuesday in the middle of his busiest day of the year as the annual St. Patrick's Day parade passed his central Dublin bar, The Bank.
Instead, one of the biggest bars on the route was as empty as the streets outside after Ireland's famous pubs followed universities and schools in shutting their doors to slow the coronavirus spread.
St. Patrick's Day parades in towns and villages big and small were canceled a week ago. The flagship gathering in Dublin typically draws some 500,000 revelers each year including many from abroad, kicking off the tourist season.
""It's our busiest day of the year and the whole week would probably be our busiest week of the year,"" said Chawke, whose extended family run nine pubs around the country.
""The problem is we just don't know when things will get back to normal.""
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar estimated 100,000 people or more - almost 5% of the workforce - could lose jobs in the next two weeks as he warned the country that coronavirus cases could soar to 15,000 from 223 over that period.
Hospitality groups predict far greater job losses in an economy that was the fastest growing in the European Union before the virus outbreak.
Around 10% of Ireland's workforce are employed in tourism-related sectors, behind only Iceland and Spain among OECD members.
The Chawke-owned pubs are so far retaining all 400 staff and do not envisage letting anybody go as they try to ride the crisis out. 
""Everyone is just going to do what they can,"" said Chawke.
NEIGHBORHOOD PARTIES
Some Dublin families who usually throng the city's streets each March 17 have came up with their own, virus-appropriate celebrations.
On Sandford Avenue, on the edge of Dublin's historic Liberties district, families gathered at their front gates to solemnly play 'Oro, Se Do Bheatha 'Bhaile', a traditional Irish song, on fiddles, recorders and guitars.
The neighborhood 'session', as a gathering of traditional Irish musicians is known, was organized on the street's WhatsApp messaging group with Lia Byrne, a musician and teacher at a local secondary school, sending around sheet music, lyrics and an audio tutorial.
    ""The kids were disappointed that there was no party this year,"" said the mother of two school-aged children. ""Usually, after the parade, we'd end up socializing with the other families on the street.""
    ""It's important to still come together as a community to celebrate.""
The government's guidelines on ""social distancing"" are, however, causing difficulties for restaurants. Though told they should stay open, many have already shut their doors. 
In Ireland's fourth largest city of Galway,  Michelin  (PA:MICP) starred chef JP McMahon put 45 staff on temporary leave across his three restaurants on Sunday, including his sister and other family members.
""It was horrible. Our staff is like a family, you want to mind them but you don't have anything to mind with,"" he said.
Pottering around his empty restaurant, McMahon says the government must do far more than set aside 3 billion euros, mainly to cover sick pay and healthcare costs.
Having heeded the advice of Ireland's main retail lobby to halt major payments and with enough cash to keep going for a month, McMahon is just keeping the lights on to stop the food in fridges and freezers rotting.
""It's heartbreaking, all you've been doing for 12 years to build this up and it all just ends in a night,"" said McMahon, who was supposed to be in Disneyland Paris with his young family this week.

""If this goes on longer than four weeks, then we're at rock bottom.""

Radi, 33, tweeted last April that the judge was working under orders when he gave heavy sentences to leaders of protests that took place in northern Morocco in late 2016 and early 2017 over the country's social and economic woes.
""I was expecting to be acquitted as I am not guilty and was only expressing my own opinion,"" Radi told Reuters after the verdict. He said he will appeal the verdict.
Local rights groups have decried the increasing use of the penal code in trying free speech cases instead of the more lenient publishing code, which has had no provision for imprisonment since a reform in 2016.
""He should never have been put on trial in the first place or sentenced for expressing peaceful views on social media. This sentence reinforces the message that anyone in Morocco who stands up for human rights will be punished,"" said Amnesty International in a statement.
The prosecutor said Radi's tweet was directed at the judge in person and not the judiciary. Radi and his lawyers denied that.
Radi was released on bail on Dec. 31 after spending five days in prison. His case triggered a wave of solidarity by Human rights activists and groups including Morocco's Freedom Now, Human Rights Watch and others which all demanded his immediate release.
Moroccan courts have in recent months sentenced a dozen individuals to prison terms of up to four years on charges that include insulting constitutional institutions or public servants and inciting protests, according to rights activists."

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian shops, restaurants and transport shut down on Tuesday as the country tightened restrictions to contain the spread of the coronavirus, while police arrested five people suspected of trying to rob 100,000 surgical masks at gunpoint in Kiev.
The country has seven confirmed cases of the coronavirus so far, including one death. The government has encouraged people to stay at home wherever possible except to buy food and medicine, but has stopped short of introducing curfews.
Following a series of emergency steps introduced by President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, parliament in a special session on Tuesday approved measures including fines and prison sentences for people who broke mandatory quarantine.
The economic fallout from the epidemic also continued to bite as the hryvnia currency slipped to 27 to the dollar for the first time since June 2019.
The central bank said it would not impose foreign currency restrictions and added it had $25 billion in reserves to continue market interventions.
Nevertheless it warned of an economic hit on Ukraine, which is still fighting a simmering conflict against Russian-backed forces in the eastern Donbass region that has killed more than 13,000 people since 2014.
In Lviv, a picturesque city of cobblestone streets in western Ukraine that is popular with tourists, restaurants and cafes closed and supermarket attendants wore masks and gloves while working at the tills.
""Of course, no one is happy about the restaurant shutdown,"" said Mark Zarhin, the owner of a restaurant chain.
""It is like a perfect storm in Lviv. We face both 'plague' and war today. It is the worst. But it's not the fact that we close the restaurants that is bad, but the fact that we don't know for how long. We cannot predict anything.""
The nationwide shutdown will include the closure of the Chernobyl area, the site of the world's worst nuclear disaster in April 1986 that has since become a visitor attraction.
Kiev's main airport was mostly empty after the government banned passenger flights to and from the country, and announced a shutdown of domestic air travel from Wednesday.
The authorities also announced the arrest of a group of people who, initially posing as members of the state security service, stole a stash of 100,000 surgical masks at gunpoint from a private seller who had stored them in his car.
""Instead of negotiating the purchase and sale conditions, the criminals attacked (the seller), took the masks and beat the man,"" Kiev police chief Andriy Kryshchenko said. ""Wearing police uniforms and threatening to use firearms, the criminals took possession of the whole batch of goods."""

Patriarch Kirill approved the array of new sanitary guidelines after the Novaya Gazeta newspaper last week reported hundreds of worshippers in St Petersburg were kissing a relic being wiped down with a cloth despite fears over the new virus.
Russia has reported 114 confirmed cases of the coronavirus. That figure has risen sharply in recent days, although there have been no confirmed deaths.
The new church measures, detailed in an online statement, told staff to regularly wash their hands and disinfect icons, to maintain good ventilation in churches and for priests not to proffer their hands to be kissed.
Staff were also instructed to change water used for baptisms after each individual use and for priests to use disposable gloves when handling bread that is blessed and distributed to worshippers.
""Instead of (holding out) the cross for kissing at the end of the Divine Liturgy and other services, we recommend placing the cross on the heads of parishioners,"" it said.

Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton born to Libyan parents, detonated his bomb at Manchester Arena as parents arrived to collect their children at the close of a show by the U.S. pop singer in May 2017.
Among the dead were seven children, the youngest aged just eight, while 237 people were injured and 670 survivors reported suffering from psychological trauma.
Prosecutors had said his younger brother Hashem Abedi, now also 22, was just as guilty of the murders by helping his sibling to carry out the attack.
""Hashem Abedi encouraged and helped his brother knowing that Salman Abedi planned to commit an atrocity. He has blood on his hands even if he didn’t detonate the bomb,"" Max Hill, Britain's Director of Public Prosecutions said in a statement.
London's Old Bailey court was told Abedi helped his brother get the components of the homemade bomb and that together they experimented with its construction, buying screws and nails to be used as shrapnel.
They stored and made the device at a separate address in Manchester and, shortly before they returned to Libya in mid-April 2017, they bought a car to be used to store the bomb-making equipment.
Hashem Abedi was in Libya when the attack took place and became the first suspect to be successfully extradited to Britain when he was sent back in July 2019.
Islamic State said it was responsible for the attack in the immediate aftermath of the bombing, but security services have always treated that claim with scepticism.
In 2018, British lawmakers concluded that the MI5 security service had missed potential opportunities to prevent the bombing.
The Abedi family emigrated to Britain during the rule of late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, later moving from London to the Fallowfield area of south Manchester. Hashem Abedi was born in Manchester and the brothers' parents returned to Libya after Gaddafi was toppled in 2011."

The Kyodo newswire reported on Monday that the emperor's trip might be postponed.
The queen's decision was made as the Church of England said it would suspend public worship until further notice to slow the spread of the coronavirus.

741,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 17, 2020 10:43AM ET</span>","Under Europe's virus lockdown, social media proves a lifeline","By Luke Baker
LONDON (Reuters) - Hundreds of millions of Europeans are getting to grips with weeks of a massively contracted existence under lockdown.
The goal is clear and very serious -- reduce the spread of a deadly virus, keep critical medical resources and hospital beds free for the most vulnerable, save lives.
But behind that sobering objective lies a new challenge for many: hours inside the same four walls, no office chatter, no social contact, kids to entertain (if you have them and they are not in school), the lure of the fridge.
The reality of the new reality is that social media has become a near-essential resource. Whether for news, shared experiences, comic relief or a heated discussion, Twitter, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Instagram have become a lifeline to many.
While in Italy, tenors and the less tuneful have taken to singing songs from their balconies to cheer up neighbors and build solidarity, videos of the performances have entertained millions far beyond Italy on social media.
Chris Martin, lead singer of the band Coldplay, took to Facebook on Monday to put on a live gig for people self-isolating, tagging it #TogetherAtHome. Singer John Legend took up the baton and said he would do the same on Tuesday.
For anyone tracking the ins and outs of the virus, whether infection rates, epidemiological research, or the infection lag between Italy and its neighbors, Twitter is a constant source of information (and, be warned, misinformation).
While European leaders have been holding news conferences or delivering televised addresses, these are at best once a day.
Online, there is a constant stream of news, commentary from experts, graphs analyzing the virus, and videos from people in Italy (which is 10-14 days ahead in terms of the infection spread) recounting what they wished they had known 10 days ago.
As working from home (#WFH on Twitter) becomes the norm, there are tips on how best to do it, where to set up a desk, how to stay focused, and if you don't have a desk, how an ironing board can double as an excellent, adjustable alternative.
Among the tips for those doing conference calls from home are the obvious -- make sure to get out of your pyjamas and brush your hair, even if you don't necessarily have to be wearing trousers if you're sitting behind a desk.
On Facebook, home workouts have proved popular, with people posting the best ways of staying fit while confined to a room. One popular video involves a woman doing a routine around a load of toilet rolls, which have been the object of hoarding by consumers worried about the impact of the virus.
As always, pets have proved a hit. Alongside WFH advice, many have been posting pictures of their cats and dogs, some of which look surprised by all the sudden unexpected attention.
For many, the surge in social media use in recent years has been an awful contradiction -- rather than making people more friendly, it has tended to cut them off, cause division and fuel anger and resentment, not sociability.
But as Europe adjusts to the reality of self-isolation, there are signs social media can bring out the best in people, not just the boastful or argumentative bits many decry.
On Twitter, alongside advice on working from home or looking after elderly relatives, users are opening their direct messages, allowing anyone to contact them, and inviting those who want to talk or share concerns to get in touch."

KIGALI (Reuters) - Alarmed consumers thronged markets across Africa on Tuesday, many in masks and gloves, to stock up as the coronavirus spread on the world's poorest continent.
Prices rose in some parts, though at least one country, Rwanda, sought to control costs of staple foods.
""It is as if people are preparing for war,"" said an astonished shopkeeper as Rwandans clamored for rice, cooking oil, sugar and flour at a market in the capital Kigali.
""Prices have gone up - but still they buy.""
Initially spared as the coronavirus battered China and then spread out, Africa has seen a rush of cases this month and governments are taking drastic measures to curb its spread.
At least 30 African nations have now reported more than 400 cases, seven in Rwanda.
For many poorer Africans, panic-buying was a privilege they could not afford.
""Rich people are not afraid of high prices. They are buying in huge quantities,"" said 43-year-old Pascal Murengezi, a father-of-three hawking second hand clothes outside the Nyarugenge market in Kigali who said he could not afford more than a day's worth of food.
""If the outbreak continues, I don’t know how I will sell clothes on empty streets.""
The shopkeeper, who declined to give his name fearing a visit from inspectors, said Tanzanian rice had risen from 27,000 francs ($29) to 30,000 francs per 25 kg bag while Pakistani rice was up from 22,000 francs to 28,000 francs.
Speaking as shoppers in masks and gloves picked over items, he blamed wholesalers for the increases.
The trade ministry in Rwanda fixed prices late on Monday for 17 food items including rice, sugar and cooking oil. It did not specify punishments for price-gouging.
Exasperated by the rises, Beatrice, a 52-year-old Rwandan with a child and no job, said she could only buy a minimum of rice. ""You can't see your children go hungry,"" she said. ""We don't know when this coronavirus will stop. If I had enough money, I would buy a lot more food.""
SUPERMARKET SAYS SORRY
Kenya, East Africa's economic powerhouse, also saw a rush on shops after reporting its first coronavirus case on Friday. Within minutes, shoppers at the upscale  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) supermarket near the United Nations complex in Nairobi began piling trolleys with wipes, sanitizer, and staples like rice and long-life milk.
Tusky's, another Kenyan supermarket, urged customers not to panic and this week launched a home delivery service.
Like Rwanda, Kenya stepped in to try and curb price rises.
Its Competition Authority ordered another chain, Cleanshelf Supermarkets, to refund customers for overpricing hand sanitizers. The firm blamed one staff member for making unauthorized price increases.
""The recent experience is unjustifiable and we are very sorry,"" said Veronica Wambui, head of sales and marketing, in a statement the company posted on Twitter.
From South Africa to Senegal, long lines snaked outside stores as families stocked up on items such as disinfectants and pasta.
""This is crazy. There's almost nothing on the shelves,"" said 68-year-old pensioner Barbara Ollerman, stacking rice in her trolley in Johannesburg's Woolworths.
Auditor Sihle Qalinge at Checkers supermarket nearby said she had sneaked out of work to buy toilet paper - she had been trying to find it since Sunday.
Anna, the manager at Auchan supermarket in Dakar's upmarket Mermoz area, said sales had doubled since last weekend. Hand sanitizer had run out and suppliers were struggling to fulfill orders, she said.
""The most sold items are pasta - people have taken everything!"" she said, adding that prices remained the same, even though many desperate shoppers were not checking.

Maesaiah Thabane was charged with ordering the killing of Prime Minister Thomas Thabane's estranged wife Lipolelo but was released on bail last month.
The case has caused huge political upheaval in Lesotho, an independent kingdom lying in the middle of a South African mountain range, with Thomas Thabane also suspected of being involved in the killing and having appeared in court.
Both Maesaiah and Thomas Thabane have denied any role in Lipolelo's death.
Flanked by supporters, Maesaiah Thabane appeared relaxed in the courtroom on Tuesday. She did not say anything, and the magistrate adjourned proceedings.
Advocate Puseletso Sekoati told the magistrate that prosecutors were not ready to proceed as four other suspects in Lipolelo's murder had still not been charged.
""Investigations regarding this matter have been completed by the police, and what is left is for the four other suspects who are in South Africa to be arrested and brought before court to be charged,"" Sekoati said.
Maesaiah Thabane's lawyer, Rethabile Setlojoane, said if she was not indicted by April 14, she would apply for the charges to be dropped.
Lipolelo, then 58, and Thomas Thabane, now 80, had been going through an acrimonious divorce when she was gunned down in June 2017, two days before her husband's inauguration as prime minister. Thabane and Maesaiah Thabane, now 42, married two months later."

""With immediate effect, I have taken the decision to advise British nationals against non-essential travel globally, for an initial period of 30 days and of course subject to ongoing review,"" Raab told parliament.
Referring to the growing number of border restrictions in other countries, Raab said Britons who decide they need to travel abroad should be aware of the increased risks of doing so, including the possibility of not being able to get home.
He added the Foreign Office was not yet advising Britons abroad to immediately return to Britain, except for those in a few countries, but he warned those who wanted to head home to keep in mind that flights could be canceled at short notice or be stopped by travel restrictions.
Raab also said the government would work with the freight industry to ensure the flow of goods continued with as little disruption as possible."

PARIS (Reuters) - Parisians rushed to rail stations and took to the highway on Tuesday to escape the French capital before a lockdown imposed to slow the rate of coronavirus contagion kicked in at midday.
Those who stayed behind descended on supermarkets and pharmacies even as these were due to remain open under the sweeping restrictions on public life announced by President Emmanuel Macron late on Monday.
The Paris exodus drew dismay from provincial France, where many fear that city-dwellers will bring the virus with them and accelerate its spread.
One man, a pensioner who was loading his car near the UNESCO headquarters, said he was fleeing to his country house 100 km west of Paris.
""Better to be there than couped up in the apartment,"" he said, giving his name only as Jean-Yves.
Along with controls on France's land borders, Macron ordered people to stay at home from 1100 GMT on Tuesday and to leave only to buy groceries, travel to work if essential, exercise or for medical care. The army will help move the sick to hospitals, he said.
France's death toll from the coronavirus has reached 148 and a total of 6,600 people have been confirmed infected. 
As in other European countries including Italy, Germany and Spain, schools are closed, restaurants and bars shuttered up, and factories idle. 
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said he expected the French economy to shrink by 1% in 2020.
Airbus (PA:AIR) said it would temporarily stop production at its plants in France and Spain. Carmaker  Renault  (PA:RENA) announced it was shutting down industrial sites in France and Spain until further notice.
PANIC-BUYING
In central Paris, normally choked with traffic, children played out in the streets before the lockdown came into force. It will last at least two weeks, Macron said.
In supermarkets across the city, people loaded up their trolleys, ignoring the government's plea not to panic-buy.
In one Monoprix supermarket in the 15th arrondissement, close to the Eiffel Tower, the shelves were empty of flour, pasta and long-life milk. At the tills, the store had marked out one-meter intervals in tape to remind customers to keep distance from one another and sought payment by card, not cash.
At the Gare du Nord station, crowds of passengers, many wearing masks, waited to board their trains out of the city. Armed police patrolled inside and a worker disinfected the main hallway. 
Junior transport minister Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said the government had not wanted to prevent people traveling to the provinces. But he acknowledged the spread of the coronavirus might be exacerbated by people crowding onto trains.
In provincial France, some were incredulous at the influx of city folk. 
""Parisians are fleeing the city and will infect the provinces, just to be confined in the open air. This exodus is unthinkable, selfish and a ticking time-bomb,"" one Twitter user wrote.
One traveler, at the Gare du Nord, 44-year-old Stephane Legrand, shrugged at the suggestion the exodus was going to help spread the contagion.

""The virus is global already. I'm normally in good health, I'm never ill, so I hope all will be well.""

The explosions took place in front of the Southern (NYSE:SO) Border Provinces Administrative Center (SBPAC), a Thai government body that oversees the administration of three mostly Malay-Muslim majority provinces of Narathiwat, Pattani and Yala where an insurgency since 2004 has killed some 7,000 people.
SBPAC was hosting a government meeting on the region's response to the outbreak of the coronavirus prior to the explosions.
""The first bomb was a grenade throne to the area outside the SBPAC office fence to draw people out,"" Colonel Pramote Prom-in, a military regional security spokesman told Reuters.
""Then a car bomb about 10 meters from the first explosion went off. This was hidden in a pick-up truck where the perpetrators parked near the fence. Eighteen are wounded and no one died,"" he said.
The car bomb exploded ten minutes after the first explosion and among the wounded were five reporters, five police officers, two soldiers and other bystanders, Pramote said.
There was no immediate claim of responsibility. Such claims are rare following attacks in the region.
The population of the provinces, which belonged to an independent Malay Muslim sultanate before Thailand annexed them in 1909, is 80 percent Muslim, while the rest of the country is overwhelmingly Buddhist. Conflict has flared on and off for decades as insurgent groups fought a guerrilla war to demand independence for the area.

A peace dialogue between the Thai government and the main insurgent group, the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) has resumed this year, after the group pull out of the process in 2014.

Gurbanoglu is the founder and chairman of the Istanbul-based Palmali group, which operates a fleet of freight vessels.
After he was detained at the weekend, a court ordered his formal arrest over ties to the network of U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen which President Tayyip Erdogan blames for the failed putsch in which about 250 people died, police and state-owned Anadolu news agency said.
Gurbanoglu's home and company were searched.
Nobody from Palmali was available to comment.
The Istanbul court ordered that he be kept in custody on a charge of belonging to a terrorist group, Anadolu said.
He was listed by Forbes as worth $1.3 billion in 2015, with interests in dairy products, media, resorts and planes, as well as having a fleet of oil tankers. Born in the Azeri capital Baku, he became a Turkish citizen in 2006, taking the name Gurbanoglu.
Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999, has denied any involvement in the attempted coup. He was once an ally of Erdogan but became his arch foe.
Gulen's supporters have for years been accused by Ankara of establishing a ""parallel state"" by infiltrating the police, judiciary and other state institutions.
About 80,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others sacked or suspended from their jobs since the coup attempt.
Prosecutors last month ordered the arrest of another nearly 700 people, including military and justice ministry personnel.

The Long March 7A, a variant of the Long March 7, blasted off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center, in the southern island province of Hainan, on Monday morning.
But it later suffered a malfunction, the cause of which was being investigated, Xinhua said.
With its specifications and capabilities, the rocket, known as the LM-7A, is well-placed to become China's main rocket for communication satellite missions, potentially replacing older rockets in the LM-2, LM-3 and LM-4 range.
The LM-7 family is also expected to be central to the construction of China's space station, due for completion in 2022.
It was not clear how the timetable for near-term orbital launches would be affected by the failed LM-7A mission.
The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation said in January that it aimed to carry out more than 40 launches in 2020, including space infrastructure missions.
President Xi Jinping has prioritized the space program to strengthen national security and defense. The government has stressed that it is a purely peaceful initiative.

Switzerland mobilized up to 8,000 members of the military on Monday and banned all public and private events after declaring the coronavirus outbreak an ""exceptional"" emergency that demanded more radical measures.
More than 2,330 people have tested positive for coronavirus so far in Switzerland, and at least 14 people have died.
Koch defended the government's policy to focus testing on people most at risk from the new virus and those who might need hospitalization.
Bottlenecks in processing test results were an issue, he said. Authorities were already running more than 2,000 tests a day.
""We will do more testing in Switzerland as soon as we can but the virus doesn't wait for it to be tested. Hospitals are seeing a leap in sick people and that is an alarm signal.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Tuesday it plans to tighten border checks for all arrivals from overseas to prevent new cases of coronavirus coming into the country at a time when domestically transmitted infections are subsiding.
The stricter checks for all arrivals will start on Thursday and come as China also stepped up monitoring of foreign travellers, in the latest sign of the pandemic's shifting centre of gravity from Asia to Europe.
""We've assessed that there's a need for universal special entry procedures for all arrivals, given rapid increases in new cases not only in Europe but also in the United States and Asia in the wake of the pandemic,"" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 84 new coronavirus cases as of Tuesday. It was the third day in a row that the county has reported fewer than 100 new infections, raising hopes that Asia's largest outbreak outside China may be easing. 
The new numbers are well below a Feb. 29 peak of 909, and bring the country's total infections to 8,320, the KCDC said. The death toll rose by two to 81.
There are 55 cases involving infected travellers, including eight foreign nationals, up from 44 recorded on Sunday. The other 47 are South Koreans, 27 of whom came from Europe, as well as 16 from China and another 12 from other Asian countries, KCDC deputy director Kwon Jun-wook said. 
Seoul has already imposed strict border checks on visitors from China, Italy and Iran, requiring them to sign up by a smartphone application to track whether they have any symptoms such as fever.
Asked whether the government was considering closing borders, Kwon said the current efforts make a ""very rational and reasonable policy for the time being."" 
""It is much more important to stick to our fundamental efforts to find, quarantine and treat patients and examining links of infections,"" he told reporters. 
SMALLER CLUSTERS
President Moon Jae-in has said he was increasingly confident South Korea would overcome the virus as the rate of new cases continued to drop.
Another 264 patients were released on Tuesday from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment, bringing the total to 1,401, the KCDC said. South Korea reported more recoveries than new infections on Friday for the first time since its outbreak emerged in January.
Testing and treatment of patients is nearing completion in the hardest-hit city of Daegu, home to a fringe Christian church that was at the centre of the outbreak in South Korea. 
But authorities renewed warnings against clusters that continue to emerge, especially in the greater Seoul area. 
The education ministry on Tuesday postponed the beginning of all schools' new semester by another two weeks to April 6, citing concerns about infections in smaller clusters. 
At least 134 cases have been linked to a Seoul-based call centre whose 800-strong workforce is being tested or in quarantine. 
In Seongnam, south of Seoul, 47 members of a Protestant church have tested positive, including the pastor, who attended services twice early this month despite government calls to cancel mass gatherings. 
The vice health minister said people at the church had even rinsed their mouths using the same salt water sprayer in an ill-advised effort to disinfect themselves. 
""That is an example of how misinformation could raise the risks of infection,"" he said. 

""Once again, we're requesting the citizens to refrain from attending gatherings in enclosed space as much as possible.""

Taiwan has repeatedly complained that China has stepped up its drills near to the island when it should be focusing its efforts on combating the spread of the virus.
China has said such exercises are to protect its sovereignty and send a warning that it will not tolerate moves toward formal independence for Taiwan.
In the latest instance, Taiwan's Defense Ministry said late on Monday that Chinese J-11 fighters and KJ-500 airborne early warning and control aircraft flew into the waters southwest of Taiwan for nighttime exercises.
During this period, they came close to Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone, the ministry added.
""After our air reconnaissance and patrol aircraft responded appropriately, and broadcast (an order) to drive them away, the Communist aircraft flew away from our Air Defense Identification Zone.""
Taiwan's military keeps close watch on the Taiwan Strait and its environs to ensure the island's security, and people have no cause for alarm, the ministry said.
There was no immediate comment from China's military on the latest drills.
China has been flying what it calls ""island encirclement"" drills on and off since 2016 when Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen first took office. Beijing believes Tsai, who won re-election in January, is an independence supporter.
Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.

PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday ordered stringent restrictions on people's movement to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and said the army would be drafted in to help move the sick to hospitals.
France had already shut down restaurants and bars, closed schools and put ski resorts off limits, but Macron said measures unprecedented in peacetime were needed as the number of infected people doubled every three days and deaths spiraled higher.
In a somber address to the nation, the president said that from Tuesday midday (1100 GMT) people should stay at home unless it was to buy groceries, travel to work, exercise or for medical care. 
Anyone flouting the restrictions, in place for at least the next two weeks, would be punished.
""I know what I am asking of you is unprecedented but circumstances demand it,"" Macron said.
""We're not up against another army or another nation. But the enemy is right there: invisible, elusive, but it is making progress.""
Some 100,000 police will be deployed to enforce the lockdown, Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. Checkpoints will be set up nationwide and those on the move will have to be able to justify their journey on a printed ministry document, pedestrians included, he said.
Macron said tougher action was needed after too many people ignored earlier warnings and mingled in parks and on street corners over the weekend, risking their own health and the wellbeing of others.
In France the coronavirus has killed 148 people and infected more than 6,600.
ARMY MOBILIZED
Under the new measures, soldiers would help transport the sick to hospitals with spare capacity and a military hospital with 30 intensive-care beds would be set up in the eastern region of Alsace, where one of the largest infection clusters has broken out. 
Macron said he was postponing the second round of local elections on Sunday. Because the government's sole focus needed to be fighting the pandemic, he said he was suspending his reform agenda, starting with his overhaul of the pension system.
The government would, when necessary, legislate by decree to fight the coronavirus, he said.
Coronavirus infections and fatalities in France and Spain have been surging at a pace just days behind that of Italy, the epicenter of the outbreak in Europe where hospitals in the worst-hit northern regions are stretched to breaking point.
Seeking to offer further reassurance to businesses, Macron said the government would guarantee 300 billion euros worth of loans. The loan guarantee plan would be submitted to parliament in coming weeks and would be retroactive, a finance ministry source said.
Rent and utility bills owed by small companies would also be suspended to help them weather the economic storm, he added. 

""No French company, whatever its size, will be exposed to the risk of collapse,"" Macron said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is unlikely to ease sanctions on Iran despite an appeal from China that it do so because of the coronavirus pandemic, sources familiar with the matter said, arguing that Tehran continues what Washington regards as its malign behavior.
The sources, who included a U.S. official, diplomats and analysts, noted Washington has made offers to help Tehran with the outbreak but these have been spurned by Tehran.
They also cited Wednesday's rocket attack on Iraq's Taji military camp north of Baghdad that killed one British and two American personnel and that the Pentagon blamed on the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah Shi'ite militia.
""The regime can't be trusted to channel whatever money it would gain from the easing of pressure toward humanitarian activity. The likelihood is the elites will steal it and/or funnel it toward malign activity,"" said a U.S. official on condition of anonymity.
Two diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said they thought it highly unlikely that the Trump administration would provide broad-based sanctions relief, with one saying the most it might do would to offer greater humanitarian relief.
""I don't believe the administration is in any way likely to significantly alter its approach towards Iran, including and especially the 'maximum pressure' economic strategy,"" added Suzanne Maloney of the Brookings Institution think tank.
Maloney said Washington faces the ""broader dilemma"" that Iran-backed Shi'ite militias have stepped up attacks on U.S. forces and would not want to look like it was buckling to pressure or to invite further such attacks.
The coronavirus has killed 853 people and infected 14,991 in Iran, making it the worst-hit country in the Middle East and prompting China to urge the United States to ease sanctions.
""Continued sanction on Iran was against humanitarianism and hampers Iran's epidemic response & delivery of humanitarian aid by the UN and other organizations,"" China's ministry of foreign affairs said on Twitter on Wednesday.
The U.S. State Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The United States reimposed sanctions on Iran's oil exports in 2018 after withdrawing from the 2015 nuclear deal that Tehran struck with six major powers to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from its economic isolation.
President Donald Trump restored sanctions to try to pressure Tehran to further constrain its nuclear program, limit its missile program and curb its use of proxy forces in Iraq, Yemen and Lebanon."

LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - The World Health Organization will start testing for coronavirus in rebel-held northwest Syria later this week, the agency's regional head said on Monday, adding that he was ""very concerned"" about the spread of the pandemic to a region where the health system has been wrecked by a long civil war.
Only about half of medical facilities in the wedge of rebel-held Syria are operational. Nearly a million people recently displaced by violence are living in make-shift housing or crowded camps.
""We are hoping ... to have the machinery and the tests sometime this week so we can start testing,"" said Dr. Rick Brennan, emergency director for the region, told Reuters. ""And we are very concerned. All of the surrounding countries have documented cases.""
Syria's government has started testing in areas in the rest of the country, although has not yet reported a case to the WHO. Turkey to the north confirmed its first case last week and Iraq has at least 93 confirmed cases.
Further east, Iran has the third highest case load after China and Italy, with nearly 13,000 confirmed cases, according to WHO data.
However, Brennan, who just returned from a mission to Iran last week, said that the number of cases reported could represent only about a fifth of the real numbers. The reason was that testing, as is the case even in some wealthy European countries, was restricted to severe cases.
""We've said the weakest link in their chain is the data,"" he said. ""They are rapidly increasing their ability to test and so the numbers will go up,"" he said.
Iran's response to the pandemic has drawn strong criticism, both from government critics, and a U.N. official last week.
However, Brennan was generally upbeat about Tehran's response. ""There's a great commitment and they are taking it seriously from the highest level of government.""
Iranian authorities say they have been especially hard hit by global supply shortages for tests and protective equipment, blaming the impact of U.S. sanctions.
Brennan described visiting new centers with dozens of beds where everything from the bed sheets, to the oxygen masks had been made locally.
However, he said that some of the locally-produced personal protective equipment was exposing medical workers to risks. He acknowledged that some health care workers had been infected, although the cause of infection was not clear.
""We are impressed that Iranians have acknowledged their weaknesses and are working on them,"" Brennan said."

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Mondays are usually slow on Rio de Janeiro's iconic Ipanema beach, but Ana Nunes, who rents parasols and chairs there, said business was down 80% due to the coronavirus outbreak that has prompted authorities to warn against gathering in crowded areas.
Nunes, who reluctantly said she was 52 but normally tells people she is ""immortal,"" said she had no option but to work.
""This is my only source of income,"" she said. ""Are we going to lose money? Sure. As long as there is no order against it, I will come to work. But I know I'm putting myself at risk.""
The coronavirus outbreak, which has spread fear across the world, pummeling markets and pushing governments into extreme measures to contain the spread and prop up economies, is also threatening the beloved Rio beach day.
Rio state Governor Wilson Witzel said on Monday he would announce a state of emergency, without giving details on when, and what that would entail. He has urged people to avoid large public gatherings and said he could close beaches.
On Monday, firemen were patrolling some Rio beaches, blaring guidance on loudspeakers for beachgoers to go home.
That struck fear in the hearts of some Rio beach workers.
Many are informal workers from poor communities, dependant on good weather and tourists' whims. A few years ago, Nunes said she could make 2,500 reais ($500) on a sunny Saturday. These days, she is lucky to make 800 reais in a day, and the outbreak could force her to close shop.
Working nearby, Paloma Nascimento, who won her stall license when she came out of prison in a program to reintegrate former inmates, said she pays Rio city hall 400 reais a year for the concession. She said she would follow any closure order, but it would devastate her business.
""I'm scared because I live off this,"" she said, adding that she employed three other people. ""If I don't work, I don't eat.""
Nunes said tempers were starting to flare amid a price war between beach stands. She was selling coconuts, which normally go for 8 reais, at 5 reais, while her neighbor was annoyed at having to rent a big parasol, usually priced at 30 reais, for 10 reais.
""Soon there will be fights,"" she said.
Her customer, 40-year-old hairdresser Tanny Nunes, was making the most of her day off, sunning herself during what she expected would be one of her final days in the sun for a while.
But she said she wasn't too concerned: ""There'll be sun next year, right?"""

UAE has recorded 98 cases of the virus."
763,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 04:44PM ET</span>",Egypt to halt flights from Thursday to stem spread of coronavirus,"By Nadine Awadalla
CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt will halt all air traffic at its airports from Thursday until March 31 to prevent the spread of coronavirus, Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly said on Monday.
Egypt will sanitize hotels and tourist sites during the closure, he said in a news conference, adding that tourists now in the country would be able to complete their vacations.
Madbouly said Egypt's strategic reserves of key commodities would last for months and there was no need for people to stock up.
He said local firms in the aviation sector would suffer losses of 2.25 billion Egyptian pounds ($143 million) due to the latest measures. The last plane allowed to depart would leave on Thursday, March 19, at noon.
Tourism is a key sector for the most populous Arab country. Tourism revenue rose to a record high of $12.57 billion in the financial year that ended in July.
Revenue continued to rise in the July-Sept quarter, the latest data published by the central bank, to $4.19 billion, the country's best quarter ever.
Egypt closed schools and universities for two weeks on Sunday to prevent the spread of coronavirus. The number of cases rose to 150, information minister Osama Haikal said on Monday, up from 126 reported by Sunday.
Three people in Egypt have died from the virus.
Analysts have hailed Egypt for reforms tied to a $12 billion loan program with the International Monetary Fund agreed in 2016, which included devaluing the currency by about half, cutting energy subsidies and introducing a value-added tax.
Analysts say the spread of the virus makes Egypt, with its large tourism industry, vulnerable. A global trade downturn could also hurt Suez canal revenues, which came to $5.7 billion in 2019.
Lower oil prices will likely be neutral, since Egypt's bill for hydrocarbon imports, at $15.5 billion, is virtually equal to what it earns from exports, mainly natural gas.
Worker remittances worth $25 billion annually could fall if Gulf countries, the biggest employer of expatriate Egyptians, scale back projects.
Several Gulf oil producers have halted or restricted international passenger flights to combat coronavirus."

LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday shut down social life in Britain and ordered the most vulnerable to isolate for 12 weeks, ramping up the battle against a coronavirus outbreak just as it accelerates towards it peak.
Johnson had faced a backlash after his government took a less stringent approach to tackling the virus than countries such as Italy, France and Spain which have effectively locked down much of Europe.
In a toughening of Britain's approach to the outbreak, Johnson closed down any remaining social life in the world's fifth largest economy and ordered those over 70 with underlying health problems to isolate for 12 weeks from this weekend. 
""What we are announcing today is a very substantial change in the way that we want people to live their lives and I can’t remember anything like it in my life time,"" Johnson, 55, said at a news conference in Number 10 Downing Street, flanked by the government's top scientist and top doctor. 
""I don't think there's really been anything like it in peacetime and we have to accept that it's a very considerable psychological, behavioral change that we're asking you, the public, the nation to do,"" he said.
People should avoid pubs, clubs, restaurants, cinemas and theaters, the government said, though Johnson stopped short of ordering them to close. He said he hoped the venues would take a responsible approach. People should also avoid unnecessary travel and work from home where possible, he said.
He said this was particularly important in London as it appears to be ""a few weeks ahead"" of the rest of the country.
The hospitality industry criticized the move, saying that since they were not being compelled to close, businesses would not be able to claim on their insurance. 
""This announcement will lead to thousands of businesses closing their doors for good, and hundreds of thousands of job losses,"" UKHospitality Chief Executive Kate Nicholls said.
The Society of London Theaters said its member venues, which include London's major West End theaters, would close from Monday night until further notice.
The limits on social contact could last for months or at least weeks, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said, adding that the next few weeks and months would be ""extraordinarily difficult"" for the health service. 
Health minister Matt Hancock told parliament that non-time sensitive, elective surgery would be canceled or postponed. 
Johnson said anyone with symptoms of the coronavirus should isolate along with their entire household for 14 days. 
Sterling fell to its lowest against the U.S. dollar since October while Johnson was speaking, down two thirds of a cent on the day. This economic and financial crisis, though, is not like the 2008 financial crisis, Johnson said.
""This is unlike 2008, there isn't a systemic problem within the economy,"" Johnson said. ""If we can get the disease under control... then there is absolutely no reason why economies worldwide should not come roaring back."" 
VIRUS SPREADS FASTER 
The British government has faced criticism for no longer testing all suspected cases of coronavirus, and Whitty said testing was critical and Britain would scale it up. Earlier on Monday the World Health Organization called on all countries to ramp up their testing program. 
The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the United Kingdom has risen to 1,543, up from 1,372 the day before, the health ministry said on Monday. The UK death toll rose to 55.
""It looks as though we are now approaching the fast growth part of the upward curve and without drastic action cases could double every 5 or 6 days,"" Johnson said.
He said it was essential to ensure ""those with the most serious health conditions are largely shielded from social contact for around 12 weeks.""
When asked about the need for a globally coordinated response, Johnson said there was widespread agreement in the G7 that measures would be needed.
""We are going to need to make sure everybody has access to liquidity,"" he said. ""If we do things jointly then I think that the global markets will understand that we're all operating in the same sort of fiscal framework and I think we'll be much more successful that way.""
Johnson faced a backlash on Monday over his decision to keep schools open, with angry parents keeping their children at home and complaining that other countries were doing more to stop the spread of coronavirus.
Britain may need to close schools to slow the spread of coronavirus but now is not the time for this, the government's chief scientific advisor, Patrick Vallance, said. 

""At some point, as we've said, it may be necessary to think about things like school closures. But those things, again, need to be done at the right time in the right way, at the right stage of the outbreak,"" he said.

765,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 04:34PM ET</span>","Special Report: 'All is well'. In Italy, triage and lies for virus patients","By Emilio Parodi, Silvia Aloisi and Pamela Barbaglia
MILAN (Reuters) - The fight against death pauses every day at 1 p.m.
At that time, doctors in the intensive care unit of Policlinico San Donato phone relatives of the unit's 25 critically-ill coronavirus patients, all of whom are sedated and have tubes down their throats to breathe, to update the families. Lunchtime used to be for visiting hours at this Milan hospital. But now, as the country grapples with a coronavirus outbreak that has killed more than 2,000 people, no visitors are allowed in. And no one in Italy leaves their homes anymore.
When the doctors make the calls, they try not to give false hope: They know that one out of two patients in intensive care with the disease caused by the virus is likely to die.
As the COVID-19 epidemic expands and the disease progresses, these beds are in increasing demand, especially because of the breathing problems the illness can bring. Every time a bed comes free, two anaesthesiologists consult with a specialist in resuscitation and an internal medicine physician to decide who will occupy it.
Age and pre-existing medical conditions are important factors. So is having a family.
""We have to take into account whether older patients have families who can take care of them once they leave the ICU, because they will need help,"" says Marco Resta, deputy head of Policlinico San Donato's Intensive Care Unit.
Even if there is no chance, he says, you have to ""look a patient in the face and say, 'All is well.' And this lie destroys you.""
The most devastating medical crisis in Italy since World War Two is forcing doctors, patients and their families to make decisions that Resta, a former military doctor, said he has not experienced even in war. As of Monday, 2,158 people had died and 27,980 been infected by coronavirus in Italy – the second highest number of reported cases and deaths in the world behind China.
Resta says that 50% of those with COVID-19 who are accepted into intensive care units in Italy are dying, compared with a usual mortality rate of 12% to 16% in such units nationwide.
Doctors have warned that northern Italy – where the universal healthcare system is ranked among the world's most efficient – is a forerunner of crises that the disease is bringing around the world. The outbreak, which hit the northern regions of Lombardy and Veneto first, has crippled the local network of hospitals, putting their intensive care units under colossal strain.
Over three weeks, 1,135 people have needed intensive care in Lombardy, but the region has only 800 intensive care beds, according to Giacomo Grasselli, head of the intensive care unit at Milan's Policlinico hospital, which is separate from San Donato. Grasselli coordinates all the state-run intensive care units across Lombardy.
Such dilemmas are not new in the medical profession. When treating patients with breathing difficulties, intensive care doctors always evaluate their chance of recovery before intubation - an invasive procedure that involves inserting a tube into the mouth and down the throat and airway.
But these high numbers mean doctors must choose more often, and more quickly, who deserves a greater chance of survival - a triage that is particularly wrenching in a Catholic country that does not allow assisted dying, and where the population is, according to statistics agency Eurostat, the oldest in Europe with nearly one person in four aged 65 or older.
""We are not used to such drastic decisions,"" says Resta, a 48-year-old anaesthesiologist.
TAKE A CHANCE
Italian doctors say that so many elderly COVID-19 patients are showing up with breathing problems, they can't take a chance on those who have a slim hope of recovery.
Alfredo Visioli was one such patient. When he was diagnosed, the 83-year old from Cremona was living a busy, active life, at home with a German shepherd, Holaf, that the family had given him. He cared for his 79-year-old wife, Ileana Scarpanti, who had suffered a stroke two years ago, said his granddaughter Marta Manfredi.
At first, he only had intermittent fever, but two weeks after he was diagnosed with COVID-19, he developed pulmonary fibrosis - a disease resulting from lung tissue becoming damaged and scarred, which makes it harder and harder to breathe.
Doctors in the hospital at Cremona, a town of about 73,000 in the Lombardy region, had to decide whether to intubate him to help him breathe.
""They said there was no point,"" said Manfredi. 
She would have liked to hold her grandfather's hand, she said, while he was in a morphine-induced sleep before he died.
Now Manfredi is worried about her grandmother. Ileana also caught COVID-19 and is now in the hospital, though she is responding well to a mouth respirator that is helping her breathe. No-one has told Ileana her husband is dead. 
Lombardy intensive care coordinator Grasselli said he believed that, so far, all patients with a reasonable chance of recovering and living an acceptable quality of life had been treated.
But he added that this approach is under strain. ""Previously, for some people we would have said, 'let's give them a chance for a few days.' Now we have to be more stringent.""
REORGANIZED HOSPITALS
This triage is happening outside of hospitals, too.
On Friday, the mayor of Fidenza, a city just outside the Lombardy region, shut access to the local hospital for 19 hours. It was overcrowded with COVID-19 patients and hospital staff had worked 21 days without a break. While the closure was aimed at keeping the hospital going, it meant some people ""died at home,"" said the mayor, Andrea Massari. 
The new coronavirus first appeared in Italy in January, but the outbreak took off in February in the small town of Codogno, around 60 km (40 miles) southeast of Milan. Some medical experts believe it may have been introduced by someone who traveled to Italy from Germany. 
Rome moved quickly to isolate the north of the country, at first locking down 10 towns in Lombardy and one in Veneto. But that didn't stop the virus. Within a week, 888 people had tested positive for the disease and 21 had died. Cases grew exponentially. Small towns were hit first, putting an immediate strain on small hospitals.
Since last week, Italy has entered complete self-isolation. It has closed all schools, offices and services and ordered everyone without a compelling and authorized reason to stay home. The measures, which are being followed by other European countries, are aimed at stopping the spread of the virus.
Italy's authorities are particularly anxious to slow its onset in southern Italy, which has a far less well-funded system than the north.
Private hospitals are usually reserved for paying patients. But the government has ordered them to offer free medical care to COVID-19 sufferers. Policlinico San Donato, which is privately held but licensed to work with public sector clients, dispatched teams of anaesthesiologists and other specialists to the worst-affected towns. Fourth and fifth-year medical students were called into hospitals to help. Cardiologists were enlisted to help in emergency rooms and COVID-19 wards.
Now, nearly all operating rooms in the Lombardy region have been converted into intensive care units, said Grasselli, the intensive-care coordinator. Hospital staff work overtime. Some are substituting for infected colleagues. Patients are being transferred across regions.
According to Grasselli, the ratio of nurses to patients in the region's intensive care units is normally one to two. Now, it's one nurse for every four or five patients. ""We have totally reorganized our hospital system,"" he says.
""GREATER LIFE EXPECTANCY""
All infected people who arrive at a hospital struggling to breathe receive oxygen, Grasselli says. The issue is to what extent - and for how long - to keep them artificially respirated.
Those with lighter breathing problems are connected to an external machine with a mask or, if the patient doesn't respond, a face-covering helmet. If their condition deteriorates, doctors must decide whether to admit them to intensive care, where they would be intubated.
But there's a problem: Intubating can be taxing on the body, especially for older patients, says Grasselli. Even if elderly people survive, many can develop other problems, like trouble walking or cognitive difficulties. Even so in the past, doctors tended to try intubating even older patients, generally because they had the resources to do so, he said - adding that he would never intubate his 84-year old father.
Before the coronavirus broke, ""we more often had the luxury to try to intubate patients who were at the limit,"" said Mario Riccio, head of anaesthesiology at the Oglio Po hospital near Cremona.
Now that's changed. Italy's Association of Anaesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care published new guidelines on March 7. Because it expects a ""huge imbalance"" between the clinical needs of the population and intensive care resources over the next few weeks, it told those on the front lines: Give priority to those with ""greater life expectancy.""
""LET ME DIE AT HOME""
Italy's mass quarantining of its population adds emotional stresses to the suffering. Family members are not allowed to travel in ambulances with relatives, and coronavirus units are closed off to anyone who is not a doctor or a patient.
Some patients who are not at the point of needing intensive care feel imprisoned in overrun wards.
""Take me away from here. Let me die at home. I want to see you one more time,"" Stefano Bollani, a 55-year-old warehouse worker texted his homemaker wife, Tiziana Salvi, from the pre-intensive care unit of Policlinico San Donato, where he is being treated for pneumonia after contracting the virus.
The couple have not seen each other since she dropped him off in their car outside the Milan hospital nearly two weeks ago. All she knows, she says, is that his condition seems to have improved in recent days. ""These are things a husband shouldn't (have to) write to a wife who is outside, who can't see him,"" she adds.
And some older patients have resisted going to hospital. Carlo Bertolini, a 76-year-old agronomist in Cremona who had made a name for himself locally with a detailed history of the town's past vineyards and taverns, was initially very reluctant to seek help, his daughter said. 
Bertolini, who lived alone, started feeling sick at the beginning of March. Eventually, his best friend called an ambulance which took him to the town hospital. When he spoke to his daughter on the phone from the hospital, he described the huge numbers of patients and the cacophony of the ward. ""I feel like I'm in a war,"" he said, according to his daughter, Mara Bertolini.
Carlo was then transferred to the intensive care unit of a bigger hospital in Milan. Mara and her sister were able to visit dressed in hazmat gear – masks, gloves, white coat – to look at him through the window of the intensive care unit. ""They told us he was the one with the most serious condition in the ICU,"" she said.
""STAY HOME""
The former military doctor Resta says the situation in Lombardy feels worse than the 1999 war in Kosovo, where he served in the air rescue team flying patients from Albania to Italy. 
Whenever a patient with coronavirus is accepted into his hospital, he says, the staff write an email to their relatives assuring them that their loved ones will be treated ""like family."" He says the hospital is trying to activate a system of video-conferencing, so that patients can see their relatives during the 1 p.m. call. 
A doctor, not a relative, is often inevitably the last person a dying COVID-19 patient will see. Loved ones can't even approach coffins for fear of catching the virus. 
The last Mara Bertolini heard of her father Carlo, the wine historian, was when someone from the morgue called another family member to say they had his body.
She holds no grudge against the hard-worked doctors, she said. 
What struck her most about her father's last week of anguish was the look on the doctor's face when she met him.
""I couldn't tell whether it was worry or sadness,"" she said.

""All he said to us was, 'Stay home.'""

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic, who is also the head of the ruling Serbian Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (SNS), on Sunday declared the state of emergency in a bid to halt the spread of the virus.
The Balkan country closed kindergartens, schools and universities until the end of the semester, deployed military to guard hospitals and police to monitor hundreds of people in isolation.
It also ordered elderly over the age of 65, most vulnerable to coronavirus infection, to stay indoors. Serbia has already closed borders to foreign nationals.
Health authorities have so far reported 57 cases of infection and tested 316 people. There have been no fatalities so far.
The vote is seen as important for Vucic and the SNS to cement its grip on power. Most opposition parties have decided to boycott the elections, accusing Vucic and his allies of autocracy, stifling media freedom, attacks on opposition activists, corruption and ties to organized crime.

LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Cuban asylum seeker with breast cancer who has been detained since November is among dozens of people seeking to be released by U.S. immigration authorities amid fears that the coronavirus could spread quickly in densely populated detention facilities.
In her four months in immigration detention, the 39-year-old woman has contracted flu and numerous infections and was recently transferred to a detention facility in rural Louisiana, her attorney wrote in a request to federal immigration authorities for what is known as humanitarian parole.
Attorneys are scrambling to file petitions like hers around the country asking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) officials and courts to grant discretionary release and reconsideration of bond denials based on an elevated risk to the detained immigrants of contracting COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The immigrants are seeking to be released in the United States while they pursue asylum and other claims to avoid being returned to their home countries.
""The effect of her exposure to this virus could be deadly given what little information we have about how to treat and control this outbreak,"" Linda Corchado, the Cuban asylum seeker's lawyer, wrote in her parole request.
Corchado noted that her client had entered the country legally at a port of entry seeking safe haven in the United States and has family in Florida.
The global spread of the virus has shown that people who are elderly or have serious underlying health conditions are particularly vulnerable to serious illness or death from COVID-19.
Las Americas, Corchado's organization based in El Paso, Texas, is working with other non-profit groups to file some 60 parole requests, Corchado said, including for a pregnant woman, a man in his late 30s with diabetes and a 55-year-old woman with unspecified underlying health issues.
Other organizations and individual lawyers around the country told Reuters they are pursuing similar bids to free detained immigrants. For example, an attorney at the Brooklyn Defenders legal aid group in New York said it was filing dozens of petitions for release based on the risk of coronavirus.
The American Civil Liberties Union sued ICE in federal court on Monday in Washington state seeking the release of nine medically vulnerable detainees in Tacoma, an area hard hit by the outbreak.
HARDLINE POLICIES
U.S. President Donald Trump's hardline policies toward immigration have been a hallmark of his presidency and his bid for re-election this year. His administration has sought to detain more people in the country illegally.
ICE said on Monday no COVID-19 cases have been detected among the 38,500 people in immigration detention in more than 200 facilities around the United States. An ICE spokeswoman said the agency is working with state and local partners to determine if further testing or monitoring is needed. As of March 3, only four immigrants in ICE custody had met the criteria for testing for the virus, according to the agency, which did not provide updated details on Monday.
Immigrant advocates and public health experts have expressed concern about the potential for the virus spread among incarcerated populations. ICE said on Monday a staff member at one of the facilities where immigrants are being held, the Elizabeth Detention Center in New Jersey, was being tested for the virus and was under self-quarantine.
Current and former U.S. immigration officials and healthcare workers who were involved in an effort to contain a mumps outbreak in ICE detention centers last year said they are concerned about the agency's ability to handle potential coronavirus outbreaks.
More than 2,000 immigration detainees were quarantined after mumps and other infectious diseases spread to nearly 900 people in 57 detention centers in 19 states between September 2018 and August 2019. A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study found that 84% of those people were infected within government facilities.
The adequacy of medical quarantine in these facilities came under scrutiny even before the emergence of the coronavirus. Reuters reported this month that federal inspectors found quarantine measures at a detention center in rural New Mexico that experienced a mumps outbreak were inadequate, among other deficiencies in healthcare there."

BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union is considering the drastic step of suspending nearly all incoming travel to the 27-member bloc to combat not only the coronavirus but also the ""every country for itself"" ethos spreading rapidly through member states.
The EU's 27 leaders will hold a teleconference on Tuesday to discuss the proposal, which would cover 30 European countries -- all EU member states except Ireland, plus the four non-EU countries that are part of the Schengen border-free zone.
But at least eight EU states have already taken matters into their own hands, unilaterally shutting out foreign nationals or partially closing their borders to one or more neighboring country. They include the EU's biggest state, founder-member Germany.
Those decisions have left Schengen, a pillar of European free movement for 35 years, in tatters, for now at least.
French President Emmanuel Macron, a passionate integrationist, on Monday condemned the closures after a phone briefing with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and other EU officials.
But Merkel, who might have been expected to side with him, insisted later in the day that Germany's closures were necessary, albeit temporary.
Even Commission President Ursula von der Leyen's proposal was not entirely convincing.
""The less travel, the more we can contain the virus,"" she said - leaving open the question of how that would be achieved by insulating the bloc against infections from outside while freeing travel between the 30 affected countries inside.
WHAT PRICE SOLIDARITY?
At least part of her concern focuses on one of the bloc's reasons for existence - solidarity between members.
On Sunday, as the line of trucks queuing to enter Poland from Germany grew longer and longer, she said border closures hurt the flow of goods and piled extra pressure on the countries suffering most from the disease.
""We need to keep goods flowing across Europe without obstacles,"" she said. ""Thousands of bus and truck drivers are stranded at internal borders on parking lots, creating more health risks and disrupting our supply chains.""
In Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic, where right-wing or populist governments are trying to reassure citizens that they are protected, the call for solidarity fell on deaf ears.
""President von der Leyen is concerned about the internal market - at a time when protecting the health of all of us is an absolute priority for me,"" said Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said migration from outside the bloc, long his bete noire, was fuelling the disease.
""Hungary has managed to defend against migration, so we are protected against the infections migrants may bring with them,"" he said.
But such objections are not confined to nationalist governments. Austria, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia were the other four countries to inform the Commission about suspensions of the Schengen agreement, while Slovenia and Slovakia had also implemented border closures but not yet informed the Commission.
""THANKS FOR NOTHING""
As part of her effort to promote solidarity, von der Leyen wants member states to end national bans on the export of medical equipment within the bloc.
In Italy, the hardest-hit EU member, desperately short of intensive care facilities and equipment, resentment has been growing that there has not been more EU support.
Italian far-right leader Matteo Salvini said on Friday that the EU's performance so far was ""yet another demonstration that if this is the Europe we have to leave to our children, then it might be worth doing something different"".
But even so, von der Leyen's plan risks aggrieving others.
In return for freeing medical equipment exports within the bloc, she would stop the export of those same goods outside the EU.
That would mean Britain and other non-EU countries will not be able to import masks, gloves, protective clothing or ventilators from the EU without the approval of member states.
But Serbia, a longstanding candidate to join the bloc, was also furious. President Aleksandar Vucic said the EU's approach meant he had no option but to turn, as Italy has, to China for help in combating the coronavirus.
""By now you have all understood that great international solidarity actually does not exist. European solidarity does not exist,"" Vucic said on Sunday.
""I believe in my brother, my friend, Xi Jinping, and I believe in help from China. The only country that can help us now is China. For the rest of them, thanks for nothing."""

ROME (Reuters) - Italy approved 25 billion euros ($28 billion) of spending measures on Monday to help the fragile economy survive the onslaught of coronavirus as the death toll in Europe's worst-affected country jumped above 2,000.
The decree throws a financial lifeline to families and firms who face hardship after the government last week ordered a draconian lockdown on the entire country to stem the contagion.
""This is a weighty economic package. We never thought we could face this flood with mops and buckets,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte told a news conference.
Underscoring the challenge confronting Italy, the Civil Protection agency said the death toll had jumped 349 in the last 24 hours to 2,158, a rise of 19%.
However, offering a ray of possible hope, the number of new cases increased just 13% to 27,980 - the slowest rate of growth since the contagion first came to light on Feb. 21.
""Let's hope it is the start of a trend reversal. I am saying it in a whisper, this could be the start of a trend reversal,"" said Attilio Fontana, the governor of the wealthy northern Lombardy region which has been by the hardest hit in Italy.
Local authorities in one of the worst-affected cities, Bergamo, were struggling to deal with the surging number of fatalities. Hearses entered the local cemetery through the day, while the local crematorium was operating around the clock.
The hospital and cemetery morgues were full, meaning coffins were now being laid out in a city church. 
""In the All Saints Church there aren't any more pews, just coffins,"" Giacomo Angeloni, in charge of Bergamo's graveyards, told Reuters. ""The situation is dramatic ... (but) we are trying to maintain decorum.""
SICILY ISOLATED
In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, the government has closed restaurants, sporting events and most shops across the country and told Italians to stay at home.
Looking to prevent people from heading to the island of Sicily, which accounts for less than 1% of the total number of national virus cases, the local government severed almost all travel links with the mainland.
""We cannot joke around with the coronavirus,"" said regional chief Nello Musumeci.
Analysts say the crisis will plunge Italy into its fourth recession in just 12 years and batter company balance sheets. The Milan bourse lost a further 6% on Monday, meaning it has now fallen 40% in barely three weeks.
The government said it would freeze any attempts by companies to sack staff from Feb. 23 and it increased funds to help firms pay workers temporarily idled due to the lockdown.
Monday's decree also suspended loan and mortgage repayments and offered state guarantees for banks. It extended parental leave and offered funds to families to pay for babysitters, with schools closed until April 3.
The government also prepared to re-nationalize the perennially troubled airline Alitalia, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters.

""We can speak about an Italian model not only due to our strategy to curb contagion, but we can also start to talk about it regarding our political and economic strategy to tackle this great political and social emergency,"" the prime minister said.

LIMA/ASUNCION/SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Peru's government deployed masked military personnel to block major roads in Lima on Monday, while police restricted the movement of people, as the country rolled out a state of enforced ""social isolation"" to slow the spread of coronavirus.
In nearby Paraguay, which has eight cases of the respiratory disease so far, the government said it would enforce a quasi curfew from 8 p.m. daily to restrict crowds, with police empowered to make arrests and prosecute those who did not comply.
The crisis has prompted the region, on the latter end of the global curve to be affected by the highly contagious virus, to lock down borders and shutter schools.
""It is not a curfew, but it is the closest thing,"" Paraguay Interior Minister Euclides Acevedo said at a news conference. ""What does that mean? That the right of movement is going to be restricted with the aim of being drastic regarding quarantine.""
Certain people, including those doing vital work, delivering food or transportation could continue to move around, he added.
Countries around South America, including Argentina and Chile, are closing their borders to non-residents amid fears the virus could take hold in the region in the same way it has in parts of Asia and Europe.
Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said on Monday his country, which has 155 confirmed coronavirus cases, would close its borders to foreigners starting on Wednesday.
In Lima, troops wearing helmets and carrying weapons, stationed themselves on the Paseo de la República avenue, a key artery into the city center, to stop vehicles, with police officers only allowing emergency and medical vehicles through.
Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra on Sunday night announced a 15-day state of emergency amid the total closure of the country's border. Peru has 86 confirmed cases.
The copper producer has suspended constitutional rights such as free movement and assembly, though the government has assured it will guarantee the operation of supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, basic services and the transport of merchandise.
""We have to halt things to avoid the exponential curve of the coronavirus,"" Peruvian Defense Minister Walter Martos told local TV station América Televisión.
Leaders of countries around the region, including from Argentina, Chile, Peru, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Brazil, held a conference call on Monday to analyze the situation and coordinate actions against the virus."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe proposed shutting its external borders to foreigners for 30 days on Monday in a bid to turn the page on its scramble to contain the coronavirus, but it drew criticism for doing too little, too late.
With the official death toll in Italy now above 1,800 and the number of cases growing rapidly around the continent, the crisis has exposed divisions in the 27-member European Union.
Some countries have introduced border controls inside what is normally Europe's Schengen zone of open borders, while others have refused to share medical data or equipment.
Calls for unity from Brussels have so far seemed to fall on deaf ears. Images from crossings in Europe show vehicles in long lines waiting to cross what would normally be invisible borders.
""The less travel, the more we can contain the virus. Therefore ... I propose to the heads of state and government to introduce temporary restriction on non-essential travel to the EU,"" said the head of the EU's executive, Ursula von der Leyen.
""These travel restrictions should be in place for an initial period of 30 days, but can be prolonged as necessary.""
Leaders of EU member states will discuss the proposals during a videoconference on Tuesday. Diplomatic sources said the they were championed by French President Emmanuel Macron, who has pushed for co-ordinated European action.
""WINDOW-DRESSING""
The plan would cover 30 countries: all EU member states excluding Ireland, as well as Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and Lichtenstein, which are part of the Schengen zone even though they are not part of the European Union.
Britain, which left the EU in January, and Ireland would have to decide independently whether to fall in line by sealing their borders. But their nationals would retain the right to travel to Europe in the meantime, according to EU officials.
From Portugal in the west to Hungary in the east, European countries have unilaterally tightened frontier controls, triggering a warning earlier on Monday from Brussels that chaotic measures risk hurting food and medicine supplies, and aggravating the crisis.
The proposals on shutting Europe's external borders to foreigners, which include a raft of exemptions, were viewed by some as an effort by Brussels to appear in control.
""We do know the threat is already inside, the threat is not coming from the outside anymore. So it's more about political messaging,"" an EU official said, requesting anonymity.
Charles Grant, director of the Centre for European Reform think-tank, agreed. He described the proposals as ""window-dressing ... to cover up the embarrassment of member-states closing their borders to each other.""
""I don't see the potential benefits,"" he said."

(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court will postpone its next round of oral arguments that had been scheduled to start later this month, including a high-profile dispute over President Donald Trump's tax and financial records, in a bid to combat the spread of the coronavirus, a spokeswoman said on Monday. 
The decision to indefinitely delay arguments that had been due to run from March 23 to April 1 marked an increase in the court's response to the coronavirus threat after closing its building in Washington to the public last Thursday.
Eleven arguments spanning 14 cases were postponed, including Trump's appeals, due to have been heard on March 31, in three separate cases to prevent his financial records from being handed over to Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives committees and a New York prosecutor.
Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said in a statement the court heeded public health precautions recommended in response to the virus, the latest in many changes that have affected numerous aspects of American life. Arberg said the court ""will examine the options for rescheduling those cases in due course in light of the developing circumstances.""
The court made no announcement about the status of arguments scheduled in the rest of the cases due to be heard in their current term, which traditionally would run through the end of June.
The coronavirus has proven to be particularly dangerous in elderly people, especially those with underlying medical issues. Three of the nine justices are over age 70: Ruth Bader Ginsburg (87), Stephen Breyer (81) and Clarence Thomas (71). Ginsburg has experienced a series of recent health issues including treatment in the past two years for pancreatic and lung cancer.
""Ultimately it may have been out of the concern for the justices' own health, particularly given that the virus is so dangerous to the elderly,"" said Tom Goldstein, an attorney who frequently appears before the justices.
Goldstein represents Google (O:GOOGL) in a postponed case that had been scheduled for arguments on March 24 involving a dispute with  Oracle Corp  (N:ORCL) over software copyrights.
The justices will still hold their regular private conference on Friday to discuss various pending appeals, although some justices may participate remotely by telephone, and will announce on Monday as planned the cases it has decided to review or turn away, Arberg said. 
The court could reschedule delayed arguments for April or later, and possibly push its calendar into the summer, Goldstein said. The court's next term is due to begin in October. 
Another postponed case involved a Trump administration bid to shield FBI agents from a lawsuit by three American Muslim men who said they were placed on the government's ""no-fly list"" for refusing to become informants. Another is a religious rights case involving Catholic school teachers in California.
Postponement of Supreme Court arguments in such circumstances is rare. Some arguments were postponed in 1918 due to the Spanish flu epidemic and argument calendars were shortened in 1793 and 1798 in response to yellow fever outbreaks, Arberg said.
Trump lost in the lower courts in the three financial records cases. Two involve Trump's efforts to stave off congressional subpoenas issued to third parties - his accounting firm Mazars LLP and two banks,  Deutsche Bank  AG (DE:DBKGn) and  Capital One  Financial Corp (N:COF) - demanding his bank records, tax returns and other material.

The other case involves a criminal investigation into Trump and his family real estate business in which Manhattan's district attorney is seeking the president's tax returns.

777,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 01:51PM ET</span>",Inside one family's coronavirus nightmare at Seattle-area nursing home,"By Tim Reid and Joshua Schneyer
(Reuters) - Lori Spencer had an uneasy feeling after dropping her 81-year-old mother off at the Life Care Center nursing home in Kirkland, Washington on Feb. 26. She felt even worse the next day, when her mother, Judie Shape, threw an uncharacteristic tantrum - begging to leave the facility.
What the family didn’t know at the time: The home was already dealing with the initial signs of what would soon become the deadliest coronavirus outbreak in the United States. A week before, on Feb. 19, the facility had sent out a patient with respiratory problems for testing, followed by a second patient on Feb. 24. Life Care officials have said they initially suspected flu.
Three days after Shape arrived at the home, Life Care announced that one of the tests had come back positive for coronavirus.
“By then it was too late,” Spencer said. “We couldn’t move her. She was suddenly a prisoner there.”
Shape wouldn’t be tested for 11 more days, as Spencer and her family waited in anguish. Amid a severe shortage of tests nationally - and at Life Care - the home initially tested only those showing symptoms.

The Kirkland home's deadly outbreak illustrates how fast coronavirus can spread through an elderly care facility. Facilities nationwide have struggled with overwhelmed staff and a national scarcity of testing kits, thrusting families into heart-wrenching dilemmas over how to protect elderly loved ones in need of full-time care or rehabilitation.
King County, Washington officials reported on Sunday that 29 deaths from coronavirus had been linked to the home. The home, as of Friday, confirmed 13 deaths from coronavirus and said it was awaiting test results on 11 more people who died.
Nations around the world are grappling with how to protect older people from the virus. In South Korea, there were two deaths and dozens of people infected at a nursing home in a province with a major outbreak. Nursing homes have also been a major source of concern in Europe, the new epicenter of the global crisis as the number of new cases declines in China, where the elderly are more commonly cared for at home.
In northern Italy, the virus has cut a swathe through the older population, including in some care homes but also in densely populated apartment buildings where many elderly people live. In the United Kingdom, some care homes have begun to bar visitors as the government says it may soon order the elderly to stay indoors. In Spain, where the virus is taking off sharply, the first cluster of infections were focused on Madrid nursing homes.
In the United States, infection control failures have long been a serious problem across the nursing home industry, which houses about 1.7 million senior citizens. Federal health data shows patients in nursing homes experience between 1.6 and 3.8 million serious infections every year, resulting in up to 380,000 deaths.
On Friday, a Trump administration official called on nursing homes nationally to restrict all visitors, with the exception of some “end of life” situations. President Donald Trump vowed to ramp up the distribution of test kits - for the first time acknowledging the severe shortage.
Richard Mollott, executive director of The Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York, said the coronavirus epidemic has made nursing home residents “sitting ducks.”
“They can be very dangerous places to live,” he said. “The industry already has a poor track record of keeping people safe.”
Life Care Center in Kirkland was cited for a violation of infection control regulations after a federal inspection in April 2019. Such violations are common in the industry, said Charlene Harrington, an expert in elderly care at the University of California, San Francisco. The disease-control failures stem in part from chronic short-staffing at most facilities, Harrington said, noting that cutting back on staff is one way the industry has boosted profits.
“National enforcement of nursing home standards has been pathetic,” said Harrington, who has testified in Congress on elder care and written extensively on the regulation of nursing homes.
The American Health Care Association, an eldercare industry group, called such criticism unhelpful in a pandemic. The organization acknowledged challenges in infection-control at nursing homes, in part because of government underfunding and nationwide shortages of caregivers.
""There is always more we can do to improve infection control,"" an issue in all health-care settings, said the organization's Chief Medical Officer, David Gifford, in a statement. ""This pandemic is demonstrating that as a nation we all have to improve how we work to prevent infections, including in nursing homes.""
Cleveland, Tennessee-based Life Care Centers of America Inc, which operates the Kirkland home, is among the largest players in U.S. nursing home care, with more than 200 senior-living centers in 28 states. The company said last week that it would take stringent infection-control measures at all its facilities to guard against coronavirus.
Leigh Atherton, a company spokeswoman, declined to answer detailed questions from Reuters about the company’s response to the Kirkland outbreak. In earlier press briefings, another spokesperson, Tim Killian, described an overwhelmed staff acting heroically in the face of a ferocious outbreak. By March 7, more than one third of the 180 staffers were out of action with suspected coronavirus symptoms.
“This is an acute care facility that is accustomed to treating patients with infectious diseases,” Killian said that day. “But really we are dealing with an unprecedented level of outbreak here, with a virus we know little about.”
The staff response was initially “limited,” by a lack of test kits, he said, even as the center saw patients with no symptoms start to display acute symptoms within an hour, requiring hospitalization.
“We’ve had patients die relatively quickly under those circumstances,” Killian said.
As of Sunday, the World Health Organization reported that most than 150,000 cases of coronavirus had been confirmed worldwide, with more than 5,700 deaths. The United States had reported more than 3,800 cases and 69 deaths as of Monday.
WAITING ON TESTING
Spencer knew little of the disease threat at nursing homes when she arrived at Life Care with her mother. But the day her mother begged to leave - two days before the home confirmed the outbreak - Spencer drove to the facility with the intention of removing her. A nurse calmed them down, assuring them that a broken bedside buzzer to summon staff had been repaired. When no one responded to the buzzer for two hours on the mother's first night there, she had eventually been forced to bang on her tray table to get the attention of a staffer to help her to the bathroom.
Spencer broke into tears when the nurse said he was worried about her, too, and asked how long both women had been dealing with hospital stress before arriving at Life Care.
Spencer had another quandary: Her mother had just had blood clot surgery and was suffering from a severe stomach infection. She could not walk, and couldn’t return to her full-time retirement community nearby until she was mobile. She came to Life Care for rehabilitation.
“But I will live forever with that tantrum,” Spencer said, “because I meant to take her home that day.”
Confusion reigned at the facility after it first told families on Feb. 29 about the outbreak, Spencer said. Officials said the facility was in “lockdown” - no visitors allowed. In what has become a heartbreaking daily ritual for many families with relatives at the center, Spencer would stand outside the window of her mother’s room, able to see her but not touch her, trying her best to provide comfort over the phone.
Life Care never prohibited residents from leaving the home, Killian said in a March 12 briefing. But it became impossible for many families to move a relative. Hospitals would only accept those with acute symptoms, while other facilities would not accept patients from a facility with an outbreak. Many of Life Care’s residents were too sick to be cared for at home.
“There’s nowhere else for these patients to go,” Killian said.
Spencer couldn’t take her mother back to the retirement home where she had lived before her surgery. “They needed a test showing she didn’t have the virus - but there was no testing,” Spencer said. “It was massively confusing, and poorly managed.”
Shape was finally tested for coronavirus on March 8. The first batch of test kits – 45 in total, still not enough – had arrived at the facility three days earlier.
On March 10, before getting the test results, Shape woke up feeling ill, like the beginnings of a severe head cold. She had a runny nose and chills.
Later that day, Spencer called the nurses station for a full medical report. She asked about the coronavirus test - and found out the results had already come in, but no one had called her.
Shape’s test had come back positive: She had contracted Covid-19.
WHEN DID THEY KNOW?
Spencer’s guilt and fear about her mother’s condition is mixed with suspicion that Life Care knew a powerful virus was sweeping through the facility when she placed her mother there on Feb. 26 - but failed to warn her.
Life Care Center officials said they had no inkling of a coronavirus outbreak until they were informed just after midnight on Feb. 29 of the first positive coronavirus test.
“We had no medical reason to suspect COVID-19 at the time,” Life Care’s Killian said in a press briefing. “Earlier in February we started to have respiratory illness symptoms showing up in our facility. That’s common for our facility ... We see between three and seven deaths in a normal month.”
Hours after the first test confirmed coronavirus, nearly all the families of about 120 residents inside had been informed of the positive result. Since Feb. 19, Life Care has said, 66 residents have been transferred to hospitals.
By March 13, according to Life Care, 44 residents still lived there. Twenty-six have coronavirus, including Judie Shape, with tests on another nine either pending or incomplete.
Spencer continues to talk to her mother several times a day by phone, usually looking at her through the window of her room. Shape isn’t sleeping much. She tries to remain upbeat. Her coronavirus symptoms so far have been less severe than many others of her age and medical condition, giving her and her family hope.
The mother struggled with isolation and loneliness before her hospital and nursing home stays. She has grown more fearful - and angry - watching the TV news on coronavirus while cooped up in her room.
“My mom is isolated, at the end of her life,” Spencer said. “She doesn’t deserve this.”"

PARIS (Reuters) - France has battened down the hatches against coronavirus, with millions of school children studying from home, office workers connecting remotely, and restaurants and cinemas shut.
But for some, adhering to the restrictions is already proving difficult.
In the Montmartre district of Paris, Le Cafe Tabac no longer offers coffee to seated patrons or those at the bar, instead selling only takeaway brews. The result: its clientele have simply moved to the pavement.
""Just getting a take-away, they gather outside, chat, smoke a cigarette, drink their coffee. So they're not respecting the rules,"" said Frederic Monnier, the cafe's owner.
""I'd thought they'd buy their coffee and leave. But no, they linger and talk!""
France's government on Saturday announced the closure of all cinemas, theaters, cafes, bars and restaurants, toughened curbs on public gatherings and urged people to stay at home.
But the first signs of warm spring sunshine on Sunday encouraged many to wander outside. Families strolled in the capital's parks, and friends and couples walked arm-in-arm along the Mediterranean seafront in Marseille.
Jerome Salomon, head of the public health authority, told France Inter on Monday that many people did not seem to be taking advice on social distancing seriously. Paris City Hall said it was closing its parks as a result.
""There's no reason to panic but yeah we have to respect the restrictions,"" physiotherapist Tristan de Parcevaux said, insisting he was not breaking any government orders as he drank coffee outside Le Cafe Tabac's doorway.
Sources told Reuters on Sunday that the government was preparing an order that would put its inhabitants under lockdown. President Emmanuel Macron is due to address the nation at 1900 GMT.
Paris is due to hold the second round of a mayoral election next weekend but it is unclear whether it will go ahead. Macron's candidate, Agnes Buzyn, said she was suspending her campaign a day after polling third in the first round.
A few streets from Monnier's cafe, book store owner Marie-Rose Guarnieri was quietly allowing in customers who looked through her shop window. But it was inevitable, she said, that she would soon have to pull down the shutters.
""We would have liked it if the government had considered book shops to be essential, just as it did pharmacies and newsagents,"" Guarnieri said. ""At least then people could have read in confinement."""
779,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 16, 2020 12:43PM ET</span>","Spain's King Felipe renounces inheritance from his father, Juan Carlos","MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's King Felipe has renounced his inheritance from his father, former King Juan Carlos, and stripped the ex-monarch of his palace allowance.
Felipe's latest move to distance himself from his father follows a recent report in Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve newspaper that Juan Carlos, who was king at the time, allegedly received $100 million from Saudi Arabia's late king.
He later gave $65 million to Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a businesswoman whose close relationship with Juan Carlos led to his abdication in 2014, the report added.
According to a statement to EFE news agency from zu Sayn-Wittgenstein's lawyer Robin Rathmell, it was ""an unsolicited gift"" from Juan Carlos for her and her son.
Britain's Telegraph newspaper subsequently reported at the weekend that Felipe, 52, was named as a beneficiary of the Lucum Foundation fund on his father's death, as well as that of another fund called Zagatka.
In a statement, Felipe said he had been made aware of the Lucum fund last year and had told his father he did not want to be a beneficiary. He said he was not aware of the Zagatka fund.
The statement, released on Sunday, said former King Juan Carlos knew of his son's decision to renounce his inheritance.
""H.M. King Don Juan Carlos ceases to receive the allocation set for him in the budget of the House of H.M. the King,"" the statement added.
It included a brief comment from Juan Carlos, saying he had not told his son about the funds.
According to the statement, Juan Carlos' lawyer would make any comment on the matter from now on. The lawyer declined to comment, a source close to him said on Monday.
Spain's parliament last week rejected for a second time demands by some political parties to open an investigation into the business activities of the former king."

MUNICH/BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany plans to close shops, limit restaurants' opening hours and ban church services in further efforts to slow the spread of the coronavirus threatening Europe's biggest economy, its largest selling newspaper Bild reported on Monday.
If confirmed, the moves would bring Germany a step nearer to a state of total lockdown like that in force in Italy and Spain, where most people are confined to their homes, and wreak further economic disruption.
The epidemic has already snuffed out hope of a first-quarter upswing on which people had been counting to avert recession, and will weigh on Germany's economy until at least the third quarter, the Economy Ministry said.
The usually well-informed Bild said the government had recommended regions shut non-essential shops, ban church services and allow restaurants to open only between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. Germany's 16 federal states must decide which of the measures to apply and how, Bild said.
There was no immediate government confirmation of the report. Chancellor Angela Merkel was due to hold a news conference at 6 p.m. (1700 GMT).
With schools already shut, almost 5,000 people known to be infected and 12 dead in official figures published at the weekend, and case numbers rising rapidly, many fear Germany is heading for the kind of disruption to everyday life that other countries, especially Italy, have experienced in recent weeks.
The Economy Ministry warned that even in a best-case scenario where the severed supply chains that link Germany's export-dependent economy to the world are quickly repaired, stabilisation would come in the third quarter at the earliest.
But with disruption being felt across the economy, particularly in the transport sector, it is far from clear whether that will transpire, even with the help of huge aid programmes unveiled by federal and state governments.
Flagship carrier Lufthansa said it would scrap 90% of all long-haul flights and run only a fifth of flights originally planned within Europe. Holiday operator TUI, the world's biggest, said it would scrap most operations and apply for state aid in response to collapsing demand.
The government has advised citizens against all non-essential trips abroad. Lufthansa said it was planning to run further flights to repatriate thousands of Germans still stranded abroad.
Baden-Wuerttemberg, the southwestern state that is home to carmaker Daimler and also facing a major outbreak, announced it was stopping air travel, closing Stuttgart and Karlsruhe airports in a bid to contain the virus.
Germany temporarily reintroduced border controls at the weekend with Austria, Switzerland, France, Luxembourg and Denmark. Borders are normally open in the European Union's Schengen passport-free travel zone.
The federal government has also loosened insolvency rules that risked forcing companies into declaring bankruptcy while they waited for state aid to arrive.
Bavaria, the wealthy southern state where some of Germany's biggest companies, including carmaker BMW and engineering giant Siemens, are based, launched a 10-billion-euro ($11.13 billion) fund to let the regional government buy stakes in struggling companies.
""The situation is very serious and changing daily, unfortunately not for the better,"" said Bavarian premier Markus Soeder, whose state is among the worst hit by the epidemic. ""We will not abandon anyone."""

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - In Sudan's capital Khartoum, a hip-hop producer who had his equipment seized during anti-government protests last year is now free to mix tracks in his studio. 
Across town, an all-female troupe in pink T-shirts and white jeans practice rhythmic dance routines late in the evening in a dimly-lit car park. 
The overthrow of Omar al-Bashir's Islamist regime last April and the melting away of its morality police have led to an easing of onerous social constraints, allowing women to dress more freely and opening up more space for cultural activities. 
The opening started with an artistic and musical outburst around the protests that helped topple Bashir, though as Sudan transitions toward democracy, many see the social changes as shallow. Restrictive laws remain on the statute books and women are still under-represented after an uprising they helped lead.
""We understand that change won't happen tomorrow because of the revolution,"" said Somia Abd Elhay, a 23-year-old student practicing the flute at Khartoum's music college. 
""It will take time, but what's new after the revolution is that there is hope and that things can change, and it is in our hands to change the things we see as wrong."" 
Bashir's three decades in power were marked by stringent social and religious rules along with international isolation and economic sanctions. Women's public behavior was strictly regimented – wearing trousers was punishable by flogging. 
Bashir's fall, after months of street protests in which women played a prominent role and dozens were killed in security crackdowns, brought a change of direction. In November, authorities repealed a notorious public order law used to impose conservative Islamic social codes.
""Before the revolution our shows were inside specific, appropriate places,"" said Anita Saimon, a young dancer with the Voice of Nuba troupe, after an impromptu roadside rehearsal under a giant billboard for a recently opened Kentucky Fried Chicken branch.
""Now that there's freedom we're practicing in parking lots, we've started to work normally without any restrictions."" 
FREEDOM 
Mohamed Abdulaziz, a music producer who had his sound systems confiscated and was repeatedly questioned by police during anti-Bashir demonstrations, said the uprising had resulted in a flourishing of music such as hip-hop and rap that were previously considered subversive.
""All the musical themes and products were dealing with the revolution, change, freedom, and our rights and duties toward the country,"" he said. 
DJs play at public parties in Khartoum where men and women can mix freely. A book fair without political censorship and even a women's soccer league have been staged in recent months. Many women say the uprising has allowed them to wear what they want.
""In the past, girls used to suffer humiliation and violence because of their clothing, but now because of those who died and the revolution, we have the right to choose our clothes,"" said Jihad al-Taher, a rights activist in her 30s.
Bashir's deep-rooted Isla mist network is on the back foot, but some moves, including calls by a southern rebel group for a secular state, have created a backlash on social media. A well-known ultra-conservative preacher, Abdulhay Yousif, denounced the female sports and youth minister, Walaa Elboushi, for organizing the women's soccer league. 
Activists say progress is uncertain under a power-sharing deal between the military and civilian groups due to last until late 2022. 
They complain that legislation underlying the public order law has yet to be repealed, and that women are not protected from sexual harassment or rape.
Too few women get political jobs, said Nahid Gabralla, director of Seema, a children's and women's rights group. Just two of the 11 members of the ruling sovereign council are women.
""What has been accomplished does not match the role or scope of women's involvement in making revolution and change, and that's evident to us from the weak presence of women in governing bodies,"" she said.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Constitutional Court on Monday ruled it was legal to change the country's constitution in a way that could allow President Vladimir Putin to remain in power until 2036, less than a week after Putin publicly backed the idea. 
The court ruling came hours after thousands of Russians signed a petition urging judges to protect them from what they said was an illegal coup that would allow Putin, who has dominated the Russian political landscape for the last two decades, to subvert the constitution. 
Putin, 67, unveiled an overhaul of the constitution in January which the Kremlin cast as a redistribution of power from the presidency to parliament. 
He made a dramatic appearance in parliament on Tuesday to endorse a new amendment that would allow him to ignore a constitutional ban requiring him to stand down in 2024.
The move, which must still be put to a nationwide vote due next month, raises the prospect of Putin serving another two six-year terms after 2024, though the Kremlin points out that Putin has not yet said whether he will run again. 
The Constitutional Court's blessing was delivered in a 52-page ruling posted on its website on Monday.
'ANTI-CONSTITUTIONAL COUP'
The Kremlin said in a statement on Saturday that Putin had signed off on the constitutional changes after both houses of parliament and regional parliaments backed them with lightning speed last week. 
Earlier on Monday, more than 18,000 Russians signed a petition denouncing the reform as ""politically and ethically unacceptable"". 
""We believe the threat of a deep constitutional crisis and an unlawful anti-constitutional coup ... is hanging over our country,"" the petition, signed by prominent scientists, journalists and writers said. 
The petition does not have any legal force, but its blunt language shows how strongly some Russians oppose the idea of Putin having the option to run again in 2024.
Putin remains popular with other Russians however who see him as a welcome source of stability after what some recall as the anarchic 1990s following the fall of the Soviet Union.

The Kremlin told reporters it was aware of the petition, but that it had also received numerous messages of support for the change and that it was up to Russians at a nationwide vote to decide whether to back it or not.

MADRID (Reuters) - The streets of Spanish cities were eerily quiet on Monday, with the silence interrupted by police loudspeakers telling people to go home, as Spaniards spent their first working day under a lockdown due to the coronavirus epidemic.
Spain's 47 million people have been under partial lockdown since Saturday night, allowed to leave their homes only to go to work, buy food or visit a pharmacy or hospital.
More than 1,000 troops have been deployed in 14 cities across the country to help police the lockdown, telling people to go home unless they have a good reason to be outside. Army specialists sprayed disinfectant in train stations.
""If Spaniards take the measures seriously, we will start seeing results in around three or four days,"" health emergency coordinator Fernando Simon told a briefing, announcing that the official coronavirus death toll rose to 297 on Monday, with 8,744 confirmed cases of infection.
Spain has the fourth-highest number of coronavirus cases in the world behind China, Italy and Iran. 
The government was also mulling whether to close borders to stem the contagion in Spain. Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska told Cadena Ser radio that closing Spain's borders was now ""a real option to fight against the spread of the virus"".
Police requisitioned at least 150,000 stockpiled protective masks in the southern town of Jaen for the health services in Madrid, which is the worst-hit region in Spain and where regional government leader Isabel Diaz Ayuso joined the swelling ranks of those infected by the virus on Monday.
Catalan regional leader Quim Torra also said he tested positive for coronavirus. 
EMERGENCY
Transport Minister Jose Luis Abalos told RNE radio the emergency situation would ""obviously"" have to be extended beyond the initially decreed 15 days.
While France, also hit by the coronavirus, went ahead with municipal elections on Sunday, the main political parties in Spain's Basque Country - the region with the second-highest number of cases - agreed on Monday to postpone regional elections scheduled for April 5.
Madrid's usually bustling Puerta del Sol square with the bronze figure of the city's symbol - a bear eating fruit from a madrono tree - was deserted except for an army patrol vehicle. Shops and restaurants were shut.
Police fined 199 people and arrested one person for breaking the quarantine, Madrid Mayor Jose Luis Martinez Almeida told state television TVE.
All services operated normally at Madrid's main Barajas airport, but there were very few travelers and various shops were closed. Only a few passengers rode the Madrid metro, and most wore masks. 
The cabinet will meet on Tuesday to discuss how to tackle the economic fallout from the pandemic and the widespread closing down of shops, after failing to agree on a packet of measures over the weekend.
A government source said the package of liquidity measures would include support for small and medium sized companies and loosen rules on temporary layoffs.
Schools across the country are closed, keeping millions of children, and their parents, at home. Various large car plants have closed and the government said private healthcare facilities will be transferred to the national health system. 
Major festivals, such as Sevilla's famed Holy Week processions in April, have been canceled.

Spaniards have nonetheless shown solidarity in confronting the epidemic. In Madrid and other cities, people have come out on their balconies in the evening to applaud health workers or to sing traditional songs.

Matovic, 46, whose opposition OLANO party won a Feb. 29 election, has put together a coalition with three other parties that will command a majority in the Slovak parliament.
OLANO's main election pledge was to reduce graft and sever ties between the outgoing government and business, but Matovic said the coronavirus epidemic demanded a smooth handover and cooperation with the outgoing administration.
""Slovakia is at a turning point. Now our only interest is to cope with the coronavirus crisis,"" Matovic told reporters after meeting the president.
He said the new government would not make immediate personnel changes at ministries.
The administration will comprise the politically diverse OLANO and three smaller parties - Sme Rodina (We are Family), a socially conservative and eurosceptic party; SaS (Freedom and Solidarity), an economically liberal party; and Za Ludi (For the People), a mildly conservative party led by former president Andrej Kiska.
The new government will take over from the center-left Smer party which has ruled for 12 of the past 14 years.
Matovic said on Friday that OLANO would hold the euro zone country's finance ministry while SAS leader Richard Sulik would become economy minister.
OLANO is a politically amorphous, pro-EU and pro-NATO movement that drew attention to what it called the ""mafia"" connections of the outgoing government. It surged in polls just before the election to win a quarter of the vote.
Fighting the coronavirus, Slovakia has banned international passenger travel, closed schools and most shops. It has reported 63 cases of the coronavirus and no deaths."

The fire burned through two containers used as living quarters by people in the Moria camp, as well as some tents, a spokesman said.
""During the operation a dead little girl was found,"" the fire brigade spokesman told Reuters. The child was aged between six and seven.
The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. Moria, built to accommodate less than 3,000 people, has about 19,400 people in the camp and its environs living in crowded and filthy conditions.
Lesbos was on the front line of a massive movement of refugees and migrants to Europe in 2015 and 2016.
There was an upsurge in arrivals after Turkey announced on Feb. 28 it could no longer contain the large numbers of migrants it hosts because of an anticipated surge of displaced persons from Syria.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada imposed tougher screening requirements for visitors on Monday in a bid to contain the spread of the coronavirus, hours before Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was due to unveil further measures.
As of 9 a.m. ET (1300 GMT), health officials were reporting around 320 cases of COVID-19 across all 10 provinces. One person has died so far.
Ontario, the most populous province, accounts for nearly half of the confirmed illnesses.
The Canada Border Services Agency said all travelers arriving from any international destination would now need confirm they knew they were being asked to self-isolate for 14 days following their trip.
Some visitors who flew into Canada over the weekend told reporters they had not undergone any screening.
Trudeau will speak with his counterparts in the Group of Seven leading industrialized nations. Officials say he will announce additional measures when he speaks to reporters at 1 p.m. ET (1700 GMT).
Transport Minister Marc Garneau said last Friday that Canada would reroute international arrivals to a handful of airports. The French-language La Presse newspaper cited sources as saying only Toronto, Calgary, Montreal and Vancouver would be able to process flights from abroad.
Trudeau on Sunday would not rule out closing borders to combat the coronavirus, while the chief medical officer said time was running out to prevent a spike in cases.
He also said his Liberal government would soon announce a major stimulus package to help those hit by the outbreak.

Pompeo spoke to Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi on Sunday, a day after three American troops and several Iraqi forces were wounded in the second major rocket attack in the past week on an Iraqi base north of Baghdad, U.S. and Iraqi officials said, raising the stakes in an escalating cycle of attacks and reprisals. 
He said Iraq's government should defend the U.S.-led coalition helping it fight Islamic State, according to the statement from State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus.
""Secretary Pompeo underscored that the groups responsible for these attacks must be held accountable. Secretary Pompeo noted that America will not tolerate attacks and threats to American lives and will take additional action as necessary in self-defense,"" it said.
Iraq's Joint Operations Command said 33 Katyusha rockets were launched near a section of the Taji base which houses U.S.-led coalition troops. It said the military found seven rocket launchers and 24 unused rockets in the nearby Abu Izam area.
The Iraqi military said several Iraqi air defense servicemen were critically wounded. Two of the three wounded U.S. troops are seriously injured and are being treated at a military hospital in Baghdad, the Pentagon said.
Longstanding antagonism between the United States and Iran has mostly played out on Iraqi soil in recent months.
Iranian-backed paramilitary groups have regularly rocketed and shelled bases in Iraq which host U.S. forces and the area around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

The United States has in turn conducted several strikes inside Iraq, killing top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and Kataib Hezbollah founder Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in January.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Online travel startups based in Germany are hunkering down to survive a coronavirus pandemic that threatens to inflict a ""nuclear winter"" on the travel industry as bookings plunge and borders close.
Berlin-based GetYourGuide and ticket booking website Omio said they planned to spend the expected quiet period working on tech systems to ensure they were more competitive when travel resumes in earnest.
""In the next couple of weeks I think we'll all just go into hibernation mode. We'll work on our tech, our infrastructure and our supply offering, and make sure we have everything in place for when travel picks up again,"" said Johannes Reck, co-founder and CEO of GetYourGuide (GYG).
The company, which specializes in experiences such as museum visits and walking tours, said bookings worldwide halved two weeks ago from forecast levels after a record start to the year.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) have become more hesitant and are seeking alternatives closer to home - preferring outdoor excursions to avoid crowds or indoor settings that would increase their risk of infection, Reck said.
Omio, which offers bus, rail and flight bookings, has seen a decline in bookings of 30%-50% and is bracing for falls of more than 50% if borders close.
Unlike airlines, for example, which must keep their planes in the air to keep going, these digital businesses have a far smaller fixed-cost base as most operate as middlemen between travelers and transport providers.
Omio spokesman Boris Radke said it had the flexibility to slash spending on marketing and devote the quiet period to improving its search engine optimization, the technology that steers customers to its app.
""The entire European Union might shut its borders for two weeks. We should be able to live with that,"" he said.
Tracking the exponential spread of the virus across Europe, governments have imposed restrictions on people's movements - including lockdowns in Italy and Spain - with a spate of border closures announced over the weekend.
Munich-based bus and train app Flixmobility suspended its services throughout Italy and halted cross-border connections to and from Italy on March 11.
Border closures in Europe mean Flixbus services to and from the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, Denmark, Poland, Bosnia Herzegovina, Serbia, Spain and Portugal and Germany will be affected in the weeks ahead, it said on its website https://global.flixbus.com/coronavirus-information.
""We're continually adapting our offer to the decreased demand,"" the company said, adding it was working with operators of its green Flixbuses that are a frequent sight on European highways to counteract the economic fallout.
GetYourGuide's Reck said the travel industry was facing a nuclear winter: ""Just survival over the next 12-24 months, by any travel company, will be a massive competitive advantage."""

Jews pray en masse at the Western Wall and often stuff written prayers into the cracks between its stones. Kissing the wall is not a ritual requirement, but some devout Jews do so, believing it shows reverence to God.
The Western Wall, the holiest place where Jews are allowed to pray in Jerusalem, is revered as a remnant of the compound of the Second Temple, built by Herod the Great more than 2,000 years ago and destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Last week, Israel's Chief Rabbinate urged Jewish worshippers to stay away from the Western Wall due to coronavirus fears, but some Jews have continued to visit the site to pray.
""Do not kiss the Western Wall stones,"" the site's rabbi, Shmuel Rabinowitz, instructed Jews in a statement on Monday.
Worshippers should maintain ""proper distance"" between one another and ""abide by required hygiene practices,"" he said.
The Western Wall abuts the sacred compound known to Jews as Har ha-Bayit, or Temple Mount, and to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif, or The Noble Sanctuary.
Muslim authorities on Sunday ordered the compound's Al-Aqsa Mosque and Dome of the Rock shut until further notice and asked worshippers to pray instead in its outdoor spaces.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Monday the authorities were not now considering imposing a lockdown to tackle the coronavirus outbreak, as the leader, his wife and a number of ministers awaited the results of tests for the virus.
The world's fourth most populous country has reported a spike in cases with the number of confirmed infections hitting 134, while five people have died.
Jakarta and several other provinces and cities have already announced school closures starting this week, and civil servants and some companies are asking staff to work from home.
Widodo told a televised briefing at the presidential palace in Bogor that ""up to now we are not considering anything in the direction of lockdown"".
He said measures to tackle the virus would be calibrated to ensure they did not ""exacerbate the economic impact that can harden the people's lives"".
At a separate press conference in the capital Jakarta, three patients who had recovered from the coronavirus were presented to reporters as evidence that the disease passes. Health Minister Terawan Agus Putranto gave them a tumbler of a herbal drink which he said had been concocted by the president to help them stay healthy.
The rupiah currency dropped 1% on Monday, while the stock index plunged more than 4%, extending falls amid capital outflows on concerns over the impact of the outbreak.
Some neighboring countries have been taking far more aggressive steps, including the Philippines, which has put half the population on lockdown. 
On Saturday, Indonesian Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi was confirmed to be suffering from COVID-19 after attending a cabinet meeting last week led by Widodo.
Widodo and his wife, as well as some ministers, have been tested for the virus as a precaution. 
Several ministers have said they had tested negative but, when questioned about his result, the president told reporters to ask his doctor.
Asked how mainly Muslim Indonesia would manage during the holy month of Ramadan starting in late April if the outbreak peaked then, Widodo said the state procurement agency had been told to ensure stocks of basic needs and private hospitals could also assist state hospitals.
Indonesia confirmed 17 new coronavirus cases on Monday, health ministry official Achmad Yurianto said, with 14 in the capital Jakarta, where most have been clustered. 
Indonesia's central bank said in a statement that banknotes and coins would be disinfected before redistribution as a precaution against the risk of spreading COVID-19. 

Indonesia confirmed its first cases of the virus on March 2, while some countries in the region had reported scores of cases far earlier, raising concerns among medical experts about infections either not being reported or going undetected.

China tightened checks on international travelers arriving at Beijing airport on Sunday, after the number of imported new coronavirus infections surpassed locally transmitted cases for a second day in a row.
Anyone arriving to Beijing from abroad will be transferred directly to a central quarantine facility for 14 days for observation starting March 16, a city government official said.
China, where the epidemic began in December, appears to now face a greater threat of new infections from outside its borders as it continues to slow the spread of the virus domestically.
China has reported 80,984 cases and 3,203 deaths. The country imposed draconian containment policies from January, locking down several major cities.

OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg told the country's children on Monday it was OK to feel scared during the ""special days"" of the coronavirus outbreak.
The Nordic country has invoked emergency powers to close a wide range of public and private institutions, including schools and kindergartens, in a bid to combat the spread of coronavirus.
""It has been special days ... Many children think it is scary,"" Solberg said during a news conference at her office dedicated to answer children's questions about the pandemic. ""It is OK to be scared when so many things happen at the same time.""
""Even if your school has been contaminated, it will go well with nearly everyone. The same with Mummy and Daddy, if they are infected,"" she added, flanked by her ministers for education and for family and children.
The trio then answered questions posted via children's TV program NRK Super and children's paper Aftenposten Junior, such as ""Can I have a birthday party?"", ""Can I visit my grandparents after I went to a shopping center?"", ""How long does it take to make a vaccine?"" or ""What can I do to help?""
""By being home you are helping other people not be contaminated and get sick. It is important for those who already have a disease or who are very old,"" Solberg said.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean student who became a lightning rod for broad social unrest after police shot him in the face during a demonstration has said President Sebastian Pinera will never regain the trust of citizens and should step down. 
Gustavo Gatica, 22, a psychology student at a Santiago university, said Pinera, a conservative billionaire two years into a second term in office, squandered an early window to engage with demonstrators' complaints of social inequality and elitism when unrest began in October.
Instead, Gatica told Reuters in his first interview since he lost his sight in November, Pinera had said Chile was ""at war"" with those perpetrating violence and failed to rein in rights abuses by police.
""This unrest could have broken out at any moment because politicians had no idea what people were feeling, they lived in a bubble,"" he said. 
""The difference is that Pinera declared war, brought soldiers out, there were deaths, shootings. That's why people remain in the streets, why there is so much violence, because he remains in office.
""His resignation would dial down the tension.""
The protests resulted in at least 31 people killed, 3,000 injured, and 30,000 detained. Prosecutors are probing allegations of abuse made by over 5,000 people against the security forces.
Chile's human rights watchdog says 445 people suffered eye injuries, primarily due to police tear gas canisters and rubber bullets. Gatica became one of two people blinded in both eyes after he was shot with rubber bullets on Nov. 8. 
The end of the southern hemisphere summer vacation and the second anniversary of Pinera's return to office last week has seen protests surge again. 
In response to the protests, Pinera has announced measures to improve pensions, lift the minimum wage, cut hospital waiting lists, and address white collar crime and the price of medicines, as well as agreeing to demands for a referendum on a new constitution. 
In a local television interview on Thursday, he renewed his backing for Chile's police, saying there had been some ""excessive use of force"" but they had found themselves ""overwhelmed"" by ""unprecedented and organized"" violence. 
Elected in 2017 with 54% of the second round vote against a leftist candidate, center-right Pinera insisted he would see out his last two years in office, saying: ""I was voluntarily chosen by a large majority of Chileans.""
On Wednesday, Gatica was mobbed by well-wishers after he returned to Plaza Italia, the hub of protests in the capital, to join a demonstration. 
The same day, police chief General Mario Rozas said the officer responsible for shooting remains on active duty while prosecutors investigate the case. In reference to the case, he told a congressional human rights committee that ""all actions were conducted within the law and the rules."" 
Gatica said that was proof of a culture of impunity.

""While there is no justice people will continue to go to the streets,"" he said. ""Justice would be those responsible paying the price in all these cases, not just mine, including going to jail.""

Bernard Preynat was found guilty of abusing dozens of boy scouts in the 1980s and early 1990s. Prosecutors had portrayed the 74-year-old as a serial pedophile and said he preyed on children entrusted to his care by their parents.
Preynat told the court he had not understood how grave his acts were nor how traumatic the consequences would be for his victims.

In a sharp blow to Netanyahu, who had declared victory in a March 2 election, 61 of parliament's 120 legislators voiced support for Gantz, leader of the centrist Blue and White party, in consultations with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin on Sunday.
At a televised ceremony, Rivlin gave Gantz 28 days, with the option of a two-week extension, to assemble a ruling coalition.
But Gantz's backers include opposing forces - the Joint List of Arab parties, and the far-right Yisrael Beiteinu faction led by former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman - that complicate efforts to form a viable government without wider support.
Netanyahu and Lieberman have proposed a six-month ""national emergency government"" grouping Blue and White and the prime minister's right-wing Likud party, to confront the coronavirus crisis.
""I give you my word, I will do all in my ability to establish within a few days as broad and patriotic a government as possible,"" Gantz said at the nomination ceremony, without going into details.
Israel has held three inconclusive elections in less than a year, and Netanyahu faces a criminal indictment on corruption charges, which he denies. 
Gantz, who in failed coalition negotiations with Netanyahu after a national ballot in September insisted on serving first as prime minister in a ""rotating"" leadership arrangement, called on his rival to agree to a unity deal now.

""The time has come for an end to empty words,"" Gantz said at the ceremony. ""It's time to set aside our swords and unite our tribes and defeat hatred.""

ISLAMABAD/KABUL (Reuters) - Health authorities across South Asia reported rising tallies of coronavirus cases on Monday, raising the prospect of rapidly spreading outbreaks overwhelming poor medical facilities in a region that is home to a quarter of the world's people.
South Asia has been relatively lightly hit by the virus compared with neighbors to the east, like China and South Korea, and to the west like Iran and parts of Europe.
But measures that have reined in epidemics in China, where the coronavirus emerged late last year, and South Korea are unlikely to work in poor, crowded parts of South Asia, health officials say.
""As compared to developed countries like the United States and China it will be difficult to (enforce) social distancing, especially in slum areas,"" said Giridhara R Babu, an epidemiologist at the Indian Institute of Public Health in the city of Bengaluru. 
""The living environment itself is crowded and may not be practical to ask them to maintain minimum distance from each other.""
Pakistan recorded a sharp rise in coronavirus cases on Monday, up 40 to 94, according to a Reuters tally of statistics from central and provincial governments.
The majority of new cases were in the southern province of Sindh in patients who had recently traveled from Iran - which has one of the world's worst outbreaks.
Afghanistan saw its tally rise to 21 with the majority of cases in the western province of Herat, which borders Iran and where thousands of Afghans cross back into their home country every day, some after being deported and others to escape a worsening Iranian economy.
Afghanistan's health infrastructure has been devastated by decades of war and a lack of funds and it would be hard pressed to mount any sort of concerted action against a coronavirus epidemic.
Matin Noorzai, a wholesaler in the one of the main markets in the Afghan capital of Kabul, said he had seen unprecedented demand and soaring food prices in recent days as worried shoppers stocked up.
""If the situation continues like this, I am sure in the coming week there will be no food left in the market,"" he said.
Sri Lanka, meanwhile, reported an almost-doubling of cases to 18 from 10. India's tally rose to 110, while the total number of cases in the Maldives and Bangladesh rose to 13 and 5, respectively.
On Sunday, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for regional action to tackle the virus, and he offered $10 million from India to get a regional emergency fund going.
Speaking to fellow South Asian leaders via video conference, Modi said India would also offer rapid response teams and other expertise to deal with the crisis. 

Around the world, the coronavirus has infected nearly 170,000 people, killing more than 6,500 of them, according to a Reuters tally of official data.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - A ""yellow economy"" of businesses has sprung up in Hong Kong to support anti-government protesters, but online store Jimmy Jungle is zeroing in on young demonstrators stuck in detention.
Michael, 27, set up the business along with three friends, to ease pressure on detainees' relatives and friends in finding them items of daily use, such as toiletries, packaged to comply with curbs set by authorities worried about security.
""It's a matter of conscience ... they sacrificed a lot for Hong Kong,"" said Michael, who did not want to use his full name for fear of losing suppliers angered at his support for protesters. ""We can't forget them.""
The company was set up after the arrest of a friend during a siege at Hong Kong's Polytechnic University in November, who has been in detention since.
""It has become like a full-time job for my friend's family to find the snacks and daily necessities,"" Michael added.
Rights groups say about 90 people are in custody in the Chinese-ruled territory, from among more than 7,500 arrested since anti-government protests escalated last June.
Hong Kong's Correctional Services Department (CSD), which furnishes detainees with items such as toothpaste, toothbrushes and toilet paper, said it did not have a figure for those detained over the protests.
Friends and relatives of detainees criticize as too strict the limits fixed on items carried in during visits.
""I understand why they need to standardize the approved items but some are hard to find in the market and not every family can afford to buy from the convenience store nearby,"" said Kay, 31, who has a detained relative.
Guidelines specify sizes and brands of toiletries, and, even in some instances, permit only wrappers with Chinese lettering.
But few items in shops meet all the specifications on soap, for example, and some sizes of toothpaste are only available as giveaways with much larger purchases.
The CSD told Reuters it reviewed the guidelines regularly and adjusted them as needed, adding that it had recently widened the choices of handwash and disinfecting wet tissues.
Jimmy Jungle's founders at first used their own money for purchases sold at cost to inmates' families and friends. But now it can provide items free, thanks to donations of nearly HK$280,000 within a single week after its February launch.
Nearly 30 detainees have received packages since. They are usually delivered to the offices of district councillors located near detention centers, making it easy for visitors to take them in to detainees.
Michael hopes for eventual amnesty for the demonstrators.
""I hope the protesters won't need our service one day,"" he said. ""My friend always told us not to feel desperate, as those in custody depend on us to ignite their hopes."""

APIA, Samoa (Reuters) - Just a few months ago, the Pacific island nation of Samoa was in the grip of a deadly measles epidemic.
Now, medical staff are being redeployed, and facilities refitted, to combat the threat of coronavirus on an already stressed population.
While the isolated nation, located more than 1000 kilometers (621 miles) north-east of Fiji, has not recorded any COVID-19 cases, some of its residents are worried it is ill-equipped to combat the epidemic.
""When it comes, we don't have the resources to prevent and cure, that's why it's a big concern to me,"" musician Sio Silva told Reuters in the Samoan capital of Apia on Monday.
""We don't know if it's inside our island already but don't have the resources to test it.""
The Pacific region has recorded six cases of COVID-19 - three in French Polynesia and three in Guam - although most island nations cannot screen for the virus onshore which is potentially masking its spread.
The Samoan government said in its most recent health update on March 14 that there were no suspected or confirmed cases of coronavirus.
Pacific countries have been tightening their border controls to prevent the coronavirus from gaining a foothold in isolated islands with limited health resources.
All incoming air travel to the United States-backed Marshall Islands have been banned.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) going to Samoa, a twin-island nation of approximately 200,000 people, must obtain a medical clearance report before boarding their flight, and passengers are screened on arrival.
White medical tents located near the main airport that were recently used to isolate measles patients will now be used to quarantine suspected coronavirus sufferers, the government said.
Last year's measles outbreak killed 83 Samoans, mainly young children, in a health emergency that was only brought under control less than three months ago after a mass vaccination drive.

RATCHABURI, Thailand (Reuters) - Thai villagers scouring a dark cave for bat guano, sought after by farmers as a nutrient-rich crop fertilizer, are undaunted by scientists' suggestion that it could be behind a coronavirus that has infected more than 150,000 people worldwide.
The source of the virus remains a matter of debate after it emerged in China late last year, but some scientists believe it could have originated in bats before passing to humans, perhaps being transferred through another animal.
But that link is not a concern for Jaew Yaemjam, a collector of bat droppings in Thailand's western province of Ratchaburi, even though the southeast Asian nation has recorded 114 virus infections and one death.
""No, I'm not worried because the virus didn't originate from here,"" said Jaew, 65, who is one of several villagers making the nightly trek into a smelly cave near a Buddhist temple, Wat Khao Chong Phran, to fill their sacks with the droppings.
They start work after dark, when millions of chittering bats stream out of the cave to hunt for food. Some of those who have been collecting for decades, earning less than $1 for each bucketload, say they have never had any health issues.
""Bat guano could be carrying various diseases,"" said Pikul Temket, a provincial health official. ""However, we've been clearing it out every week, so our cave is considered to be quite clean.""
Guano collection began generations ago, when the abbot then in charge of the temple asked villagers to help clean the cave. 
At $6 a bucket, the guano, rich in chemicals such as nitrogen, phosphate and potassium, brings in the bulk of the temple's earnings from farmers keen to boost crops and improve the taste of fruit.
In the past, it also went into gunpowder and explosives.

""I've been collecting bat guano for 40 years already, and never got sick,"" Jaew said. ""I just use a piece of cloth to cover my face, nothing much, really.""

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - For years, Hindus and Muslims lived and worked peacefully together in Yamuna Vihar, a densely populated Delhi district.
But the riots that raged through the district last month appear to have cleaved lasting divisions in the community, reflecting a nationwide trend as tensions over the Hindu nationalist agenda of Prime Minister Narendra Modi boil over.
Many Hindus in Yamuna Vihar, a sprawl of residential blocks and shops dotted with mosques and Hindu temples, and in other riot-hit districts of northeast Delhi, say they are boycotting merchants and refusing to hire workers from the Muslim community. Muslims say they are scrambling to find jobs at a time when the coronavirus pandemic has heightened pressure on India's economy.
""I have decided to never work with Muslims,"" said Yash Dhingra, who has a shop selling paint and bathroom fittings in Yamuna Vihar. ""I have identified new workers, they are Hindus,"" he said, standing in a narrow lane that was the scene of violent clashes in the riots that erupted on Feb. 23. 
The trigger for the riots, the worst sectarian violence in the Indian capital in decades, was a citizenship law introduced last year that critics say marginalizes India's Muslim minority. Police records show at least 53 people, mostly Muslims, were killed and more than 200 were injured.
Dhingra said the unrest had forever changed Yamuna Vihar. Gutted homes with broken doors can be seen across the neighborhood; electricity cables melted in the fires dangle dangerously above alleys strewn with stones and bricks used as makeshift weapons in the riots. 
Most Hindu residents in the district are now boycotting Muslim workers, affecting everyone from cooks and cleaners to mechanics and fruit sellers, he said.
""We have proof to show that Muslims started the violence, and now they are blaming it on us,"" Dhingra said. ""This is their pattern as they are criminal-minded people.""
Those views were widely echoed in interviews with 25 Hindus in eight localities in northeast Delhi, many of whom suffered large-scale financial damages or were injured in the riots. Reuters also spoke with about 30 Muslims, most of whom said that Hindus had decided to stop working with them.
Suman Goel, a 45-year-old housewife who has lived among Muslim neighbors for 23 years, said the violence had left her in a state of shock.
""It's strange to lose a sense of belonging, to step out of your home and avoid smiling at Muslim women,"" she said. ""They must be feeling the same too but it's best to maintain a distance.""
Mohammed Taslim, a Muslim who operated a business selling shoes from a shop owned by a Hindu in Bhajanpura, one of the neighborhoods affected by the riots, said his inventory was destroyed by a Hindu mob.
He was then evicted and his space was leased out to a Hindu businessman, he said.
""This is being done just because I am a Muslim,"" said Taslim.
Many Muslims said the attack had been instigated by hardline Hindus to counter protests involving tens of thousands of people across India against the new citizenship law.
""This is the new normal for us,"" said Adil, a Muslim research assistant with an economic think tank in central Delhi. ""Careers, jobs and business are no more a priority for us. Our priority now is to be safe and to protect our lives."" 
He declined to disclose his full name for fear of reprisals.
Emboldened by Modi's landslide electoral victory in 2014, hardline groups began pursuing a Hindu-first agenda that has come at the expense of the country's Muslim minority.
Vigilantes have attacked and killed a number of Muslims involved in transporting cows, which are seen as holy animals by Hindus, to slaughterhouses in recent years. The government has also adopted a tough stance with regard to Pakistan, and in August withdrew semi-autonomous privileges for Jammu and Kashmir, India's only Muslim-majority state.
In November, the Supreme Court ruled that a Hindu temple could be built at Ayodhya, where a right-wing mob tore down a 16th-century mosque in 1992, a decision that was welcomed by the Modi government.
The citizenship law, which eases the path for non-Muslims from neighboring Muslim-majority nations to gain citizenship in India, was the final straw for many Muslims, as well as secular Indians, sparking nationwide protests.
Modi's office did not respond to questions from Reuters about the latest violence.
NIGHT VIGILANTES
During the day, Hindus and Muslims shun each other in the alleys of the Delhi districts that were hardest hit by the unrest in February. At night, when the threat of violence is greater, they are physically divided by barricades that are removed in the morning.
And in some areas, permanent barriers are being erected.
On a recent evening, Tarannum Sheikh, a schoolteacher, sat watching two welders install a high gate at the entrance of a narrow lane to the Muslim enclave of Khajuri Khas, where she lives. The aim was to keep Hindus out, she said.
""We keep wooden batons with us to protect the entrance as at any time, someone can enter this alley to create trouble,"" she said. ""We do not trust the police anymore.""
In the adjacent Hindu neighborhood of Bhajanpura, residents expressed a similar mistrust and sense of insecurity.
""In a way these riots were needed to unite Hindus, we did not realize that we were surrounded by such evil minds for decades,"" said Santosh Rani, a 52-year-old grandmother. 
She said she had been forced to lower her two grandchildren from the first floor of her house to the street below after the building was torched in the violence, allegedly by a Muslim.
""This time the Muslims have tested our patience and now we will never give them jobs,"" said Rani who owns several factories and retail shops. ""I will never forgive them.""
Hasan Sheikh, a tailor who has stitched clothing for Hindu and Muslim women for over 40 years, said Hindu customers came to collect their unstitched clothes after the riots.

""It was strange to see how our relationship ended,"" said Sheikh, who is Muslim. ""I was not at fault, nor were my women clients, but the social climate of this area is very tense. Hatred on both sides is justified.""

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's capital and the country's second most populous state declared states of emergency on Monday while large, non-essential gatherings were banned in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus after the national death toll rose to five.
Australia has recorded nearly 300 cases of coronavirus and authorities fear a rapid rise in the flu-like respiratory disease.
After a 77-year-old woman and a 90-year-old woman died in New South Wales, Victoria state and the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) - home to the capital city of Canberra - both declared a state of emergency that will give health officials sweeping powers.
The proclamations allows the Victoria state and ACT's chief health officers near unchecked powers to contain the spread of the virus and reduce the risk to the public.
The chief health officers will be able to issue fresh quarantine orders to cover entire suburbs, businesses or professions if deemed necessary.
""These powers have never been used before,"" Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters in Melbourne, the state capital of Victoria. ""This, I hope provides a clear sense about the unprecedented nature of this public health emergency, this really significant challenge.""
The Victoria state of emergency will run for four weeks, while the ACT declaration will be in force for at least a week.
Western Australia state declared a state of emergency on Sunday.
BORDER RESTRICTIONS
Nationally, Australia is tightening its borders, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday ordering everyone arriving from overseas to self-isolate for 14 days.
Australia has also banned non-essential social gatherings of more than 500 people, though this not apply for public transport, work or schools.
Still, many offices are asking employees to work from home and several leading universities on Monday shuttered for at least a week.
Australia's parliament, which is scheduled to sit next week and pass the country's planned A$17.6 billion ($10.8 billion) stimulus package, will also restrict access to visitors.
Morrison said lawmakers will be asked to limit the number of staff members that come to Canberra next week.
The contagion has taken a heavy toll on global markets, with central banks cutting interest rates to fight the coronavirus slowdown.
Australia's central bank said on Monday it was ready to purchase local government bonds to support the smooth functioning of the market and will announce further policy measures later this week.
The Reserve Bank of Australia earlier pumped extra liquidity into the banking system, part of a package of measures aimed at ensuring business and households have access to credit as the coronavirus causes chaos in global financial markets.
Australia's corporate regulator asked some participants in the equity market to limit the number of trades they execute each day by up to 25% after a huge spike in volumes last week.
The moves, however, did little to calm market jitters, with the local share market falling as much as 7% in morning trading.
Hundreds of Australians have begun stockpiling goods, from staples to sanitizers, clearing supermarket shelves.
The country's biggest grocer, Woolworths Group, said on Monday it would open exclusively for an hour in the morning from Tuesday until at least Friday for elderly Australians and people with disabilities.
""Common sense, great idea, well done,"" Morrison told Channel 7 of the measures. ""Let's look after each other and help each other out."""

PARIS (Reuters) - Voters turned out in low numbers in France's mayoral elections on Sunday after the government imposed stringent restrictions on public life to curb the spread of the coronavirus, though many headed outdoors to enjoy the warm spring sunshine.
Many expressed bemusement after Prime Minister Edouard Philippe's announcement on Saturday that the vote would go ahead even as he declared all cafes, bars, cinemas and non-essential shops would close until further notice.
In the race for Paris City Hall, an exit poll showed President Emmanuel Macron's candidate, former health minister Agnes Buzyn, coming third behind the socialist incumbent Anne Hidalgo and a conservative challenger.
Even after Macron pressed ahead with the first round, saying it was critical that democracy followed its course, some opponents questioned how a second round could be held in a week as the number of deaths and infections spirals higher.
""I find the government position hypocritical. Keeping the local election going is pure nonsense,"" said Laurence Koch, 38, who works at a city planning consulting firm.
Fewer than 40 percent of registered voters had cast a ballot at 1600 GMT, when only an hour's voting remained outside the big cities, confirming concerns that abstentions could eclipse the previous lowest turnout in 1971.
Yet people appeared to ignore the health warnings when it came to their social life.
In the gardens of the Louvre Museum and along the banks of the River Seine in the capital, hundreds of people strolled, picnicked and drank in the spring sunshine.
Marseille's old port was packed with people determined to enjoy the warm temperatures.
""We're worried like everybody, but it's sunny. We're not close to people and we're not touching them,"" said writer Marc Roger,62. 
There was concern among officials that the public was not heeding warnings. ""Respect the strict social measures,"" Health Minister Olivier Veran implored.
The government was preparing an order that citizens stay at home, sources aware of the planning said, a move that would tighten further restrictions on public life to combat the epidemic.
It was not clear whether the government had taken a final decision on a lockdown. Emmanuel Macron's office said the president and his prime minister had already spoken when announcing earlier restrictions and would communicate again if the public health situation evolved.
'NOT SCARED'
The number of deaths from the coronavirus in France increased by more than a third on Sunday to 127 and more than 5,423 have been infected.
In polling stations across the country, people were visibly cautious, trying with difficulty to keep a safe distance from each other.
One voter, Pascale, 59, who gave only her first name and who was wearing a mask and gloves after voting in Paris' 7th district, said it seemed irresponsible to hold the vote.
""I've got a lot of friends and family that will not go even if they usually carry out their civic duty,"" she said.
Poll clerks wore latex gloves, offered disinfectant and marked out lanes with arrows on the floor showing where people should stand while waiting for their turn. Some voters wore gloves and brought their own pens to sign off their vote.
""I am going to vote and keep living my life no matter what. I am not scared of the virus,” said another voter, a 60-year-old woman who asked to be identified only as Martine as she entered a polling station in Paris' 16th district.
Philippe suggested on Saturday the election's second round on March 22 could be pushed back. If the second round does not go ahead, the first round is likely to be annulled. 
The elections are an important test for Macron, whose presidency has been roiled by public unrest, first from the ""yellow vest"" protesters angered over the cost of living and more recently over his pension reform plans. 

His party is not expected to do well in the vote for France's 35,000 city, town and village halls, and which is critical for anchoring power at a local level.

Mainland China had 16 new confirmed cases on Sunday, the National Health Commission said on Monday, down from 20 a day earlier. That brings the total number of confirmed cases in China so far to 80,860.
Of the new figures, 12 were imported infections, exceeding locally transmitted cases for the third day.
Beijing accounted for four of the cases, Guangdong province four, Shanghai two, Yunnan province one and Gansu province one. That brings the total number of imported cases to 123 so far.
China has tightened checks on international travelers, with the capital of Beijing requiring anyone arriving from abroad to be transferred to city quarantine facilities for 14 days, starting Monday.
Beijing has redirected all international flights that were scheduled to land at its new Daxing International Airport in the south to the older Beijing Capital International Airport in the northeast.
Shanghai has designated hotels serving as quarantine venues for inbound international travelers, though the financial hub has not made it compulsory yet for all travelers to be quarantined at such venues on arrival.
Mainland China's only locally transmitted new infections on Sunday were in Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak and capital of Hubei province, with four cases.
It was the 11th consecutive day that the central province recorded zero new infections outside of Wuhan.
The death toll from the outbreak in China had reached 3,213 as of the end of Sunday, up by 14 from the previous day.
In Hubei, there were 14 new deaths, with Wuhan accounting for 13 of the fatalities."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - With panic buying on Main Street and fear-driven sell-offs on Wall Street, the U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates to near zero on Sunday in another emergency move to help shore up the U.S. economy amid the rapidly escalating coronavirus pandemic. 
For the second time since the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed cut rates at an emergency meeting, aiming for a target range of 0% to 0.25% to help put a floor under a rapidly disintegrating global economy. 
U.S. President Donald Trump, who had openly pressed the Fed for further action, called the move ""terrific"" and ""very good news.""
Americans are waking up to a new reality as coronavirus spreads, with store shelves stripped bare of essentials, schools closed and millions of jobs in jeopardy as businesses temporarily shut their doors. New York City joined the nation's other major public school systems in calling off classes starting this week.
""We're learning from watching other countries,"" Trump said. ""It's a very contagious virus ... but it's something that we have tremendous control of.""
Trump has faced criticism at home and abroad for sometimes downplaying the seriousness of the coronavirus and overstating his administration's ability to handle it.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, said the United States was entering a new phase of coronavirus testing but tempered the president's optimism.
""The worst is yet ahead for us,"" Fauci said, a warning he has issued frequently in the past week. ""It is how we respond to that challenge that is going to what the ultimate end point is going to be.""
U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said testing for coronavirus was expanding with more than 2,000 labs across the country ready to process tests and 10 states operating drive-through testing. 
U.S. Assistant Health Secretary Brett Giroir said there will be 1.9 million high-throughput tests available this week.
The United States has lagged behind other industrialized nations in its ability to test for the coronavirus. In early March, the Trump administration said close to 1 million coronavirus tests would soon be available and anyone who needed a test would get one, a promise it failed to keep.
With limited testing available, U.S. officials have recorded nearly 3,000 cases and 65 deaths, up from 58 on Saturday. Globally more than 162,000 are infected and over 6,000 have died.

Pence also said the government on Monday morning would issue updated federal guidelines, which he described as ""broad-based recommendations for the American public."" 
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control on Sunday recommended that events with gatherings of 50 or more people over the next eight weeks be postponed or cancelled.

DON'T HOARD 
The White House appealed to Americans not to hoard as the coronavirus spreads, reassuring them that grocery supply chains were strong.
Trump held a phone call on Sunday with 30 executives from grocery stores including Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Inc's Whole Foods,  Target  Corp (NYSE:TGT), Costco Wholesale Corp (NASDAQ:COST) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT) Inc, the White House said.
""Have a nice dinner, relax because there's plenty, but you don't have to ... you don't have to buy the quantities,"" Trump said. ""We're doing really, really well. A lot of good things are going to happen."" 
Trump tested negative for coronavirus, his doctors said on Saturday, as the president extended a travel ban to Britain and Ireland to try to slow the pandemic. 
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) returning to the United States and being screened for the coronavirus were met by long lines and massive delays at some major airports, prompting federal officials to deploy more staff and Trump to appeal for patience.
Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, squaring off in a Democratic debate, blasted Trump's handling of the coronavirus and touted their own plans to deal with it. 
In their first one-on-one debate, the two Democratic contenders to face Trump in the November election said the Republican president had contributed to worries about the pandemic by minimizing the threat before declaring a national emergency on Friday.
CLOSURES EXPAND
The U.S. containment measures have so far been mild compared to the nationwide lockdowns imposed in Italy, France and Spain. However, Ohio and Illinois on Sunday ordered all bars and restaurants to close, although carry-out and delivery are still allowed.
""I think Americans should be prepared that they are going to have to hunker down significantly more than we as a country are doing,"" Fauci said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" Elderly people and those with underlying conditions need to be especially cautious.
Fauci said he did not see domestic travel restrictions in the immediate future. 
Even though Americans are not barred from going to the movies, ticket sales in North America fell to their lowest level in more than two decades this weekend, according to measurement firm Comscore.
NEW YORK SCHOOLS CLOSED 
Democratic New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that schools in New York City, Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk counties would close from Monday, and he called on Trump to mobilize the Army Corps of Engineers to create more hospital beds.
Cuomo had been criticized for not closing schools as other states have done, given that New York has a large cluster of coronavirus cases. 
A clinical trial to evaluate a vaccine designed to protect against coronavirus will begin on Monday, the Associated Press reported, citing an unnamed U.S. government official. 
It would take a year to 18 months to fully validate any potential vaccine, the AP added, citing public health officials.

830,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 15, 2020 08:25PM ET</span>",Colombia strikes to go ahead without marches to avoid coronavirus,"BOGOTA (Reuters) - Unions and student groups in Colombia on Friday said a strike planned for March 25 to protest against the social and economic policies of President Ivan Duque will go ahead but they canceled public marches to avoid the spread of the coronavirus.
The planned strike would be the first one this year after a series of protests and three strikes in the final two months of 2019.
""The strike on March 25 is going ahead. However, we are asking Colombians not to leave their houses as there will be no transport. We will hold cacerolazos from houses every two hours, from eight in the morning until eight at night,"" Diogenes Orjuela, head of the Central Union of Workers (CUT), told Reuters.
Cacerolazos are traditional Latin American protests in which demonstrators bang pots and pans.
""We will hoist Colombian flags decorated with black tape to condemn the killings and violence. The strike will last 24 hours and we are not going to break protocols because safety is paramount,"" Orjuela said, referring to the health emergency declared by the government to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
Colombia's government on Thursday suspended public events involving more than 500 people to combat the coronavirus. Health authorities have reported the infection of 16 people in the Andean country.
Talks between the government and protest organizers have not been successful in reaching an agreement that would satisfy the protesters.
The protest leaders initially presented 13 demands across a wide range of economic and social issues, including measures to halt the killings of social activists, pressure Duque to properly implement the 2016 peace agreement with the demobilized FARC guerrillas and to demand the dissolution of the anti-riot police unit that has been accused of using excessive force.
In December, the protest leaders widened the number of demands to 104. The government said many of the demands, which involve economic, fiscal, environmental and business themes, were unconstitutional.
The demonstrations were largely peaceful but there was some looting of shops and attacks by hooded protesters against public transport and buses. Authorities at the time imposed curfews in the cities of Bogota and Cali."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Travelers (NYSE:TRV) returning to the United States and being screened for the coronavirus were met by long lines and massive delays at some major airports, prompting federal officials to deploy more staff and President Donald Trump to appeal for patience.
""Pardon the interruptions and delays,"" Trump said in a Twitter post on Sunday afternoon. ""We are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful.""
Authorities are conducting ""very precise"" medical screenings, Trump tweeted, adding safety comes first. The disease has infected more than 3,200 people in the United States and killed at least 62.
Trump's comments echoed those of officials from the Department of Homeland Security and Customs and Border Protection. They acknowledged delays caused by the new testing policy, but said it was necessary to protect Americans from the virus, which has rapidly spread around the globe.
The Trump administration last week imposed restrictions on travelers from continental Europe, and on Saturday extended the ban to Britain and Ireland. U.S. citizens and permanent residents would still be able to return home, but would be funneled through specific airports.
Acting Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan said the agency was working to adjust its response, but acknowledged the problems faced by travelers waiting to enter the country.
""CBP recognizes that the wait times experienced yesterday were unacceptable,"" Morgan said in a statement.
Chad Wolf, acting secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said he understood that the situation was very stressful.
""We will be increasing capacity, but the health and safety of the American public is first & foremost,"" Wolf wrote on Twitter.
The medical screenings come in addition to the usual immigration and customs checks for travelers entering from abroad. They take about one minute each, he said.
Some lawmakers, including Senator Edward Markey of Massachusetts and Maryland Representative Jamie Raskin, both Democrats, demanded Trump add screening staff, citing the increased risk of spreading the virus in crowded conditions.
Among those caught up in the chaos at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport on Saturday night was Twitter user Sophie Bair, who posted a video of giant crowds and said she had waited for four hours.
""Pics can't even capture the scale of this,"" she wrote. ""We've had to wait in 3 different stages of lines.""
But by Sunday afternoon, the lines at O'Hare, one of the largest U.S. airports, had all but disappeared, travelers said.
""It was fast,"" said Emylou Paris, a 50-year-old nurse who had just arrived with two friends after flying from Vienna and then Brussels.
Paris and her friends, all wearing masks, said they would self-quarantine for 14 days after spending an extra $700 each to come home four days early after Trump announced the travel restrictions.
Packing travelers into crowded lines and airports was ""not helpful"" to efforts to contain the virus, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Anthony Fauci said.
""I'm not going to make policy with you, but if you can possibly lessen that crowding one way or the other, we should do it,"" Fauci said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program.
Illinois Democratic Governor J.B. Pritzker, who had slammed the administration's response in a series of Twitter posts on Saturday, said Wolf and U.S. Vice President Mike Pence told him in a Sunday morning phone call that CBP was increasing staff at the airport."

Bolsonaro appeared to shrug off the advice of medical experts suggesting he remain isolated after several members of his delegation to Florida recently tested positive for the virus.
The president tested negative for the virus, as did U.S. President Donald Trump following their meeting, but newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo reported that Bolsonaro's medical team has suggested he remain isolated until early next week. He will also take another test to rule out all chances that he has the virus, the paper reported on Friday.
Estado also reported on Sunday that the seventh member of Bolsonaro’s entourage in Florida had tested positive for the coronavirus, citing sources who said that press aide Samy Liberman had contracted the disease. 
Bolsonaro strode down the ramp of the presidential palace in a Brazilian soccer jersey and met a throng of protesters at the front gate, where he bumped fists, grabbed cell phones to take pictures and leaned in for selfies with the crowd.
In streaming video of the encounter from his official Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) account, Bolsonaro said it was “priceless” to see so many public demonstrations in favor of his agenda, playing down his warnings against them in a Thursday address to the nation. 
""Although I suggested (a postponement), I can't order anything because this protest isn't mine,"" Bolsonaro said. “With everything against them — the press, the virus, the recommendations — the people took to the streets.”
His move comes as the total number of people tested positive for coronavirus in Brazil rose to 176, from 121 on Saturday.
He insisted that the demonstrations showed support for his agenda and not attacks against any particular adversaries. Public health concerns aside, many have warned Bolsonaro against encouraging the protests in light of the vociferous attacks by some organizers against democratic institutions such as Congress and the Supreme Court. 
Beyond Brasilia, protesters joined demonstrations in state capitals such as Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Belem.
“I’m a Brazilian patriot and I want this country cleaned up. No coronavirus is going to keep me from defending Brazil against the crooks in Congress,” said protestor Claudia Santos at a demonstration along Copacabana beach in Rio. "

MILAN (Reuters) - Italian authorities voiced growing concern on Sunday over how much longer strained health systems could cope with the coronavirus outbreak, as thousands of new cases were recorded over the past 24 hours and several hundred more people died.
While the virus has begun spreading rapidly across Europe, Italy remains the second most heavily affected country after China, where the illness first emerged, and the outbreak has shown no signs of slowing. 
The government is working urgently on procuring more protective equipment, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, adding there was maximum attention on helping Lombardy, the northern region where the virus emerged three weeks ago.
""Our priority is to keep doctors, nurses and all our health personnel safe,"" Conte said in a statement.
A week ago, his government, which is expected to confirm a 25 billion euro ($27.68 billion) package of measures to support businesses and workers hit by the crisis, imposed a virtual lockdown across the country.
With 24,747 cases and 1,809 deaths by Sunday - a rise of 368 in the death toll in just 24 hours - Italy's experience has offered an alarming example for other European countries which have begun seeing sharp rises in cases over recent days.
Lombardy, the heavily populated area around the financial capital Milan, has been the worst-affected region with 1,218 deaths. Of those, 252 were recorded in the last 24 hours.
Italy has the most elderly population in Europe, with almost a quarter of the population aged 65 and over, rendering it especially vulnerable to a disease that has predominantly killed older people.
PUSHED TO THE LIMITS
The head of the civil protection authority, Angelo Borelli, said that Lombardy had been able to transfer some patients to other regions. He also said he was so far unaware of any cases of patients dying because of a lack of intensive care facilities.
But the health systems in Lombardy and in other regions like Emilia Romagna and Veneto at the epicenter of the Italian outbreak have been pushed to their limits.
""The numbers have continued to grow. We're close to the moment where we will have no more intensive care beds,"" Lombardy governor Attilio Fontana told SkyTG24 television.
Italy was the first government in Europe to impose country-wide restrictions to try to control the spread of the virus, closing schools, shops and sporting events and ordering people to stay in their homes for all but essential travel.
Most cases in Lombardy have been in small towns in areas like Bergamo and Brescia, but there have been fears of a major spread into Milan itself, which could overwhelm hospitals.
""The big challenge will be to see how far we can succeed in keeping Milan, the metropolitan area, away from a mass phenomenon with the disease,"" said Massimo Galli, head of the infectious diseases unit at the city's Sacco hospital.
Authorities have been working to set up hundreds of intensive care beds in a specially created facility in the Fiera Milano exhibition center but are still waiting for sufficient respirators and qualified personnel.
Behind the concern for the north, where intensive care and assisted breathing units were at saturation point, there was also a looming worry over the much less well-equipped south, where tens of thousands of people have arrived from the affected regions.
Nello Musumeci, president of the Sicily region, said at least 31,000 people had arrived from northern and central areas in the past 10 to 12 days and registered with authorities but the real number was much higher.
""How many other thousands have entered without showing the same sense of responsibility?"" he told RAI state television, adding that the army might have to be deployed to oversee points of arrival.

Scores of the kingdom's economic and political elite were detained in 2017 at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel in a corruption crackdown that unsettled some foreign investors.
The royal court said last year it was winding down that campaign after 15 months, but the authorities later said they would start going after graft by ordinary government employees.
An anti-corruption body known as Nazaha tweeted on Sunday that it had arrested and would indict 298 people on crimes such as bribery, embezzlement, and abuse of power involving a total of 379 million riyals ($101 million).
Among those implicated are eight defense ministry officers suspected of bribery and money laundering in relation to government contracts during the years 2005-2015, and 29 interior ministry officials in the Eastern Province, including three colonels, a major general and a brigadier general.
Two judges were also detained for receiving bribes, along with nine officials accused of corruption at Riyadh's AlMaarefa University which resulted in severe damage to a building and caused deaths and injuries, Nazaha said.

The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) said the explosion was triggered after a truck hit some gas cylinders stacked in a gas processing plant near the corporation's pipeline in Abule Ado area of Lagos state.
The impact of the explosion led to the collapse of nearby houses, damaged NNPC's pipeline and caused the corporation to halt pumping operations on the Atlas Cove-Mosimi pipeline, the state-owned oil company said in a statement. 
Several people were injured and taken to hospital, according to Ibrahim Farinloye, zonal coordinator for the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA).
Plumes of smoke billowed into the air as people watched, while firefighters tried to quench the flames, a Reuters witness said.
Farinloye told Reuters that ""the explosion destroyed over 50 residential houses.""
Pipeline fires in Nigeria, Africa's biggest crude oil producer, are common and they are mostly caused by theft and sabotage. The methods used to steal oil often result in accidents that cause fires.
""The fire started with smoke,"" one eyewitness said. ""The smoke was coming up and later we heard a sound ... and some houses collapsed even the roofs.""

NNPC said that the temporary shutdown of the petroleum products pipeline would not affect the normal supply of products to the Lagos and surrounding towns.

""Tomorrow we will present guidelines to national governments on border measures. Protecting people's health should not block goods and essential staff from reaching patients, health systems, factories and shops,"" she said in a video address.

""The government is suspending travel for all persons coming into Kenya from any country with reported coronavirus cases ... only Kenyan citizens, and any foreigners with valid residence permits will be allowed to come in provided they proceed on self quarantine,"" President Uhuru Kenyatta told the nation in a televised address.
Anyone entering Kenya in the last 14 days should self-quarantine, he said. The ban would take effect within 48 hours and remain in place for at least 30 days, he said.

CHAMPERY, Switzerland (Reuters) - Alpine ski resorts emptied on Sunday as governments ordered new measures to limit the spread of coronavirus in Europe, including the closure of ski lifts and restaurants.
Switzerland, which has more than 1,500 confirmed cases and is wedged between badly affected European neighbors, on Friday ordered a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people, saying it applied also to ski resorts.
France adopted even stricter measures on Saturday closing cafes, shops and restaurants. Austria's western region of Tyrol, home to popular ski resorts where the country's first cases were reported, announced a total lockdown on Sunday.
In the Swiss village of Champery, part of the vast Portes du Soleil resort that spans the border with France, tourists were checking out of hotels and removing skis from rental lockers. Large slope maps showed red crosses over the lifts.
""It's sad as the snow is magnificent,"" said Damien Gavillet, a 39-year-old ski instructor, at the bottom of the lift. ""It's true we are nearly at the end of the season but there are still great opportunities.""
Some determined skiers, lured by the good conditions and sunshine, didn't let the lack of working lifts deter them and hiked up to the top on back-country skis and enjoyed empty slopes.
Others donned snowshoes and walked to the top of the slopes in bright sunshine to enjoy picnics there. Lower down, a few families with small children were sledding on the nursery slopes.
Around 5,000 people earn a living, either directly or indirectly, from tourism on the Swiss side of Portes du Soleil resort. Normally, the ski season here would last until late April, after the Easter holidays.
""It's a catastrophe,"" said a shop owner in the village, dotted with wooden chalets. ""People have been leaving the village for the last 48 hours.""
Switzerland has made 10 billion Swiss francs ($10.52 billion) available in immediate assistance to mitigate the economic impact of the coronavirus outbreak, the government said on Friday.
Perhaps aware of the blow to tourism, some Swiss resorts kept lifts running on Saturday, witnesses said, but all appeared to be conforming on Sunday after Berne sent a reminder.
Some saw the bright side, noting the fact that it was a great location to avoid the crowds.
""This is an ideal place for isolation,"" said a German woman."

The Balkan country's confirmed cases more than doubled to 51 over the weekend. Two people have died from the infection. The country has declared a state of emergency until April 13, closing schools and banning mass gatherings. 
Bulgaria's hospitals, suffering from a chronic shortage of nurses - many of whom have left the European Union's poorest member state to seek better pay in the west - have already started to hire volunteers to help treat patients.
In a rare demonstration of unity, Prime Minister Boyko Borissov and President Rumen Radev stood together appealing to Bulgarians not to yield to panic, but to grasp the gravity of the situation, observe social distancing and show unity and solidarity.
""Everyone that is on the frontline and deals with the coronavirus will get an additional 1,000 levs monthly,"" Borissov said, adding that Bulgarian industry is producing protective masks and outfits for the medics.
The government will extend 20 million levs to provide for the increased pay for medics and another 20 million to help municipalities boost food deliveries across the country to disabled people and those put under quarantine.
It will also provide liquidity support through state-run Bulgarian Development Bank to businesses hit by the stringent measures Sofia has imposed to contain the infection, Finance Minister Vladislav Goranov said. 
However, he discarded proposals to delay due taxes or credit payments to banks.
In a step to prevent long dole queues, Goranov proposed that businesses planning to lay off workers due to closures of shops, bars and clubs keep them for now, with the state covering 60% of their pay for one month.
Bulgaria is also reviewing its large-scale investment priorities and may delay some army modernization projects, Goranov said without elaborating. Bulgaria has opened a 1.46 billion lev tender to buy 150 armed vehicles. 
The foreign ministry on Sunday urged Bulgarians both in the country and abroad to abstain from international travel. 
Dozens of Bulgarians are currently stranded at the border between Croatia and Serbia after Belgrade closed its land frontiers for all passengers coming from France, Germany, Austria or Spain, including for transit travel.
Bulgaria will ban flights from Italy and Spain after March 17.

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday said he would not rule out closing the nation's borders or forcing people arriving from abroad to go into self-isolation to help combat a coronavirus outbreak.
Asked whether Canada might shut its frontiers to Europe or the United States, Trudeau told CTV: ""We have taken some very strong measures and we are not taking anything off the table.""
So far at least 249 Canadians have tested positive and one person has died.
Canada, acting on the advice of health experts, has already boosted monitoring at airports and is urging its citizens to return from abroad while they still can.
""We're going to continue trusting our public health officials but of course we're hearing the concern people have had. The shift in posture in the United States of course gives us significant things to think about,"" said Trudeau.
The U.S. House of Representatives passed a coronavirus aid package on Saturday that would provide free testing and paid sick leave.
Closing borders could have a major economic impact, given that Canada sends 75% of its goods exports to the United States.
All 10 of Canada's provinces have now reported cases of coronavirus, many linked to foreign travel.
Asked whether people visiting from abroad might be obliged to go into isolation, Trudeau replied: ""We are considering everything ... every step of the way we have, and we will, do the things necessary to keep Canadians safe."" 
The Liberal government will make significant fiscal announcements early next week to help Canadians and businesses hit by the outbreak, he added. Ottawa has already said it will do whatever it takes to protect vulnerable people and firms.
The government is mulling a multibillion-dollar package for industries most hit by the outbreak, including airlines, a source directly familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday.
Trudeau, asked about instances of Canadians panic buying foodstuffs and toilet paper, said supply chains were intact and groceries would continue to arrive.
""Not panicking about anything is going to be really important,"" he said. 

Trudeau spoke from his residence, where he is in self-isolation after his wife Sophie tested positive for coronavirus. Trudeau said he and his three children were ""doing fine"", while Sophie had a headache and was feeling ""under the weather"".

The editorial accused Robert O'Brien, the U.S. national security adviser, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of spreading a ""political virus"" and using it to put China down.
O'Brien said last week that China had reacted slowly to the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing, in remarks that angered China.
Pompeo has said the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak had been hindered by what he called imperfect data from China.
However Xinhua said China's actions including strict quarantine of millions of people had earned the world ""precious time"" to prepare for the epidemic, which has been recognized by the international community.
It added that the U.S. efforts to deal with its own virus cases had been widely criticized.
It accused the United States of having double standards when it came to evaluating the lockdown in Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus that emerged in December last year, compared with its view of the recent lockdown in Italy.
Ties between Washington and Beijing are already strained over issues including trade, intellectual property rights and press freedom but they have been further tested by the virus outbreak.
Xinhua also attacked the U.S. politicians for calling the virus the ""Wuhan virus"" or ""Chinese virus"".
Beijing has disputed the widely held belief that COVID-19 originated in China, and comments by a foreign ministry spokesman that it could have been brought to the country by the U.S. military have further fanned tensions between the two.
On Friday the U.S. State Department summoned the Chinese ambassador to the United States to protest against those remarks.
The virus has infected more than 156,000 people globally and killed more than 5,800. It has also pummeled financial markets, halted industry, brought flights to a standstill and led to the closure of schools in many countries."

The patrol on the M4 highway in Idlib province was the result of a March 5 ceasefire accord between Moscow and Ankara, which back opposing sides in Syria's nine-year war. The ceasefire has largely held since then.
Under the deal, which halted hostilities after an escalation of violence that displaced nearly a million people, Turkish and Russian forces are to establish a security corridor on either side of the M4, as well as carry out joint patrols along it.
But on Sunday hundreds of civilians and rebels cut off the roadway, rejecting the presence of Russian forces and what they said was an agreement that did not guarantee their re-settlement after being pushed out by violence.
""If the patrols happen without people being able to return to their lands, we oppose them,"" said Osama Rahal, a military commander with the Syrian National Army, a Turkey backed rebel group. 
Protesters, some waving Syrian National Army flags, climbed atop Turkish tanks or stood in their path, according to witnesses. Photos posted by the Syrian Observatory, a Britain-based war monitor, showed people lighting fires in the street and forming human chains.
""We are at odds with Russians who have been killing us for six years and have bombed us by air. So we oppose their entry into our towns,"" said Ahmed Shehad, 22.
The Russian Defense Ministry said the joint patrols were cut short because of rebel ""provocations"" and civilians being used as a human shield, forcing them to take a shorter route, according to Russian news agency RIA.
Ankara has been given more time to rein in rebels undermining the patrols, the Russian defense ministry said.
The Turkish Defense Ministry said the first patrol had been completed with air and land assets. It released photos showing Russian and Turkish military vehicles traveling along a highway and officers in discussion as they looked at a map.

It subsequently said the two sides in coordination ""took necessary measures, with the aim of preventing potential provocations and harm to the civilian population in the region"". It did not give further details.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spaniards hunkered down in silent cities on Sunday with children's playgrounds blocked off with police tape, after the government imposed sudden, severe restrictions on public life and the coronavirus death toll more than doubled overnight.
Spain, the second-worst affected European country after Italy, on Saturday ordered its 47 million citizens to stay indoors except for necessary outings such as buying food and medicine. Social gatherings are banned.
The government's official coronavirus death toll rose by 152 overnight to 288. The number infected rose by 2,000 new cases to 7,753.
Among the high-profile figures to test positive were the prime minister's wife, two cabinet ministers and five players on top-flight soccer club Valencia.
The sudden Spanish lockdown, along with similarly abrupt moves to curtail public life in France, have astonished Western Europe this weekend, as countries follow Italy in imposing restrictions unseen in peacetime.
Public places from city streets to beaches across Spain were deserted, with a strengthened presence of police, many wearing latex gloves and facemasks, ensuring people complied with the emergency measures.
All that could be heard on the empty streets of Madrid was the sound of families behind shuttered windows. People played video games, watched TV and sat out on balconies.
All major newspapers carried a wrapper emblazoned with a government-promoted slogan ""Together we'll stop this virus"". Newspapers reported that police could issue on-the-spot fines of hundreds of euros for those who fail to follow the rules. 
Bars, restaurants and shops selling non-essential items are shut for 15 days as the country enters a state of emergency. Schools are shut, keeping millions of children at home. 
In a further blow to Spain's economically vital tourist industry, Easter processions that typically draw huge crowds have been canceled.
Britain on Sunday advised its citizens against all but essential travel to Spain. Around 4,400 inbound flights to Spain have been canceled for the second half of March, the Spanish airlines association said on Thursday.
""I hope it ends soon so I can go back to work,"" said 22-year-old airport worker Fabricio, who declined to give his surname, waiting to make a money transfer in central Madrid.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Saturday the emergency measures would have a major impact on citizens and businesses, but promised the government would work to lessen the blow. 
Spain, where more than half of jobs are dependent on small or medium-sized companies, already has one of the developed world's highest unemployment rates.

""This city depends on tourism - what with all the bars and restaurants and shops - this is really going to economically damage many businesses,"" said 52-year-old Leonel Sanchez, out to buy food on Madrid's main thoroughfare, Gran Via.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - The main rival to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu won support from Israel's Arab coalition on Sunday to form a government, potentially undermining Netanyahu's plan to stay in power atop a proposed unity cabinet to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
After a third inconclusive election in less than a year left Netanyahu still three seats short of forming a majority, the prime minister has asked his main rival, general Benny Gantz, to agree to an ""emergency government"" to fight the global pandemic.
However, Gantz has so far been cool to the proposal, suggesting he could still try to form a minority government of his own, ousting Israel's longest-serving leader.
Speaking at a meeting with President Reuven Rivlin, who is holding discussions with parties on forming a new government, Joint List head Ayman Odeh said its voters had said ""an emphatic 'no' to a right-wing government and Benjamin Netanyahu"".
The Joint List is now the third biggest party in the Israeli parliament, after achieving a record showing in the March 2 election.
Odeh called Netanyahu a ""serial inciter"" against Israel's Arab minority. His coalition would not join a government led by Gantz, but could potentially provide it enough votes to govern.
About a fifth of Israeli citizens are Arabs - Palestinian by heritage but Israeli by citizenship. But no Israeli government has ever included an Arab political party. 
Netanyahu's Likud party denounced any such plans: ""While Netanyahu is handling a global and national crisis in the most responsible way, Gantz is racing to form a minority government depending on supporters of terror,"" the party said on Twitter.
With Netanyahu facing criminal charges in three corruption cases - his trial was supposed to start on Tuesday but was postponed until May 24 amid the health crisis - political rivals have cast doubt on his motives for proposing a unity cabinet.
Gantz has said Netanyahu did not appear to be sincere, having yet to send a negotiating team to Gantz's Blue and White party. ""When you're serious, we'll talk,"" Gantz wrote.
Gantz's prospect of toppling Netanyahu could depend on former defense minister Avigdor Lieberman, who heads the far-right Yisrael Beiteinu party.
Lieberman, who was due to meet Rivlin later on Sunday, has balked at supporting a government backed by Arab legislators, accusing them of disloyalty to Israel. But he has also called for Netanyahu to leave power while under indictment.
Netanyahu, 70, has the pledged backing of 58 members of parliament, three short of a ruling majority in the 120-seat Knesset. He has denied any wrongdoing in the investigations. Charges against him include bribery, breach of trust and fraud.

Television pictures showed buses transporting pilgrims along the highway from Ankara's airport to the city as part of an operation to place those returning into student dormitories.
Turkey, which has only diagnosed six cases of coronavirus, has ramped up measures to halt its spread in recent days, closing schools and universities, holding sports events without spectators and halting flights to many countries.
On Wednesday it became the last major economy to report an outbreak after taking what the World Health Organization (WHO) described as ""vigilant"" measures to delay it.
The latest move came after Health Minister Fahrettin Koca called overnight for those returning from the Umrah pilgrimage to quarantine themselves for a fortnight, saying a returnee in the last week had become the sixth person to test positive.
He then announced on Sunday that the state was actively quarantining the returnees.
""All passengers returning from the Umrah since last night are being put into quarantine in separate rooms in student dormitories,"" he wrote on Twitter, adding that those suspected of being ill were being taken to hospital for tests.
Earlier in March, Saudi Arabia expanded a rare freeze on pilgrimages to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina by foreigners to also include Saudi citizens and residents due to concerns about coronavirus.
Umrah refers to pilgrimage rites carried out in the holy cities throughout the year, and is separate from the annual week-long haj, which typically draws 2 million Muslims from around the world. Haj starts this year in late July.
The head of Turkey's religious directorate, Ali Erbas, said on Saturday that the last 5,300 Turkish pilgrims were in the process of returning to Turkey, but at the time he said the pilgrims should self-isolate at home for two weeks.
A day earlier he said that 21,000 pilgrims were to return from Saudi Arabia by March 15, but it was not clear whether they were all to go into quarantine.
The youth and sports ministry said the pilgrims were to be kept under observation for 14 days in five student dormitories - in the capital Ankara and the central Turkish city of Konya - with a capacity of 10,330 people.
It said the three-week closure of universities in Turkey, announced last week, meant that the dormitories were mostly empty and that the remaining students had been transferred to other dormitories."

The conservative kingdom only recently lifted bans on public entertainment, including cinemas and concerts, as part of social and economic reform efforts, but the virus's spread has prompted authorities to pause such activities again.
Getaways to the rugged desert just outside the capital Riyadh are witnessing a surge of interest, guides say.
Those seeking isolation away from home can make the two-hour drive northwest from the capital Riyadh to 'The Edge of the World' site, where 300-metre-high cliffs offer expansive desert vistas.
""I came to enjoy trail hiking because many places are closed: cinemas, public spaces and we cannot travel,"" Khalid al-Harbi, a Saudi from the Eastern Province, told Reuters.
Sarah, a Briton living in Riyadh, said the metropolis had gone quiet nowadays. ""But here is an incredible place to come, lots of fresh air, you're outside. There are lots of people here but there's such a lot of space,"" she said.
Saudi Arabia has reported 103 coronavirus cases but no deaths. It suspended the Umrah pilgrimage and locked down its eastern Qatif region where many infections are located.
The authorities have shuttered sports, entertainment and wedding halls, asked people to avoid shaking hands, and urged the population of 30 million to limit their movements.
Buses and 4x4s transport families and young people to the desert site for a day of trekking and a campfire barbecue with music, dancing and waterpipes. The cliffs, officially known as Jebel Fihrayn, overlook ancient caravan trade routes.
""Corona is negative, but the positive is that this place is full of people,"" said Abdulrahman Edres, who knows the area well as a rescue volunteer."

Ireland, which has 129 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and two deaths, closed schools and universities last week and advised people to cancel all indoor gatherings of 100 people or more.
But it stopped short of closing cafes, bars and restaurants, as some European states have done, citing the potential impact on workers and small businesses and saying owners should instead ensure customers well spaced out.
Videos showing packed bars with sing-alongs and crowded streets in Dublin's Temple Bar nightlife district went viral on social media on Saturday under the #CloseThePubs hashtag.
One stag party, usually involving a group of men celebrating shortly before one their number gets married, was shown walking down the street in medical overalls and face masks.
Health Minister Simon Harris said images from packed bars were an insult to medical workers preparing for a pandemic.
Ireland's European Minister Helen McEntee said that closing pubs restaurants would be devastating for workers but added that ""unless people listen to public health advice and take this seriously then that’s where this is headed.""
Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Sunday he was considering asking parliament for enforcement powers to keep numbers in bars to under 100.
""No indoor mass gatherings of more than 100 people applies to pubs & clubs..... May seek enforcement powers from Dail/Seanad,"" he said in a Twitter post, referring to the lower and upper houses of parliament.
He urged anyone who had gone out to avoid contact with the elderly of people with chronic diseases, he said.
Other Twitter users praised some pubs for voluntarily closing, with the DublinByPub.ie bar guide offering a list of responsible pubs ""to go on the lash in when this is all over."""

ZURICH (Reuters) - Austria announced major restrictions on movement in public places on Sunday, urging Austrians to self-isolate, banning gatherings of more than five persons and putting further limits on who can enter the country.
The restrictions on public movement will come into force on Monday, while restaurants are ordered closed from Tuesday, when new entry restrictions will also take effect, a government spokesman said.
""Austrians are being summoned to isolate themselves,"" Chancellor Sebastian Kurz's office said in a statement. ""That means only making social contact with the people with whom they live.""
People should only leave the house for work that could not be postponed, to buy necessary food supplies and to help others, it said.
Gatherings of more than five people will be allowed only for activities serving to fight the coronavirus outbreak.
People who urgently want to go into the outdoors “may do so, but only alone or with people living in the same apartment,” Kurz told Austrian news service APA.
Police would already be stationed at playgrounds and outdoors from Sunday, he told APA, and would ask large groups to disband.
The country had 800 cases and one death by 0700GMT on Sunday, according to its health ministry.
Austria also expanded its list of countries from which it restricts entry, adding Britain, the Netherlands, Russia and Ukraine. It said people traveling from countries on the list could enter only if they undertook two weeks of home quarantine or had a current health certificate.
Austria has already closed its borders to most arrivals from neighboring Switzerland and Italy because of the coronavirus outbreaks there and previously announced other measures, such as shutting schools and most shops other than those selling food and medicine from Monday.

It said on Saturday it was making 4 billion euros ($4.4 billion) immediately available to deal with the economic fallout from the pandemic.

Singapore will also tell all travelers to the country with recent travel history to southeast Asian nations, Japan, Switzerland or the United Kingdom to quarantine themselves at their place of residence for 14 days, the ministry added.
These measures come as the majority of new infections being reported in the city-state over the past few days have been people arriving from overseas rather than local transmissions.
The Asian travel hub is already set to bar from Monday entry or transit to visitors who have been in coronavirus-hit countries Italy, France, Spain or Germany in the last 14 days, as part of measures to control the spread of infection.
It has a similar ban in place for travelers from Iran, South Korea and China.
The city-state has won international praise for its painstaking onslaught on the virus since it initially emerged with one of the highest tallies of infections outside China. But other nations have since outpaced it.
Singapore has reported more than 200 infections, but no fatalities. Globally, more than 150,000 people have been infected while over 5,800 have died, a Reuters tally shows."

Citizens and residents in Kuwait, which went into virtual lockdown on Thursday, had their temperatures tested before entering banks, where long queues formed on Sunday after the state limited the number of operational branches. Masks and gloves were distributed to those in line.
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have taken the most drastic steps among the six Gulf Arab states, which have recorded a total of 870 cases but no deaths, by halting international passenger flights. The United Arab Emirates has suspended new entry visas from March 17 while Qatar has restricted visa issuance.
Kuwait, where the ban on international flights began on March 13, has offered its citizens stranded at London's Heathrow Airport paid accommodation at an airport hotel with three meals a day, according to an embassy notification seen by Reuters.
An American living in the Saudi capital Riyadh said his parents -- in their 60s and 70s -- cut short their visit and departed the kingdom on Saturday night before the flight suspension went into effect at 0800 GMT Sunday.
""I'm glad that they're off even though it means 24 hours in the airport hotel in Dubai. Given their age and medical issues it's definitely better than stuck here for weeks,"" he told Reuters.
Saudi Arabia, which has locked down its eastern Qatif region where many infections were recorded, has 103 cases of the virus.
Two gated compounds in the capital Riyadh housing hundreds of expatriates have each reported one case among residents, according to emails from management seen by Reuters.
The Saudi health ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment and it was not clear if the two cases were already included in the kingdom's total count.
Many of the coronavirus cases recorded in Gulf Arab states have been linked to travel to Iran, which has emerged as an epicenter for the disease in the Middle East.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Sunday the government had no plans to quarantine Iranian cities because of the coronavirus outbreak, adding that there was no shortage of goods in shops and supermarkets, state TV reported.
Oman, across the Gulf from Iran, asked open-deck boats to immediately halt ship-to-ship trade with Iranian boats, state news agency ONA said on Sunday.
In the UAE, regional tourism and business hub Dubai joined other emirates in shuttering cinemas, arcades and gyms. Dubai's large Global Village shopping and entertainment market, which runs from November to March each year, said it was closing early. The UAE capital Abu Dhabi shut down public beaches and parks.

Belgium has been run by a caretaker administration with limited powers for more than a year and a May election failed to resolve the standoff.
The cabinet of Prime Minister Sophie Wilmes has ordered the closure of schools, cafes, sports and cultural centers to slow the virus's spread, but the administration cannot take steps such as launching new budgetary measures that are likely to be required to shore up the euro zone's sixth largest economy.
Bart De Wever, leader of the center-right N-VA, the largest party in Dutch-speaking region of Flanders, called on Saturday for the creation of an emergency government, which would be in power for a year and focus on the coronavirus and its aftermath.
The center-left Socialists (PS), the largest party in the French-speaking south of Belgium, agreed that it was time to set aside political differences during the crisis.
They and four other parties met on Saturday until the early hours of Sunday, with individual party meetings set for Sunday.
But the parties are still divided over who will lead an emergency government.
De Wever has put himself forward as prime minister, but the PS said it would be irresponsible ""to change captain in the middle of a storm"", preferring to stick with Wilmes, a French-speaking liberal.
Belgium set a world record of 18 months to form a government after parliamentary elections in 2010 and, until the coronavirus struck, could have been on course to beat that due to differences between the two largest parties, the PS and separatist N-VA."

HAMMAMET, Tunisia (Reuters) - Ammar Jouini had been optimistic about this year, hoping that after Tunisia's tourism sector finally recovered from years of pain caused by militant attacks in 2015, his souvenir business might also be looking up.
But with the coronavirus devastating holiday bookings, he is thinking of shutting up his shop in the popular beach resort of Hammamet and seeking new work for the season.
""I have to wait three or four days to sell only one piece. My costs are much higher than my income. It seems the difficulties will return again,"" he said.
Tunisia had been gearing up for a season of record visitor numbers that politicians hoped would make up for gloom elsewhere in the economy. But last week Prime Minister Elyes Fakhfakh said forecast economic growth had fallen to 1% from 2.7%, citing the virus.
In another blow to the tourist trade, Tunisia has announced it will require everyone arriving from abroad to self-isolate for two weeks.
Tourism accounts for nearly a tenth of Tunisia's economy, is its second-biggest employer after agriculture and provides an important source of foreign currency.
The crash that followed the 2015 attacks caused gross domestic product (GDP) growth to slow to 0.5% that year from an expected 3%. It contributed to a sharp fall in the value of Tunisia's currency the following year and ongoing economic troubles.
Tunisia agreed a loan program in 2016 with the International Monetary Fund but it expires in April and the new government, agreed in February after months of wrangling, is now trying to negotiate a replacement.
Jouini's shop, full of stuffed camels, painted pottery, t-shirts, red fezzes and postcards, is far from the only business facing hard times in Hammamet, where resorts stretch along the sandy beach each side of the pretty walled city and its fort.
While Jouini spoke, other souvenir sellers played football in the street, their shops empty. Nearby, Ramadan Jlassi sat with his horse-drawn carriage, waiting for custom.
He does not earn more than 10 dinars ($3.50) a day and has three sons, he said. ""It is hard to buy the basics for my family,"" he said.
CANCELED RESERVATIONS
Tunisia has confirmed 13 cases of the coronavirus, mostly people who have recently arrived from abroad. It has closed schools early for their scheduled spring holiday and stopped some international travel.
Spring bookings at the Hasdrubal hotel, one of the smartest in town, stand at 15%, a quarter of the usual level in March, said general manager Samir Ncir.
""There is stagnation. Many reservations were canceled,"" he said. The hotel is not yet planning to lay off staff though it may delay signing up seasonal workers, hoping that the epidemic will pass and tourists will return in the summer.
""We expect the pattern to return at the end of May and the beginning of June. But we may have to put off signing contracts with casual workers in the summer,"" he said.
But for Jouini, who has two children, the outlook is not good. ""It will be complicated for me and my family because this is our only income,"" he said."

Widodo also suggested people work from home and avoid mass gatherings, as he sought to calm rising concerns about the spread of the virus in the sprawling archipelago.
Indonesia, the world's fourth most populous country, reported on Sunday the number of infections had risen by 21 to 117. Five people with the virus have died in the country.
Jakarta and several other provinces and cities have already announced school closures starting this week, and some companies are asking staff to work from home.
Transport Minister Budi Karya Sumadi was confirmed to be suffering from COVID-19 on Saturday. Widodo, who led a cabinet meeting attended by Sumadi on Wednesday, said the minister was still being isolated in a hospital.
Other ministers, including State Owned-Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir, were tested for coronavirus on Sunday, CNBC Indonesia reported.
Sofyan Djalil, a minister in charge of land planning who was sitting closest to Sumadi at the cabinet meeting, had tested negative, a ministry spokeswoman said.
While most confirmed cases have been clustered in Jakarta, cases have also been reported in cities in western and central Java, Manado on Sulawesi island, Pontianak on Borneo island and the holiday island of Bali.
The president said he would let regional governments decide on whether to declare emergency status over outbreaks.
""The most important thing right now is social distancing, how we maintain a distance. That's why I said in this condition we should work from home, learn at home and pray at home,"" Widodo said.
Jusuf Kalla, Widodo's former vice president who heads Indonesia's Red Cross, told Metro TV on Saturday authorities should consider lockdowns to limit interactions between people.
The number of cases had grown around 30% everyday, while only 10% of those infected had recovered, Kalla said, warning this could mean around 1,000 cases within the next week.
""We have to take emergency actions and quickly, swiftly because we're at war and our time is limited,"" he said.
Civil servants would be allowed to work from home starting this week and shifts would be arranged to make sure public services are maintained, a government statement said.
Indonesia confirmed its first cases of the virus on March 2, while some countries in the region had reported scores of cases far earlier, raising concerns among medical experts about infections either not being reported or going undetected.

Singapore, which must hold a national ballot by early 2021, revised its electoral boundaries on Friday, in a move typically seen as a precursor to calling a vote imminently.
The government had two choices for timing the election - either hope the virus situation will stabilize before the end of its term or to call for a vote early, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Saturday.
Lee's People's Action Party has ruled Singapore since independence over half a century ago.
Opposition parties said the government should wait for the virus outbreak to end before calling elections in the city-state where voting is compulsory.
Singapore has confirmed 212 cases of the virus.
More than 2.6 million voters could be exposed to the virus at polling stations and at large rallies during campaigns, said Tan Cheng Bock, leader of the newly launched Progress Singapore Party (PSP).
""There is this potential mass exposure to this virus. So holding a general election at this time should not be considered,"" said Tan, a prominent opposition figure and a former PAP lawmaker.

""The SDP calls on the PAP to refrain from such an irresponsible act,"" it said.
Neither party currently holds seats in parliament.
On Friday, Singapore authorities issued new virus-fighting measures for people to reduce close contact, including cancelling or deferring ticketed events with more than 250 participants.

Netanyahu, who is spearheading Israel's tough measures to slow the spread of the coronavirus, has denied any wrongdoing in the investigations. Charges against him include bribery, breach of trust and fraud.
In addition to the legal battle, Netanyahu, who heads the right-wing Likud party, is fighting for his political life after an inconclusive election on March 2, following ballots in April and September that also ended without a clear victor.
Netanyahu, 70, is accused of wrongfully accepting $264,000 worth of gifts from tycoons, which prosecutors say included cigars and champagne, and of dispensing regulatory favours in alleged bids for improved coverage by a popular news website.

He could face up to 10 years in prison if convicted of bribery and a maximum three-year term for fraud and breach of trust.

""Many of our friends are looking for him,"" his close friend and businesswoman Wang Ying said in a statement to Reuters, describing them as being ""extremely anxious"".
""Ren Zhiqiang is a public figure and his disappearance is widely know. The institutions responsible for this need to give a reasonable and legal explanation for this as soon as possible,"" she said. 
Calls made by Reuters to Ren's mobile phone went unanswered.
The Beijing police did not immediately respond to requests by phone and fax for comment on Sunday. China's State Council Information Office did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.
An essay Ren shared with people he knew in recent weeks took aim at a speech Xi made on Feb. 23, which state media reported was teleconferenced to 170,000 party officials nationwide. Copies of his essay were later posted online by others.
In the essay, which does not mention Xi by name, Ren said after studying the speech he ""saw not an emperor standing there exhibiting his 'new clothes,' but a clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor,"" according to a version posted by China Digital Times, a U.S.-based website.
He also said it revealed a ""crisis of governance"" within the party, and that a lack of free press and speech had prevented the outbreak from being tackled sooner, causing the situation to worsen. 
Ren's disappearance comes as censorship over how local media and online users discuss the epidemic has tightened in recent weeks.
The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has infected more than 80,000 people in the country, killing 3,199. 
Ren, who gained the nickname ""Cannon Ren"" for previous critiques posted on social media, was put on probation from the party for a year in 2016 as part of a punishment for publicly criticizing government policy. 
That year, the government ordered platforms such as the Twitter-like Weibo to shut down Ren's social media accounts, which at the time had more than 30 million online followers, saying he had been ""spreading illegal information"".
Beijing has framed the battle against coronavirus as a ""People's War"" led by Xi. 

While the draconian measures to fight the virus, including the lockdown of the city of Wuhan, have proven effective at containing it even as the disease spreads rapidly in other countries, China has faced criticism for suppressing information in the outbreak's early days.

SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - China tightened checks on international travellers arriving at Beijing airport on Sunday, after the number of imported new coronavirus infections surpassed locally transmitted cases for a second day in a row.
China, where the epidemic began in December, appears to now face a greater threat of new infections from outside its borders as it continues to slow the spread of the virus domestically. Over a hundred countries have reported infections.
Mainland China reported 20 new cases of infections on March 14, up from 11 cases a day earlier, data from by the National Health Commission (NHC) showed on Sunday.
Of those, 16 were imported, it said.
Beijing has redirected all international flights that were scheduled to land at its new Daxing International Airport to Beijing Capital International Airport, and as of Sunday has cordoned off a special area to process these passengers, the state-backed Beijing News reported.
Travellers who are transiting through Beijing to other destinations will be given special assistance, it said.
Beijing's moves follow that of Shanghai, also a key hub for international flights to China, which stepped up airport screening last week, resulting in some passengers saying they had to wait as long as seven hours.
Of the 16 latest imported cases, 5 were found in the capital Beijing and three in Shanghai. The provinces of Zhejiang, Gansu and Guangdong respectively reported four, three and one cases.
Three of the cases in Beijing involved travellers from Spain while one came from Italy and the other from Thailand.
The Shanghai case involved a Chinese native who lived in the Italian city of Milan.
The Gansu government said one of its cases was linked to a charter flight from Iran while the others were travellers from Saudi Arabia. Zhejiang province did not say where its four imported cases were from.
Underlying growing concerns over these imported cases, the southern province of Guangxi has said it will provide a cash incentive of 3,000-10,000 yuan ($428-$1,428) to people who provided clues on anyone who had travelled in from abroad but not abided by quarantine rules.
Mainland China's only locally transmitted new infections on Saturday were in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, which recorded four cases. It was the tenth consecutive day that the Hubei province recorded zero new infections outside Wuhan.
PUSH TO RESTART
China is making efforts to restart work cross its factories and businesses, which had been halted amid virus-related curbs, as the numbers of new infections fall further.
Some cities with no infections in recent days, such as Shanghai and Hangzhou, have started opening tourist attractions, restaurants and gyms.
The western region of Xinjiang also plans to reopen schools in batches starting from Monday, state media reported.
Limitations, however, remain in place.
Beijing, for instance, has allowed restaurants to start reopening but requires them to prevent diners from eating meals while directly facing each other and tables must be spaced a metre apart, the Xinhua news agency said.
Saturday's figures bring the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,844. The death toll had reached 3,199 as of the end of Saturday, up 10 from the previous day. All ten deaths occurred in Wuhan, the NHC said.
China came in for criticism at home and globally over its early response to the outbreak, but its draconian efforts at control, including the lock-down of Wuhan and Hubei province, have been effective at curbing the spread.
The government has in recent days been trying to burnish its credentials as a responsible power by sharing expertise and equipment with countries seeing a surge in cases, but still faces some calls for accountability at home.
An influential former Chinese property executive who called President Xi Jinping a ""clown"" over a speech he made last month about the government's efforts to battle the coronavirus has gone missing, three of his friends told Reuters.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will impose 14-day self-isolation on international travelers arriving from midnight Sunday and ban cruise ships from foreign ports for 30 days, mirroring restrictions in nearby New Zealand aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.
Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the new measures after a meeting with a newly formed national cabinet, dubbed the coronavirus ‘war cabinet’.
The strict measures were designed to slow the spread of the global pandemic across Australia and help the country “flatten the peak” of the virus, Morrison told a news conference.
""To help stay ahead of this curve, we will impose a universal precautionary self-isolation requirement on all international arrivals to Australia and that is effective from midnight tonight,"" he said.
""Further the Australian government will also ban cruise ships from foreign ports from arriving at Australian ports for an initial 30 days.""
The new border restrictions come as Australia recorded more than 250 cases of coronavirus and three deaths.
As of mid-March, COVID-19, the deadly respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus, has infected 156,00 people globally and killed more than 5,800.
Australia has already imposed bans for travelers from Italy, South Korea, Iran and China, countries with high infection rates.
The bans mean foreign nationals who have been in any of the four nations will not be allowed into Australia for 14 days from the time they left those countries.
Australian citizens and permanent residents traveling from those countries will still be able to enter Australia but must self-isolate for a fortnight after returning home.
Australia has advised against non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people from Monday, but this is yet to apply to schools and universities.
Morrison on Sunday urged people to practice ""social distancing"", such as keeping a meter (three feet) apart and not to shake hands, in order to reduce transmissions.
He said the rate of community transmission had started to increase and that social distancing would help limit demand on the healthcare systems, which would mean better treatment for elderly and those in remote and vulnerable communities. 
""Slowing the spread will free up beds,” he said, “That's what happens when you get this right and we've seen other countries going down this path.""
Neighboring New Zealand on Saturday said it would require incoming travelers, including its own citizens, to self-isolate for two weeks and banned cruise ships. [L4N2B705A].
The Australian government is yet to restrict the operation of schools, but earlier on Sunday the Health Minister Greg Hunt did not rule out such a measure in the coming months.
The new phase of restrictions come as the Australian government launches a multi-million-dollar advertising campaign focused on good hygiene, and the formation of a Coronavirus Business Liaison Unit to address the economic fallout.

SAN SALVADOR/TEGUCIGALPA/PANAMA CITY (Reuters) - Central American countries took further and tougher steps to contain the fast-spreading coronavirus on Saturday with measures ranging from bans on large gatherings to travel restrictions.
El Salvador's Congress approved a series of emergency measures sought by President Nayib Bukele to prevent the spread of the virus and to fend off the risk of a public health crisis.
The measures include restrictions on entry to and exit from El Salvador, as well as curbs on public gatherings. El Salvador has so far not reported any cases of coronavirus.
Earlier, Honduras and Guatemala banned public gatherings to prevent the virus from spreading as quickly as it has in Asian and European countries. Panama had already banned large gatherings. 
Meanwhile, authorities in Panama said flights arriving from Europe and Asia would be temporarily suspended, with the exception of flights that transport doctors, medical equipment or other humanitarian aid. 

So far, more than 150,000 people have been infected by the coronavirus across the world and over 5,500 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

(Reuters) - In Union, New Jersey, a  Target  (NYSE:TGT) opened at 8 a.m. and had sold out of its full stock of milk and bottled water five minutes later. In Austin, Texas, some gas station pumps ran dry. Not a bottle of bleach could be found at a  Home Depot  (NYSE:HD) in Fairfax, Virginia.
As dawn broke across the United States on Saturday, thousands of shoppers lined up outside supermarkets and grocery stores before they opened, eager for a chance to buy essentials that have flown off shelves as the country hunkers down to slow the spread of coronavirus.
""It's crazy. People have gone crazy,"" said Alexis Coppol, a Washington, D.C. resident who was shopping at Costco (NASDAQ:COST). ""I mean, I'm not too worried, but if we get put on a lockdown I want to make sure I have food.""
Americans have been stocking up on goods for days. But for many, the severity of the rapidly spreading coronavirus, which causes a sometimes fatal, highly contagious respiratory illness, really started to sink in after President Donald Trump declared a national emergency on Friday, releasing $50 billion in federal aid to help states fight the virus.
More than 2,500 Americans have contracted the disease and at least 52 have died. The virus has infected more than 154,000 people worldwide and killed some 5,800 since it was discovered in China in December.
To slow the rate of contagion, local officials across the country have closed schools and employers have asked employees to work from home. The resulting rush to stock up on supplies in preparation for long periods of isolation has placed a strain on the distribution of consumer goods nationwide.
Trying to prevent shortages, resales and price gouging, many chain stores have limited the amount of certain items individual customers can buy, particularly household cleaning products and hand sanitizers that health experts say are effective in killing the virus on surfaces.
""It's worse because people are buying in bulk, and some people are callous enough to resell what they're buying,"" said Tevin Hunter, a sales representative at the Target in Union.
Along with shortages of basics such as pasta, meat and toilet paper, some unexpected items were also in short supply.
Bottles of virgin olive oil flew off the shelves in the affluent Washington suburb of Bethesda, Maryland.
And with so many companies telling their employees to work from home if possible, the Best Buy in Manhattan's Union Square (NYSE:SQ) was sold out of external computer monitors by late Thursday.
At the Plum Grove Cyclery, a bicycle shop in Leesburg, Virginia, manager Tom Stokes said sales have risen noticeably over the past week as people avoid public transportation.
""A woman came in this morning and said, 'I normally go to the gym, and that's not happening right now, so I'm going to ride a bike and get my exercise outdoors,'"" Stokes said.
At a Costco in Seattle, Dee Jackson wore a gas mask as she lined up with hundreds of other shoppers before it opened. The line spanned the length of the store and continued around a corner, with a law enforcement officer keeping watch at the main entrance. A sign laid out limits for purchases of high demand items, with ""Sold Out!!!"" taped over items like gloves, soap, and disinfectant wipes.
Not a roll of toilet paper remained on shelves at Target in Alexandria, Virginia, but limited amounts were being rationed out at BJ's Wholesale Club in West Nyack, New York. There were mounds of apples at Safeway in Silver Springs, Maryland, but the citrus fruits and bananas had all been swiped.
""I just came here for bananas, and there's no bananas,"" said one elderly woman in dismay.
Waiting in a long line at the Costo in Washington, shoppers Hua Lu and K.C. Dutton said they had one main priority.
""We need the wine, that's why we're here,"" said Dutton. ""We don't care about toilet paper or cleanser, we're here for the wine. Yeah, we'll be honest."""

The 32-year-old, known for his provocative performances criticizing authorities, had been put in ""preventive prison"" awaiting trial on various charges, according to his partner and art curator Claudia Genlui.
One of these was the charge of insulting national symbols, after the self-described ""art-ivist"" draped himself in the Cuban flag for a month last year, including in the bathroom, documenting his performance with photos and videos.
Supporters said they were trumped up charges to silence a vocal critic. The Cuban government, which usually does not comment on police activity such as the detention of dissidents, did not respond to a request for comment.
But officials said this week on social media that he was not an artist and state news outlets ran articles on the importance of respecting the flag.
Otero Alcantara said in a video released by alternative outlet El Estornudo that authorities did not explain whether they would maintain those charges against him when they released him unexpectedly.
""I am still in shock because inevitably the experience of being in a jail is traumatic,"" said Otero Alcantara. ""But honestly I'm happy .. (because this support shows) I am not alone, all I have done is not in vain, and Cuba is changing.""
Amnesty International had on Friday named him as a prisoner of conscience
Otero Alcantara had been detained dozens of times at police stations over the past few years but never for more than 72 hours, and he had never been thrown in jail, Genlui said.
Those who criticized his imprisonment included even some staunch defenders of Cuba’s 1959 revolution such as folk singer Silvio Rodriguez and painter-sculptor Alexis Leiva “Kcho,” who was friendly with late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.

""We are giving a very sad impression of backwardness, of the Middle Ages,"" Rodriguez wrote on his blog. ""How, in the middle of the 21st century, are we going to put ideological brakes on young artists?""

The planned strike would be the first one this year after a series of protests and three strikes in the final two months of 2019.
""The strike on March 25 is going ahead. However, we are asking Colombians not to leave their houses as there will be no transport. We will hold cacerolazos from houses every two hours, from eight in the morning until eight at night,"" Diogenes Orjuela, head of the Central Union of Workers (CUT), told Reuters.
Cacerolazos are traditional Latin American protests in which demonstrators bang pots and pans.
""We will hoist Colombian flags decorated with black tape to condemn the killings and violence. The strike will last 24 hours and we are not going to break protocols because safety is paramount,"" Orjuela said, referring to the health emergency declared by the government to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
Colombia's government on Thursday suspended public events involving more than 500 people to combat the coronavirus. Health authorities have reported the infection of 16 people in the Andean country.
Talks between the government and protest organizers have not been successful in reaching an agreement that would satisfy the protesters.
The protest leaders initially presented 13 demands across a wide range of economic and social issues, including measures to halt the killings of social activists, pressure Duque to properly implement the 2016 peace agreement with the demobilized FARC guerrillas and to demand the dissolution of the anti-riot police unit that has been accused of using excessive force.
In December, the protest leaders widened the number of demands to 104. The government said many of the demands, which involve economic, fiscal, environmental and business themes, were unconstitutional.
The demonstrations were largely peaceful but there was some looting of shops and attacks by hooded protesters against public transport and buses. Authorities at the time imposed curfews in the cities of Bogota and Cali."

PARIS (Reuters) - France heads to the polls on Sunday for local elections, but the rapid acceleration of the coronavirus across the country has led to officials fearing the vote could see mass abstentions with some politicians demanding a last minute postponement.
Voters are set to choose mayors for 35,000 town halls and almost half a million councillors in a vote overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak and by growing public scepticism about traditional politics in France.
Authorities said on Saturday that 91 people had been killed by the virus and more than 4,500 were infected, including 300 who were in intensive care.
That prompted Prime Minister Edouard Philippe on Saturday evening to shut most shops, restaurants and entertainment facilities from midnight and urge people to stay at home.
The government had already decided to close schools from Monday and urged those over 70 stay home as much as possible.
However, Philippe confirmed that the election would proceed under strict health guidelines with people asked to keep their distance from one another.
""Macron tells us to stay at home for our own safety and then tells us it's ok to vote. It makes no sense. I won't vote,"" said 75-year-old Marie-Helene Corbellini.
President Emmanuel Macron decided to go ahead with the elections last week despite concerns that people may be more at risk at polling stations, saying it was vital the democratic system to continue functioning.
""We can fear (large) abstentions,"" Interior Minister Christophe Castaner told reporters during a visit to a polling station on Saturday. ""We understand the concerns of citizens who may not want to go to vote.""
Following Philippe's announcement, the top politicians from five of France's main regions called for the vote to be postponed and 17 doctors sent an open letter to Macron calling on him to reconsider.
Several political sources told Reuters there were also signs that poll clerks were pulling out of the vote. Whether at this late stage it would be possible to postpone the election is not clear, but Philippe left open the possibility that the second round on March 22 would not go ahead.
France's municipal elections traditionally see a higher turnout, with local politicians often viewed in a better light than their national counterparts as they are considered more in touch with what's going on in people's everyday lives.
An Elabe poll published on Friday showed that more than 60 percent of French people were worried about going to public places.
""There will be material to disinfect and wash hands. Everybody is being asked to come with their own pen to sign (voting forms),"" former Health Minister Agnes Buzyn, who is now running as the candidate for Macron's party, told Reuters.
""Measures are being taken so that people do not queue or are not too close to each other.""
The elections are an important test for Macron after a wave of protests over the last year, first from the ""yellow vests"" movement and now from opponents of his plans to reform the French pensions system. His party is not expected to do well."

PARIS (Reuters) - France will shut most shops, restaurants and entertainment facilities from midnight on Saturday and people should stay home as much as possible as the spread of coronavirus is accelerating, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe announced.
He was speaking at a news conference after the public health authority said 91 people had died in France and almost 4,500 were now infected.
""I have decided to close all non-indispensable locations, notably cafes, restaurants, cinemas, nightclubs and shops,"" he said. ""We must absolutely limit our movements.""
Exceptions to the shop ban will include food stores, pharmacies and petrol stations.
Philippe said the government had been left with no choice because too many people were still out in the streets and not sufficiently applying recently announced measures, including keeping a safe distance from each other.
That, he said, was helping accelerate the spread of the virus.
France has already ordered the closure of schools from Monday and had advised people over the age of 70 to stay home.
Philippe said public transport would remain open, but that the government expected companies to put into place systems for people to work from home beginning on Monday. 
However, he said local elections on Sunday would go ahead under strict sanitary conditions.
President Emmanuel Macron decided last week to go ahead with the elections, saying it was vital the democratic system continue to function, despite some criticism and concern over the possibility of people being infected at polling stations.
Jerome Salomon, the head of the French public health authority, said there had been a rapid increase in serious cases, including 300 people in intensive care, half of whom were below 60 years of age.
""To date, there has not been enough awareness by French women and men of the importance of their role in the face of the virus. It is urgent. Now is the time to change our behavior,"" he said.
""We must now do everything to delay, to slow down, to clip the curve of this epidemic.""
The government wants to avoid a situation where hospitals are overwhelmed by the number of serious cases. Neighboring Italy's health system has been severely strained by the coronavirus outbreak there.

""I am conscious of the efforts and sacrifices that we are asking, but I have faith that the French people will have the capacity to understand the seriousness of this moment,"" Philippe said.

KIGALI (Reuters) - Mauritania, Rwanda, Seychelles and Central African Republic confirmed their first coronavirus cases on Saturday, bringing to 23 the number of African countries that have reported positive tests for the virus.
Moving swiftly to contain its spread, Rwanda, Senegal, Madagascar, Mauritius, Morocco and Kenya announced tougher control measures, including bans on public gatherings, halting flights and closing schools and universities.
Three days after the World Health Organization (WHO) described the outbreak as a pandemic, there is concern among health specialists about the ability of some African nations to meet the logistical and financial challenges posed by the fast-spreading virus.
Borders are porous and many nations have extremely poor health infrastructure. Some countries, like Somalia, are fighting insurgencies while others, such as South Sudan, have high levels of malnutrition.
But governments are implementing preventative steps to try to keep the virus at bay.
""To prevent the outbreak entering in Madagascar, all flights connecting Madagascar to Europe are suspended for 30 days,"" Madagascar President Hery Rajaonarimampianina said in a statement.
Madagascar, one of the world's poorest nations where malnutrition is rife and outbreaks of deadly diseases are common, will also suspend air links to the nearby islands of La Reunion and Mayotte, he said.
The East African nation of Rwanda, which registered its first coronavirus case on Saturday, announced hours later that schools and universities would be closed for two weeks starting from Monday.
The Health Ministry also called for all places of worship to close their doors and for large gatherings such as weddings and sport events to be postponed.
In West Africa, Senegal announced schools and universities would stop classes and canceled all religious festivals. So far, Senegal has reported 21 cases.
The United Nations said that as of Friday, 39 countries had closed schools worldwide, affecting more than 420 million children and young people.
Other nations suspended flights.
Authorities in Kenya, which confirmed its first case on Friday, banned all major public events and said they would restrict foreign travel. Some private schools said they would close down starting next week.
Kenya is East Africa's richest economy, the regional headquarters for many multinationals and a major regional transit hub.
In North Africa, Morocco suspended flights from 21 countries on Saturday. So far, Morocco has confirmed 13 cases.
Most cases reported on the continent so far are foreigners or locals who traveled abroad. Rapid testing and quarantines have been put in place to limit transmission."

OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada's most populous province of Ontario, which has reported more than 100 new coronavirus cases, on Saturday said it would limit testing for the respiratory illness until it can guarantee a more steady supply of swabs.
""There is in an increased global demand for viral nasopharyngeal swabs due to COVID-19,"" Public Health Ontario said on its Web site. ""In an effort to ensure swabs are available where most needed, the Public Health Laboratory is limiting the volume of swabs supplied.""
On Friday, Canada ramped up its fight against the coronavirus outbreak, with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urging Canadians against all foreign travel during a news conference held outside his home, where he is in quarantine after his wife, Sophie, tested positive for the disease.
Canada also said those who return from abroad should isolate themselves for two weeks. The foreign ministry urged Canadians to return home on commercial flights ""while they remain available"".
Travis Kann, spokesman for Ontario's minister of health, said the province is prioritizing tests for people who do not have any history of travel since everyone who has been outside the country is expected to self-isolate upon return.
""We expect to expand the testing once we're confident in stable supply, and so we're working, obviously, with our manufacturing and supply chain partners,"" he said. ""It's our hope that we procure them as quickly as possible.""
Ontario has seen about half of the more than 220 cases recorded nationally. With a case on Prince Edward Island confirmed on Saturday, eight of Canada's 10 provinces have reported cases. Canada has had one death.
British Columbia's chief medical officer Bonnie Henry also said on Saturday testing would be more limited, also because of the new self-isolation guidelines for international travelers.
""We don't need to test everyone who's been outside of the country even if they're mildly ill,"" Henry said in an televised news conference. She said there was no supply problem, but the limits would make sure ""those who need those tests get it"".
Both Ontario and British Columbia, after widespread reports of stockpiling, told people that they did not need to horde food because there are no supply problems.
U.S. President Donald Trump said he had a ""nice conversation"" with Trudeau on Saturday and ""to coordinate closely together on COVID-19"".
""Great to hear that his wonderful wife Sophie is doing very well,"" he added."

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Laura and Don Davis, two former passengers of a coronavirus-stricken ocean liner now quarantined on a California military base, have little to do to pass the time but watch TV, play cards and - they add half-jokingly - avoid arguments.
But more frustrating to the Modesto, California-based couple than the boredom, the stagnant indoor air, the lack of clean towels or their missing luggage has been what they describe as an almost complete lack of communication from their caretakers.
""We're not being given any information. We're being told next to nothing,"" Don Davis, 53, a retired California Highway Patrol officer, said during a FaceTime interview from the couple's second-floor room.
His wife, Laura, 51, a hospital intensive care unit nurse, said she was most appalled by a ""fiasco"" of haphazard germ-control measures she observed during their transit from the ship to the quarantine site at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and after their arrival there.
Overall, the two say their treatment has shown a lack of sympathy and competence on the part of their custodians.
Asked about the couple's complaints, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said in a statement that the quarantine operation ""raised many significant logistical challenges.""
She said HHS held a ""telephonic town hall"" with nearly 300 of those under quarantine on Friday night, and had assigned case managers to ""each of the guests to individually address their needs.""
""We recognize this has been a stressful experience and we remain dedicated to providing all the support we can do passengers,"" the spokeswoman said.
A base spokesman, Captain Matthew Gregory, said separately that the military was ""providing the facility to host the quarantine,"" and HHS and its Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are ""responsible for the care of those who are traveling through on their way home.""
The Davis couple were among some 2,400 passengers of the cruise ship Grand Princess whose vacation voyage to Hawaii ended in quarantine earlier this week after a coronavirus outbreak was detected aboard the vessel.
CRUISE GOES AWRY
The ship, also linked to a dozen coronavirus cases from an earlier cruise to Mexico, was barred last Wednesday, March 4, from returning to its home port in San Francisco when a number of passengers and crew reported flu-like symptoms.
Diagnostic kits were flown by helicopter to the ship, and 21 people aboard - mostly crew - tested positive. Federal, state and local officials then arranged for the Grand Princess to dock temporarily at the Port of Oakland.
It finally arrived on March 9, but the Davis couple did not get off the boat for two more days. Having packed, as instructed, just enough clothes and toiletries for 24 hours, Don and Laura Davis and his elderly parents shuttled on buses to Oakland International Airport. They ended up among 480 people flown to Miramar, near San Diego.
Laura Davis said it appeared that personnel working under the auspices of HHS and escorting them from the ship to the base were poorly trained and ill-equipped. She recounted seeing workers in full protection suits moving among the passengers, touching each one in succession, as well as their belongings, without changing gloves in between, as they should.
As of Friday, passengers were still wearing ""the same dirty, contaminated"" surgical-style face masks they were issued aboard the ship nine days earlier, she said, noting that as an ICU nurse she changes face masks every 30 minutes while on duty.
Her husband said that when they asked for fresh face masks, which they are required to wear whenever they answer the door or step outside, he was told the available supplies ""are for the emergency workers, not for us.""
'SANDPAPER' BLANKET
The room itself and packaged meals are adequate, but creature comforts are in short supply, the couple said. A single blanket with the texture of ""400-grit sandpaper"" was left in the closet for the two beds, Don Davis said. They scrounged a couple more but they were ""tissue-paper thin.""
What little instruction they have received is often contradictory. Initially ordered to remain confined to quarters for the first 48 hours of their stay, the Davis couple missed dinner on the second night, and breakfast the next day. Only when they called the front desk to inquire were they told they were supposed to come downstairs to retrieve their meals.
The couple said they were told they would be permitted some fresh air on the hotel grounds after 72 hours, but must keep their masks on while outdoors.
In the meantime, they said, the only information about their quarantine was provided in a packet of HHS material they were handed with the keys to their room upon arrival.
As of Friday, they had not been interviewed, examined or checked for fever. The last time their temperatures were taken was before getting off the airplane that flew them to Miramar, they said. No mention has been made of getting tested for coronavirus.
Showing no signs or symptoms of illness, the two said they have effectively been quarantined since March 5, when all passengers were directed to be confined to their cabins aboard the ship.
""This is 10 days locked in a room with windows that don't open and no fresh air,"" Laura Davis said, lamenting the lack of fresh clothes or access to laundry facilities.
Her husband said he found the social isolation to be especially challenging. ""It's very difficult not to be around people,"" he said. ""We miss our family. We miss our kids.""
Once avid cruise-goers, the couple agreed the ordeal had fundamentally altered their view of ocean liners.
""We'll most likely never getting on another cruise as long as we live,"" she said.

The government is ready to do all that is needed to secure the economy, which has been hit by business shutdowns due to the virus outbreak, and will seek to import medical equipment from China, Solberg told a news conference.
""We've decided to shut our airports, close our ports and implement extensive controls along our border,"" Solberg said.
Planes carrying Norwegian citizens will still be able to land in Norway, and the government is negotiating with Norwegian Air and SAS to bring nationals home, she said.
The transport of goods to and from Norway will also continue, she later added.
The Nordic country will implement extensive controls of its land entry points, but will not shut its 1,630-kilometre (1,000-mile) border with neighboring Sweden, she said.

Norway recorded its second and third deaths linked to coronavirus on Saturday, Norwegian news agency NTB said. The official number of infected persons has risen to around 950.

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain plans to put its 47 million inhabitants under partial lockdown from Monday as part of a 15-day state of emergency plan to combat the coronavirus, a draft of an official decree seen by Reuters showed. 
The government will say all Spaniards must stay home except to buy food, go to the pharmacy, to the hospital, or to work or for other emergencies, the draft discussed on Saturday by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and his ministers showed.
Bars, restaurants, conference centers and all leisure and sports activities - including cinemas, theaters, swimming pools or soccer grounds - will be shut down.
A source with knowledge of the talks said the measures that are part of the lockdown could change in Saturday's cabinet talks.
All public transport would be curtailed, the draft showed, with airline, train, bus and boat operators told they need to cut their services by at least half and that any plane, train, bus or other means of transport can only be a third full.
The draft decree does not, however, foresee closing the country's borders.
Employers would have the obligation to let their workers work remotely and judicial proceedings will be suspended. 
Spain's Interior Ministry would control all police forces, including local and regional ones, under the 15-day emergency.
The health and transport ministries would also have nationwide reach, taking over some local or regional powers, according to the draft, which Catalan and Basque leaders immediately criticized.
Spain is the second hardest-hit country in Europe after Italy, with 193 deaths and 6,250 cases so far, public broadcaster TVE said, well up from 120 deaths reported on Friday.
The draft says the lockdown will begin on Monday at 8 a.m. (0700 GMT) while all other measures will enter into force as soon as the decree is published in the official journal.
The government did not comment on the details of the leaks, also reported in Spanish media, but said that only the final version will be valid.
ECONOMIC MEASURES
With schools shut across Spain and a first package of economic steps announced on Thursday, the government had also been expected to announce economic and social measures on Saturday to mitigate the impact of the fight against the coronavirus.
But ministers failed to agree in a seven-hour cabinet meeting on Saturday on what these should be, a source close to the negotiations told Reuters. The source added that the government would aim to agree on the measures on Tuesday. 
A news conference with Sanchez, initially announced for 1300 GMT, was delayed and was now scheduled for 1900 GMT.
The draft decree would also allow the government to ration supplies and requisition factories and buildings.
It did not detail what the sanctions would be for breaching the lockdown or other aspects of the state of emergency.
Earlier in the day, authorities in Madrid urged people to stay home, Madrid and the southern city of Seville announced the cancellation of hugely popular Holy Week celebrations and shops in several regions had already shut down.
Sanchez's leftwing government took few steps at first to impose tough measures and changed tack only this week. The opposition has criticized the government for letting events like International Women's Day marches go ahead a week ago. 
National and regional authorities have said they reacted appropriately, taking stronger measures when the number of cases started soaring on Monday. 

In an increasingly deserted capital city, posters put up by the city authorities read: ""The best option to prevent the propagation of the virus is to stay at home.""

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. hospitals, gearing up for a large surge in patients as the new coronavirus spreads throughout the country, are reaching out to temporary staff agencies and exploring other ways to maintain workforce levels as school closures add to pressure on doctors and nurses.
""The biggest issue right now is we need to plan for a logarithmic increase in patient numbers,"" Dr. Jason Persoff, assistant director of emergency preparedness at UCHealth, Colorado's largest health system. ""We are learning a lot from what happened in Washington state and in Italy ... there are a lot of issues with childcare.""
He said UCHealth is preparing for as many as 20 percent of its regular staff not being able to work at one time or another throughout the outbreak - the ultimate dimensions of which remain unknown.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday reported 1,629 cases of coronavirus, including 41 deaths.
U.S. hospitals have been advised by some statisticians to expect as many as 96 million coronavirus cases in the next few months.
As of Friday afternoon, at least 21,900 U.S. kindergarten through high schools have been closed or are scheduled to close, affecting at least 15 million students, according to trade publication Education Week. There are 132,853 public and private schools in the United States and almost 50.8 million students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.
""It used to be you could have grandma and grandpa step in and watch the kids. But it turns out grandma and grandpa are the most vulnerable population for this virus,"" Dr. Persoff said. He said some employees have begun pooling nannies and babysitters, and that could become more formalized if needed.
COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, is a highly contagious respiratory illness. Around 5 percent of infected individuals can develop life-threatening symptoms that require extended hospitalization. The elderly and people with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, are most at risk.
""One of the larger concerns that we have is school closures ... that could have a significant effect on staffing,"" Jeff Smith, chief operating officer at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where the public school system announced on Friday plans to close for two weeks.
He said Cedars is working with staffing agencies to try to make sure its two hospitals have access to temporary nurses and other staff if necessary.
Healthcare professionals are already in high demand. The Association of American Medical Colleges has projected a shortage of up to 122,000 physicians by 2032, and some studies estimate a shortage of more than 200,000 nurses over a similar period.
Colorado's UCHealth has not reached the point where it needs to bring in outside workers, but is looking at ""creative options,"" such as asking nursing students to work at a hospital or repurposing staff from other areas for patient needs, Dr. Persoff said.
""For single-parent households this is a crisis situation ... at the same time we are messaging that it is all hands on deck,"" he said.
In San Diego, where the public school system is set to close on Monday, Scripps Health has contingency staffing plans that could include shutting down some auxiliary clinics in order to move nurses to other facilities, Chris Van Gorder, the hospital group's chief executive, told Reuters.
""We have a largely female workforce,"" he explained. ""In a disaster situation, we would usually set up daycare for our employees, but we can’t do that with this situation.""
Aya Healthcare, which fills short-term nursing assignments, on its website said it is partnering with healthcare facilities across the country, but most of its over 10,000 assignments do not currently involve COVID-19.
The staffing agency explains that some hospitals have already had to quarantine staff who may have had contact with coronavirus patients. ""These hospitals now have needs to backfill core staff ... and are offering higher compensation rates,"" it says."

Putin in January unveiled a major shake-up of Russian politics and a constitutional overhaul, which the Kremlin billed as a redistribution of power from the presidency to parliament.
But Putin, 67, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for two decades as either president or prime minister, made a dramatic appearance in parliament on Tuesday to back a new amendment that would allow him to ignore a current constitutional ban on him running again in 2024.
His intervention raised the prospect of him serving another two six-year consecutive terms after 2024, though the Kremlin points out that Putin has not yet said whether he will run again in 2024.
The Kremlin said in a statement on Saturday that Putin had signed off on the constitutional changes after they were approved by both house of the country's parliament and by regional parliaments. 
The constitutional court must now rule whether the changes are legal ahead of a planned nationwide vote on the shake-up due on April 22. 
OVD-Info, a monitoring group, said that police had detained around 50 people in Moscow on Saturday protesting against Putin's plan to change the constitution. 

Footage showed riot police bundling protesters into buses near the headquarters of the FSB security service in central Moscow. They had been lining up to take turns to hold single-person protest pickets.

The Palestinian Authority's Religious Affairs Ministry asked Palestinians to worship at home.
""In light of the Health Ministry's recommendation to minimize contact between people and to reduce gatherings as much as possible we call upon our Muslim people in Palestine to hold their prayers at home,"" a ministry statement said. 
In Ramallah, a prayer leader reciting the Muslim call to prayer at one mosque in the early evening added the words: ""Pray at home, pray at home.""
According to Palestinian health officials, 38 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the West Bank, where the Palestinians have limited self rule under the Palestinian Authority. None have been reported in the densely-populated Gaza Strip, which is controlled by the Islamist Hamas group.
The Hamas-led government said it was closing Gaza's border crossings with Israel and Egypt for travel, excluding life-threatening cases that required medical treatment outside the enclave. Gatherings would be limited to 100 people and schools were to remain shut through March. 
Citing security reasons, Israel and Egypt keep the coastal Gaza Strip under a blockade with tight control of movements over their border land crossings.
Religious authorities have so far kept Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque, which is Islam's third holiest site, open for prayers.
The Jordan-appointed council that oversees Islamic sites on Jerusalem's sacred compound has kept it open for Friday prayers, encouraging faithful to congregate on the 35-acre complex's outdoor grounds rather than inside its covered shrines.
The Waqf council reassured worshippers in a statement this week that the entire compound, including its golden Dome of the Rock shrine, was being ""sterilised continuously.""
Muslim faithful believe the site to be where the Prophet Mohammad ascended to heaven. Jews revere it as the site of the Jewish temples of antiquity. It is one of the most sensitive venues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.
In Israel, where 164 coronavirus cases have been confirmed, gatherings have been limited to 100 people. Some religious authorities in the Holy Land, including the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, have moved to implement crowd controls at places of worship.
Muslim majority countries have introduced a range of measures to try to halt the infection. 
Egypt will suspend schools and universities for two weeks starting on March 15. Among Gulf Arab states, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait taking the most drastic decisions by cancelling all international flights.
Attendance at Friday prayers is generally mandatory for able-bodied men in Islam, but Riyadh said those under quarantine and those afraid of being infected or infecting others need not attend. 
Pakistan has shut its schools and land borders and decided to limit international flights and discourage large gatherings.

Morocco, which so far has 17 cases of the virus, has suspended all soccer matches, closed schools, halted flights with nine countries and canceled gatherings of more than 50 people.
French television stations and social media showed hundreds of people at Marrakesh airport with no flights available and nowhere to go.
""To our compatriots stranded in Morocco: new flights are being organized to allow you to return to France. I am asking the Moroccan authorities to ensure that everything necessary is done as soon as possible,"" President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter.

Education Minister Imad al-Azab told a news conference on Saturday schools would be closed until April 2 as authorities monitor for the virus, saying it was ""not possible"" for the government to conceal infections.
Damascus said on Friday that all scientific, cultural, social and sporting events would be halted, and many public institutions would be closed or staffed at 40% of normal levels and operate during reduced hours, state news agency SANA said.
The Health Ministry said the steps were ""precautionary"" and intended to raise the health sector's readiness to control the virus should it be detected.
The government went further on Saturday, postponing to May 20 parliamentary elections previously slated for April 13. A top religious council, meanwhile, said Friday prayers at mosques would be suspended until April 4.
Britain-based war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said Syrian doctors had detected cases of the virus in Damascus and at least three other provinces but were under orders to keep quiet. Azab denied this.
""There are some saying that there are infections being hidden, but no government nor the ministry of health can cover up a disease,"" he said. ""If a disease is somewhere it wants to spread, so it's very hard to hide it.""
Pakistani health officials said on Tuesday that at least five of their country's cases originated from patients traveling to Pakistan from Syria via Qatar. 
It was not immediately clear whether the infections could have originated in Qatar, where cases have risen to 337, the highest among the Gulf Arab states.
Syria is one of just three countries in the Middle East that have yet to announce a confirmed coronavirus case along with Libya and Yemen. The three nations could face a daunting challenge to contain an outbreak after years of war that have ravaged their health care systems.
Syria had already suspended flights to and from several countries hit by the virus including Iran, with which it has extensive ties.

Iranian militias back Damascus in its nine-year war and Syrians flock to Iranian holy sites such as Qom, where Iran first detected the virus.

LONDON (Reuters) - The British government will ban mass gatherings from next week in an attempt to curb the coronavirus outbreak, an escalation of its crisis plan that critics had said was too relaxed.
Health authorities in England announced on Saturday a further 10 deaths caused by coronavirus, almost doubling the number of fatalities in Britain since Friday.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson has so far resisted pressure to take some of the stringent measures adopted by other European countries to slow the spread of the virus.
""Ministers are working with the chief scientific adviser and chief medical officer on our plan to stop various types of public events, including mass gatherings, beginning next week,"" a government source said.
Legislation would be published next week to give the government powers to deal with the outbreak, including to stop mass gatherings and compensate organizations, the source said.
Some organizations have moved ahead of the government in terms of limiting public gatherings. On Friday, England's soccer Premier League suspended all matches until April 4 and the London Marathon was postponed by its organizers.
Queen Elizabeth, who is 93, canceled some public engagements for next week due to the coronavirus outbreak, Buckingham Palace said on Friday.
Johnson postponed for a year local and mayoral elections in England that had been due to take place in May.
As of Saturday, 21 people had died after testing positive for COVID-19 in Britain.
""All 10 individuals were in the at-risk groups,"" Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, said in a statement.
""I understand this increase in the number of deaths linked to COVID-19 will be a cause for concern for many. The public should know every measure we are taking is seeking to save lives and protect the most vulnerable.""
By comparison, on Friday Italy said its death toll from COVID-19 rose to 1,266 and France reported an increase to 79.
Britain's health ministry said the number of confirmed positive tests for coronavirus in the country rose to 1,140 on Saturday, a 43% increase from the figure of 798 given on Friday.
U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday that the United States might include Britain in a coronavirus travel ban that it has imposed on other European countries.

BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romania's centrist Prime Minister Ludovic Orban won a parliamentary vote of confidence by a large margin as expected, on Saturday, with all parties seeking to end a political stalemate and focus on reining in the spread of coronavirus.
President Klaus Iohannis asked the interim premier to form a government on Friday.
Cabinet ministers quarantined themselves for two weeks, after coming into contact with a coronavirus-infected lawmaker.
""It's been 286 votes for the government out of 309 cast ballots and 23 MPs voted against it,"" a senior ruling party deputy told Reuters.
Lawmakers toppled Orban's minority Liberal government at the beginning of February, but he has continued running the country on an interim basis with limited powers.
Since then, rival parties have been jockeying for position before municipal and parliament elections in June, respectively in November this year.
But the onset of the coronavirus, which has so far infected 102 people in the European Union member, meant Orban's nomination passed very easily through parliament - restoring full powers to his government to fight the outbreak.
""Our party has taken full responsibility at these difficult times, and now, with a full power government, I'm confident we will manage to rein in coronavirus more resolutely,"" Orban said in an online speech.

On Saturday, Romania heightened restrictions enforced so far, banning cultural, scientific, religious activities involving more than 50 people in a closed space from 100.

PARIS (Reuters) - French security forces fired teargas and clashed with anti-government ""Yellow Vest"" protesters who were demonstrating in Paris on Saturday in defiance of a ban on mass gatherings that aims to prevent the spread of coronavirus. 
In a televised address to the nation on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron announced school closures and urged people to avoid close contact for fear of propagating the virus that has killed 79 people in France and infected more than 3,600.
The government on Friday banned all gatherings of more than 100 people. Paris police had already turned down requests for protesters to convene at sensitive sites, including the Champs Elysees where there were violent clashes between security forces and protesters almost a year ago to the day.
""It's Saturday, demonstration day. Some people think that the coronavirus won't touch them and refuse to respect the advice,"" said a riot police officer in front of a heavily armed vehicle blocking the road that leads to the presidential palace.
Central Paris had earlier been in lockdown, with police searching bags over concerns the protesters would seek to return to the Champs Elysees. The police cordon had been eased by lunchtime. 
Hundreds of protesters, some wearing protective medical masks, had marched early on Saturday from Montparnasse train station, chanting anti-Macron slogans. By mid-afternoon, tension had grown. 
A police source put the numbers at about 400.
Riot police used teargas and stun grenades in attempts to disperse the crowds and clashed with individuals as about 2,000 security forces were deployed across the city to manage the situation. 
""The security forces are currently pushing back a portion of the cortege composed of determined individuals, who are trying to continue in a direction that has not been declared,"" the Paris police said on Twitter, adding that 25 people had been arrested. 
The protesters, named after the high-visibility jackets they wear, were holding a 70th consecutive Saturday of action. The movement emerged late in 2018, triggered by fuel tax rises, and swelled into a revolt against Macron's government.
While protests are now much smaller, anger at Macron's government remains and Saturday's demonstration served as a remainder to the president a day before local elections.
Sunday's vote is an important test for Macron, with opponents now particularly angered by his plans to reform the French pensions system. His party is not expected to do well.
""We had to come and mark the day to tell Macron that we're still here and that we won't accept his pension reform,"" said one pensioner. 
Voters will begin choosing mayors for 35,000 town halls and almost half a million councillors on Sunday in elections overshadowed by the coronavirus outbreak, which is expected to hit turnout.
Macron decided to go ahead with the elections despite concerns over the spread of the illness, which have led the government to shut schools and universities, suspend major sporting events, curtail public transport and close tourism attractions.

Under the unprecedented lockdown, the government has forbidden all non-essential travel, telling people to stay at home. Airlines have slashed services to Italy and the Transport Ministry said on Saturday that night train services would be suspended.
Schools, restaurants and most shops have been closed but so far, factories, offices and other workplaces have been allowed to remain open.
Supermarkets and bakeries have also been open but entry is controlled to limit the number of people inside at any one time and long queues of shoppers waiting outside have become a feature of daily life. Online delivery services are booked out.
Business lobby Confindustria said the measures would allow factories to stay open and key sectors including food and pharmaceuticals to keep working and ""prepare for economic recovery as soon as we get through this"".

Italy's economy, already on the brink of recession, is expected to be heavily impacted by the crisis with sectors from tourism to fashion or manufacturing seeing orders collapse since the virus first appeared in the country in a small town close to Milan last month.

The UAE civil aviation authority also announced a suspension of all flights from and to Lebanon, Turkey, Syria and Iraq, starting March 17 until further notice.
Dubai, the UAE's regional business and transit hub, said it was cancelling all events planned in March and asked hotels not to host wedding celebrations during this period.
A number of shops have voluntarily closed in Dubai to contribute to the containment efforts.
Gulf Arab states have stepped up measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak, with Saudi Arabia and Kuwait taking the most drastic decisions by cancelling all international flights.
Saudi Arabia has suspended all international flights for two weeks, starting on Sunday, while Kuwait did not specify a period for the lockdown which started on Saturday.
The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), a group of six oil-rich Arab monarchies which also includes Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, has reported nearly 850 coronavirus cases, mostly of people who had traveled to Iran or who were contaminated by them.
No death has been reported in the GCC, unlike in Iran where the death toll rose by nearly 100 on Saturday to 611, out of a total of 12,729 infections.
Oman, which has the lowest number of infections in the region at 20, said on Saturday all schools and educational institutions would close for a month, a precaution taken by other GCC states.
Saudi Arabia has canceled all sports events until further notice and decided to close all sports centers, state media said.
The UAE will suspend all visa issuance, except to foreign diplomats, starting on March 17, the official news agency WAM reported, citing immigration authorities.
Qatar will stop issuing visas upon arrival to a number of European nationalities from Sunday, the government communication office said.
Qatar confirmed 17 new infections on Saturday, bringing the total diagnosed with the disease to 337, the highest in the GCC, followed by Bahrain with 211 and Kuwait with 104.
Gulf health authorities have intensified pleas to the population to avoid gatherings and are carrying out campaigns to sanitize public places.
Police in Kuwait used drones fitted with loudspeakers to urge people on the streets to avoid gathering.

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Several Iraqi air defense servicemen were critically wounded on Saturday as multiple rockets hit a military base which houses U.S.-led coalition troops, in the second such strike in a week, the Iraqi military said.
The U.S.-led coalition said three of its troops and two Iraqi soldiers were wounded in the attack.
Iraq's Joint Operations Command said 33 Katyusha rockets were launched near a section of the Taji base which houses coalition troops. It said the military found seven rocket launchers and 24 unused rockets in the nearby Abu Izam area.
The military said it would arrest those responsible.
No group has claimed responsibility for the attack which, unlike recent similar attacks, took place in daylight hours.
An Iraqi colonel inside the base had earlier told Reuters he heard rockets hit the site and sirens blaring.
A similar rocket attack on Wednesday on Taji, 20 km (12 miles) north of Baghdad, killed two U.S. troops and a British soldier, prompting Washington to launch retaliatory air strikes on Thursday which killed six Iraqis.
The United States blamed the Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah Iraqi militia for Wednesday's attack and said its air strikes targeted the group. But the official Iraqi casualty figures showed three Iraqi soldiers, two policemen, one civilian and no militiamen were killed.
The Iraqi military said on Saturday that neither the United States nor other foreign forces should use the latest attack as a pretext to take military action without Iraq's approval, and should instead hasten to implement a parliamentary resolution expelling them.
Iraq condemned the U.S. air strikes on Friday, saying they were a violation of its sovereignty and targeted aggression against its regular armed forces.
Longstanding antagonism between the United States and Iran has mostly played out on Iraqi soil in recent months.
Iranian-backed paramilitary groups have regularly rocketed and shelled bases in Iraq which host U.S. forces and the area around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.
The United States has in turn conducted several strikes inside Iraq, killing top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and Kataib Hezbollah founder Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in January.

Many Iraqis say it is they who suffer most from U.S.-Iranian tensions and some, including caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, have called for U.S. troops to withdraw. Parliament voted to expel foreign troops in January.

BAMAKO (Reuters) - A Canadian woman and an Italian man kidnapped in Burkina Faso 15 months ago have been freed and appear to be in good health, the United Nations' peacekeeping mission in neighboring Mali said on Saturday. 
Edith Blais and Luca Tacchetto went missing while traveling through Burkina Faso in December 2018. Jihadist groups with links to al Qaeda and Islamic State which are active in the region have kidnapped Westerners in the past. 
It is not known who was responsible for the couple's abduction or if any ransom was paid. 
Olivier Salgado, a spokesman for the U.N. mission MINUSMA, told Reuters that the pair were found by peacekeepers near the northern Mali city of Kidal on Friday. They were flown to the capital Bamako on Saturday. 
Salgado shared photos of a smiling Blais and Tacchetto wearing U.N. human rights t-shirts and sweatpants at the U.N. base in Kidal where they spent the night and later met the MINUSMA head. 
Security has deteriorated in recent years across Africa's Sahel region, a semi-arid band beneath the Sahara Desert, where hundreds of civilians were killed last year by the jihadists and ethnic militias. 
Western powers like former colonial master France and the United States have poured money and troops to combat the jihadists, but the violence has continued to get worse.
According to Menastream, a risk consultancy that monitors jihadist activity, 10 foreign nationals from nine different countries, including France and Australia, are still being held in captivity in the region. 
Canadian national Kirk Woodman was kidnapped in January 2019 from a mining site where he was working in Burkina Faso and found dead later the same week. While Islamic State claimed responsibility, security sources told Reuters they believed he actually died during a botched attempt by a criminal gang to sell him on to another group.

The Taliban promised to open talks with the Afghan government as part of an accord reached with the United States last month to end 18 years of U.S. involvement in war in Afghanistan.
The militants say the agreement requires the government to release 5,000 prisoners before talks begin. The government says the talks must begin and violence subside before it will free all the detainees.
Earlier this week President Ashraf Ghani agreed to free 1,500 prisoners on Saturday with plans to release the remainder once conditions were met.
""We are ready to start the process the way it is described in the presidential decree but we won't release anyone if there is no guarantee that they will not return to fighting,"" said Javid Faisal, spokesman for the Afghan government's national security advisor. ""The Taliban have to show flexibility ""
The Taliban are refusing to accept a partial release of the prisoners or any conditions on their release, its spokesman told Reuters on Friday.
""Our stance on the prisoners' release is crystal clear. They should be released without any pre-condition the way it is mentioned on the US-Taliban peace agreement,"" Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters by phone. ""We have not agreed to any extra dialogue or conditions.""
Officials and experts say the issue poses a major hurdle to starting peace talks, alongside an additional challenge of rising discord between Ghani and his political rival Abdullah Abdullah.
Both men say they are the country's rightful leader. Their intense feuding is leading to the risk of parallel governments being formed and is hindering the appointment of a delegation to negotiate with the Taliban."

While infections continue to climb around the world, in mainland China the number of new cases is falling.

Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those - all in the virus epicenter of Hubei province - were locally transmitted.
Hubei has now seen new infections fall for nine straight days. All four of the new cases on Friday, down from five a day earlier, were in provincial capital Wuhan.
The flu-like virus has infected 80,824 people in mainland China, the commission said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - The number of new coronavirus cases imported into mainland China from overseas surpassed the number of locally transmitted new infections for the first time on Friday, data released by the National Health Commission showed on Saturday.
Mainland China had 11 new confirmed cases on Friday, up from eight cases a day earlier, but only four of those - all in the virus epicentre of Hubei province - were locally transmitted.
The other seven - including four in the financial hub of Shanghai, one in the capital Beijing and two in the northwestern province of Gansu - were all detected in travellers coming into China from overseas, specifically Italy, the United States and Saudi Arabia, according to local authorities.
The numbers underscore how China, where the outbreak began in December, appears to now face a greater threat of new infections from outside its borders as it continues to slow the spread of the virus domestically.
A total of 95 cases have entered mainland China from overseas, the commission said. 
Hubei has now seen new infections fall for nine straight days. All four of the new cases on Friday, down from five a day earlier, were in provincial capital Wuhan.
The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 3,189 as of the end of Friday, up by 13 from the previous day. All of the latest deaths were in Hubei and 10 of them were in Wuhan.
To date, the flu-like virus has infected 80,824 people in mainland China, the commission said. Globally, more than 138,000 people have been infected and over 5,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements. 
As China's imported cases rise, the city of Tangshan, a steel-making hub in northern China's Hebei province, warned people entering the city - whether Chinese or overseas nationals - against trying to conceal their travel history.
People who do so will have to bear all treatment costs if they are later found to have contracted coronavirus, the Tangshan city government said in a statement. 
Of the newly imported Shanghai cases, three were Chinese people who worked in Italy and flew to Shanghai via Moscow, according to the city's municipal health commission, while the fourth was an Italian who flew in from Italy via Paris.
Italy, the first European Union member state to suspend flights to China in the wake of the outbreak, is the worst affected country in Europe, reporting a total 17,660 cases by Friday.
It also has a much higher fatality rate than most other countries, with 7% of those testing positive for the virus dying.
Chinese President Xi Jinping spoke to his Italian counterpart Sergio Mattarella over the phone to offer his ""sincere condolences"" to the Italian people over the crisis, CCTV reported on Saturday. 

Xi also held phone calls with the presidents of two other severely hit countries, Iran and South Korea, again expressing condolences, the state broadcaster said.

Colombia's state of emergency will last until May 30 and allow the government to take quick and exceptional steps relating to the outbreak, such as directing financial resources.
Venezuela reported its first two cases of coronavirus on Friday amid concerns that the country, which is facing a social and economic crisis, is not prepared to confront the pandemic. 
In Venezuela, hyperinflation and a six-year recession under President Nicolas Maduro have caused millions to flee the country. Some 1.7 million Venezuelans have fled to Colombia in recent years. 
Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez blasted Duque's decision to close the border between the two countries as ""an act of gross irresponsibility.""

""Life in prison was difficult, but I have no regret at all... as this is a necessary price to pay for fighting for democracy,"" Chan said, chanting ""I want universal suffrage"" with dozens of supporters.
""I think after the last few months, Hong Kong people understand more why we had to use civil disobedience to fight for freedom.""
A retired sociologist and one of the three leaders of the pro-democracy movement, Chan was found guilty last year of conspiracy to commit public nuisance for his role in planning and mobilizing supporters during the 79-day protest that brought parts of the Chinese-ruled city to a standstill.
The Umbrella protests staged peaceful sit-ins, blocking major roads in the Asian financial hub, in a push for full democracy, although they failed to wrest concessions from Beijing.
The Umbrella movement got its name because activists used umbrellas to shield themselves from tear gas and pepper spray.
The symbolic umbrella tactic re-emerged in 2019 during the sometimes violent anti-government protests triggered by a now withdrawn extradition bill that would have allowed criminal suspects to be sent to the mainland for trial in Communist Party controlled courts.
Many protesters last year said the 2014 movement prepared them for further fights for democracy.
Chan said he understood why the young protesters resorted to ""intense actions"" in the last few months because they felt the government was no long fair and just.
Chan, 61, said he plans to visit the young protesters arrested during the recent unrest and share with them his experience in how to mentally deal with the charges they face.
Hong Kong returned to China from British rule in 1997 under a “one country, two systems” formula that guarantees freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland but many activists accuse Beijing of tightening its grip on the city and eroding those freedoms.
Beijing denies meddling and blames the West for fomenting unrest."

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who met with Donald Trump in the United States less than a week ago, will be retested for coronavirus following a negative test on Friday, Brazil's Estado de S.Paulo newspaper reported.
The test will be done early next week in order to rule out any chance the president has the virus, the newspaper said, without naming the source of the information. A representative for Bolsonaro's press office declined to comment.
Bolsonaro and a large Brazilian entourage, including cabinet ministers, met with Trump and other senior U.S. officials last weekend at Mar-a-Lago. One of the party, Bolsonaro's communications secretary Fabio Wajngarten, tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday and is in quarantine at his home.
Charge d'Affairs Nestor Forster Jr. at the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, who was also present at the Trump dinner, has also now tested positive, GloboNews television channel reported late on Friday.
Bolsonaro said earlier in the day that he had tested negative for coronavirus, in a post on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page.
""Tests negative for COVID-19 Mr President of the Republic Jair Bolsonaro,"" the post said, above an old image of Bolsonaro making an obscene local gesture in an apparent response to some media reports that a first test had been positive.
Estado de S.Paulo said Bolsonaro would remain isolated in quarantine at his official residence until the beginning of next week, citing an unnamed member of the president's medical staff who said Bolsonaro needed to be isolated for seven days from the time of being in contact with someone infected with the virus.
Bolsonaro's son Eduardo tweeted earlier on Friday that his test had come back negative. Defense Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva tested negative as well, the ministry said in a statement. 
The results for others in the Brazilian delegation, including Bolsonaro's wife Michelle and Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo, have not yet been published. 
However, Bolsonaro's lawyer, Karina Kufa, who was part of the delegation, tested positive, according to the O Globo newspaper. Senator Nelsinho Trad, who also formed part of the group, said late Friday that his test had also come back positive.
""Life continues normally, we have many challenges ahead and many problems to solve,"" Bolsonaro said outside his official residence after news of the negative test result.
He waved to supporters but said it was better not to shake their hands.
The testing of Bolsonaro and many in his inner circle has changed the president's tone on a virus that he dismissed on Tuesday as largely a ""fantasy.""
In a stern address to the nation on Thursday evening, Bolsonaro asked his supporters to call off marches planned for the weekend in order to avoid spreading the disease.
Brazil has confirmed 98 cases of the coronavirus, according to the Ministry of Health.
Fox News and a local Brazilian newspaper earlier reported Bolsonaro's initial test for coronavirus was positive.
""He tested negative full stop,"" Bolsonaro's son Eduardo later told Fox News. He did not directly answer a question as to whether a first test was positive.
Trump told reporters on Friday he would likely be tested ""fairly soon"" but denied this was related to his contact with Wajngarten, beside whom he was photographed at Mar-a-Lago.
""There was somebody that they say has it. I have no idea who he is, but I take pictures and it lasts for literally seconds,"" he said.

""I did sit with the president (Bolsonaro) for probably two hours, but he's tested negative, so that's good.""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - The United States should ""think twice"" before giving Malaysia back the money recovered from an anti-kleptocracy probe into state fund 1MDB, former prime minister Mahathir Mohamad said on Friday, as the party accused of graft at 1MDB was back in power. 
Mahathir, 94, abruptly resigned last month before being replaced by Muhyiddin Yassin, whose coalition includes the former ruling party United Malays National Organisation despite voters rejecting UMNO in the 2018 general election amid a backlash over the multi-billion dollar scandal at 1MDB.
The U.S. Department of Justice (DoJ) says over $4.5 billion was looted from 1MDB under UMNO prime minister Najib Razak, who is now on trial for allegedly receiving some of the stolen money.
The DoJ, in its biggest ever anti-kleptocracy case, has recouped about $1 billion from the seizure and sale of assets allegedly bought with 1MDB funds. 
The DoJ returned nearly $200 million to Malaysia in May, but a second transfer of about $240 million was delayed last month amid uncertainty following Mahathir’s resignation, sources have said.
Mahathir told Reuters the DoJ should re-consider its decision to send the money to Malaysia after the return of Najib's party to the government. 
""When we took over, the DoJ was willing to give it to us because we overthrew the people who stole the money,"" he said in an interview. 
""Now, the people who stole the money is going to get back the money they stole. I think the DoJ will have to think twice.""
At least six countries are investigating alleged graft and money laundering at 1MDB, founded by then-premier Najib in 2009. 
After an unexpected election victory in 2018, Mahathir reopened probes into 1MDB and Najib's involvement at the fund. 
Najib is facing five trials, the first of which - involving seven charges linked to $10 million misappropriated from a 1MDB unit - is expected to reach a verdict within months.
He has pleaded not guilty and says he was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials. Low, who has been charged in Malaysia and the United States, has consistently denied any wrongdoing. 
Najib told Reuters last week that he expected an atmosphere more conducive to a fair hearing now that Mahathir was out of power.

The case has also led to scrutiny of Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), which Malaysia has accused of misleading investors over bond sales totaling $6.5 billion that the bank helped raise for 1MDB. Three units of the bank have pleaded not guilty.

Top diplomats from the United States, European Union, Britain and Canada also walked out of the elections headquarters Friday in Georgetown, Guyana's capital, where the count was being held.
The March 2 election has been marred by accusations of fraud in favor of President David Granger, who is running against Irfaan Ali of the opposition People's Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party to lead the former British colony.
Guyana's Chief Justice Roxane George had blocked the electoral commission from declaring a winner in the vote and ruled on Wednesday that the country's largest electoral district, known as Region Four, must resume counting votes with independent observers.
The OAS said the head election official in Region Four concealed official poll results from each voting site against court instructions, giving ""credence to allegations that the numbers being tabulated do not correspond with the numbers on the statements of poll.""
Results from Region Four and thus the election as a whole ""will not be credible and a president sworn in on the basis of those results will not be considered legitimate,"" the diplomats from the United States, EU, Canada and Britain said.
The diplomats also cited concerns about ""intimidation tactics"" used against officials who championed a clean count.
The OAS said the opposition's vote count was ""vastly different"" than those reported by the Region Four election head.
The dispute in which both parties claim victory led to violent demonstrations last weekend in which one protester was shot dead.
The vote will decide who is in power during the early years of an oil boom set to transform the economy of the poor country, which is beset by tensions between black Guyanese and Indo-Guyanese."

The event, to be held in Christchurch on Sunday, was expected to attract a large crowd, with many traveling from around New Zealand and from overseas.
“This is a pragmatic decision. We’re very saddened to cancel, but in remembering such a terrible tragedy, we shouldn’t create the risk of further harm being done,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement.

The planned strike would be the first one this year after a series of protests and three strikes in the final two months of 2019.
""The strike on March 25 is going ahead. However, we are asking Colombians not to leave their houses as there will be no transport. We will hold cacerolazos from houses every two hours, from eight in the morning until eight at night,"" Diogenes Orjuela, head of the Central Union of Workers (CUT), told Reuters.
Cacerolazos are traditional Latin American protests in which demonstrators bang pots and pans.
""We will hoist Colombian flags decorated with black tape to condemn the killings and violence. The strike will last 24 hours and we are not going to break protocols because safety is paramount,"" Orjuela said, referring to the health emergency declared by the government to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
Colombia's government on Thursday suspended public events involving more than 500 people to combat the coronavirus. Health authorities have reported the infection of 16 people in the Andean country.
Talks between the government and protest organizers have not been successful in reaching an agreement that would satisfy the protesters.
The protest leaders initially presented 13 demands across a wide range of economic and social issues, including measures to halt the killings of social activists, pressure Duque to properly implement the 2016 peace agreement with the demobilized FARC guerrillas and to demand the dissolution of the anti-riot police unit that has been accused of using excessive force.
In December, the protest leaders widened the number of demands to 104. The government said many of the demands, which involve economic, fiscal, environmental and business themes, were unconstitutional.
The demonstrations were largely peaceful but there was some looting of shops and attacks by hooded protesters against public transport and buses. Authorities at the time imposed curfews in the cities of Bogota and Cali."

The attack inspired more online hate and polarizations, experts have said.
Twitter would partner with the University of Otago's National Center for Peace and Conflict Studies in the project that looks at ways to counter ""digitally amplified polarizations"", the social media firm said in a statement this week.
By looking at Twitter data before, during, and after the attack the research will study how conversations can be used to ""to promote tolerance and inclusion instead of division and exclusion,"" it said.
Twitter and other tech firms like Facebook and YouTube signed up last year to a global initiative called ""Christchurch Call"" launched by New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern that aimed to bring together governments and companies to eradicate extremist material being shared online.
Ardern said at a news conference on Friday that 48 countries, six tech companies and three organizations have joined the initiative, and the online distribution of violent videos in recent attacks have been ""far, far diminished"" due to coordination between the group.
The Christchurch attack was live-streamed on Facebook for 17 minutes, and its copies were later shared on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook-owned Whatsapp and Instagram.
Millions of copies of the footage were later taken down but despite that videos of the attack still remain online, the Counter Extremism Project (CEP) said in a statement on Saturday.
CEP, a private group that monitors and reports extremist content online, said the video, clips of the video, and content celebrating the attack remain easily locatable on file hosting websites, chan-style message boards, and video streaming platforms.

WASHINGTON/GENEVA (Reuters) - President Donald Trump declared a U.S. national emergency over the quickly spreading coronavirus on Friday, opening the door to more government aid to combat a pathogen that has infected more than 138,000 people worldwide and left over 5,000 dead.
The impact of the coronavirus on everyday life deepened around the world. It was detected for the first time in several countries, with the World Health Organization (WHO) calling Europe the pandemic's current epicenter. More schools and businesses closed, the global sporting calendar was left in tatters, and people faced greater restrictions on where they could go.
""To unleash the full power of the federal government to this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency - two very big words,"" Trump said in remarks at the White House Rose Garden, adding that the U.S. situation could worsen and ""the next eight weeks are critical.""
Trump, whose action makes available $50 billion in federal aid to states and localities, had faced criticism from some experts for being slow and ineffective in his response to the crisis and playing down the threat.
The latest steps came two days after Trump announced travel restrictions blocking U.S. entry for most people from continental Europe. While Britain was among the countries exempted, Trump said on Friday that might change because infections there had risen ""precipitously.""
The president, who was photographed last Saturday at his private Florida club with a Brazilian official who has tested positive for the coronavirus, said he himself likely would be tested ""fairly soon,"" a reversal of his previous stance. But Trump, 73, said he did not plan to isolate himself, noting he was suffering no symptoms.
Travel bans have hammered airlines and travel companies worldwide, while financial markets have been hit by panic selling this week.
The three major U.S. stock indexes rallied more than 9% on Friday, rebounding from Wall Street's biggest daily drop since 1987. But the indexes were still about 20% below record highs hit in mid-February.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Europe now had more reported cases and deaths than the rest of world combined, apart from China, where the coronavirus originated but where new cases have slowed to a trickle. The WHO called the death toll reaching 5,000 globally ""a tragic milestone.""
The WHO's top emergency expert, Mike Ryan, said social distancing was a ""tried and tested method"" to slow the spread of a virus but ""not a panacea"" that would stop transmission.
""Blanket travel measures in their own right will do nothing to protect an individual state,"" Ryan said.
CULTURAL LANDMARKS
More cultural landmarks were shuttered to try to stop the spread of the virus. In Paris, the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre museum and the Moulin Rouge cabaret closed their doors. The Smithsonian museums in Washington were preparing to do so on Saturday and Broadway theaters in New York went dark.
The kissing of the Blarney Stone, one of Ireland's oldest tourist traditions, was suspended.
Central banks worldwide acted to shore up money markets after cratering share prices drove a rush for cash, hitting many regional currencies and threatening a surge in short-term borrowing costs.
In China, which bore the brunt of the economic fallout from the coronavirus in the first few months of 2020, authorities late on Friday cut banks' reserve requirements for the second time this year.
The U.S. Federal Reserve followed suit with $37 billion of Treasury bond purchases, accelerating the enhanced market liquidity measures announced on Thursday.
Japan's central bank pledged to buy 200 billion yen ($1.90 billion) of five- to 10-year Japanese government bonds and also inject an additional 1.5 trillion yen in two-week loans.
The European Union proposed a 37 billion euro ($41 billion)investment initiative as part of a package to cushion the bloc's economies from the coronavirus impact.
In Italy, which after China has been hardest hit by the respiratory illness, the death toll jumped by 250 to 1,266 in the last 24 hours, authorities said. The total number of cases also rose to 17,660 from a previous 15,113, despite draconian measures to restrict the movement of people.
In the northern region of Lombardy, at the heart of Italy's coronavirus epidemic, authorities asked for even stricter steps.
In hard-hit Iran, security forces will empty the streets in cities across the country, state television reported.
NEW COUNTRIES RECORD CASES
The virus continued its persistent march across the globe. Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Guinea all confirmed their first cases, giving the disease a foothold in 18 countries on the African continent.
Kosovo, Venezuela and Kazakhstan also confirmed their first cases, and Spain declared a state of emergency.
World leaders, sports stars and actors were among the tens of thousands of people hit by the virus. Golf's crown jewel, The Masters, England's top-flight soccer Premier League, and the Boston and London marathons joined the long list of elite sporting events to be canceled or postponed.
But sport's biggest showpiece, the Olympics, will proceed as planned, according to Tokyo organizers.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland advised its citizens on Friday to exercise a high degree of caution before deciding to travel to the rest of the European Union due to the spread of the coronavirus and restrictions other members states had put in place.
Ireland shut schools, universities and childcare facilities until at least March 29 on Friday and restricted mass gathering to slow the spread of the virus. The number of confirmed cases rose to 90 from 70 on Thursday.
Ireland had previously only urged against all travel to Italy and advised avoiding non-essential travel to China, Iran and Spain. The World Health Organization said on Friday that Europe had become the epicenter of the pandemic.
""In light of rapidly changing conditions and restrictions across a number of EU countries, my department is now advising people to exercise 'a high degree of caution' before deciding to travel to other EU States,"" Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said on Twitter. 
Coveney said in a separate tweet that the updated advice does not apply to neighboring Britain, a former EU member. Ireland shares an open border with the smaller British-run region of Northern Ireland, which has so far reported 29 cases.
Ireland's health service provision chief earlier said that the country's contingency plans to fight the coronavirus if the outbreak becomes significantly worse includes seeking additional bed capacity in hotels.
The Health Service Executive (HSE) had received ""significant offers"" from the hotel sector, Paul Reid told a news conference, adding that he did not envisage having to go to such lengths to boost its capacity.
The hospitality sector is operating below capacity since the collapse of travel as a result of the global pandemic.
The kissing of the County Cork's Blarney Stone, one of Ireland's oldest tourist traditions, was also suspended for the first time in its more than 200-year history on Friday due to the outbreak, the owners of Blarney Castle said in a statement.
On Monday, Ireland canceled all St. Patrick's Day parades which draw hundreds of thousands of revelers each March.

The new curbs in Ireland sent shoppers rushing to supermarkets for the second straight day despite government pleas not to panic buy and left large parts of Dublin deserted. Daily trips on public transport across the country were down 15-20% in recent days, the National Transport Authority said.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations said it will slash its staff presence at its New York headquarters for four weeks, starting Monday, after a Filipino diplomat became the first person at the 193-member world body known to have tested positive for the coronavirus.
The U.N. announcement on Friday came as host country the United States declared a national emergency over the fast-spreading virus.
U.N. staff will be available for essential services at the Manhattan campus, such as translation and security, but it was unclear whether the move would prompt meeting cancellations. The 15-member Security Council is due to meet every day next week on issues including Syria, North Korea and Libya.
""Our aim is twofold: reduce our physical presence at United Nations Headquarters; and continue delivering on our mandates,"" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres wrote in a letter to member states on Friday. 
""It is essential that we reduce social contact to a minimum and follow the clear instructions of the World Health Organization to minimize the risks of transmitting the infection,"" he said. 
The United Nations had already started implementing coronavirus prevention measures at its headquarters this week, including closing to the public, more regular cleaning and cancelling some meetings. 
U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said the number of people entering daily had fallen by half to about 5,300, between March 4 and March 11 and that there had been a steeper drop on Friday. 
Guterres said in his letter that staff not physically required to be in the building would work from home. 
""The United Nations remains open for business. But our work will be done from different locations, using different technologies,"" he wrote. 
The U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) also said on Friday that its New York headquarters - across the street from the main U.N. building - would close for four weeks and staff would work from home after three people showed flu-like symptoms. UNICEF said they had not been confirmed positive for the coronavirus.
A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday, according to a note sent to U.N. missions. Philippines acting U.N. Ambassador Kira Azucena said the mission was in lockdown and ""We are assuming that all of us have been infected.""
Several U.N. meetings planned for Friday were canceled in the wake of the diagnosis. 

The World Health Organization has described the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. The virus broke out in China's Wuhan city late last year and has so far infected more than 138,000 people from more than 130 countries and territories, killing more than 5,000, according to a Reuters tally.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday declared a national emergency over the fast-spreading coronavirus, opening the door to what he said was about $50 billion in federal aid to fight a disease he said could have an even greater impact on the country.
""It could get worse. The next eight weeks will be critical,"" Trump said.
Trump made the announcement at a Rose Garden news conference as he battled to show Americans that he is aggressively addressing the health crisis after appearing to play down the threat for weeks.
""To unleash the full power of the federal government in this effort today, I am officially declaring a national emergency. Two very big words. The action I am taking will open up access to up to $50 billion - a very important and a large amount for states and territories or localities in our shared fight against this disease,"" he said.
""Through talent or through luck, call it whatever you want, but through a very collective action and shared sacrifice, national determination, we will overcome the threat of the virus,"" Trump said.
Trump himself came into contact with a Brazilian official last Saturday who later tested positive for the coronavirus. The White House said on Thursday Trump was not exhibiting symptoms and had not been tested.
Trump, who has been heavily focused on hard-hit industries in making sure the U.S. economy is not devastated by a slowdown in consumer activity as a result of the virus, used much of his appearance on Friday to focus on potential victims.
He urged every state to set up emergency centers to help fight the coronavirus. “We’ll remove or eliminate every obstacle necessary to deliver our people the care that they need and that they’re entitled to. No resource will be spared, nothing whatsoever,” he said.
Pressure has been mounting for Trump to declare an infectious disease emergency under the 1988 law that would allow the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to provide disaster funds to state and local governments and to deploy support teams. The power is rarely used. Former President Bill Clinton in 2000 declared such an emergency for West Nile virus.
Trump said the federal government was partnering with the private sector to accelerate production of test kits to make them more widely available to Americans.
He said there will be about 5 million coronavirus tests available but doubted that that many will be needed. He urged Americans to only seek out the test if they feel they need it.
""We don't want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn't be doing it and we don't want everyone running out and taking - only if you have certain symptoms,"" he said.
Alongside Trump was Anthony Fauci, the National Institutes of Health expert who is on Trump's coronavirus task force.
""We still have a long way to go. There will be many more cases. But we'll take care of that,"" said Fauci, long the nation's top infectious disease expert. ""What's going on here today is going to help it end sooner than it would have.""

Trump said the federal government would waive interest on student loans and ordered the Energy Department to take advantage of low oil prices to top up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia's parliament confirmed late on Friday the 16-member cabinet of the center-right Prime Minister Janez Jansa, who has pledged to do everything to slow the spread of the coronavirus epidemic in the country.
The cabinet was confirmed by 52 votes to 31, parliamentary speaker Igor Zorcic said. 
Slovenia has reported 141 confirmed coronavirus cases, up from 96 on Thursday, and has closed all schools and introduced health checks at its border with Italy.
""We are fighting against time ... and we need to win this battle. ... The change in our living habits in the coming days and weeks is necessary in this case,"" Jansa told parliament on Friday, before the vote.
Jansa was confirmed by parliament earlier this month and will replace the outgoing center-left Prime Minister Marjan Sarec, who resigned in January saying he did not have sufficient support in parliament to pass important legislation.
Jansa, 61, is the leader of the largest parliamentary party, the Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), and pledges to cut red tape and build more fences on the border with Croatia to reduce the inflow of illegal migrants.
He led the Slovenian government from 2004 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2013, and is close to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.
The four parties of his government coalition together hold 48 out of 90 seats in parliament. One of the main tasks of the government will be to hold the rotating presidency of the European Union in the second half of 2021. The next parliamentary election is due in mid-2022.

ACAPULCO, Mexico (Reuters) - Mexicans are finding it difficult to shake the habit of greeting friends, family and even strangers with a handshake, hug or kiss on the cheek despite warnings they could spread coronavirus, with the practice on display at a major banking conference.
At the annual gathering this week in the seaside resort of Acapulco, a couple of bankers, old friends, embraced after a brief back and forth discussion on what was the right way to greet one another.
""Just in case this is the last time,"" one of them joked.
The coronavirus has infected more than 129,140 people around the world, the vast majority in China, and killed 4,750. But Mexico appears so far largely unscathed and has confirmed only 16 cases and no deaths.
Mexico's Finance Minister Arturo Herrera has argued that because the disease is taking longer to spread in the country, it gives the government time to better organize a policy response.
In the absence of a more visible impact and drastic measures, like quarantines imposed in Italy and travel bans imposed by the United States, it appeared ""social distancing"" was not yet a priority for many, including the president.
""Look, this whole thing about the coronavirus that you can't hug. You have to hug, nothing is going to happen,"" President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said last week at his daily press conference. ""Like this,"" he said, putting his arms over his shoulders as if he were hugging himself.
Still, awareness is spreading.
Conference organizers set up tables, stocked with hand sanitizers, along hallways, while hostesses offered hand gel and signs detailed the sanitary measures.
Luis Esteve, who heads the Union of Mexican Financial Institutions think tank, said he decided to avoid unnecessary physical contact after seeing drastic measures in other parts of the world and hearing the World Health Organization refer to the outbreak as a pandemic.
""Latinos, we're affectionate ... and people think, 'How sad that we can't greet one another,'"" said Esteve, adding that it is better to be cautious under the circumstances.
But old habits die hard.
""In these type of events suddenly you bump into someone that you haven't seen, a friendly face, and you forget about the whole issue,"" he said. Moments later, an old acquaintance showed up and they hugged."

WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines (N:DAL), American Air Lines (O:AAL) and United Airlines (O:UAL), the three largest U.S. airlines, are in talks with the U.S. government about potential assistance amid a dramatic drop-off in air travel demand due to the coronavirus outbreak, the carriers said on Friday.
Airlines are reeling from a plunge in bookings and traffic, as the fast-spreading coronavirus pandemic prompts travel restrictions and event cancellations around the world.
United CEO Oscar Munoz has spent the last two days in Washington, D.C., meeting with senior officials in the Trump administration and senior members of the U.S. House and Senate in both parties, while President Scott Kirby has been in close touch with bank executives to assess the deepening impact of this crisis on the broader economy, the two told employees in a memo on Thursday. 
Delta CEO Ed Bastian also told employees on Friday that it was pursuing government aid.
""We are in discussions with the White House and Congress regarding the support they can provide to help us through this period,"" Bastian said in a memo released by the airline, adding he was forgoing his salary this year. ""The speed of the demand fall-off is unlike anything we've seen.""
American Airlines is also in discussions, a spokeswoman said.
Airlines and their trade association met with senior White House aides on Thursday to discuss the mounting crisis, three people briefed on the matter said. 
The conversations are in the early stages and no specific proposals have been exchanged, people said. Airlines have been sounding the alarm in talks with government officials about potentially having to furlough tens of thousands of employees and warning that urgent action is needed.
Bastian said he was ""optimistic"" about receiving government support but said the ""form and value is unpredictable"" and the company could not put its ""future at risk waiting on aid from our government.""
Delta announced a 40% capacity cut in the coming months, the largest in its history, including eliminating all flights to continental Europe for the next 30 days.
To preserve cash, Delta will park up to 300 aircraft, defer new aircraft deliveries and delay other investment initiatives, in addition to implementing a hiring freeze. As part of the capacity cuts, it is eliminating all flying to continental Europe for the next 30 days, or longer.
Delta, United and American have all raised capital in recent weeks, with United tapping $2 billion. Their share prices have fallen by between 40%-56% over the past month.
In another sign of pressure. Alaska Airlines (N:ALK) said on Friday it borrowed $388 million from existing credit facilities. It noted it has 133 aircraft that could be financed, if necessary to generate another $2.5 billion. 
Earlier, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin urged Americans to shake off worries about the coronavirus and continue to fly on domestic airline routes, while saying the administration of President Donald Trump was ready to provide needed liquidity to U.S. airlines.
""It is of strategic importance to us,"" Mnuchin told reporters at the White House, adding that he was in close touch with the CEOs of U.S. airlines. The Trump administration viewed the ability of airlines to continue to fly as a top priority, he said.
""I think the airlines want to make sure that they can continue to provide domestic travel. They also want to make sure that they keep as many workers employed as they can,"" he said.
""If I weren’t so busy working I would be going home to Los Angeles and I would be perfectly comfortable getting on a commercial plane this weekend. Despite the fact that we told people to shut down travel a little bit, people can travel in the domestic U.S.,"" he said.
The International Air Transport Association on Friday warned that air carriers could collapse if the coronavirus crisis lasted another two or three months.
IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters revenue losses internationally would be ""probably above"" the $113 billion figure the group had forecast a week ago, before the Trump administration's announcement of U.S. travel curbs on much of continental Europe.

European carriers were also suffering from the measures, with Norwegian Air (OL:NWC) saying on Friday it needs access to cash within weeks as it seeks to overcome the coronavirus crisis and is optimistic that the government of Norway will help secure funding.

The move came as the World Health Organization (WHO) said Iran needed to do more to contain the disease. Tehran has recorded 514 people killed and 11,364 diagnosed infections, making Iran one of the worst affected countries outside China.
Iranian officials have repeatedly complained that many Iranians have ignored calls to stay home and avoid travel.

KERBALA, Iraq/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Iraq condemned overnight U.S. air strikes on Friday, saying they killed six people and warning of dangerous consequences for what it called a violation of sovereignty and targeted aggression against the nation's regular armed forces.
President Barham Salih said repeated such violations could cause Iraq to unravel into a failed state and revive the Islamic State militant group. Iraq's foreign ministry announced plans to bring a complaint to the United Nations.
The United States defended the air strikes, saying all five targets were legitimate and stored Iranian-supplied weapons used by the Kataib Hezbollah militia to attack the U.S.-led coalition. Washington launched the strikes in retaliation for a rocket attack on Wednesday on a base north of Baghdad that killed U.S. and British troops.
""These locations that we struck are clear locations of terrorist bases,"" said Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, head of the U.S. military's Central Command. 
""If Iraqis were there and if Iraqi military forces were there, I would say it's probably not a good idea to position yourself with Kataib Hezbollah in the wake of a strike that killed Americans and coalition members,"" he told a Pentagon news briefing.
The Iraqi military warned the air strikes would have consequences while the foreign ministry said it summoned the U.S. and British ambassadors.
Long-standing antagonism between the United States and Iran have mostly played out on Iraqi soil in recent months, stoking deep-seated tensions between elements of Iraqi society who oppose the U.S. military presence and those who see U.S.-led coalition support as vital to preventing the resurgence of Islamic State militants. 
McKenzie said the death toll from the strike appeared limited. Iraq's Joint Operations Command said in a statement that three soldiers, two policemen and one civilian were killed, according to an initial toll, and that four soldiers, two policemen, a civilian, and five militiamen were injured.
""The pretext that this attack came as a response to the aggression that targeted the Taji base is a false pretext; one that leads to escalation and does not provide a solution,"" Iraq's Joint Operations Command said in a statement.
The civilians killed and wounded were construction workers at an airport building site in the Shi'ite Muslim holy city of Kerbala, Iraqi religious authorities said.
McKenzie acknowledged that a structure had been hit near the Kerbala airfield but said it was being used to store weapons. 
""That was a clear target,"" he said.
PROXY WAR
Around 5,000 U.S. troops remain in Iraq, most in an advisory capacity, as part of a wider international coalition formed to help Iraq drive back and defeat Islamic State militants.
But the Iraqi military said the new U.S. air attack went against ""any partnership"" under the coalition. ""It will have consequences that subject everyone to the most serious dangers.""
Iran's foreign ministry said on Friday that the ""presence and behavior"" of U.S. and allied forces in Iraq was to blame for attacks against them.
Iranian-backed paramilitary groups have regularly rocketed and shelled bases in Iraq that host U.S. forces and the area around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. 
The United States, which believes Iran wants to drive it from the region, has conducted several strikes inside Iraq, killing top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani and Kataib Hezbollah founder Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in January.
Many Iraqis say it is they who stand to suffer most from U.S.-Iranian tensions and some, including caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, have called for U.S. troops to withdraw.
McKenzie said he was confident the United States would be able to keep troops in Iraq.
He added that while the latest U.S. strikes would deter militia from waging similarly deadly rocket attacks, the risk from Iran and the groups it backs remained high. 
""I think the tensions have actually not gone down,"" he said.
Parliament passed a resolution calling for all foreign troops to leave after Soleimani was killed. The recent air strikes could see those calls renewed.
Iraq has suffered decades of war, sanctions and sectarian conflict, including the U.S.-led invasion of 2003.
Iraq is grappling with anti-government unrest in which almost 500 people have been killed since Oct. 1.

It also faces an unprecedented power vacuum after Abdul Mahdi stood down from most of his duties and his designated successor withdrew his candidacy.

958,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 01:12PM ET</span>",Airlines seek cost cuts and aid to survive coronavirus,"By Sarah Young and Victoria Klesty
LONDON/OSLO (Reuters) - British Airways warned of job losses and Norwegian Air said it had ""weeks not months"" to avert collapse, as airlines look for cost cuts and government help in the face of a crippling travel slump brought on by the coronavirus.
In a Friday message to staff entitled ""the survival of British Airways"", Chief Executive Alex Cruz said jobs would be cut ""perhaps for a short period, perhaps longer-term."" Talks have begun with unions, he said.
Heavily indebted Norwegian, whose finances were precarious even before the outbreak, said only a bailout could prevent it sharing the fate of British carrier Flybe - which became the first airline casualty of the crisis last week.
And Germany's Lufthansa, hit hard by flight restrictions in China then the United States, said it would need government help as it grounds two-thirds of its aircraft fleet.
Airlines are reeling from a plunge in bookings and traffic, as the spreading coronavirus prompts more travel restrictions including a U.S. entry ban on foreign passengers from Europe's entire Schengen zone.
European airline shares, which rose on Thursday amid a broader market rebound from multi-year lows, are down 43% since the start of the year, according to the STOXX Europe Total Market Airlines index.
NEAR THE BRINK
The head of global industry body, IATA, also stepped up calls for government support on Friday - warning that the travel meltdown could otherwise lead to multiple airline failures within two to three months.
The risk of further bankruptcies will ""depend on the intensity and the duration of the crisis"", IATA CEO Alexandre de Juniac told Reuters. 
""If the drop is as significant, as deep as we are seeing now, and if it lasts for more than two or three months, we will see some difficulties among airlines,"" he said.
Airlines are demanding relief from charges ranging from aircraft parking to overflight fees - payable for the use of airspace - as well as the deferral of a proposed EU fuel levy and other environmental taxes.
Heeding the calls, Norway suspended aviation taxes on Friday and said it was discussing further support for airlines including Norwegian Air, the low-cost long-haul pioneer whose breakneck expansion racked up unmanageable debt.
Norwegian, which is laying off half its 11,000 employees and scrapping thousands of flights, is looking to Oslo to ""provide liquidity within weeks not months,"" CEO Jacob Schram said.
PRESSING FOR AID
France and Germany have also said they stand ready to help their carriers. Carsten Spohr, the head of Lufthansa, told employees the German carrier would run only four of its normal 70 scheduled U.S. flights on Saturday as it slashes operations.
""Pressure is rising on governments to take action in the very near term to support the aviation industry,"" Bernstein analyst Daniel Roeska said.
Airlines need ""support from governments to ensure their operations remain a going concern beyond the current crisis,"" Roeska added. ""This is where the debate will move next.""
Air France-KLM boss Ben Smith addressed staff on Friday, with a warning of unspecified cost cuts that may include partial layoffs funded by government.
BA's CEO struck an even bleaker note, despite relatively robust finances at parent group IAG (LON:ICAG) and Heathrow traffic that largely escapes the transatlantic clampdown.
In his internal video message, a transcript of which was seen by Reuters, Cruz predicted that the impact of the coronavirus would be worse than the 9/11 terror attacks of 2001, the SARS epidemic two years later or the 2008 financial crisis.
""Please do not underestimate the seriousness of this for our company,"" he added.

PARIS (Reuters) - At lunchtime in a busy Paris restaurant area, hundreds of people are soaking up the sun, eating, chatting and smoking on cafe terraces and adamant that the coronavirus will not get in the way of their lives.
Even though Italy has gone into lockdown and neighboring Belgium and Spain have closed bars and cafes, the French government has kept cafes - and their vibrant social life - open, just asking people to keep a safe distance between tables. 
In a televised address to the nation on Thursday, President Emmanuel Macron announced school closures and urged people to avoid close contact for fear of spreading the virus that has killed 61 people in France and infected almost 3,000.
On Friday, there was little sign the message had been heard.
""It's a stressful atmosphere to talk about closing everything and staying at home. We need to be careful and stay in contact. It's important in life,"" said Alexandra Baronnet, a manager in a large business.
""I'm worried by the idea of not being able to go to the cinema, restaurant or theater, or even seeing my friends. It's essential.""
Italy, the country with the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, decided to close its bars, restaurants and other entertainment activities only after the number of cases spiraled and hospitals struggled to cope. 
Young French executive Clemence Guillern's company has recommended employees work from home from Monday. Having lunch with her colleagues, she is not too phased by the latest developments.
""We're going to take advantage of this moment among colleagues to have lunch together, but from Monday we'll be working from home,"" she said.
She feels the measures announced by Macron were aimed more at stopping the elderly getting sick than at her generation.
""We are going to try to be more careful, but continuing to have a social life is important,"" she said.
But the measures against the spread of coronavirus are having an impact. Not only have sports and other events been postponed but the Louvre, the world's most visited museum, said on Friday it was closing until further notice.
Michel Gomes, who runs the Cafe du Centre near the heart of Paris, looks on worriedly despite what looks like solid lunchtime numbers. 
With business down 30 percent since the start of the month, he cannot predict how long the situation will last and fears working hours will be restricted.
But the immediate challenge is getting customers to follow the national health guidelines, including keeping tables apart.
It is not easy. 
""We aren't going to tell them to sit a meter apart because it will make them even more scared. If they want to sit together, that's their choice,"" he said. 

Fearing forced closures as the virus spreads, he said: ""We fear that we're going to follow the Italian path.""

Pinera shipped several bills to Congress to beef up penalties against colluding to fix prices on sensitive consumer products, while stiffening fines and jail time for financial crimes ranging from fraud to insider trading.
The legislation also provides regulators with more tools to investigate the crimes and establishes new protections for ""whistleblowers"" in both public and private sectors who come forward with evidence of crimes.
""The immense majority of Chileans want to build a more just, more equal Chile, without abuses or privileges. That's the message we have heard loud and clear from the people,"" Pinera said in a speech at the La Moneda presidential palace.
Price fixing and other financial crimes lie at the heart of recent protests over social and economic injustices in Chile that have left at least 31 dead and wrought billions in damages to business.
Since Chile's return to democracy in 1990, allegations of price fixing have cropped up in markets for items from chicken to diapers, milk, drugs, asphalt and even gynecological visits, outraging many Chileans, who demand changes to the country's economic model.
Anger over these abuses appears in graffiti spray-painted on building walls across Santiago, a city of 6 million, and in the signs carried by protesters rebuking such crimes.
""When these bills become law, we will have freer, more transparent markets, more competitive companies, products of higher quality and lower prices,"" Pinera said.
Chileans will vote on whether to rewrite the country's dictatorship-era constitution in April. Many have also called for tougher consumer protections to be worked into a new Magna Carta.

Greece reported its first fatality from the virus on Thursday, in the town of Patra on the mainland. It has confirmed 117 cases of coronavirus so far, including one on the island of Lesbos, where the notorious Moria camp is located.
""The evacuation of the camps on the Greek islands is now more urgent than ever,"" the charity said.
""We need to be realistic: It would be impossible to contain an outbreak in such camp settings,"" it said, adding that it had not yet seen a credible emergency plan in case of an outbreak.
More than 40,000 asylum-seekers are living in camps, which are operating far beyond their capacity on five Greek islands.
MSF did not specify where it thought the Greek authorities should transfer the migrants but said both Greece and the European Union should act swiftly to avert a disaster.
The Moria camp on Lesbos was set up to accommodate 3,000 people but now hosts at least five times that number. The MSF said that in parts of the Moria camp some 1,300 people shared just one water tap and there was no soap available.
""Forcing people to live there as part of Europe’s containment policy was always irresponsible, but with the virus spreading, it is on the verge of becoming criminal if no action is taken to protect people,"" it said.
On Thursday, the Greek government suspended visits and activities of non-state organizations in refugee camps for two weeks as a preventative measure against the possible spread of coronavirus, an migration ministry official told Reuters.
The MSF said the suspension affects its operations inside the camps mainly.
""MSF works just outside Moria camp. So far we don’t have any plans to close our clinics,"" an MSF official said.

971,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 12:12PM ET</span>","Like the flu? Trump's coronavirus messaging confuses public, pandemic researchers say","By Brad Brooks
(Reuters) - The coronavirus is not as bad as the seasonal flu. President Donald Trump is not worried about having had a direct exposure to the virus. The United States is in far better shape than other countries.
Those are some of the messages from Trump to the American public in recent days. 
They are textbook examples of disastrous communication during disease outbreaks, according to some researchers into the psychology of pandemics and how leaders can most effectively communicate to keep the public safe during them.
Asked about Trump's messaging around the illness, including his public comments, a White House spokesman said:
""While the media wants to spin up fear, this White House is working around the clock to protect all Americans from the coronavirus. As President Trump said this week, we are using the full power of the federal government and the private sector.""
Trump is known for his informal style in attempts to, for instance, calm markets amid trade wars. In the past few days, decision-makers in the United States including the president have taken a flurry of steps to try to curb the spread.
Among them - Trump restricted travel to the United States from Europe; the National Hockey League suspended its season and the men's college basketball tournament was canceled; Disney theme parks and Broadway theaters closed. Trump, who has been criticized over the pace of testing for the virus, on Friday promised ""large scale"" testing.
Yet across social media and in private conversations, many Americans still doubt the pandemic is that bad. Many link their suspicions that the danger is exaggerated directly to Trump's early downplaying of the illness. 
""This is insanity, I think this coronavirus hype is bull,"" said Rene Rodriguez, doing some late-night grocery shopping in Austin with his wife and infant child. 
""The media is hyping this to get at Trump. Nobody can explain why this is more dangerous than the flu. Everybody I work with thinks this is a joke."" 
Managing a pandemic is one of the toughest tasks for a leader, some experts say, as there is a fine balance between not stoking panic while also speaking truthfully of the dangers. 
They say there are clear best practices.
""It's essential in managing pandemics that leaders are seen as credible and trustworthy,"" said Steven Taylor, a psychiatry professor at the University of British Columbia and author of the 2019 book ""The Psychology of Pandemics.""
""If the public loses the trust of its leaders, people will not listen to them when they offer good advice."" 
History has shown that leaders trying to manage pandemics without full transparency hamper citizens from acting to help, Taylor said. 
""On the one hand it creates increased anxiety among those who doubt the truth is being told,"" he said. ""And on the other it increases the number of people who think the whole thing is overblown."" 
'I'M NOT CONCERNED'
Trump's address to the nation on Wednesday evening was his most somber public appearance to discuss the pandemic. He imposed the Europe travel curbs, called for unity and asked people to set aside partisan differences.
But for experts in effective messaging during pandemics, he did not go far enough to plainly lay out to Americans the sacrifices they need to make.
Just hours later, Trump again seemed to be relaxed about the risks.
He got word that he had been in direct contact earlier this week with someone who later tested positive for coronavirus - the communications director for Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.
Asked if he was worried, Trump told reporters on Thursday: ""Let's put it this way – I'm not concerned."" A White House spokeswoman said later the president would not undergo a test for the virus. 
On Monday, Trump had tweeted: ""So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life & the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of CoronaVirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!""
Anthony Fauci, head of infectious diseases at the National Institutes of Health and a member of Trump's coronavirus task force, was asked by a House of Representatives committee on Wednesday for a fact that would help Americans gauge the danger.
""This is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu,"" Fauci said. ""I think that's something that people can get their arms around and understand."" 
Taylor said past pandemics have shown how playing down dangers only helps the virus spread, as people are less vigilant about hygiene, avoiding crowds and getting tested.
'SHAMEFUL' RESPONSE 
M.J. Crockett, a neuroscientist and director of the Crockett Lab at Yale University whose work centers on investigating altruism, morality and economic decision-making, has researched behavior in pandemics and the type of messaging that spurs people to make sacrifices for the common good.
Such messaging was not coming from Trump and his Cabinet, she said. 
""The response of the American government has been shameful,"" Crockett said. ""There are a lot of mixed messages."" 
Political divisions in the United States, intensified ahead of the November presidential election, make it likely that Trump will balk at highlighting the dangers and the need for Americans to make deep sacrifices, Crockett said.
""The absolute wrong messaging includes comparing the coronavirus to the ordinary flu, by insisting that the number of cases is low and saying that it's been contained,"" she said.
OTHER EXAMPLES
Leaders in countries harder hit by the coronavirus are far out front in how they are motivating people, both Crockett and Taylor said.
Chancellor Angela Merkel told Germans on Wednesday that up to two-thirds of the country's citizens could become infected. 
Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, while his government has been strongly criticized for bungling the response, has stepped up effective communications. 
""We realize that these measures will create discomfort, sometimes small, sometimes very large. But this is the moment of self-responsibility,"" Conte said this week.
In Austin, postal carrier A.J. Graham was stuffing mail into dozens of mailboxes. 
""I'm definitely not hearing messages that I need to make sacrifices for the common good,"" she said. ""We've overcome our differences and come together before - just look at America after 9/11,"" she said, referring to the Sept. 11, 2001 hijacked plane attacks.

""But we need leaders who know how to ask for it.""

ROME (Reuters) - The northern region of Lombardy, at the epicenter of Italy's coronavirus epidemic, asked on Friday for a further, final push to combat the contagion, which has killed more than 1,000 people and pummeled the economy.
The government this week imposed drastic curbs on all of the country, shutting bars, restaurants and most shops, and banning non-essential travel in an effort to halt the worst outbreak of the disease outside China.
However, it said factories and public transport should remain operational to prevent a total shutdown. Lombardy, which has accounted for 73% of all the deaths, said even these activities needed to close to stamp out the illness.
""We are asking for an exception to be made for Lombardy, which is the hardest hit region, with additional closures of shops and businesses,"" said Giulio Gallera, the local councillor responsible for welfare.
""If we can resist for at least eight days, perhaps we will see things turn around,"" he told RAI 3 television.
Some companies, such as car maker Fiat Chrysler, have decided to shut down some operations, while premium brakes maker Brembo announced on Friday it would temporarily stop work at its four Italian plants.
THE SICK, THE ECONOMY
There was no immediate word on whether Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte would agree to further curbs in Italy's business heartlands, with the government increasingly concerned about the long-term scars the virus will leave on the fragile economy.
""Today we have two objectives: Taking care of the sick and preventing infections, and taking care of our economy,"" Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio said on Friday.
Di Maio was speaking at an event to thank China for sending 31 tonnes of medical supplies, including masks and respirators, to Italy, as well as a team of doctors.
""Italy is not alone,"" Di Maio said. ""China is getting back on its feet and soon we too will be back on our feet.""
Italy has been dismayed by the response of some of its closest European allies to the crisis, with EU states refusing earlier this month requests for help as they stockpiled face masks and other medical equipment for their own citizens.
Austria and Slovenia have also drawn diplomatic displeasure by drastically limiting cross-border road traffic, leading to lengthy tailbacks and widespread confusion.
Four buses carrying Ukrainian nationals trying to get home from Italy were turned back at the Slovenian frontier overnight.
""We can't continue our journey. We have children on board, we are tired and we can't continue,"" said an upset woman, who did not give her name. ""If something happens, we want to die in our homes, in our country,"" said a Ukrainian man next to her.
In Rome, Pope Francis rebelled against a decision by his Roman Catholic Church to close all the 750 churches in the Italian capital - an unprecedented move in modern history.
""Drastic measures are not always good,"" the pope said on Friday in improvised remarks at the start of his morning Mass, streamed on the Internet. 

Within hours, the Church in Rome rowed back on the order and said all parish churches and those run by religious communities could remain open.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After all the rancor of the Democratic presidential race, front-runner Joe Biden has a chance in Sunday's debate to extend an olive branch to Bernie Sanders and his fervent supporters in a bid for party unity before the general election fight.
Growing concerns about the coronavirus pandemic and the Trump administration's handling of the U.S. response could minimize conflict between the two rivals as they look instead to contrast their leadership with the Republican president's in a time of crisis, Democratic strategists say.
Sunday's debate may be the last such event of the Democratic nominating contest and comes at a time when the global coronavirus outbreak has rocked American life. 
The crisis has prompted school closures and cancellations of sports tournaments and games, music concerts and political rallies in an election year. The debate itself was moved to Washington from Arizona and will have no in-person audience due to concerns about the coronavirus.
Following a string of nominating contest victories, Biden leads Sanders in delegates, and next week's primary elections could put the former vice president on a nearly unstoppable path to the nomination. 
The centrist Biden may now be in a position to try to find common ground with Sanders, a democratic socialist, a move that could help mend the fissure in the party between moderates and progressives, according to party veterans.
“Sunday’s debate could be an important step to heal and strengthen the party,"" said Hari Sevugan, recently a top aide to former presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg. “A measured, respectful conversation could go a long way.”
The winner of the Democratic primary contest will face President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election.
Edison Research exit polls from Tuesday's nominating contests showed that voters trust Biden to most effectively handle the response to the virus over Sanders. The health crisis is expected to take center stage on Sunday, providing another opening for Biden to position himself as a unifying force, strategists said.
The former vice president is not prone to conflict with fellow Democrats. The question remains whether the pugnacious Sanders, a U.S. senator from Vermont and an independent, would follow suit or keep trying to draw a clear contrast between the himself and Biden.
Some Democrats say lingering tensions between Sanders and presidential rival Hillary Clinton in 2016 played a role in her upset loss to Trump. 
After being routed by Biden in Michigan and other primaries on Tuesday, Sanders seemed to signal he was less interested in attacking Biden personally and more intent on pushing him to address issues such as universal healthcare coverage, college affordability, climate change and poverty.
And Sanders suggested that if Biden is the nominee, he will need to appeal to young voters and Latino voters who have gravitated to Sanders.
For Biden, the challenge may be figuring out how to thread the needle of expressing support for Sanders' efforts without aligning himself with his policies. 
Biden can say that ""while they share the same goals, they differ on the prescription,"" Sevugan said. 
'AN OPEN HAND'
Biden’s team is under pressure from allies of Sanders and Senator Elizabeth Warren, another former presidential candidate, to adopt policies popular with progressives such as a wealth tax, a stepped-up estate tax and an equal-pay plan, according to several strategists familiar with the conversations.
A wealth tax ""one, is supported by both Senators Sanders and Warren and two, speaks to the fundamentals of who the Democratic Party should be making clear they fight for,” said a Democratic strategist who was close to Warren's campaign.
A similar dynamic played out between Sanders and Clinton in the 2016 primary, when Sanders said he would not drop out even after it became clear she would be the nominee. 
The progressive wing of the party then successfully pushed for the addition of policies, including a $15-an-hour minimum wage, to the party’s convention platform. Sanders ultimately endorsed her.
Brian Fallon, Clinton's spokesman in 2016, said that while Sanders’ supporters were unlikely to be “fully transferable” to Biden, Biden’s team must work to earn the support of as many as possible to avoid the narrow loss Clinton suffered.
“It begins with rhetorically stretching out an open hand,” Fallon said.
Biden has been resistant to Sanders’ Medicare for All plan, which would replace private health insurance, arguing it is too costly and that many Americans prefer to keep their current insurance. 
Wendell Potter, a former healthcare executive who now works as an advocate for a government-run plan, said Biden must at least concede “the problems of our healthcare system are more severe than he’s acknowledging.”
Exit polls of Democratic voters from recent primaries showed strong support for Medicare for All.
Biden has promised to ""build on"" Obamacare by adding a public option that would leave the private insurance system in place.
Earlier this week, Biden praised the passion of Sanders and his supporters and promised to deliver a “bold, progressive vision to the American people.”
But his campaign has yet to indicate it would be inclined to embrace any of Sanders’ signature proposals. Biden's agenda in its current form would already make him the most progressive Democrat in history if elected, a campaign aide said.
Matt Bennett, a vice president for Third Way, a Democratic think tank that advocates for centrist policies, said Biden could not afford to break leftward after moderates in the party coalesced around him.

“The guy who comes in second doesn’t get concessions,” Bennett said. “The problem with Bernie is that his ideas are so huge, they are sinking his campaign. Biden can’t take those on.”

Companies would be allowed to suspend social security payments and maintain employees' contracts with payments equal to two-thirds of salaries, funded largely by the state.
""The main problem is the lack of liquidity. What we can do is put money in companies' treasuries so they can preserve their productive capacity and employment,"" Economy Minister Pedro Siza Vieira said after an all-night cabinet meeting.
Portugal has so far reported 112 confirmed cases of coronavirus, far below neighboring Spain where dozens of people have died, but its vital hotel sector has already been hit.
On Thursday, the government ordered all schools to be shut from next week to contain the epidemic, which Prime Minister Antonio Costa called a threat to survival.
Workers who have to stay at home to care for school children of up to 12 years of age will receive 66% of their base salaries, the government said.
Parents and unions have urged the government to pay workers full base salaries, arguing that two thirds is not be enough to make ends meet.
On Friday, the government led by Prime Minister Antonio Costa declared a ""state of alert"" until April 9, when the situation will be reevaluated.
Cruise ships would not be allowed to disembark passengers except those residing in Portugal, night clubs would be shut and there would be capacity restrictions on entry to shopping malls and restaurants.
Internal affairs minister Eduardo Cabrita said police officers would be responsible for ensuring nightclubs remain shut, adding that security forces' resources had been reinforced.
All events held in close spaces with more than 1,000 people have been prohibited, as well as all events held in open spaces with over 5,000 people.
Those who fail to obey the new measures, which will come into force when the clock strikes midnight on Friday, will be punished, he added."
976,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 11:31AM ET</span>",DUP leader not solely to blame in Northern Ireland 'cash for ash' scandal - inquiry,"By Ian Graham
BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster was one of a number of policymakers criticized in an inquiry on Friday into the so-called ""cash for ash"" scandal, which caused a three-year suspension of the province's government until January.
Northern Ireland's political establishment was rocked in 2016 when it emerged that farmers were heating barns night and day to burn as many wood pellets as they could to take advantage of a flawed green-energy subsidy that gave them 1.60 pounds for every 1 pound spent.
The scheme, which was overseen by then enterprise minister Foster, exposed Northern Ireland to hundreds of millions of pounds in costs and led to Irish nationalists Sinn Fein walking out of the power-sharing government with Foster's Democratic Unionist Party over her role.
A judge-led inquiry found that Foster should not have signed off on documents provided by officials which did not contain all necessary information, but that she had been ill advised by her special advisors and department staff.
While Sinn Fein initially insisted it could not return to power with the DUP if Foster remained as leader, the parties agreed to form a new government two months ago without such preconditions and Foster was reappointed first minister.
Foster previously apologized, but insisted her party closed it as soon as flaws became apparent. She initially dismissed criticism of her role as misogynist.
Retired High Court Judge Patrick Coghlin listed a mass of failures in the 656-page report and said the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme was ""a project too far"" for the devolved government, established as part of a 1998 peace deal that ended three decades of political and sectarian violence in Northern Ireland.
While it identified some instances where behavior was unacceptable, the inquiry found that ""corrupt or malicious activity on the part of officials, ministers or special advisors was not the cause of what went wrong with the NI (Northern Ireland) RHI.""
Unlike a similar scheme elsewhere in the United Kingdom, the legislation in Northern Ireland lacked a cap, leaving taxpayers exposed to up to 490 million pounds ($595 million), almost 5 percent of the region's annual budget.
Coghlin, who collected evidence from 114 days of hearings, said the Northern Ireland stand alone scheme should never have been adopted and recommended that ministers be given training on policy, legislation and on the workings of public expenditure.
Foster rose to UK-wide prominence when the DUP were needed to prop up then Prime Minister Theresa May's minority government following an election just five months after the ""cash for ash"" scandal toppled the Northern Ireland administration.
That put Foster at the heart of Brexit talks that stalled many times over Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom and the European Union post-Brexit, but that influence ended with Prime Minister Boris Johnson's thumping election victory in December."

Thousands of worshippers, some wearing face masks, were asked to keep their distance from one another as they filed into the Old City compound known to Muslims as al-Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary) and to Jews as the Temple Mount.
In Israel 126 cases of the disease have been reported and another 35 in the occupied West Bank.
Israel has banned gatherings of more than 100 people and some religious authorities, including the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, have moved to implement crowd controls at places of worship.

Shelves in supermarkets in major Dutch cities were emptying quickly hours after Dutch Prime Minister said there was ""no need"" to buy extra groceries.
On Thursday, the government announced a ban on gatherings of more than 100 people, told companies to encourage employees to work from home and said anyone with flu-like symptoms should stay home.
They were the most far-reaching measures yet in the Netherlands, where the number of recorded new coronavirus infections on Friday reached 804, with 10 deaths.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention testified on Thursday on Capitol Hill that public health officials discussed coronavirus information in classified rooms on occasions “too numerous to count,"" though he said the information wasn't treated as classified.
On Wednesday, Reuters reported that the White House ordered federal health officials at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the nation’s premier health agency, to treat top-level coronavirus meetings as classified, citing four Trump administration officials. 
The officials said that dozens of such discussions have been held since mid-January in a high-security meeting room at HHS, which oversees the CDC, and that staffers without security clearances have been excluded. 
After the story was published, the National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot emailed Reuters on Wednesday evening, saying, “The White House has never ordered any agency ‘to treat top-level coronavirus meetings as classified,’” as the story alleged.
“This story is fake news,” he wrote.
Asked about the Reuters report on Thursday, Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, told the House Oversight and Reform Committee of the meetings, ""We're holding them in a classified room, but the nature and the content of those conversations are not classified.""
The vice president's office emailed a joint statement from HHS Secretary Alex Azar and National Security Advisor Robert O'Brien on Thursday saying they were ""perplexed"" by the Reuters story, saying that task force meetings convened by Vice President Mike Pence take place in the White House Situation Room and are unclassified.However, the Reuters story was not about the Pence task force, which he began to lead at the end of February. 
""We stand by our story,"" a Reuters spokeswoman said Thursday.
The Reuters story focused on meetings at HHS that sources said were held in a SCIF (sensitive compartmented information facility). SCIFs are intended to be used for classified matters and include restrictions on attendees such as prohibiting most cell phones.
The sources, who all spoke on condition of anonymity, said they could not describe the interactions in the SCIF because they were classified. But they said topics included the scope of the outbreaks, quarantine issues and travel restrictions.
A spokesman for Republican Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, said Thursday that Grassley’s office had contacted the White House to ask about the Reuters’ report because he was concerned about the potential over-classification of information, an issue he had raised previously.
“Federal health experts need to be able to access all Intelligence Community information that could help combat this pandemic,” said the spokesman, Michael Zona.

Kel McClanahan, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who specializes in national security law and classification matters, said that if the practice was to hold these meetings in a SCIF, block certain people who lacked security clearances from attending and prevent attendees from discussing the matters with uncleared people, then “it would be classified.”

Earlier on Friday, Orban said he and his entire cabinet would quarantine themselves after coming into contact with a senator who was later confirmed to have the coronavirus.
Lawmakers toppled Orban's minority Liberal government at the start of February, opening the way for an early election his party was confident of winning, but his cabinet has continued running the country on an interim basis with limited powers.
Since then rival parties have been jockeying for position ahead of local and national elections.
But the onset of the coronavirus, which has so far infected 75 people in the European Union member state, means Orban's renomination could pass easily through parliament - restoring full powers to his government to fight the outbreak.
""All discussions with politicians were mature and constructive, everyone understands the special crisis situation does not leave room for political battles but for urgent solutions,"" Iohannis said.
After Orban's quarantine, Iohannis held consultations with parties via teleconference.
Orban said earlier that a senator who attended a meeting of the Liberal Party's senior figures on Monday had since tested positive for the virus. He added that he, his 17-member cabinet and all Liberal senators would quarantine themselves and be tested.
""All government members ... will do their duty and take all the measures to fight coronavirus, regardless of whether they are confirmed to have the virus or not,"" Orban told reporters.
He urged journalists who had covered his news conferences to seek testing as well.
Orban has held meetings with leaders of other political parties this week, as well as with Iohannis and officials including the central bank governor.

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan and Guinea all confirmed their first cases of the new coronavirus on Friday, giving the disease a foothold in 18 countries on the African continent.
Africa had so far largely been spared the rapid spread of COVID-19, which has infected at least 127,000 and killed 4,700 worldwide.
Most of Africa's reported cases were foreigners or people who had traveled abroad. Rapid testing and quarantines have been put in place to limit transmission.
But concerns are growing about the continent's ability to handle the disease.
Cases have been reported in Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Senegal, Togo, Cameroon, Burkina Faso, Democratic Republic of Congo, South Africa, Nigeria, Cote D'Ivoire, Gabon, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Kenya and Ethiopia. Most of the countries' totals are still in single figures.
Kenya is the richest economy in East Africa and a hub for global firms and the United Nations. Ethiopia is Africa's second-most populous nation, with 109 million citizens. Both Addis Ababa and Nairobi are regional transit hubs.
In the Kenyan capital Nairobi, authorities banned all major public events and said they would restrict foreign travel. The mayor of Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa urged citizens to avoid close personal contact but the health minister said there were no plans to cancel flights.
TRAVELERS FALL SICK
Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said their first case, a 27-year-old Kenyan, was diagnosed on Thursday after traveling home via London on March 5. 
He said the government had traced most of the people she had been in contact with, including fellow passengers on her flight, and a government response team would monitor their temperatures for the next two weeks.
The Ethiopian case was a 48-year old Japanese national who arrived in Ethiopia on March 4, the health ministry said.
Guinea's first case was an employee of the European Union (EU) delegation who had self-isolated after she felt ill upon returning from Europe, the EU delegation said.
Sudan's first confirmed coronavirus case was a man who died on Thursday in the Sudanese capital Khartoum, the Health Ministry said. He had visited the United Arab Emirates in the first week of March.
MEASURES TO STOP THE SPREAD
Kenyan Health Minister Mutahi Kagwe said the government had suspended all public gatherings, sporting events, open-air religious meetings and events ""of a huge public nature"". Schools will remain open but inter-school events are suspended.
Public transport operators must install hand sanitizers in their vehicles and clean them regularly, Kagwe said, while foreign travel would be restricted.
Soon after the announcement, shoppers in one Nairobi supermarket were buying up cart loads of staples like maize flour and water as well as hand sanitizers and soap. 
Kenya Airways suspended flights to China last month and on Thursday added Rome and Geneva to the list of suspended destinations. 
Kenya, dependent on Asian imports, has seen disruptions to its supply chain and a decline in tourism, an important source of hard currency and jobs.
""We are going to be hit badly,"" Tourism Minister Najib Balala told journalists.
The Nairobi Securities Exchange halted trading in the afternoon after the main NSE 20 share index dropped by more than 5% following the news.
Also in East Africa, the island nation of Mauritius, whose economy depends on tourism and financial services, said it was seeking to mitigate the effects of the virus by offering liquidity to banks to support struggling firms and cutting the cash reserve requirements for banks. It has not yet reported any cases of COVID-19.

Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province, registered the five new cases on Thursday, the National Health Commission said, down from eight cases the previous day. The commission routinely reports new cases the day after the data is collected.
Excluding Wuhan, Hubei had reported no new infections for eight consecutive days.
The province also lowered the epidemic risk ratings of several cities and regions, leaving only Wuhan classified as ""high risk"" as of the end of March 12, according to the Hubei Daily, a state-owned newspaper.
The commission said on Thursday China's coronavirus epidemic had passed its peak, even as alarm over the virus intensified elsewhere with global markets suffering record falls and governments unveiling measures to try to slow the spread of a disease that has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide.
The financial hub of Shanghai reported two new cases, while Beijing saw one, all imported by people traveling to China from affected areas abroad, the health authority said.
Those cases brought the total number of new infections in mainland China to eight on Thursday, down from 15 the previous day, and the lowest since the healthy authority started publishing nationwide figures in January.
To date, the total accumulated number of cases in mainland China is 80,813.
The coronavirus has killed more than 3,000 people in mainland China. 
It had also stalled the world's second-largest economy as, beginning in January, authorities ordered work stoppages, travel restrictions and home quarantines.
As the measures start to pay off, local governments have been ordered to revive their economies, especially those in areas that have not had to deal with extensive outbreaks.
Hubei province has started to loosen the strict controls that kept up to 60 million people under a virtual lockdown for weeks.
Wuhan has seen some restrictions relaxed this week and the nearby city of Huanggang, which also had numerous coronavirus cases, on Friday begun relaxing its lockdown, saying that residents could start traveling within the city.
Outside Hubei, about 60% of small- and medium-sized firms and 95% of large ones have gone back to work, vice industry minister Xin Guobin said on Friday.
The death toll in mainland China reached 3,176 as of the end of Thursday, up by seven from the previous day. 
In Hubei, there were six new deaths, with Wuhan accounting for all of them.
As the Qingming tomb-sweeping festival approaches, when millions of Chinese families traditionally pay respects to ancestors, clean their graves, offer flowers and burn incense, authorities in Beijing have urged the public to stay away.
""We will arrange free services at cemeteries, the staff will offer free tomb cleaning and free flowers,"" said Li Quanxi, an official at Beijing's civil affairs bureau. 
""We want to encourage people to transform social traditions amid the coronavirus outbreak.""

The festival is on April 4.

The men were part of a group of seven flown back to Bosnia from Syria in December, along with 18 women and children.
Jasmin Keserović, 26, from the central town of Zavidovici, and Senad Kasupovic, 40, from the northwestern village of Grabovac, were accused of organizing a terrorist group, the prosecutor's office said in a statement.
Keserovic, who used the name ""Muhamed"" and spent nearly seven years fighting in Syria, was also charged with inciting others to take part in terrorist activities, the statement added.
""The defendant is also accused that during his stay in Syria, wearing uniform and armed with an automatic rifle, he recorded and distributed on the internet a video in which he personally called for the killings of Christians,"" the office said.
A third member of the group was charged on Thursday with taking part in terrorist activities.
Bosnia's state court has tried and convicted 46 people who have returned from Syria or Iraq over the past few years.
According to Bosnian intelligence, 241 adults and 80 children left Bosnia or the Bosnian diaspora from 2012-2016 for Syria and Iraq."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government said at the time that ending Kashmir’s special status was necessary for closer integration of the Muslim majority territory into the rest of India.
The government imposed a communication blackout with mobiles phones, internet links and landlines down and the detentions of scores of people including Abdullah to prevent large scale protests from erupting over the loss of autonomy for Kashmir.
The federal government said those measures were necessary to stop separatists and militants from stirring trouble. The government did not offer any reason on Friday for Abdullah's release when it made the announcement.
Abdullah, a former chief minister, told reporters he was happy to be free, but there were many others still under detention including his son and also a former chief minister Omar.
""But this freedom is not complete; the freedom will be complete when all the leaders .... who are in either prisons in the state or outside the state, on in ... hostels or in various buildings where they have been put under house arrest,"" he told reporters in main city Srinagar.
Abdullah said a window had opened with his release.
""I hope that the government of India takes action soon to release everyone if they want that the people of the state should have freedom to live as free people,"" he said."

The spat comes as Britain takes a different approach to coronavirus to EU countries such as Ireland, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson saying it was premature to take measures like closing schools or banning large sporting events.
The pro-British DUP and Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein agreed in January to restore the British region's devolved power-sharing government after a break of three years due to disagreements between the parties on Brexit and other issues.
Sinn Fein's leader in Northern Ireland, Michelle O'Neill, the region's deputy first minister, said schools and colleges should be closed immediately to match a measure taken in the Republic of Ireland on Thursday.
""Now is the time to take action,"" O'Neill told journalists. ""It's vital that we have a joined-up approach across the island.""
Northern Ireland's first minister, Arlene Foster, head of the Democratic Unionist Party, told the BBC earlier on Friday that schools would be closed eventually but that the decision needed to be taken at the right time.
She said she agreed that the virus would not recognize borders, but said the decision to leave them open was based on ""clear scientific advice"" and that closing schools could force people to leave children with elderly relatives.
""We do listen to the science. I think all of your listeners would want us politicians to do that because once we take political decisions and not scientific decisions we are in a difficult place,"" Foster told BBC radio.
Northern Ireland currently has 20 confirmed cases of COVID-19 compared with 70 in the Republic of Ireland, where the population is around two and a half times bigger."

LAHORE, Pakistan (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Friday allowed an anti-corruption body to investigate the owner of the country's largest media group on allegations of graft dating back three decades, a move that rights groups said was aimed at stifling press freedom.
Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman, the owner and editor-in-chief of Jang media group, publisher of Urdu and English newspapers and which runs the popular Geo News TV, was arrested on Thursday by the anti-graft body, the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).
NAB, which accused him of obtaining illegal property concessions from a previous government in 1986, presented Rehman to an anti-corruption court, which said he could be held in custody and investigated for 12 days, his lawyer Aitzaz Ahsan said.
The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists and Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said his arrest was an attack on press freedom.
Jang media group said the case was trumped up and being used as an attempt to silence Rehman and his company because of its reporting that was critical of the government and NAB.
The group said in a statement that the anti-corruption body had sent ""our reporters, producers and editors -- directly or indirectly -- over a dozen notices"" threatening to shut down the Geo News TV channel because of its reporting.
Pakistan's opposition parties have long accused NAB of being used as a political tool by the government and the powerful military to quash critics.
NAB, the government and the military deny the accusation, saying the body acts independently in line with the law.
""It is regretful to connect an inquiry against a businessman with freedom of press,"" Information Minister Firdous Ashiq Awan said.
Prime Minister Imran Khan's relations with the press and broadcasters have become increasingly strained since he took office after an election in 2018.
Opponents say Khan secured office with the help of a crackdown on the media and his opponents by the military, which has a history of involvement in Pakistani politics, including staging coups to oust civilian governments.
Activists say a crackdown on the media since 2018 has left 3,000 journalists and other media workers jobless.
The prime minister and the military, who deny any collusion, have long accused Jang media group of siding with Khan's main rival, former two time prime minister Nawaz Sharif.
Murtaza Solangi, a senior journalist who says he lost his job in the crackdown, described Rehman's arrest as an act of ""fascist thuggery"".
""We have been under immense pressure for a very long time for taking a stance of an independent media and questioning various actions of the government and NAB,"" Geo News President Imran Aslam told Reuters.
Geo News has been taken off air several times in recent years at the order of the state-run media regulator or because of what it says is government pressure on cable operators. It said on Friday it was being forced to shutdown again."

MILAN (Reuters) - Donato Velardi's hotline has been ringing almost non-stop since Rome imposed draconian measures to combat its coronavirus crisis, forcing millions of Italians to embrace smartwork.
Italy's small businesses, which form the backbone of its economy, have been slow to switch to distance working. But the coronavirus has changed their approach almost overnight.
Velardi, the 43-year-old founder of Milan-based simultaneous translation services provider ConVerso, says his clients were turning digital after cancelling all live events booked until June with a traditional interpreting business he also runs.
""There is a lot of psychological support involved,"" he told Reuters by telephone.
""After the initial panic and all the cancellations we've been inundated with calls from clients asking us to organize events connecting virtually people here, there and everywhere,"" he said, adding that demand had ""exploded"".
Companies in Italy are allowed to remain open provided they comply with safety measures, but the government has urged employees to work remotely as much as possible.
Data from Eurostat showed that in 2018 only 2% of Italians working for companies or public institutions used smart working, against a European average of 11.6%.
Compare that to the United States where companies, already big users of video conferencing services like Microsoft's Teams and Zoom, are now being offered interaction with digitized, 3D versions of co-workers by firms like Rumii and Spatial.
Italy has some 4 million companies with less than 10 staff, accounting for 95% of total businesses, who are now having to find ways to operate through the country's lockdown.
For Emo Maracchia, an engineer at rival HDC Cloud Services, which provides conference call and video-streaming services to small- and medium-sized firms, that is proving a challenge.
""It's quite stressful. The phone won't stop ringing, demand for our services has more than quadrupled and we're close to full-capacity,"" Maracchia said.
CATCH-UP
A report on smart-working by Milan's Politecnico University in October showed that the share of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that said they were not interested in smart-working had risen to 51%, from 38% a year earlier.
The annual study said only 12% of SMEs had formal projects in place, against 58% of larger firms.
But the coronavirus crisis is reshaping habits fast and Maracchia said HDC's client base had widened to include businesses with 3-4 staff, such as small offices of lawyers, tax advisers and even a school for truck drivers.
""Italy is being forced to catch up all at once,"" he said.
Italy's biggest IT services group Engineering said it was supporting 250,000 workers remotely at 400 firms it supplies.
Rome has imposed progressively stricter measures, ordering a shutdown of bars, restaurants and beauty parlors to fight an outbreak that, as of Thursday, had infected at least 15,113 people and killed more than 1,000 in just three weeks.
The government had already closed down schools until April 3 and banned any public or sports events as well as all non-essential travel.
Italy's biggest phone group  Telecom Italia  (MI:TLIT) (TIM) reported an increase of 70% in traffic on its fixed-line network in the past 7-10 days, mostly in the country's northern industrial heartland, from where coronavirus has been spreading.
Rome has long been pushing for an all-fibre optic network to be rolled out nationwide to boost productivity across a country with one of the lowest take-ups of fixed broadband in Europe.
Maracchia said saturated networks made it difficult to use common apps such as Skype and companies also generally preferred professional services to interact with clients.
The travel ban has disrupted commercial operations.
Lorenzo Simoncini, CEO of ATP, a Modena-based maker of gaskets and plastic parts, said one big problem was not being able to visit clients.
""We're working on smart ways to help the sales team function from home,"" he said.
ATP has all of its 80 employees working from home except those on the factory floor and one director in the office.
""It's all working really well,"" Simoncini said, adding staff would probably be working remotely for one or two months.
But not everyone is a convert.
Nicola Cosciani, who works at valves and pipe group EMER in Brescia, which is one of the most affected areas in Italy's north, said 90% of his employees were smart working, but only because of the coronavirus precautions.
""I can see the benefits in crisis times like this but in normal times I have my doubts. I think it can induce inefficiency since team work and being close to the production hub are important,"" he said."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Valentina Tereshkova was hailed as a hero when she became the first woman in space in 1963.
Now 83, she has became a hate figure for some Russians after this week putting forward a constitutional amendment that could allow President Vladimir Putin to stay in power until 2036.
At least two online petitions have been launched against her, one calling for a street named after her to be renamed and another asking for one of her honorific titles to be revoked.
She has also been widely mocked by critics on social media. 
""Tereshkova - the first woman who bravely traveled into cosmic cold and darkness, and then brought the entire country there,"" read one message on Twitter reposted by Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny. 
Opposition politician Dmitry Gudkov wrote: ""This whole obscene fuss over the constitution was conceived for the sake of one moment ... two new terms for Putin. Tereshkova, who still remembers (Soviet dictator Josef) Stalin well, did not disappoint."" 
A household name in Russia, Tereshkova, who holds an array of state honors including a Hero of the Soviet Union medal, became the world's first female astronaut in June 1963, spending 71 hours in orbit on board a Soviet Vostok spacecraft.
A staunch backer of Putin and the traditional values he has espoused, she has been a lawmaker in the lower chamber of parliament since 2011.
Her amendment, since backed by both houses of parliament, allows Putin to ignore the current constitutional limits and run for president again in 2024, potentially opening the way for him to serve two more six-year terms consecutively.
The moves has been applauded by Putin's admirers but critics have accused him of plotting to stay in power for life and have blamed Tereshkova. 
One petition, that has garnered nearly 8,000 signatures, calls for Tereshkova to be stripped of her title of ""honorary citizen"" of Tutayev, a town northeast of Moscow near where she was born. 
""...Tereshkova actively took part in the show that some people are calling a state coup,"" it says, adding she had discredited the honor of the town's residents. 
Another, with over 3,000 signatures, calls for a Tereshkova Street in the town of Artyomovsky to be renamed. 
Neither of the petitions has legal force. 
Putin allies, including the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, and the speaker of parliament, Vyacheslav Volodin, have rallied to her defense, praising her proposal and decrying the attacks on her as unpatriotic and orchestrated from abroad. 
Tereshkova has branded her critics unpatriotic. 

""I don't even want to talk about these people who don't love the country,"" she was quoted as saying by the RIA news agency.

With just 74 confirmed cases of the virus and a single death, India, a country of 1.3 billion people, has so far fared better than elsewhere in Asia, Europe and North America.

Sporting events and other large public gatherings will also be included in the shutdown, she added, without elaborating.

JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesia on Friday reported 35 new coronavirus cases, including two toddlers, bringing its total to 69, as a rights group urged authorities to be more transparent about the spread of the virus in the world's fourth most-populous nation.
Health Ministry official Achmad Yurianto told reporters the new cases ranged in age from 2 to 80, and that three people out of the latest cases had died.
The patients were found after tracing their contacts back to earlier confirmed cases, Yurianto said without disclosing the location.
Indonesia only confirmed its first cases of the virus last week while some neighbors had reported scores of cases far earlier, raising concerns among medical experts about infections either not being reported or going undetected.
In addition, some officials have appeared to play down the risks from the virus as well as at times declining to specify the location of an outbreak.
""The central government is not transparent in fulfilling the public's right to know about the spread of the coronavirus in Indonesia,"" Amnesty International director Usman Hamid said in a statement.
""If this continues to happen, authorities could potentially breach the public right to information... and the public right to health.""
Speaking at an event at Jakarta's airport, President Joko Widodo defended the stance of not revealing travel records and the history of contacts among patients.
He said this was to ""consider the risk of panic among the public"" and the effects giving out such information could have on patients when they recovered.
Authorities on Friday sanitized parts of Jakarta's airport and also disinfected mosques.
Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the United States said in a study last month Indonesia's lack of confirmed cases at that time ""may suggest the potential for undetected cases"", urging authorities there to strengthen outbreak surveillance and control.
As of Friday, Indonesia has tested 970 people according to Health Ministry data.
Starting Monday, the health ministry’s Yurianto said two additional labs will be available to help examine samples.
Indonesian media reported on Friday that one person confirmed to have the disease had fled a hospital in Jakarta.
But Yurianto told reporters that the patient had since returned.
Five people had recovered from the disease, Yurianto said, while another was expected to recover soon."

The trial in the western town of Saintes is the first of hundreds of legal complaints against defendant Joel Le Scouarnec to come to court. It is due to run until March 17.
Le Scouarnec, 69, is charged in this opening case with raping and sexually abusing four children between 1989 and 2017. The alleged victims included two of his nieces, a patient and his neighbor's then six-year-old daughter.
Because the victims were minors at the time, the Saintes court ruled on Friday that proceedings would be closed to the public, radio franceinfo said.
Le Scouarnec was arrested in 2017 when the young girl living next door told her mother that he had exposed himself and molested her.
Investigators said a search of Le Scouarnec’s home yielded images of child abuse as well as notebooks where the surgeon detailed acts of sexual violence against children from 1989 to 2017.
Le Scouarnec has told investigators that he had ""already acted out” with children. He has however denied any full sexual penetration and said his diaries included an element of fantasy.
He faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted."

CARACAS (Reuters) - In January, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro claimed a major victory: congress lawmakers elected his favored candidate as National Assembly leader, putting the increasingly authoritarian nation's last independent institution within his grasp.
Opponents cried foul, accusing the Venezuelan leader of intimidating and attempting to bribe lawmakers to oust Maduro's arch-rival, opposition head Juan Guaido, in the Jan. 5 vote.
An examination by Reuters of the circumstances surrounding the vote shows there was evidence to support their accusations.
A previously undisclosed recording of a conversation between two congressmen - along with interviews with a dozen other lawmakers and unreported text messages - sheds light on the ruling Socialist party's strategy of making cash offers and threats to exploit divisions within Guaido's coalition.
Maduro's leftist government, branded a dictatorship by Washington and targeted by U.S. sanctions, denied using coercion, as did the newly elected head of congress, Luis Parra.
In the recording, at 9 a.m. on Dec. 15, Kerrins Mavarez, a 34-year-old congressman for the coastal state of Falcon, took a phone call from a senior opposition figure worried the government was plotting to wrest control of congress.
The caller, Luis Stefanelli, told Mavarez he believed Maduro's allies were trying to buy and scare opposition politicians into backing Parra. 
Mavarez confirmed to Stefanelli he had received phone calls from an unnamed government emissary threatening him with arrest and asking how much money he wanted to change sides.
""I'm really scared,"" said Mavarez, who did not identify the emissary. Mavarez said he had resisted the offer but asked Stefanelli for the opposition's support: ""Don't leave me alone.""
""It's important for us to know we can rely on you,"" Stefanelli said in the recording, which he shared with Reuters, promising Mavarez that opposition leaders would back him. 
""Your position will mark your life.""
By the time of the Jan. 5 ballot, Mavarez had made up his mind. He joined some 15 other opposition lawmakers in voting against Guaido's re-election and instead backed Parra, who had aligned himself with Maduro's Socialists.
At a news conference four days after the vote, Mavarez denied accusations by other opposition figures that he took a bribe and said he acted with ""bravery"" after Guaido failed to advance solutions to Venezuela's economic and political crisis.
Asked by Reuters about the recording, Mavarez did not deny its authenticity and said both sides pressured him, but he voted ""with full freedom."" 
He accused the opposition of staging the threatening calls he received in December to assess if he was involved in a conspiracy, but did not give evidence for that. A spokesman for Guaido said no calls or messages were staged. 
Reuters was unable to determine whether any bribes were actually made or who made the December calls. Stefanelli said he recorded Mavarez because he suspected that he already had been ""bought,"" without elaborating further.
Neither representatives for Parra nor Venezuela's Information Ministry responded to requests for comment.
""HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT?""
The opposition politicians interviewed by Reuters said Parra's allies in December had solicited 30 of their colleagues - the number needed to swing the majority - with offers of up to $700,000, picking targets in financial need and frustrated with Guaido. They offered evidence for three cases, which are detailed in this story.
""They were calling up those who had doubts or who were unhappy with the leadership,"" said lawmaker Jose Guerra.
Citing his conversations with colleagues targeted, Guerra said one lawmaker close to Parra, Jose Noriega, who was formerly in Guaido's Popular Will party, made many of these calls. 
Noriega denied this to Reuters.
According to the deputies and people close to the Socialist party, Maduro wanted to take advantage of Guaido's diminished popularity to place a new pliant opposition in congress that could pass legislation required by his government.
But, according to these people, Parra failed to sway enough opposition legislators.
This, they said, forced him to bar entry to Guaido and his allies and claim control of the 167-seat congress without proof he met the requirement that half of lawmakers be present. Parra has said the vote did have quorum, but he has never presented an official list of which legislators voted for him in a show of hands. 
On the day of the vote, soldiers with riot shields blocked Guaido and allies from entering parliament, according to Reuters reporters, enabling pro-government legislators to elect Parra. 
Maduro said on state television that Guaido did not want to enter congress as he did not have the votes. He celebrated Parra's rise as a ""rebellion"" within congress.
Although opposition lawmakers later re-elected Guaido as head of the National Assembly in a separate session at a nearby newspaper's offices, Parra's rival election was a symbolic blow and deprived them of control of the building itself. 
Guaido, who accuses Maduro of stealing the 2018 presidential election, proclaimed himself rightful president last year based on his status as head of congress - with the support of Washington and dozens of other nations.
In December, before the vote, the main opposition coalition evicted Parra after a local media report accused him and others of abusing their positions to burnish the reputation of a government-linked businessman. Parra denied that at the time and remains as head of congress.
Mavarez replaced Stefanelli in congress after the elder lawmaker fled abroad due to a Dec. 13 Supreme Court request to investigate him for alleged crimes related to a plan to seize military installations. A pro-government legislative superbody agreed to remove his parliamentary immunity three days later, though it is unclear how the case has proceeded since. 
Stefanelli denies the treason and conspiracy allegations. 
In a phone interview, he said he could not reveal his location or when exactly he left due to security concerns.
Venezuelan authorities have opened criminal probes into Guaido's finances and involvement in anti-government protests and stripped many more of his colleagues of parliamentary immunity on grounds they also conspired to overthrow Maduro. Some 30 lawmakers remain detained, in exile, or in refuge at embassies in Caracas.
During his call with Stefanelli, Mavarez said the go-between had told him he too would be arrested for participating in an unsuccessful military uprising against Maduro last April. Furthermore, the intermediary warned him that Mavarez lacked immunity as a substitute lawmaker, making him more vulnerable, the recording reviewed by Reuters shows.
In the call, Mavarez recounted to Stefanelli that earlier that morning the emissary asked him: ""How much do you want and which bank account do you want it in?""
Mavarez declined to identify the emissary to Reuters and Stefanelli said he did not know who the individual was.
""THE SCORPION WANTS TO STING ME""
Lawmaker Alfonso Marquina was another target.
On Dec. 11, Marquina attended a congressional meeting during which he chastised colleagues for mistakes the opposition made last year, Marquina told Reuters. Afterwards, Noriega, the lawmaker allied with Parra, approached him and suggested they talk.
Suspicious of Noriega's motives, Marquina messaged Guaido to keep him apprised of the proposition. 
""My president, the scorpion wants to sting me,"" Marquina told Guaido, referring to government pressure over the National Assembly vote that the opposition dubbed Operation Scorpion.
They agreed Marquina would go to find out more.
The next morning, Noriega wrote to Marquina. ""Comrade, good morning. I'll wait for you at 8 a.m. at the Tamanaco so we can have breakfast,"" he said, referring to Caracas' plush Tamanaco hotel, according to their unreported messages seen by Reuters.
Once at the hotel restaurant, Marquina said he placed a phone in a bag by their table to secretly record their conversation.
According to the 5-minute tape, which Marquina released publicly in January, Noriega offered him $700,000 to support Parra, with an initial payment of $150,000 before the vote, along with the chair of the congress' finance commission.
""Whoever extends their hand and accepts the initial amount gets a commitment,"" Noriega said.
In a statement to Reuters, Noriega reiterated previous denials that the conversation took place and said the recording formed part of a Guaido-led campaign to discredit Parra's election. The Guaido spokesman said the tape was genuine. 
Marquina stands by the audio's authenticity. He said he refused the money - but claims 15 other lawmakers had a price.
Arkiely Perfecto, who left a pro-Maduro party to join the opposition early last year, told a colleague on Dec. 10 that she had accepted 50,000 euros ($57,000) to vote for Parra, though she felt ""terrible"" for doing so, according to WhatsApp messages published by her political organization, which later expelled her.
""The dignity that I have maintained has meant a lot of people I love in my family have gone to bed with empty stomachs,"" Perfecto said in one text to the colleague seen by Reuters, referring to previous offers she had turned down.
Perfecto told Reuters she had not accepted any money and said the messages were fabricated by her group, the Democratic and Inclusion Movement, to damage her.
Her group's leader, Nicmer Evans, said Perfecto's expulsion followed a proper disciplinary investigation which found she had received a payment.

LISBON (Reuters) - A few hours after Portugal ordered schools to close next week due to the coronavirus outbreak, parents taking their kids to the last day of classes on Friday said they were relieved on health grounds but worried about how to make ends meet.
With his 11-year-old son peeking out from behind his back at a Lisbon school, 42-year-old Jorge Martins told Reuters he was happy with the new measure but the government should do more to compensate parents for child care costs.
Workers who have to stay at home to care for schoolchildren of up to 12 years of age will receive two thirds of their base salaries, the government said as it announced a 2.3 billion euros package to help businesses and employees.
""If a worker is home or if parents are unable to take care of their children and have to leave their jobs, an exceptional measure should guarantee 100% of the salary,"" Martins said.
The suspension of classes covers the whole education system from kindergartens to universities, both public and private, and will be in force until a further evaluation on April 9.
Another father, 45-year-old Manuel Santos, said working parents were in a tricky situation as care centers were likely to close too, and leaving children with grandparents was also off the table for many due to contagion fears.
""It will be complicated, but as a society we have to turn this around,"" he said.
There are about 2 million schoolchildren in Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million people.
Portugal has so far reported 112 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, far below neighboring Spain, where La Vanguardia newspaper said there were about 4,000 cases and dozens of fatalities.
On Thursday, the government also announced cruise ships would not be allowed to disembark passengers except those living in Portugal, night clubs would be shut and there would be restrictions on numbers visiting shopping malls and restaurants.
""This is a fight for our very survival ... the government is determined to adopt every measure necessary,"" said Prime Minister Antonio Costa said."

VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Catholics criticized a cardinal's order to close churches in Rome on Friday to help contain the spread of coronavirus and Pope Francis cautioned against ""drastic measures"".
Some took to social media to rail against the move by Cardinal Angelo De Donatis, accusing him of caving in to the government. One said the move had put ""Christ in quarantine"".
Catholic bishops around the world were deciding how to deal with the pandemic in their own dioceses and what guidance they should give to the 1.3 billion-member Church in places from Little Rock to Lyon.
""Drastic measures are not always good,"" the pope said in improvised remarks at the start of his morning Mass, which has been streamed on the internet and televised live without outside participants in order to limit gatherings of people.
Francis prayed that God give pastors ""the strength and even the capacity to choose the best means to help"" those suffering from the pandemic ""so that they can provide measures that do not leave the holy faithful people of God alone"".
On Thursday, De Donatis, the pope's vicar for the Rome archdiocese, ordered the more than 900 Catholic churches under his jurisdiction closed until April 3.
Previously, only Masses had been canceled because of the coronavirus outbreak. Individual bishops can decide whether to keep their churches open or closed and many are open in parts of Italy.
The pope is bishop of Rome and the cardinal is his administrative vicar. It was not clear if De Donatis had sought the pope's approval for the move.
The Italian government on Wednesday closed virtually every commercial activity in the country apart from pharmacies, food shops and other stores selling essential goods and services.
Customers must enter a few at a time, keep a safe distance from each other and wear surgical masks in some cases.
Critics say being allowed to pray in a church, albeit with precautions similar to those imposed on stores, should be seen as an essential service.
""My heart is in pieces,"" Father Maurizio Mirilli, a pastor of a Rome parish said on Twitter. ""I have to close everything, even the church ... I feel like a father whose children have been snatched from him.""
""Churches closed in the capital of Christianity is a wound that will be hard for us to forget,"" tweeted Gaetano Strano. ""The Church is independent from the state and was not obliged to adhere to government norms."""

According to the local news agency Eye Witness News, the SCA ruled that Zuma's appeal against an October decision by the Pietermaritzburg High Court had ""no reasonable prospects of success"".
Zuma, in office from 2009-2018, had applied for the stay of prosecution for alleged fraud, racketeering and money laundering relating to a deal to buy European military equipment for South Africa's armed forces in the 1990s.
The French defense firm Thales, accused of agreeing to pay Zuma around $34,000 annually for protection from an investigation into the $2 billion arms deal, and set to stand trial this year along with the former leader, had also appealed the decision.

The Federal Court ordered an appellate court to rehear the cases of leaders of the Islamic Central Council of Switzerland (ICCS).
Prosecutors charged the three ICCS officials in 2017 over videos posted online in 2015 that included interviews with leaders of Jabhat al-Nusra, at the time al Qaeda's Syrian branch. The charges were made under a law that bans al Qaeda and the Islamic State.
One of the men was convicted, while two were found not guilty because the court held that prosecutors had failed to provide sufficient detail about the allegations.
In a ruling released on Friday, the Federal Court rejected the basis for the two acquittals. In the case of the man who was convicted, it rejected an appeal, holding that the lower court had not violated federal law by ruling that he had acted with intent.
Prosecutors say the 2015 videos were propaganda in which the filmmakers failed to explicitly distance themselves from al Qaeda activities in Syria. The ICCS contends the video was intended to shed light on a troubled region, not glorify extremists."

Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria's war, agreed on March 5 to halt military activity in the northwestern Idlib region after an escalation of violence displaced nearly a million people and brought the two sides close to confrontation.
The deal addresses Turkey's main concerns - stopping a flow of migrants and preventing the death of more Turkish soldiers - but also cements recent gains by Syrian government forces and leaves Turkish posts encircled.
Around 60 Turkish soldiers were killed in clashes in the region since last month, but the ceasefire has largely held since March 5.
Turkey set up a dozen military observation posts in the Idlib region under a 2018 agreement with Russia, but most of those are now in areas held by the Syrian government. Ankara had previously warned that it will push back Syrian forces from the area if they do not withdraw, but it has not yet done so.
""There are no issues regarding the observation posts. There are no violations (of the ceasefire) against observation posts either,"" a Turkish security official said. ""These observation posts will continue to carry out their duties,"" he said, adding that no heavy arms or equipment would be withdrawn from there.
""The point of the observation posts is to end the bloodshed and humanitarian drama. The step taken on March 5 should be seen as a move for this. There is no such thing as 'an agreement was signed on March 5 so everything is finished', it has just been frozen,"" the official told a briefing in Ankara.
Under the agreement, Turkish and Russian forces will carry out joint patrols along the M4 highway linking Syria's east and west, and establish a security corridor on either side of it.
A Russian delegation arrived in Ankara on Tuesday for talks on the details of the deal.
The official said talks with the Russians, which were slated to conclude on Thursday, would end on Friday, and had been ""positive"". He said the first joint patrol would be held on Sunday as planned and that ""what is necessary"" will be done against any groups trying to deter these.
President Tayyip Erdogan said on Wednesday Turkey, which has backed some Syrian rebel groups, would not shy away from even stronger military action in Idlib if the ceasefire is broken.
The Turkish official also said on Friday that ""necessary intervention"" would be made against groups aiming to violate the ceasefire."

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Southeast Asian countries are cancelling or scaling back traditionally boisterous Buddhist New Year celebrations next month, citing the coronavirus pandemic as they call off water-soaked street parties and festivals.
The region usually hosts the world's biggest water fights in mid-April in which revelers splash each other under a scorching sun. Carnivals are held across the region, with pageants and dance parties as well as religious ceremonies.
Myanmar on Friday became the first to ban all mass gatherings to mark the Thingyan holiday – the most important event in the Theravada Buddhist year – over the fast-spreading coronavirus. Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand have also taken steps but have not introduced outright bans yet.
""Since the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is easily contracted in crowded spots, citizens are not allowed to participate in events, festivals and celebrations for Myanmar’s traditional water festival,"" Myanmar’s presidential office said in a statement.
All such events and festivals will be banned until the end of April and possibly longer, it said.
The Thai government has urged the public not to organize big festivals and water fights, but to celebrate more traditionally at home with their families, pouring water on elderly people to ask for blessings and offering alms to monks.
Bangkok, which typically closes off streets in April for water fights, has called off Songkran activities to reduce of risk of an outbreak. The city has also asked businesses and malls to not hold activities including water fights.
Siam Piwat, which operates popular malls like Siam Paragon, said they would have smaller events to celebrate the culture of Songkran and not draw large gatherings.
The beach resort town of Patong in Phuket Island, famous for its nightlife, has also canceled Songkran events, which usually includes musical performances and dances.
Thailand on Friday had a total of 75 coronavirus cases.
Neighboring Cambodia canceled celebrations in Siem Reap, where the first Cambodian was confirmed to have fallen ill with the virus on Saturday, and Laos urged citizens to avoid mass gatherings in a statement on Wednesday.
An official from Luang Prabang told Radio Free Asia all public events to mark the new year in the city had been called off.
""Only necessary traditional rituals will be allowed,"" the official said.
Despite close links with China, where the virus originated in Wuhan city, Southeast Asia has had fewer cases than other regions, though some fear they are going under-reported due to weak healthcare systems and lack of testing.
""It is difficult to predict what will happen in Myanmar, but the global situation is not good,"" Kaung Sithu, the organizer of one big annual new year party in the commercial capital of Yangon told Reuters by phone.
""Now is the time to be concerned, we do not want to be reckless and gather people."""
1021,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 07:03AM ET</span>",WHO officials rethink epidemic messaging amid pandemic debate,"By Kate Kelland and Stephanie Nebehay
LONDON (Reuters) - The World Health Organization is considering changing the way it classifies and describes international epidemics, amid a protracted public debate over whether to call the outbreak of the new coronavirus a pandemic.
Officials at the Geneva-based WHO – who this week described it as a pandemic for the first time - are reviewing how the health agency communicates its risk assessment of disease outbreaks in the future, said two people familiar with the discussions. They said that included use of the term pandemic as well as PHEIC, which stands for public health emergency of international concern.
Among ideas that have been discussed is whether to use a more graded approach to capture different levels of severity, rather than binary terminology, the two people said. That would enable the WHO to dial up the severity of its messaging to prompt global cooperation on issues such as funding and drug development across the public health and scientific community, but without causing unnecessary public alarm.
WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has publicly signaled support for a more nuanced approach, saying the current system of declaring a public health emergency is too blunt. 
""It's either red or green,"" Tedros said during a Jan. 29 conference with news media. ""I think we have to now revise that. You cannot have just yes or no. There could be some intermediate situation."" He suggested a yellow stage that could be “a warning…serious enough but not really red.”
The agency’s emergency committee on the new coronavirus, which is made up of independent experts, alluded to the internal discussions the following day. In a Jan. 30 statement following a meeting at which it declared a public health emergency, the panel said it recommended that the WHO “continue to explore the advisability of creating an intermediate level of alert” between PHEIC or no PHEIC.
WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said that currently the decision on declaring a public health emergency of international concern, or PHEIC, is “binary.” She said the WHO’s emergency committee on coronavirus suggested, and the director general agreed, to meet to “review whether the existing instrument is still fit for purpose.”
The discussion around the agency’s messaging on epidemics comes as it seeks to coordinate the global fight against an outbreak of infection with the newly identified coronavirus, which emerged in December. Now known as COVID-19, it has spread from China to more than 100 countries, killing thousands of people with more expected to die.
While many public health experts say the WHO’s response to this epidemic has been timely and decisive, the agency has also drawn criticism from some commentators who say it has been too quick to heap praise on China – a criticism Tedros has strongly rejected, saying China’s drastic measures have slowed the virus spread and allowed other countries to prepare. The agency also came under intense media scrutiny in recent weeks as it refrained from calling the infectious disease’s spread a pandemic, even as it took grip in scores of countries around the world. 
When the WHO did on Wednesday describe COVID-19 as a pandemic, Director General Tedros said the agency was concerned about “the alarming levels of spread and severity” of coronavirus. While the characterization doesn’t trigger any formal change in what the agency does or it recommends countries do, some public health experts said it might prompt governments to move more swiftly to make interventions, such as banning or restricting public gatherings or travel. 
GLOBAL HEALTH EMERGENCY 
Under the WHO’s International Health Regulations, the agency can formally declare a PHEIC (pronounced ""fake""), or global health emergency, which it did with COVID-19 on Jan. 30. Such declarations are made when an epidemic meets two criteria: The outbreak poses a risk to more than one country and it requires a coordinated international response. The formal designation triggers various moves, including calls for increased funding and resources, recommendations to countries aimed at preventing or reducing cross-border spread of disease and boosting public health measures.
The WHO has declared PHEICs on five previous occasions, including the West Africa Ebola outbreak starting in 2014 and the 2016 Zika virus outbreak that spread from Brazil.
In 2009, the WHO declared the outbreak of H1N1 flu a pandemic. That move later drew criticism from some governments that it triggered some countries to take expensive measures, including stockpiling and prescribing anti-viral drugs and undertaking mass vaccinations against a flu that ultimately turn out to be milder than originally thought. The then-director general, Dr. Margaret Chan, has defended her decision as the “right call.”
How the WHO communicates around global epidemics was under review even before the COVID-19 outbreak began in December, according to the two people familiar with the discussions.
According to one of those people, the discussion was prompted in part by last year’s outbreak of Ebola in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, which the WHO declared a PHEIC in July 2019. WHO officials wanted to sound an alarm and prompt a global response in terms of funding and vaccines, but there were questions among some officials at the WHO and member states about whether it was truly an international issue because the Ebola outbreak affected only Congo and neighboring Uganda, the person said. They added that these questions focused discussion on whether a graded approach might be more appropriate.
When COVID-19 began spreading beyond China, global health officials and experts looked to the WHO to declare a PHEIC. Even after it did so in late January, the agency faced repeated questions from international media on whether or not the outbreak was a pandemic.
PANDEMIC CONTROL
Some WHO chiefs have expressed concern that using the label pandemic might signal to governments and the public that the coronavirus outbreak had developed to a level where there was no longer action they could take to control its spread.
That was a key part of the WHO’s message when it did ultimately call the coronavirus as a pandemic. “We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic. This is the first pandemic that can be controlled,” Tedros said in a tweet Wednesday.
WHO officials and some global health experts said the media’s focus on the word pandemic was an unwanted distraction for them because, unlike the PHEIC classification, it doesn’t trigger specific responses within countries.
""There is an unhelpful alignment in people's minds between this 'pandemic' word and some sort of major shift in approach - but this is not the case,"" Mike Ryan, head of WHO's health emergencies program, told reporters at a March 3 briefing for news media.
A sign of the WHO’s frustration was visible during a news conference this week – one of around 30 hour-long briefings the WHO has held for international media since the COVID-19 outbreak began. A senior official who had been asked repeatedly by journalists about whether the disease constituted a pandemic gave a half-joking but tetchy response: ""This is a word you love, right? You just can't wait, can you?"" 
Some specialists agree that the external focus on the label pandemic have been a distraction, including Lawrence Gostin, a global health expert at Georgetown University Law School in Washington. Gostin has been openly critical of the WHO in the past - in particular for what he considered to be moving too slowly to declare international emergencies over Ebola and Zika. With the COVID-19 outbreak, however, Gostin said the WHO was right to not describe it as a pandemic prematurely because the word tends to generate fear.
Global health specialists say that more subtleties in how WHO messages around epidemics could be useful, but say they doubt it will make much practical difference.

""In the end if you move from a binary to a three or four stage process, you'll always have these semantic arguments,"" said Jeremy Farrar, an expert in infectious disease epidemics and director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity. ""And is there really a difference between a global epidemic and a pandemic? And does it make a difference to what we do?” he said. “I don't think so.""

After the coronavirus outbreak in China late last year, the virus is now spreading rapidly in Europe. Measures against it have included the Czech Republic and Slovakia tightening their borders and Austria introducing border checks to deny entry from Italy, the country hit the hardest by the coronavirus in Europe.
Swedish interior minister Mikael Damberg said before a meeting in Brussels that countries introducing tighter border measures must be careful not to aggravate the healthcare emergency.
""You have to take the right measures at the right time,"" he said. ""They must be aware that (the) transportation system has to work for food and healthcare materials - the kind of things that are important for European countries so we don't make problems for each other handling the crisis.""
Sweden has had some border checks in place inside what should normally be the EU's Schengen zone of free travel since a sharp increase in arrivals of refugees and migrants from the Middle East in 2015-16.
Back then, several EU countries shut down their borders to prevent people from moving across the bloc toward wealthy states such as Germany and Sweden to seek asylum.
The Schengen zone all but collapsed and several countries still have some form of border controls in place years later.
The EU's top interior official, Commissioner Ylva Johansson, said that any border curbs must be ""coordinated, operational, proportionate and effective"".
Austria has also introduced border checks to deny entry from Italy, the country hit the hardest by the coronavirus spread in Europe.
""We should try to find a European agreement. I don't think we should shut borders,"" said Luxembourg's interior minister Jean Asselborn.
The EU's economic powerhouse, Germany, has not acted to tighten its borders for now, It has left its regions to decide on school closures and announced steps to cushion the economic hit of the pandemic.
But Spain stepped up its response significantly on Thursday as infections soared, placing four towns under quarantine. It has also ordered a ban on flights from Italy.
Croatia's interior minister, Davor Bozinovic, echoed the call for more EU coordination.
""We are too close to each other. If we were acting in one way, it would be much better for all us,"" he said."

""I want to retire. But even now, they keep on saying, 'are you going to come back? Are you going to help us?'"" Mahathir said in an interview at his office in Kuala Lumpur.
""I will be very selfish if I say I want to enjoy life and all that. To me, this is a duty.""
Still recovering from the political back-stabbing, Mahathir appeared concerned by the risk of coronavirus as he greeted Reuters reporters with the Indian-style namaste, pressing his palms together, rather than shaking hands.
Mahathir was first prime minister between 1981 and 2003. He came out of retirement to join hands with old rival Anwar Ibrahim to oust the corruption-tainted United Malays National Organization led by Najib Razak. But, his second stint in power lasted less than two years.
He was replaced by his former interior minister Muhyiddin, who was able to command more support in their Bersatu party and broke with Mahathir to ally with UMNO, which had lost the 2018 election amid a backlash over a multi-billion dollar graft scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd. The new ruling alliance also includes a Malay Islamist party, PAS.
This week, Muhyiddin said he had written to Mahathir to request a meeting and apologize, but he is likely to be given short shrift.
""What's the good of asking for forgiveness when he did this thing in front of me. He split up my party because he wanted to be a prime minister,"" Mahathir told Reuters.
Mahathir said he will wait and see how Muhyiddin deals with ruling coalition leaders who are facing corruption charges, including former premier Najib, before deciding on any possible reconciliation with the prime minister.
""I'm watching what this government is going to do with the people who are under trial... Whether it is a proper conviction, whether the sentence is commensurate with the crime committed,"" said Mahathir.
""All these things we have to see.""
Najib is now facing dozens of corruption charges over state fund 1MDB, from which U.S. and Malaysian investigators say over $4.5 billion was misappropriated. He has pleaded not guilty.
Mahathir said the United States should ""think twice"" before giving Malaysia back the money recovered from its anti-kleptocracy probe, as the party accused of graft at 1MDB was back in power.
Next month, Mahathir said he plans to seek re-election as chairman of his Bersatu party, but he expects Muhyiddin, the party's president, to challenge him.
Muhyiddin's move against Mahathir stemmed from fears that the coalition was losing Malay support due to the presence of ethnic-Chinese politicians. He also did not want Anwar to take over from Mahathir, sources have told Reuters.
Mahathir said Anwar should be patient in his pursuit of the premiership and that Anwar is ""not all that popular"" at the moment.
Reuters reported this month that the political machinations that led to Mahathir's resignation began several months ago with his knowledge, the aim being to block Anwar from taking power.
Mahathir said he was aware of talks between some in his coalition and the then opposition, but he never expected them to go against his word.
""I was aware they were talking,"" he said, adding that he had never asked them to stop the talks. ""No, I never asked because I feel that I have a strong argument. And I thought that people will follow me."""

The Kremlin issued the plea a day after Russia's lower house of parliament said it was disinfecting its chamber after a lawmaker ignored coronavirus quarantine to attend assembly sessions, including one where President Vladimir Putin gave a speech. 
Moscow says it has officially recorded 34 cases of coronavirus and that nobody has died. Some doctors have questioned whether those figures are accurate however given what they say is the patchy nature of testing. 
""I want to address all members of the Kremlin press pool (that covers Putin) and all journalists and editors ... who cover the president's activities in the Kremlin,"" said Dmitry Peskov, Putin's spokesman.
""Be especially vigilant when it comes to any signs of coronavirus. If you simply feel unwell, please do not come to the Kremlin, do no take part in journalistic work in the Kremlin."" 
Peskov said Putin's own medical care arrangements were of an extraordinary high level and that he was working at full capacity as usual.
He declined to say whether Putin had taken a coronavirus test.
""Detailed information about the president's health is not meant for wide publication,"" said Peskov. 
Commenting on the incident earlier this week when a lawmaker ignored Russia's coronavirus self-isolation rules to attend a parliamentary session where Putin gave a speech, Peskov said he was confident that there was no risk to Putin's own health.

""I'm convinced that the president did not have any contact with this lawmaker,"" said Peskov.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States waged a series of precision air strikes on Thursday against an Iran-backed militia in Iraq that it blamed for a major rocket attack a day earlier that killed two American troops and a 26-year-old British soldier. 
The U.S. strikes appeared limited in scope and narrowly tailored, targeting five weapons storage facilities used by Kataib Hezbollah militants, including stores of weaponry for past attacks on U.S.-led coalition troops, the Pentagon said.
In a statement, Iraq's military said the U.S. air strikes hit four locations in Iraq that housed formal Iraqi police and military units, in addition to the paramilitary groups. 
Three Iraqi army soldiers were killed and four wounded, police in Babel province said in a statement. Five paramilitary fighters and one policeman were also injured, they said, adding that the fate of two more policemen was unknown.
One strike hit an Iraqi civilian airport under construction in the holy Shi'ite Muslim city of Kerbala and killed a worker, Iraqi religious authorities said on Friday.
The U.S. military did not estimate how many people in Iraq may have been killed in the strikes, which officials said were carried out by piloted aircraft. 
But there was no sign of the kind of high-profile killing that President Donald Trump authorized in January, when the United States targeted a top Iranian general, Qassem Soleimani.
U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper, in a Pentagon statement detailing the strikes, cautioned that the United States was prepared to respond again, if needed.
""We will take any action necessary to protect our forces in Iraq and the region,"" Esper said.
Trump had been quick to authorize the U.S. military to respond following Wednesday's attack in Iraq, in which militants fired dozens of 107 mm Katyusha rockets from a truck, striking Iraq's Taji military camp north of Baghdad.
About 18 of the roughly 30 rockets fired hit the base. No one has claimed responsibility for the attack.
It was the third time in recent months the U.S. military lashed out against Kataib Hezbollah. It killed more than two dozen militants in December in response to an attack on an Iraqi base that killed a U.S. contractor.
The U.S. military drone strike in January that targeted Soleimani also killed Kataib Hezbollah founder Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis.
It was unclear if the latest strikes would deter further militant action. The Taji rocket attack took place on what would have been Soleimani's 63rd birthday, suggesting the militants still sought revenge.
FURTHER ATTACKS?
Dennis Ross, a former U.S. ambassador now at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy think tank, cast doubt on the Pentagon's ability to deter Kataib Hezbollah.
""Regrettably, these attacks on our forces will continue as Iran has no problem fighting to the last of the Shia militias and believe they can force us out of Iraq,"" he said on Twitter.
Iran retaliated for the U.S. drone strike that killed Soleimani by launching missiles from its territory at an Iraq base hosting U.S. troops, causing brain injuries to more than 100.
In the latest attack, 14 U.S.-led coalition personnel were wounded, including American, British, Polish and other nationals. Private-industry contractors were among the wounded. 
U.S. Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Pentagon reporters that five of the wounded were categorized as ""urgent,"" suggesting serious injuries that could require rapid medical evacuation.
Britain identified its fallen service member as Lance Corporal Brodie Gillon. The United States has not yet identified its service members killed.
In a sign of concern that tension between the United States and Iran could be headed toward open conflict, the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to limit Trump's ability to wage war against Iran.
The Republican president has been engaged in a maximum-pressure campaign of renewed sanctions and near-constant rhetoric against Iran, after pulling the United States out of the international nuclear deal struck under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have mostly played out on Iraqi soil in recent months.

Iran-backed paramilitary groups have regularly been rocketing and shelling bases in Iraq that host U.S. forces and the area around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan police said on Friday that they had arrested a retired general who plans to stand for president on suspicion that he sought support from neighboring Rwanda to remove President Yoweri Museveni.
Henry Tumukunde, a former ally of Museveni and ex-security minister, was detained on Thursday.
Police said in a statement he was held on charges of treason, accusing him of enlisting ""the support of a neighboring country to support him in removing the current leadership"" - an apparent reference to Rwanda.
While appearing on NBS television on March 4 Tumukunde said: ""If I was Rwanda I would wish to support people who want to cause change in Uganda.""
Relations between Uganda and Rwanda have been strained for more than a year over accusations that they support each other's dissidents.
Uganda is due to hold its next presidential election early next year.
Museveni, in power since 1986, is one of Africa's longest-ruling leaders. Government critics and rights campaigners accuse him of using tactics including intimidation by security forces to maintain his grip on power.
A committee of the ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) has already endorsed him to stand for re-election.
One of his opponents will be Bobi Wine, a pop star and lawmaker whose large support base among the youth has fueled worry in the ruling party and provoked a security crackdown on his supporters.
His rallies have frequently been dispersed by security forces using teargas, beatings and arrests.
In the statement, the police also accused Tumukunde of inciting violence and hatred.
""His utterances in a series of radio and television interviews...seek to foster hatred that might lead to inter-community violence,"" it said.
Tumukunde has said that if he is elected, he would speed up Uganda's preparations for the pumping of its crude oil reserves.
Production of the reserves, discovered 14 years ago, has been repeatedly delayed by disagreements with international oil firms and slow progress in the construction of infrastructure such as an export pipeline."
1031,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 13, 2020 05:07AM ET</span>",Every Russian regional parliament backs changes allowing Putin to extend rule - RIA,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - All of Russia's 85 regional parliaments have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that would allow Vladimir Putin to run again for president again in 2024, the RIA news agency cited senior Russian lawmaker Andrei Klishas as saying on Friday. 
Putin in January unveiled a major shake-up of Russian politics and a constitutional overhaul, which the Kremlin billed as a redistribution of power from the presidency to parliament.
But Putin, 67, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for two decades as either president or prime minister, made a dramatic appearance in parliament this week to back a new amendment that would allow him to ignore a current constitutional ban on him running again in 2024.
His intervention raised the prospect of him remaining in power until 2036, though the Kremlin points out that Putin has not yet said whether he will run again in 2024. 
Both houses of the national parliament have since backed the new amendment and a majority of regional parliaments endorsed it on Thursday, sufficient for it to move to the next stage of the approval process.
But Klishas was cited on Friday as saying that every single one of Russia's 85 regional parliaments had now said yes.
""The Federation Council (the upper house of parliament) has received the results of voting in all 85 regional parliaments,"" said Klishas. ""They are all positive,"" RIA cited him as saying.
The list of 85 regions he referenced includes two which are part of Russian-controlled Crimea, which Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.
Russia's constitutional court must now examine the constitutional changes, which are due to be put to a nationwide vote in April. 

Vyacheslav Volodin, the speaker of Russia's lower house of parliament, told lawmakers on Thursday to rally behind Vladimir Putin against what he said was a foreign campaign to discredit the constitutional reforms.

""The international community, including the U.S., have different opinions about the origin of the virus,"" said Geng.
Geng did not directly comment when asked whether his colleague Zhao Lijian's comments were consistent with Beijing's official views on the virus, which first surfaced late last year in China's central city of Wuhan and has now infected more than 100,000 people globally.
The origin of the virus is a scientific matter and as such scientific views should be listened to, said Geng.
On Thursday, Zhao tweeted in English and Chinese: ""When did patient zero begin in US? How many people are infected? What are the names of the hospitals? It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!""
Zhao accompanied his post with a video of Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, saying that some Americans who had seemingly died from influenza later tested positive for the new coronavirus.
A hashtag referring to Zhao's posts was trending on the Chinese social media platform Weibo on Friday with more than 89,000 mentions.
Zhao, an avid and often combative user of social media, debuted on Feb. 24 as the foreign ministry's newest spokesperson. He was previously based at China's embassy in Pakistan, a close ally of China.
Earlier on Thursday, his boss and the ministry's top spokesperson Hua Chunying, retweeted the same video of Redfield and said ""It is absolutely WRONG and INAPPROPRIATE to call this the Chinese coronavirus.""
Twitter is blocked in China, though Chinese diplomats have taken to the platform with increasing gusto, tweeting in English aiming at a foreign audience."

CHRISTCHURCH (Reuters) - Aya al-Umari looks at the bunches of flowers and reads messages of support outside the Al Noor mosque, tributes left for the victims of the Christchurch shootings a year on from the attacks.
Al-Umari's brother Hussein, 35, was one of 51 Muslim worshippers killed when a gunman opened fire at the city's Al Noor and Linwood mosques.
""We live it day in and day out,"" she told Reuters outside the mosque. 
""A year on anniversary is a great way for us to come together as a community and reflect on the incident that took the lives of many people and ultimately my brother too.""
Among the tributes outside the Al Noor mosque were signs reading ""We may be small, but we are strong"" and ""We love you!""
Brenton Tarrant, an Australian national, faces 92 charges in relation to the attacks. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in June. 
Police were at the mosque on Friday after a new threat was reported last week. 
Adele Carroll and her husband Des came to the Al Noor mosque to donate a prayer mat and an Islamic clock.
""We felt we should do this. Having lived abroad with several Muslim and Arab friends, we were hurt by what had happened here,"" Carroll said. ""We are all one ... it doesn't matter what religion or race you are. We just could not believe this could happen in our country.""
Across the city, hundreds of people attended a private prayer service at a civic center. The turnout was lower than expected as many stayed away due to concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, a factor that may also impact a memorial service planned for Sunday.
""One year has passed, but for us, it just feels like yesterday,"" Abdul Aziz, who was hailed by local media for trying to stop the shooter, said outside the prayer service.
Taj Mohammad Kamran, who was shot in the leg and lost his friend, said it has been a very tough year: ""But today, I feel more strong.""

WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland's President Andrzej Duda will not travel to Russia next month due to the coronavirus, missing ceremonies marking the 10-year anniversary of a plane crash which killed Poland's president, central bank chief and military commanders.
The plane crash in thick fog over a small airport in Russia stunned Poland, exacerbating political divisions and reviving historic suspicions about Russia, its former Cold War master.
The death of Lech Kaczynski, the country's then president and twin brother of the current head of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party Jaroslaw, sparked various theories over what caused the crash.
An inquiry by the previous government returned a verdict of pilot error, but PiS has argued the crash could have been caused by an explosion on board. Some in Poland believe they were murdered.
""The president will not fly to Smolensk...as he had hoped,"" a government official with knowledge of the decision told Reuters.
""All options are still on the table with regards to the prime minister,"" he added, emphasizing how important the anniversary was to the party.
Ties between Moscow and Warsaw have plumbed new lows after a series of comments made by Russian President Vladimir Putin last December about Poland bearing some responsibility for the outbreak of World War Two.
But Russian authorities said earlier this year they would cooperate with Poland to allow anniversary ceremonies in Smolensk to proceed.
Poland has since taken drastic measures to limit the spread of the coronavirus, closing schools, museums, theaters and cinemas while also declaring a state of epidemic threat.
Officials close to the prime minister said they hope the spread of the coronavirus may subside in the next month ahead of the anniversary, allowing more senior Polish officials to travel, but realistically this may not be the case.
Poland has confirmed 58 cases of the coronavirus and one death, while Russia has 28 cases.
Alternate ceremonies and arrangements are being considered, such as sending diplomatic staff to the event in Russia while holding the main ceremony in Krakow on April 18, the anniversary of former president Lech Kaczynski's funeral, an official said.
No formal decision has yet been made about the events surrounding the anniversary, the prime minister's spokesman Piotr Muller told Reuters.
A plan is likely to be announced either by the end of this week or early next week after further discussions on the matter, he added.
The president's spokesman declined to comment.
""It's up to them (the Polish authorities) to decide if they intend to organise memorial ceremonies in Smolensk and to inform the media about it,"" the Embassy of Russia in Poland told Reuters in an email response.
Russia has canceled its annual economic forum in St. Petersburg, initially scheduled for June, over the virus."

KATHMANDU (Reuters) - Nepal has closed all of its Himalayan peaks including Mount Everest this climbing season because of fears of the coronavirus outbreak, a government minister said on Friday.
Nepal, home to eight of the world's 14 highest mountains including Mount Everest, gets more than four million dollars in permit fees for the world's highest peak and other mountains every year.
Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai said expeditions to all peaks in the March-May spring season had been suspended. 
""Climbing this season has been closed,” Bhattarai told Reuters. 
""It is as a precaution for that,"" he added, when asked it its was because of the coronavirus.
Nepal has confirmed just one case of the coronavirus - a student studying in China on a trip home - out of 450 people tested.
The suspension of expeditions in Nepal will affect hundreds of foreign climbers now preparing for the spring season, a window or relatively good weather between the end of the bitterly cold winter and the rainy season, which begins in June.
Everest, the world's highest mountain at 8,850 meters (29,035 feet), is on the border between Nepal and the Chinese region of Tibet. China announced the closure of its side of the mountain on Thursday.
It is the second time in recent years that the climbing season has been disrupted. Expeditions were suspended in 2015 after a major earthquake struck Nepal on April 25 that year, killing some 9,000 people.
Eighteen people were killed at the Everest base camp when an avalanche triggered by the quake roared down a slope.
""This is disappointing news for both our expedition leaders and our clients who have trained for months for this year’s climb,"" Lukas Furtenbach, of the California-based guiding company Furtenbach Adventure, said.
Adrian Ballinger of the Alpenglow Expeditions company said he understood the decision.
“While cancelling a climb is never an outcome we want, this time, it’s the responsible thing to do,” Ballinger said in a statement.
“A COVID-19 outbreak at base camp would be dangerous and potentially devastating,” he said.
Nepal would also stop issuing visas on arrival until April 30, an official said.

BEIJING (Reuters) - As Xi Jinping toured the coronavirus-stricken city of Wuhan this week, setting the tone for an official narrative that China will win a ""People's War"", numerous social media users went to extraordinary lengths to make an alternative voice heard.
The effort to get around China's censors and publish the words of Wuhan doctor Ai Fen, the first to sound the alarm over the virus, was among the most elaborate in an outpouring of dissent against the government narrative as the outbreak exacts a devastating human and economic toll. 
In a bid to fool censors' AI software, netizens translated an interview with Ai, head of the emergency room at Wuhan Central Hospital, into at least five languages and reformatted it in at least 22 ways.
The text was rendered backwards, into emojis, Braille, oracle bone script, Morse code, song sheets and even the Elvish language from Lord of the Rings.
""The scale and intensity of the pushback against propaganda during this virus outbreak is unprecedented,"" said Zhan Jiang, a media professor at Beijing Foreign Studies University.
""To some extent, the '404 system' has collapsed temporarily,"" he told Reuters, referring to the error message that appears when content has been moved or deleted. ""It will bounce back into this seesaw game with the netizens."" 
Under Xi, censorship has steadily tightened. Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the National University of Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, expects that to continue after the virus outbreak.
""Aware that many are unhappy, it is in the nature of the party to adopt the strategy of offence as defence,"" he said, referring to the ruling Communist Party.
The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet regulator, did not reply to a request for comment.
Xi acknowledged the suffering of those infected or forced to stay at home when he visited Wuhan.
""People under lengthy quarantine have some frustrations to vent,"" which should be understood and tolerated, state television cited him as saying.
In the article that was repeatedly deleted and reposted, Ai recounted how instead of taking early precautions after she warned others about the virus, the hospital chastised her for spreading rumors and causing panic - part of the suppression of early information that exacerbated the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
""Had I known how things would turn out, I wouldn't care if I got criticised. I would've told the whole world,"" Ai, who has lost patients and colleagues to the novel coronavirus, said in the interview with Chinese magazine People, giving a grim account of deaths and the strain on medical staff.
Neither Ai nor a hospital representative could immediately be reached for comment.
'DECISIVE BATTLE'
Xi, who was conspicuously absent from state media coverage in the outbreak's early days, has become the face of the virus fight. After his Wuhan visit, state news outlet Xinhua posted a video, ""The People's Leader commanding the decisive battle."" 
There is little sign that Xi has been politically weakened by the outbreak. Indeed, the worsening global pandemic makes China's response look effective, strengthening Beijing's official narrative.
After Xi visited a Wuhan hospital and stood in front of a red banner that said, ""Resolutely winning the people's war"", Fang Fang, a Wuhan novelist who has gained a following by posting diary entries about life in a city under lockdown, wrote: ""Remember, there is no win, only an end."" 
Fang's postings are often scrubbed from social media, but her blog is intact on Caixin, an independent media outlet, where each entry gets tens of thousands of reads.
The death from coronavirus last month of Li Wenliang, a doctor from the same Wuhan hospital and one of the eight given a police warning for circulating Ai's message about the disease, triggered a rare outpouring of outrage against authorities. The government ended up honoring Li among more than 500 ""model healthcare workers"". 
""A healthy society should have more than one voice,"" Li said in a Caixin interview before his death from the virus, in what became a rallying cry for free speech among Chinese netizens.
Last week, a rare view of public anger involving a top central official went viral: a video clip showed residents of a Wuhan apartment complex accusing employees of staging the delivery of groceries to impress a high-level inspection tour, jeering, ""It's fake!"" 
Last Friday, Wuhan party secretary Wang Zhonglin's launch of a ""gratitude education"" campaign asking residents to be thankful to Xi and the party triggered backlash.
""Anyone with a conscience would not demand the people of Wuhan, still reeling from shock, to be grateful,"" commentator Chu Zhaoxin said in a WeChat article that went viral.

The official newspaper article announcing Wang's campaign was later removed.

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday urged people not gather in groups of more than 500 but said he would still go to a weekend rugby game, as health officials warned millions of residents will contract coronavirus within months.
Australia has recorded 156 infections and three deaths from the flu-like disease, figures that authorities expect to increase rapidly in the coming weeks.
Morrison said his government will from Monday advise against non-essential gatherings of more than 500 people, though this does not include schools, airports or public transport.
""This is an early-stage action that we are undertaking to
make sure we get ahead of this,"" Morrison told reporters in Sydney, adding Australians should also reconsider their need for any overseas travel.
The virus has so far infected almost 135,000 and killed more than 4,900 worldwide.
Health officials warned millions of Australians will contract the coronavirus within the next six months.
""We're anticipating 20% of the population in the first wave to be affected,"" Kerry Chant, the chief medical officer for the New South Wales (NSW) state government.
Home to more than 7 million people, NSW is Australia's most populous state, and Chant said models suggest 5% of the state's population - some 350,000 people - will need hospital treatment as a result of coronavirus.
KEEP CALM AND CARRY ON
Australia ban on foreigners from arriving from China, Iran and South Korea was extended on Thursday to cover Italy, and has formed a key part of Australia's move to stop the spread of the virus.
Morrison has spent much of the past week urging locals to remain calm while trying to reassure nervous financial markets.
On Thursday he said his government would inject A$17.6 billion ($11.1 billion) to spur an economy hammered by the coronavirus outbreak.
But Morrison's urging for calm has largely fallen on deaf ears. Hundreds of Australians have began stockpiling goods, from staples to sanitizers, while the country's share market has been battered in the past week.
SPORTING UPHEAVAL
Australia's updated medical advice was a key catalyst behind the cancellation of the Australian Formula One Grand Prix and an order for a cricket series between Australia and New Zealand to be played behind closed doors.
Two of the sports-mad country's most popular sports, rugby league and Australian Rules football, are beginning their seasons with games that typically draw tens of thousands of spectators, raising the risk of contagion.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the Australian Rules football league season may need to be suspended. The country's biggest and best-attended football code is due to begin its season on March 19.
Morrison said he would attend a weekend rugby league game to watch his favorite Cronulla Sharks team.
""It might be the last game I get to go to for a long time. That's fine. In the future I suspect we might be watching them on television."""

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will be in isolation for two weeks after his wife, Sophie, tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday, and the outbreak prompted the province of Ontario to shutter schools to limit the spread.
Sophie Gregoire Trudeau recently returned from London and experienced flu-like symptoms, so she was tested for the coronavirus, the prime minister's office said earlier on Thursday. The test came back positive, it said in the evening.
""The Prime Minister is in good health with no symptoms. As a precautionary measure and following the advice of doctors, he will be in isolation for a planned period of 14 days,"" an official statement said. Sophie will be in quarantine for 14 days. 
""The Prime Minister will continue to fully assume his duties and will address Canadians tomorrow.""
In a personal note, Sophie said she was ""experiencing uncomfortable symptoms of the virus,"" adding that she ""will be back on my feet soon"". 
Canada reported 145 new case of the virus, a three-fold gain from a week ago. There has been one death. Seven of Canada's 10 provinces have recorded infections. 
Ontario, the most populous province, reported 17 new cases overnight, a 40% jump. To contain the virus, authorities ordered all schools to close from Saturday to April 5.
Globally, more than 127,000 people have been infected by the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19. 
In a blow to hockey-obsessed Canadians, the National Hockey League suspended its season because of the outbreak, although it said its goal was to resume play ""as soon as it is appropriate and prudent,"" so teams can compete for the Stanley Cup championship. 
With the Canadian dollar at a four-year low against its U.S. counterpart and stocks plunging, the Bank of Canada announced measures to inject liquidity into the market.
Working from home on Thursday, Trudeau spoke with U.S. President Donald Trump, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte and joined a special cabinet meeting on the coronavirus by phone, his spokesman said on Twitter. 
The Pacific province of British Columbia, north of Washington state, advised against all non-essential foreign travel, including to the United States. Washington is one of the worst-affected states.
Any warning that involves the United States is politically sensitive, given the two countries' 5,525-mile (8,890-km) shared border and Canada's overwhelming reliance on bilateral trade.
""This is really important ... the evolving situation both in the United States and globally is a risk for all of us,"" British Columbia's provincial chief medical officer, Bonnie Henry, told reporters.
Alberta's chief medical officer, Deena Hinshaw, banned gatherings of more than 250 people and canceled all international events. Hinshaw also discouraged foreign travel.
Quebec, which has recorded 13 cases, has banned all indoor events with more than 250 people and said people returning from any foreign country should self-isolate for 14 days. Health and education public-sector workers who travel abroad will be required to self-isolate.
Separately, Canadian authorities canceled the JUNO music awards, Canada's version of the Grammys, and Toronto's annual St. Patrick's Day parade was suspended.
Ottawa committed C$1 billion ($723 million) on Wednesday toward bolstering the healthcare system and limiting the impact of the virus, while Ontario said on Thursday it had set aside C$100 million in ""contingency funding.""

On Thursday, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said the public health crisis alone would cost the country ""well north of C$10 billion.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea reported more recoveries from the coronavirus than new infections on Friday for the first time since its outbreak emerged in January, as a downward trend in daily cases raised hopes that Asia's biggest epidemic outside China may be slowing. 
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) recorded 110 new coronavirus cases on Friday compared with 114 a day earlier, taking the national tally to 7,979. In contrast, 177 patients were released from hospitals where they had been isolated for treatment. 
This marks the first time that the daily number of recovered people exceeded that of new infections since South Korea's first patient was confirmed on Jan. 20. 
The latest figures are in line with a downward trend in new cases which has raised hopes that the outbreak may be easing in Asia's fourth-largest economy.
But officials urged vigilance after new clusters of infections emerged at a call center in a crowded part of capital Seoul, and a government agency in the administrative city of Sejong. 
""We've managed to turn the corner, but there are concerns about overseas inflows, as well as possible infections at home around such facilities as call centers, computer cafes and karaoke rooms,"" Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said at a meeting in Daegu. 
Of the latest 110 cases, 61 were from the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu where a fringe Christian church at the center of the epidemic is located, while 17 and 13 were in Sejong and Seoul, respectively. 
At least 109 cases so far have been linked to the call center, operated by an insurance company whose 800-strong workforce is being tested or in quarantine for monitoring. 
Seoul city plans to carry out extensive checks on some 10,500 computer cafes and karaoke bars as part of efforts to prevent the spread of the virus in crowded workplaces, Mayor Park Won-soon told a briefing. 
Global alarm over the coronavirus intensified, with governments from Europe to the United States unveiling new measures aimed at slowing the spread of a disease that has infected almost 135,000 people worldwide.

South Korea said it will subject visitors from France, Germany, Britain, Spain and the Netherlands to reinforced border checks starting Sunday, after imposing similar rules for China, Italy and Iran suffering a major outbreak.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - True to form, U.S. President Donald Trump has warned coronavirus could spread from Mexico, touting his anti-migrant wall as a solution. Seen from south of the border though, the greater risk is infection from the much bigger outbreak in the United States. 
Residents of the city of Tijuana, just across from San Diego, California, have for years crossed back and forth daily to reach jobs and schools. Many say they are now wary of bringing back the contagious disease from the U.S. side.
Perla Macias, a Tijuana resident who heads into California to tend a make-up concession in a mall, now sees her commute as a daily risk, but an unavoidable one. 
""I don't want to get sick, but I don't have a choice,"" she said. ""I work over there.""
In Mexico, authorities have detected 12 cases of the virus so far and no deaths, a fraction of the more than 1,000 confirmed cases in the United States, where there have been dozens of fatalities. 
In California alone 50 cases and four deaths have been confirmed. In Tijuana's state of Baja California, no cases have been confirmed.
WALL WISECRACKS
Last week, Trump wrote on Twitter that his signature border wall is needed ""more than ever,"" citing coronavirus as a new argument for the barrier.
The overwhelming majority of Mexicans oppose the wall, dating back to Trump's campaign for president in which he routinely lashed out at Mexico and its migrants.
Across social media though, Mexicans joked on Thursday that the wall had taken on new purpose - to stop U.S. citizens infecting Mexicans. 
Wisecracks aside, Julian Palombo, a Tijuana business chamber official said what was needed was much tougher measures to check for infections coming from San Diego. 
""It makes sense to build a wall, but a public health wall from over there to here to avoid the risk of possible infections,"" he said.
Like others consulted by Reuters, Palombo bemoaned the lack of checks at busy land crossings into Tijuana, or in nearby airports. He added that face masks and hand sanitizer were in short supply on both sides of the border.
Coronavirus has infected more than 126,000 people globally according to a Reuters tally, most of them in China. In Italy there are 15,000 cases. 
Some experts speculate that the outbreak is more acute in both Mexico and the United States than the relatively low number of confirmed cases suggests, due to insufficient testing for the virus. Mexican authorities say they have a clear containment strategy.
Tijuana Mayor Arturo Gonzalez Cruz has said that he is working with Baja California state officials to implement better health checks on persons crossing on foot each day.
Dulce Molina, whose husband works in a San Diego hotel, supported tougher sanitation measures at the border but said a physical barrier was not a solution to keeping the virus out.

""It's all over the world,"" she said.

1043,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 10:01PM ET</span>",U.S. 'China-bashers' seek to gain from China's coronavirus woes - China Daily,"SHANGHAI (Reuters) - An editorial in the official China Daily on Friday intensified a war of words with the United States, blasting ""China-bashers"" and saying they would ""continue to fling dirt at China"" despite what it called the country's effective pandemic-control efforts.
The editorial follows comments from a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, who tweeted on Thursday that the U.S. lacked transparency and suggested that the U.S. military might have brought the coronavirus to the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.
U.S. National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien had remarked that China reacted slowly to the emergence of the coronavirus, probably costing the world two months when it could have been preparing for the outbreak.
China Daily said that China was an example ""worth heeding"" because of its effective pandemic control measures, offers of foreign aid, transparent information sharing and international cooperation.
""That U.S. politicians feel no qualms about putting their political schemes above global public health has served to expose how deeply they have fallen into the abyss of inhumanity,"" said the editorial. ""In seeking to derive gain from China's coronavirus woes, they have not only opened the doors of the U.S. to the disease but also hindered the unity of purpose the world needs to treat the pandemic and its effects.""
The coronavirus first emerged in December in the central Chinese city of Wuhan and surrounding Hubei province, where around two-thirds of global cases so far have been recorded.
Authorities there initially responded to the outbreak by detaining doctors who discovered the novel coronavirus. One of them, Li Wenliang, later died.
The coronavirus has since spread globally, with new cases rising rapidly, but its progress in China has slowed in the past seven days. In recent weeks the vast majority of new cases have been outside China.
""The stark contrast between the fast increase of infections outside of China, including in the US, and the sharp decrease in the number of cases in China should awaken other countries to the dangers created by the China-bashing orchestrated by a handful of US politicians,"" said the China Daily editorial."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Army soldier and WikiLeaks source Chelsea Manning was released from prison on Thursday on a judge's order after being held since May for refusing to testify in an ongoing U.S. investigation of WikiLeaks.
U.S. District Court Judge Anthony Trenga in Alexandria, Virginia, ordered Manning released because the grand jury hearing the case had concluded.
Alexandria City Sheriff Dana Lawhorne told reporters late on Thursday that Manning had been released from the Alexandria Detention Center.
Trenga rejected a request from Manning to cancel fines that he had imposed for her refusal to testify and ordered her to pay fines totaling $256,000.
A detention hearing for Manning scheduled for Friday was canceled.
""Needless to say we are relieved and ask that you respect her privacy while she gets on her feet,"" Manning's defense team said in an emailed statement.
On Wednesday, a spokesman for Manning's defense team said Manning had attempted to commit suicide and had been taken to hospital, where she was recovering.
Spokesman Andy Stepanian said that in spite of her imprisonment and the imposition of financial sanctions, Manning remained ""unwavering in her refusal to participate in a secret grand jury process that she sees as highly susceptible to abuse."" 
Prior to her recent incarceration for refusing to testify, Manning had served seven years in a military prison for leaking hundreds of thousands of U.S. military messages and cables to WikiLeaks, before being released on the order of President Barack Obama.
WikiLeaks, an internet-based ""dead letter drop"" for leakers of classified or sensitive information, was founded by Australian citizen Julian Assange in 2006.

Assange is being held in a London prison as British courts consider a request from U.S. prosecutors for his extradition to the United States. He is wanted on charges of conspiring with Manning to hack into a Pentagon computer system containing classified materials.

WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Global markets suffered record falls on Thursday as alarm over the coronavirus intensified, and governments from Ireland to Fiji unveiled new measures to try to slow the spread of a disease that has infected more than 127,000 people worldwide.
Travelers (NYSE:TRV) in Europe rushed to board flights to the United States after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sweeping restrictions on travel from the continent, a decision that angered leaders there.
In Europe, North America and Australia events from sports matches to weddings were canceled or suspended, schools were closed and public gatherings restricted or banned.
Trump suggested that the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo could be delayed by a year.
""Maybe they postpone it for a year ... if that's possible,"" Trump told reporters. ""I like that better than I like having empty stadiums all over the place.""
Tokyo 2020 organizers insisted they were moving ahead with preparations to hold ""safe and secure"" Games on schedule, starting in July.
The White House announced it was stopping public tours, while Rome's Catholic churches were ordered closed - a move thought to be unprecedented in modern times - and the city's faithful given dispensation not to attend Sunday mass. Disneyland in California is shutting the gates of its amusement park.
But in China, where the epidemic originated, officials said the disease had peaked and the global spread could be over by June if other nations applied similarly aggressive containment measures as Beijing's communist government, which locked down a province with a population the size of Italy's.
Fears of the impact of such restrictions on the movement of people and goods hit global stocks and oil prices hard.
Major European bourses fell by double-digit percentages for their biggest daily losses on record, led by a 17% slide in Italian stocks (FTMIB). Stimulus efforts from the European Central Bank did little to calm nerves. (EU)
On Wall Street stocks slumped around 10% (DJI) (SPX) in their worst day since the 1987 ""Black Monday"" crash. (N)
The U.S. Federal Reserve offered a hefty $1.5 trillion in short-term loans to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial system.
Australia's central bank followed suit, pumping an usually large amount of cash into the system as panic selling across global markets threatened to drain liquidity and push up borrowing costs.
'MASS PANIC'
Trump had restricted certain travel from Europe to the United States in a televised address on Wednesday, and on Thursday, weary and confused travelers rushed to airports to board the last flights back to the United States.
""It caused a mass panic,"" said 20-year-old Anna Grace, a U.S. student at Suffolk University on her first trip to Europe, who rushed to Madrid's Barajas airport at 5 a.m. to get home.
The outbreak has disrupted industry, travel, entertainment and sports worldwide, and prompted airlines to appeal for urgent aid from their governments.
But its progress in the epicenter of China's Hubei province has slowed markedly amid strict curbs on movement, including the lockdown of provincial capital Wuhan.
Hubei logged just eight new infections on Wednesday, the first time in the outbreak it has recorded a daily tally in single figures. The rest of mainland China had seven new cases, six of them imported from abroad.
""The peak of the epidemic has passed for China,"" said Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission.
The coronavirus has infected more than 127,000 people around the world, the vast majority in China, and killed 4,700, according to a Reuters tally. 
WAR FOOTING
In a wave of announcements, countries and U.S. states unveiled stricter new measures to slow the spread of new infections, some of them reminiscent of a war footing.
""It's going to spread further,"" British Prime Boris Johnson told a news conference. ""I must level with you, level with the British public - more families, many more families, are going to lose loved ones before their time.""
French President Emmanuel Macron said in a television address the country was facing its worst public health crisis in a century and announced measures including the closure of all schools, creches and universities from Monday.
California and New York announced sweeping bans on large gatherings, and more schools, museums and other institutions said they planned to close, including all schools in Ohio and public schools in Maryland. 
In Italy, where the death toll passed 1,000 in Europe's deadliest outbreak, the government imposed a blanket closure of restaurants, bars and almost all shops except food stores and pharmacies.
Ireland will shut schools, universities and childcare facilities until March 29 and restrict mass gatherings.
Some matches in European soccer's elite Champions League were postponed, the Australian Grand Prix was canceled, and in U.S. sports the National Basketball Association and National Hockey League seasons were suspended and Major League Baseball delayed its season. U.S. college basketball's ""March Madness"" tournament was canceled. 
Small island states in the Pacific, ill-equipped to deal with any outbreak, imposed strict lock-down measures including denying access to supply vessels and prohibiting human-to-human contact during aircraft refueling.
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie were in self-isolation after she came down with flu-like symptoms and was tested for the new coronavirus.

Oscar-winning American actor Tom Hanks tested positive in Australia, where he is on a film shoot.

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - A female diplomat from the Philippines mission to the United Nations tested positive for coronavirus on Thursday, according to a note sent to U.N. missions, making the woman the first known case at the world body's New York headquarters.
""As of today, the Philippine Mission is in lockdown, and all personnel are instructed to self-quarantine and to seek medical attention should they develop the symptoms. We are assuming that all of us have been infected,"" wrote Philippines acting U.N. Ambassador Kira Azucena in a message seen by Reuters.
According the online U.N. directory of diplomatic staff, there are about 12 diplomats at the Filipino mission, which is on 5th Avenue in Midtown Manhattan.
The sick diplomat represented the Philippines in the U.N. General Assembly's legal affairs committees. Azucena said the diplomat was last at U.N. headquarters on Monday for about half an hour when she was asymptomatic.
She came down with flu-like symptoms on Tuesday and visited her doctor. ""She got the call today that she tested positive for COVID-19,"" Azucena wrote on Thursday.
The United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the case.
The 193-member world body began implementing coronavirus prevention measures at its Manhattan headquarters this week.
A two-week conference on women's rights was cut to one day, several other planned large conferences canceled, most smaller meetings cut, U.N. missions asked to limit the number of diplomats they send to meetings, and at least half the several thousand U.N. staff who normally work in the building will be working from home by next week.
The World Health Organization has described the coronavirus outbreak as a pandemic. The virus, which has been deadly for some people, broke out in China's Wuhan city late last year and has so far infected some 125,000 people from 118 countries and territories. According to a Reuters tally it has killed 4,700."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. government surveillance tools fiercely opposed by privacy advocates and defended by intelligence agencies will expire after legislation renewing them stalled in the Senate on Thursday, although passage is expected next week.
In a rare bipartisan vote, the Democratic-led House of Representatives backed the ""USA FREEDOM Reauthorization Act of 2020"" on Wednesday. But the measure, which renews and updates domestic surveillance rules under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), must pass the Senate and be signed by President Donald Trump to become law. 
Privacy advocates, including liberal Democrats and libertarian-leaning Republicans, are fiercely critical of FISA. And Trump, who is convinced that surveillance tools covered by the legislation were improperly used against his 2016 campaign, had demanded tighter controls on authorities allowed under the law.
Republican Senator Mike Lee spoke against FISA in the Senate on Thursday, as an effort to quickly pass the House bill fell short.
""The American people deserve more, they deserve better, and we must provide it,"" Lee said, urging Senate leaders to at least allow time to consider amendments to the legislation.
Lee had suggested a 45-day extension of the existing law, but that was blocked by fellow Republican Senator Richard Burr, the chairman of the Intelligence Committee, who wants the House-passed authorization bill to become law.
Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was confident the Senate would pass the bill. ""It's not a question of if this passes but when,"" he said.
McConnell had asked senators to pass the House legislation before leaving Washington for a recess next week. However, McConnell postponed the recess so lawmakers can deal with the coronavirus pandemic, clearing the way for FISA to be renewed after lapsing only briefly.
""I hope we don't have an attack this weekend,"" Burr told reporters after the debate in the Senate with Lee.
Trump's opposition to FISA seemed to have eased after Attorney General William Barr wrote the bill renewing it with Republican and Democratic lawmakers, including reforms that addressed Republican concerns about surveillance of Trump's campaign.
Barr is considered a particularly close ally of Trump's.
But Trump cast some doubt on the FISA bill's future on Thursday.

""Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted 'coup' of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!"" Trump said on Twitter.

NHAMATANDA, Mozambique (Reuters) - Hundred-year-old Vasco Gaspar leans on his walking stick in a field in central Mozambique, gathering maize near the tent where he has lived since floods and winds destroyed his house in March 2019.
Like thousands of others, he is still in a temporary shelter almost a year to the day after Cyclone Idai tore through southern Africa.
He walks with a limp from the injuries he suffered when a wall in his house fell on him during the deluge. He is supposed to get food aid every month, he says, but sometimes the supplies come late. 
""I don't have the strength to work but I don't have a choice ... I need to feed myself,"" he tells Reuters. 
Then he goes back to gathering his food, pulling at the maize stalks that tower above his head.
Gaspar lives on his own in a U.N.-backed government camp in Nhamatanda district, about 70km (40 miles) inland from the port city of Beira where the cyclone hit land on March 14, 2019. 
The government plan is to build up the camp into a permanent settlement. But for now the residents are making do with huts and tents and the small plots of land they have to grow their own crops. 
Cyclone Idai - and then Cyclone Kenneth, which hit just six weeks later - destroyed 700,000 hectares of maize, beans, rice and other produce. In February more floods hit Sofala, the central province worst affected by Idai, swamping more fields.
The International Organization for Migration said in December nearly 100,000 people were still displaced in Mozambique.
The U.N. World Food Program says two million people in the country need food assistance, and it is struggling to reach them all. 
""WFP have been forced to reduce the food ration for those not living in resettlement centers by 50% in order to assist those most vulnerable up to the end of March,"" a spokesman said.
The repeated deluges have tested the huts and tents and other temporary housing.
The government has promised to upgrade the settlements with stronger buildings, but says it has been held up by delayed funding and a host of reporting regulations imposed by different donors.

""It is one of our priorities to rebuild housing in a more resilient way,"" Stela da Graça Novo Pinto Zeca, State Secretary for Sofala, told Reuters. ""We are coming up with a plan to do things faster.""

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has made his second public appearance this week to oversee military drills, despite concerns about the possible spread of the coronavirus.
Kim guided the spot drills on Thursday, which included a firing competition by artillery units to evaluate their combat readiness, the official KCNA news agency said on Friday.
North Korea, sandwiched between China and South Korea, has not confirmed any cases of the coronavirus but has stepped up border checks and imposed quarantine measures.
Photographs published by KCNA showed Kim watching the artillery drills without any protective gear, unlike all the aides accompanying him who were wearing identical black masks.
Kim similarly avoided wearing any kind of protection when he watched missile tests last week and on Monday. Those tests were the first by North Korea in three months.
On Monday, North Korea flew dozens of diplomats out of the country to Russia, including the staff from Germany, France and Switzerland which had closed their missions amid coronavirus concerns.
As well as the border checks, any foreigner from a country that has reported a case of the virus is required to spend 30 days in quarantine.
KCNA said in a separate dispatch that the country was intensifying its prevention efforts.
""All workers are strengthening awareness-raising campaigns about the global spread of the disease and prevention and treatment policy so that no one lowers their guard because the outbreak has not occurred in our country"", KCNA said.
Until the military exercises over the past week, Kim had not been seen in public for more than three weeks, barring a brief appearance to pay tribute to his late father, Kim Jong Il, on the latter's birthday anniversary."

Several groups, from gay rights activists to supporters of Cuba's underground street network, have held protests over the past year despite the Communist government's tight control of public spaces.
Increased internet access, and in particular the launch of mobile internet just over a year ago, is mobilizing civil society not sanctioned by the state, analysts said, although the demonstrations are small and narrowly focused unlike the mass anti-government protests elsewhere in the region.
The protesters in Santa Clara, the hometown of Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel, in the province of Villa Clara, vented their fury at local authorities for enforcing an existing nationwide ban on private entrepreneurs selling imported goods, the two witnesses told Reuters by phone.
Reuters was unable to independently verify their accounts or the videos. Cuban state media did not comment on the march, and the Cuban government did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The cash-strapped Cuban state that is facing a hike in U.S. sanctions has a monopoly on imports and exports and criticizes ""hoarders"" for buying imported goods in short supply from state stores to sell at a profit.
Many Cubans also travel abroad to buy clothes and household items that are hard to find on the island to sell back home, an illegal practice largely tolerated by authorities.
The Cuban government is increasingly seeking, however, to combat capital flight, and has complained in recent years that irregularities in the private sector have led to tax evasion and an increased inequality.
""We want commerce! We want a solution! We want answers!"" salespeople chanted in the videos, which appeared to show state officials outside their offices listening to their concerns. ""We are not delinquents.""
One witness told Reuters the protesters had marched towards the provincial government of Villa Clara before heading to the local seat of the Cuban Communist Party.
Villa Clara Communist Party head Yudi Rodriguez listened to the protesters and said they could continue until she had reviewed their complaints, the witness said.
Cuba's private sector has expanded steadily since former President Raul Castro started opening up the economy, partly in order to cut the bloated state payroll, but it remains heavily regulated."

(Reuters) - From cancelling Broadway shows to closing schools, U.S. states are scrambling to slow the spread of coronavirus and stop hospitals from being overwhelmed with a surge in critically ill patients, as has been the case in Italy.
After weeks of federal officials telling Americans they faced low risk from the virus, and with no widescale testing to track its spread, hospitals in hard-hit cities like Seattle are now fighting to save lives as COVID-19 tears through communities.
One Seattle, Washington hospital has triage tents outside, two for possible COVID-19 cases, one for anything else. Nearby walk in clinics ask patients who think they have the virus wait in cars to avoid the potential of infecting others.
In Hawaii, another state that rapidly responded to the outbreak, urgent care clinics offer drive-through testing.
U.S. hospitals are being helped by a rapid shift in state strategy from containing the virus to mass mitigation measures to slow its spread.
These measures, ranging from bans on large gatherings in Washington state and California to a containment zone in New York and school closures in Maryland and Ohio, are meant to reduce the rate at which people are infected and seriously-ill patients show up at emergency departments.
The goal is to prevent the kind of surges that overwhelmed Italy - a country with more doctors and hospital beds per capita than the United States - causing fatality levels to leap as doctors ran out of equipment to help people breathe.
U.S. states that wait too long to stem the spread of contagion may find hospitals trapped in this doom spiral, experts warn.
Italy's confirmed cases of coronavirus have leapt from around 300 cases at the end of February to over 12,000 Thursday, providing a preview of what awaits America if measures aren't taken quickly to mitigate the spread. The Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care published guidelines instructing healthcare workers to provide scarce hospital resources to those who stand ""the highest likelihood of survival.""
LIKE MAJOR QUAKE
The biggest U.S. battle is in greater-Seattle, an area with over a quarter of the country's more than 1,300 U.S. COVID-19 cases and the bulk of the 39 deaths.
On the front lines, with limited testing, it can be an individual nurse practitioner or doctor who decides if a person is treated as a COVID-19 patient, or not.
""Our staff can use their clinical judgment and consider that patient to be likely positive if they choose,"" said Megan Farnsworth, an emergency room doctor in Everett, Washington dealing with high patient volumes at clinics she oversees.
Washington officials have prepared residents for a large-scale outbreak of the virus ten times as deadly as the flu that would double in size every five to eight days.
""It's something similar to the infectious-disease equivalent of a major earthquake that is going to shake us for weeks and weeks,"" said Jeff Duchin, health officer for Seattle's King County.
Few places in the United States are better prepared for this fight than the cities of Seattle and Everett, where their hospitals have been readying for a largescale community spread since late January when the area reported the country's first COVID-19 case. Despite limitations, greater-Seattle may have the best testing in the country.
""Being able to know who has the virus and who does not is able to free up beds, isolation units,"" said Alex Greninger, assistant director of University of Washington Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratories, which is testing over 1,000 people a day.
Doctor Janet Englund can get a test result back in between 12 and 36 hours.
""I think other states and sites are looking at what we are finding and what we are doing,"" said Englund, an infectious disease specialist at Seattle Children's, which has yet to see a high number of COVID-19 patients.
PROTECTIVE GEAR
Emergency medicine professionals in other U.S. states tell a different story, with doctors only able to test acutely ill patients and colleagues not wearing protective gear.
""None of the nurses, no one is wearing them. I put on my own N95 mask and everyone laughed at me,"" said an emergency room doctor in a southern U.S. state, who asked not to be named. ""We don’t know who has it and, especially healthcare workers need to be tested, because we can give it to everybody else.""
Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, has heard similar accounts.
""Many hospitals in this country, as of last week, really had not woken up to what this was about to throw at them and had not begun putting measures in place to be ready for that,"" said Konyndyk, describing the federal government's ""wait and see"" public health guidance as ""unspeakably irresponsible.""
Personal protective equipment such as CAPR respirator masks used by emergency room staff are in high demand, Farnsworth said. Her hospital network is shifting supplies to areas in greatest need.
Ultimately, the ability of hospitals to save lives will rest on the speed at which states apply mitigation. If taken early enough, aggressive measures like lockdowns can all but flatten the spread of the disease.
""I think we do need to take more of a no regrets approach,"" said Konyndyk, adding that it might be impossible to enforce Wuhan-style, mandatory lockdowns in the United States."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain placed four towns under quarantine on Thursday and announced measures to tackle the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic, which the country's hoteliers described as a ""tsunami"" threatening the survival of their businesses. 
Catalan authorities began locking down four towns around the village of Igualada - 49 km (30 miles) north of Barcelona - after a significant outbreak in the area, top regional police official Eduard Sallent told reporters. 
Access to Igualada, Vilanova del Cami, Santa Margarida de Montbui and Odena will be blocked from 2300 GMT, the first such restriction imposed in Spain since the outbreak began. 
A Catalan government spokesman said around 70,000 people would be affected by the quarantine. 
Spain, which initially did little in response to the outbreak, changed tack this week after infections soared. It ordered a ban on flights from Italy and warned against domestic and foreign travel. 
Schools and universities will be closed across the country for at least two weeks, while the prison service cut back visiting rights across its facilities. 
On the economic front, funds will be directed to central and regional health authorities, prices of drugs and medical equipment will be capped, and the tourism sector will also receive financial support.
The bulk of the 18 billion euro package announced by Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez goes towards allowing small businesses to make split or delayed tax payments over the next six months.
""These are difficult moments but we will overcome then,"" Sanchez told a news conference. ""We will overcome this with unity and responsibility from all.
Spain's coronavirus death toll rose to 84 on Thursday, a rise of nearly 80% overnight. Spain has the second-highest coronavirus tally in Europe behind Italy. 
In Madrid, which has nearly 1,400 cases, the regional health authority said it would take control of private hospitals and convert some hotels into medical centers ahead of an expected jump in infections.
Occupancy rates at Spanish hotels have fallen dramatically, with some left empty, and there are ""no new bookings"" due to the coronavirus epidemic, a top official at Spain's hotels federation CEHAT said. 
""A tsunami has arrived. A meteorite has fallen on us and we have to see how we survive,"" CEHAT Secretary General Ramon Estalella told Reuters.
Amid measures announced by Sanchez, which did not go as far as Italy's 25 billion euros, are 2.8 billion euros in brought-forward transfers to regions, 1 billion euros for the health ministry and 400 million euros for the tourism sector.
Pablo Casado, leader of the conservative People's Party, described the measures as ""disappointing"" and called for more decisive action from Sanchez. 
STAYING HOME
Sanchez will hold meetings via video conference after fellow minister Irene Montero was diagnosed with coronavirus.
Regional policy minister Carolina Darias later tested positive, as did Santiago Abascal, leader of the far-right Vox party. 
However, tests on all other ministers returned negative. 
The lower house of parliament, already shut, will extend its closure.
In Madrid, metro stations and bars were unusually quiet.
""Business has gone down a lot, really a lot,"" said José Manuel González, manager of the Santa Barbara cafe. ""It's very quiet at lunchtime. Things have dropped by 40%-50% since the school shutdown.""
As #Imstayingathome became a top trending topic on Twitter in Spain, 20-year-old student Alejandro Fernandez said his grandparents had fled Madrid.
""My grandparents, who are 84 and 81 years old, have left for the countryside and locked themselves up there. We have orders not to go visit them,"" Fernandez said.
After the Prado and other major museums in Madrid, Barcelona's Sagrada Familia cathedral said it was closing. 
Madrid health authorities asked people to donate blood, after a drop in donations in recent days. Doctors in the capital say they could run out of beds in intensive care units.

China sent a shipment of masks and other medical supplies to help Spain and Italy contain the outbreak.

Speaking after meeting the leaders of Germany's 16 states, Merkel said her finance and economy ministers would present a ""very comprehensive"" package of additional measures to support German businesses on Friday.
Asked about Germany's self-imposed policy pledge of not taking on new debt, Merkel said the budget was not her government's main focus, underlining her message from a day earlier that the public finances were secondary.
""The debt brake ... provides for exceptions in extraordinary situations - and that is, as I said yesterday, really not our topic as to how the budget balance will look in the end,"" Merkel told a news conference.
Under the German debt brake rule, the federal government can take on new debt of up to 0.35% of economic output. France has been using the coronavirus crisis to push for more public spending by Germany and other countries with fiscal leeway.
""We are in a situation that is unusual in every respect and I would say more unusual than at the time of the banking crisis because we are dealing with a health problem, a health challenge for which scientists and medicine does not yet have an answer,"" Merkel said.
""So it is our task first of all to save people's lives, as best we can, and secondly to keep economic activity going.""
Merkel said that for regions suffering a dynamic outbreak of coronavirus ""the temporary closure of nurseries and schools, for example by bringing forward the Easter holidays, is another option.""
Urging people to avoid social contact where possible, Merkel said the federal and state governments called for events with fewer than 1,000 participants not to go ahead. Previously, it had urged a halt to public gatherings with more than 1,000."
1056,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 05:03PM ET</span>",Trump authorizes military to respond after deadly attack blamed on Iran-backed militia,"By Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump has authorized the U.S. military to respond to Wednesday's rocket attack in Iraq that killed two American troops and a British service member, the Pentagon said on Thursday, blaming Iran-backed militia.
Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, stopped short of blaming Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah or naming any specific militia. 
But they were clear that they believe Iran backed the fighters who carried out the attack, and warned that all options were on the table - language suggesting the United States, Iran and the forces Tehran backs were again on a path toward renewed confrontation inside of Iraq. 
""I have spoken with the president. He's given me the authority to do what we need to do, consistent with his guidance,"" Esper told reporters at the Pentagon.
Asked if a U.S. response could include strikes inside Iran, Esper hinted that strikes against the militia itself were the priority. 
""I'm not going to take any option off the table right now, but we are focused on the group - groups - that we believe perpetrated this in Iraq, as the immediate (focus),"" he said.
Trump told reporters at the White House it was not ""fully determined it was Iran"" and declined to say what the United States might do.
""We'll see what the response is,"" he said.
No one has claimed responsibility for the attack and Iran has not commented.
The United States has repeatedly and publicly warned that killing Americans overseas constituted a red line that would trigger a U.S. response. 
""We gotta hold the perpetrators accountable. You don't get to shoot at our bases and kill and wound Americans and get away with it,"" Esper said.
Washington blamed Kataib Hezbollah for a strike in Iraq in December that killed a U.S. contractor, leading to a cycle of tit-for-tat confrontations that culminated in January's U.S. killing of top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani and a retaliatory Iranian missile attack that left more than 100 U.S. troops with brain injuries.
Wednesday would have been Soleimani's 63rd birthday. 
In the latest attack, some 14 U.S.-led coalition personnel were wounded, including American, British, Polish and others. Private industry contractors were among the wounded. Milley said five of the wounded were categorized as ""urgent,"" suggesting serious injuries that could require rapid medical evacuation.
Britain named its fallen service member as Lance Corporal Brodie Gillon, a 26-year-old with the Irish Guards Battle Group.
The United States has not yet identified the U.S. service members killed.
LIKELY CULPRIT?
Earlier on Thursday, U.S. Marine General Kenneth McKenzie, head of the military's Central Command, noted that only Iran-backed Kataib Hezbollah had been known to wage such an attack in the past. 
""While we are still investigating the attack, I will note that the Iranian proxy group Kataib Hezbollah is the only group known to have previously conducted an indirect fire attack of this scale against U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq,"" McKenzie told a U.S. Senate hearing.
The U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq says 18 107 mm Katyusha rockets struck Iraq's Taji military camp.
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a total of 30 of the rockets were fired from a nearby truck and that only 18 of them landed at the Iraqi base.
Milley said the truck yielded evidence about those responsible.
""We have good indication based on forensics of where (the attack) was fired from, who did the firing and so on and so forth,"" Milley said, adding that ""we have pretty good confidence we know who did this."" 
In a sign of concern that tensions between the United States and Iran could be headed toward open conflict, the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to limit Trump's ability to wage war against Iran.
The Republican president has been engaged in a maximum-pressure campaign of renewed sanctions and near-constant rhetoric against Iran, after pulling the United States out of the international nuclear deal reached during the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have mostly played out on Iraqi soil in recent months.

Iran-backed paramilitary groups have regularly been rocketing and shelling bases in Iraq that host U.S. forces and the area around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad.

1057,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 05:00PM ET</span>",Special Report: Italy and South Korea virus outbreaks reveal disparity in deaths and tactics,"By Emilio Parodi, Stephen Jewkes, Sangmi Cha and Ju-min Park
MILAN/SEOUL (Reuters) - In Italy, millions are locked down and more than 1,000 people have died from the coronavirus. In South Korea, hit by the disease at about the same time, only a few thousand are quarantined and 67 people have died. As the virus courses through the world, the story of two outbreaks illustrates a coming problem for countries now grappling with an explosion in cases.
It's impractical to test every potential patient, but unless the authorities can find a way to see how widespread infection is, their best answer is lockdown. 
Italy started out testing widely, then narrowed the focus so that now, the authorities don't have to process hundreds of thousands of tests. But there's a trade-off: They can't see what's coming and are trying to curb the movements of the country's entire population of 60 million people to contain the disease. Even Pope Francis, who has a cold and delivered his Sunday blessing over the internet from inside the Vatican, said he felt ""caged in the library.""
Thousands of miles away in South Korea, authorities have a different response to a similar-sized outbreak. They are testing hundreds of thousands of people for infections and tracking potential carriers like detectives, using cell phone and satellite technology.
Both countries saw their first cases of the disease called COVID-19 in late January. South Korea has since reported 67 deaths out of nearly 8,000 confirmed cases, after testing more than 222,000 people. In contrast, Italy has had 1,016 deaths and identified more than 15,000 cases after carrying out more than 73,000 tests on an unspecified number of people.
Epidemiologists say it is not possible to compare the numbers directly. But some say the dramatically different outcomes point to an important insight: Aggressive and sustained testing is a powerful tool for fighting the virus.
Jeremy Konyndyk, a senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development in Washington, said extensive testing can give countries a better picture of the extent of an outbreak. When testing in a country is limited, he said, the authorities have to take bolder actions to limit movement of people.
""I'm uncomfortable with enforced lockdown-type movement restrictions,"" he said. ""China did that, but China is able to do that. China has a population that will comply with that.""
The democracies of Italy and South Korea are useful case studies for countries such as America, which have had problems setting up testing systems and are weeks behind on the infection curve. So far, in Japan and the United States particularly, the full scale of the problem is not yet visible. Germany has not experienced significant testing constraints, but Chancellor Angela Merkel warned her people on Wednesday that since 60% to 70% of the populace is likely to be infected, the only option is containment. 
South Korea, which has a slightly smaller population than Italy at about 50 million people, has around 29,000 people in self-quarantine. It has imposed lockdowns on some facilities and at least one apartment complex hit hardest by outbreaks. But so far no entire regions have been cut off.
Seoul says it is building on lessons learned from an outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) in 2015 and working to make as much information available as possible to the public. It has embarked on a massive testing program, including people who have very mild illness, or perhaps don't even have symptoms, but who may be able to infect others. 
This includes enforcing a law that grants the government wide authority to access data: CCTV footage, GPS tracking data from phones and cars, credit card transactions, immigration entry information, and other personal details of people confirmed to have an infectious disease. The authorities can then make some of this public, so anyone who may have been exposed can get themselves - or their friends and family members - tested. 
In addition to helping work out who to test, South Korea's data-driven system helps hospitals manage their pipeline of cases. People found positive are placed in self-quarantine and monitored remotely through a smartphone app, or checked regularly in telephone calls, until a hospital bed becomes available. When a bed is available, an ambulance picks the person up and takes the patient to a hospital with air-sealed isolation rooms. All of this, including hospitalization, is free of charge.
South Korea's response is not perfect. While more than 209,000 people have tested negative there, results are still pending on about 18,000 others - an information gap that means there are likely more cases in the pipeline. The rate of newly confirmed cases has dropped since a peak in mid-February, but the system's greatest test may still be ahead as authorities try to track and contain new clusters. South Korea does not have enough protective masks - it has started rationing them - and it is trying to hire more trained staff to process tests and map cases. 
And the approach comes at the cost of some privacy. South Korea's system is an intrusive mandatory measure that depends on people surrendering what, for many in Europe and America, would be a fundamental right of privacy. Unlike China and the island-state of Singapore, which have used similar methods, South Korea is a large democracy with a population that is quick to protest policies it does not like. 
""Disclosing information about patients always comes with privacy infringement issues,"" said Choi Jaewook, a preventive medicine professor at Korea University and a senior official at the Korean Medical Association. Disclosures ""should be strictly limited"" to patients' movements, and ""it shouldn't be about their age, their sex, or their employers."" 
Traditional responses such as locking down affected areas and isolating patients can be only modestly effective, and may cause problems in open societies, says South Korea's Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip. In South Korea's experience, he told reporters on Monday, lockdowns mean people participate less in tracing contacts they may have had. ""Such an approach,"" he said, ""is close-minded, coercive, and inflexible.""
ITALY ""AT THE LIMIT""
Italy and South Korea are more than 5,000 miles apart, but there are several similarities when it comes to coronavirus. Both countries' main outbreaks were initially clustered in smaller cities or towns, rather than in a major metropolis - which meant the disease quickly threatened local health services. And both involved doctors who decided to ignore testing guidelines.
Italy's epidemic kicked off last month. A local man with flu symptoms was diagnosed after he had told medical staff he had not been to China and discharged himself, said Massimo Lombardo, head of local hospital services in Lodi. 
The diagnosis was only made after the 38-year-old, whose name has only been given as Mattia, returned to the hospital. Testing guidelines at the time said it was not necessary to test people who had no link to China or other affected areas. But an anaesthetist pushed the protocols and decided to go ahead and test for COVID-19 anyway, Lombardo said. Now, some experts in Italy believe Mattia may have been infected through Germany, rather than China.
Decisions about testing hinge partly on what can be done with people who test positive, at a time when the healthcare system is already under stress. In Italy at first, regional authorities tested widely and counted all positive results in the published total, even if people did not have symptoms. 
Then, a few days after the patient known as Mattia was found to have COVID-19, Italy changed tack, only testing and announcing cases of people with symptoms. The authorities said this was the most effective use of resources: The risk of contagion seemed lower from patients with no symptoms, and limited tests help produce reliable results more quickly. The approach carried risks: People with no symptoms still can be infected and spread the virus. 
On the other hand, the more you test the more you find, so testing in large numbers can put hospital systems under strain, said Massimo Antonelli, director of intensive care at the Fondazione Policlinico Universitario Agostino Gemelli IRCCS in Rome. Testing involves elaborate medical processes and follow-up. ""The problem is actively searching for cases,"" he said. ""It means simply the numbers are big."" 
Italy has a generally efficient health system, according to international studies. Its universal healthcare receives funding below the European Union average but is comparable with South Korea's, at 8.9% of GDP against 7.3% in South Korea, according to the World Health Organization. 
Now, that system has been knocked off balance. Staff are being brought into accident and emergency departments, holidays have been canceled and doctors say they are delaying non-urgent operations to free up intensive care beds. 
Pier Luigi Viale, head of the infectious disease unit at Sant' Orsola-Malpighi hospital in Bologna, is working around the clock - in three jobs. His hospital is handling multiple coronavirus cases. His doctors are shuttling to other hospitals and clinics in the area to lend their expertise and help out with cases. In addition, his doctors also have to deal with patients with other contagious diseases who are struggling to survive.
""If it drags on for weeks or months we'll need more reinforcements,"" he told Reuters.
Last week, the mayor of Castiglione d'Adda, a town of about 5,000 people in Lombardy's ""red zone"" which was the first to be locked down, made an urgent online appeal for help. He said his small town had had to close its hospital and was left with one doctor to treat more than 100 coronavirus patients. Three of the town's four doctors were sick or in self quarantine. 
""Doctors and nurses are at the limit,"" said a nurse from the hospital where Mattia was taken in. ""If you have to manage people under artificial respiration you have to be watching them constantly, you can't look after the new cases that come in."" 
Studies so far suggest that every positive case of coronavirus can infect two other people, so local authorities in Lombardy have warned that the region's hospitals face a serious crisis if the spread continues - not just for COVID-19 patients but also for others whose treatment has been delayed or disrupted. As the crisis spreads into Italy's less prosperous south, the problems will be magnified.
Intensive care facilities face the most intense pressure. They require specialist staff and expensive equipment and are not set up for mass epidemics. In total, Italy has around 5,000 intensive care beds. In the winter months, some of these are already occupied by patients with respiratory problems. Lombardy and Veneto have just over 1,800 intensive care beds between public and private systems, only some of which can be set aside for COVID-19 patients.
The government has asked regional authorities to increase the number of intensive care places by 50% and to double the number of beds for respiratory and contagious diseases, while reorganizing staff rosters to ensure adequate staffing. Some 5,000 respirators have been acquired for intensive care stations, the first of which are due to arrive on Friday, deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said.
The region has already asked nursing institutes to allow students to bring forward their graduation to get more nurses into the system early. Pools of intensive care specialists and anaesthetists are to be set up, including staff from outside the worst affected regions.
To add to the burden, hospitals in Italy depend on medical personnel to try to trace the contacts that people who test positive have had with others. One doctor in Bologna, who asked not to be named, said he had spent a 12-hour day tracing people who had been in contact with just one positive patient, to ensure those who next need testing are found. 
""You can do that if the number of cases remains two to three,"" the doctor said. ""But if they grow, something has to give. The system will implode if we continue to test everyone actively and then have to do all this.""
""MAXIMUM POWER""
In South Korea as in Italy, an early case of COVID-19 was identified when a medical officer followed their intuition, rather than the official guidelines, on testing.
The country's first case was a 35-year-old Chinese woman who tested positive on Jan. 20. But the largest outbreak was detected after the 31st patient, a 61-year-old woman from South Korea's southeastern city of Daegu, was diagnosed on Feb. 18.
Like the patient named Mattia in Italy, the woman had no known links to Wuhan, the Chinese province where the disease was first identified. And as in Italy, the doctors' decision to recommend a test went against guidelines at the time to test people who had been to China or been in contact with a confirmed case, said Korea Medical Association's Choi Jaewook.
""Patient 31,"" as she became known, was a member of a secretive church which Deputy Minister for Health and Welfare Kim Gang-lip said has since linked to 61% of cases. Infections spread beyond the congregation after the funeral of a relative of the church's founder was held at a nearby hospital, and there were several other smaller clusters around the country.
Once the church cluster was identified, South Korea opened around 50 drive-through testing facilities around the country. 
In empty parking lots, medical staff in protective clothing lean into cars to check their passengers for fever or breathing difficulties, and if needed, collect samples. The process usually takes about 10 minutes, and people usually receive the results in a text reminding them to wash their hands regularly and wear face masks.
A total of 117 institutions in South Korea have equipment to conduct the tests, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC). The numbers fluctuate daily, but an average of 12,000 is possible, and maximum capacity is 20,000 tests a day. The government pays for tests of people with symptoms, if referred by a doctor. Otherwise, people who want to be tested can pay up to 170,000 won ($140), said an official at a company called Seegene Inc, which supplies 80% of the country's kits and says it can test 96 samples at once. 
There are also 130 quarantine officers like Kim Jeong-hwan, who focus on minute details to track potential patients. The 28-year-old public health doctor spends his whole working days remotely checking up on people who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. 
Kim, who is doing military service, is one of a small army of quarantine officers who track the movements of any potential carriers of the disease by phone, app or the signals sent by cell phones or the black boxes in automobiles. Their goal: To trace all the contacts people may have had, so they too can be tested.
""I haven't seen anyone telling bad lies,"" Kim said. ""But lots of people generally don't remember exactly what they did."" 
Underlining their determination, quarantine officers told Reuters they located five cases after a worker in a small town caught the virus and went to work in a ""coin karaoke,"" a bar where a machine lets people sing a few songs for a dollar. At first, the woman, who was showing symptoms, did not tell the officers where she worked, local officials told Reuters. But they put the puzzle together after questioning her acquaintances and obtaining GPS locations on her mobile device.
""Now, quarantine officers have maximum power and authority,"" said Kim Jun-geun, an official at Changnyeong County who collects information from quarantine officers. 
South Korea's government also uses location data to customize mass messages sent to cellphones, notifying every resident when and where a nearby case is confirmed. 
Lee Hee-young, a preventative medicine expert who is also running the coronavirus response team in South Korea's Gyeonggi province, said South Korea has gone some of the way after MERS to increase its infrastructure to respond to infectious diseases. But she said only 30% of the changes the country needs have happened. For instance, she said, maintaining a trained workforce and up-to-date infrastructure at smaller hospitals isn't easy. 

""Until we fix this,"" Lee said, ""explosions like this can keep blowing up anywhere.""

1058,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 04:48PM ET</span>","Trump met Brazilian official with coronavirus, but says 'not concerned'","By Steve Holland and Anthony Boadle
WASHINGTON/BRASILIA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday said he was not concerned about the possibility of being exposed to the coronavirus after dining last week with a Brazilian government official who has since tested positive for the disease.
The day after announcing curbs on travel to the United States by European Union residents, Trump brushed off concerns about his possible exposure to the virus, which has sickened more than 126,000 people in a worldwide pandemic.
""Let's put it this way: I'm not concerned,"" Trump told reporters while meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in the Oval Office.
Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who had been at the dinner with Trump in Palm Beach, Florida, has been tested for coronavirus and is awaiting the result, his son Eduardo wrote on Twitter, adding that the president was not showing any symptoms.
Brazilian officials on Thursday confirmed that Brazil's communications secretary, Fabio Wajngarten, has the coronavirus and is now under quarantine at home. 
The entire Brazilian delegation that traveled to Florida with Bolsonaro is being tested for the virus, a senior member of the president's staff told Reuters.
White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said Trump and Vice President Mike Pence had ""almost no interactions"" with the Brazilian official and that they ""do not require being tested at this time.""
She said the White House medical unit and the U.S. Secret Service are ensuring that ""every precaution is taken"" to ensure the good health of Trump and Pence, their families and staff.
“We are monitoring the situation closely and will update everyone as we get more information,"" she said.
The coronavirus pandemic and fallout is shaping up to be perhaps the greatest crisis of Trump's presidency. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the front-runner for the Democratic nomination to challenge Trump's bid for re-election in November, criticized the administration's handling of the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday afternoon.
Wajngarten had been on an official visit to the United States with Bolsonaro and posted a photo on Instagram of the meeting at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club last Saturday, showing him standing next to Trump while wearing a ""Make Brazil Great Again"" cap. Pence was next to Trump.
Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo reported that Bolsonaro's test results were due on Friday. It added that other Cabinet ministers on the trip will also be tested.
Two Republican U.S. senators who attended the visit by the Brazilian delegation said they would quarantine themselves.
Senator Rick Scott of Florida, a Republican, on Thursday said he had met with a member of Bolsonaro's staff.
""While I do not believe I interacted with the infected person, that individual was in the same room as me,"" Scott said in a statement. ""The health and safety of the American people is my focus and I have made the decision to self-quarantine.""
U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a close Trump ally, did not recollect direct contact with Bolsonaro while at Mar-a-Lago but would quarantine himself out of ""an abundance of caution"" and on his doctor's advice, his office said in a statement. 
Bolsonaro's son Eduardo, a federal congressman who also attended the meeting at Mar-a-Lago, wrote on Twitter that he was on his way to get tested. Four days ago, he posted a photo of himself standing behind the U.S. president, next to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, and close to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner. 

Brazil's foreign minister, defense minister and Brazil's chief national security advisor were also in the image, along with the Brazilian president.

JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday ordered most schools in the country to close as a precaution against coronavirus, and called for the formation of an emergency national unity government.
Primary and secondary schools, with some exceptions such as special education programs, would be shut, he said.
""We are altering our internal routine in order to handle an outside threat, the threat of the virus,"" Netanyahu, 70, said in remarks broadcast live.
The right-wing leader's tenure is in doubt after three inconclusive elections in less than a year.
Calling for a unity government, he said: ""It will be an emergency government for a limited time, and together we will fight to save the lives of tens of thousands of citizens.""
Netanyahu's principal rival, centrist Blue and White Party leader Benny Gantz, said he would be willing to discuss the proposal in a responsible fashion. He tweeted that any such government should be ""broad"" and represent all sides of Israeli society.
Neither Netanyahu nor Gantz command a clear majority in parliament after the latest election, on March 2.
Netanyahu has faced calls to step aside ahead of a corruption trial that begins on March 17.
He faces charges including bribery, breach of trust and fraud, but denies any wrongdoing and is under no legal obligation to resign while the legal proceedings continue.
The latest coronavirus measures follow a series of tightening restrictions imposed by Israel and the Palestinians.
Earlier this week Netanyahu ordered all visitors to Israel to self-isolate for two weeks, and the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the Israeli-occupied West Bank was closed in what Israeli officials said was a joint Palestinian, Israeli and Jordanian effort to stop the virus from spreading.
Israel's flag carrier El Al said on Thursday it would start suspending most of its flights on Sunday but would maintain regular flight routes to the United States, Canada, England, France and South Africa.
The Palestinian Islamist group Hamas, which controls Gaza, said it would restrict travel with Egypt and Israel for all but the most urgent cases from Friday, and anyone entering Gaza would be put under ""mandatory quarantine.""

It ordered schools and universities closed until the end of March.

NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The expanding coronavirus outbreak threw daily American life into turmoil on Thursday as more professional sports leagues suspended their seasons, Broadway theaters canceled performances, and new restrictions caused chaos in trans-Atlantic airline travel.
Fears of a U.S. recession rose in step with an increase in the number of people infected by the virus, which causes the sometimes fatal COVID-19 respiratory illness. The concerns were reflected in U.S. stock markets, with major indexes entering bear-market territory. 
California and New York announced sweeping bans on large gatherings and more schools, museums and other institutions announced plans to close. 
Officials in the hardest-hit parts of the country, including New York and Washington states, were trying to balance the need to protect the public from the highly contagious coronavirus while stopping short of actions that could freeze the daily lives of millions of people and stop economic activity.
New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency to fight the coronavirus outbreak on Thursday, allowing him to use new powers as the number of confirmed cases rose to 95 cases in the nation's most populous city.
New York state will ban gatherings of more than 500 people beginning at 5 p.m. on Friday in order to slow the spread of the virus, Governor Andrew Cuomo said at a news conference. Establishments that can fit 500 people or fewer must halve their capacity beginning on Friday, Cuomo said.
Broadway theaters in Manhattan will have to start observing the new rules on Thursday night, Cuomo said. Hospitals, nursing homes, mass transit and certain other facilities will be exempt from the new rule. 
New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, the largest art museum in the world, said it was temporarily closing all three of its locations in the city.
In Washington, officials ordered the U.S. Capitol complex closed to much of the public starting on Thursday, a day after a staffer for a senator from Washington state tested positive for the coronavirus. 
Hollywood has postponed the release of several movies and movie theaters around the world have been closed over the health crisis.
More than 1,300 U.S. cases of coronavirus have been confirmed and 38 people have died. A nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, has accounted for a large share of the deaths.
The state of Georgia reported its first death on Thursday.
Florida Senator Rick Scott said he would quarantine himself after meeting last week with a member of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's delegation in Florida. Another Bolsonaro official on the trip has since tested positive for the virus.
President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met the Brazilian delegation, but White House spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said: ""Both the President and Vice President had almost no interactions with the individual who tested positive and do not require being tested at this time."" 
U.S. health officials have struggled to quickly expand testing capacity to make screening for the virus widely available, and have acknowledged that it is not easy for those possibly exposed to the virus to get tested. 
""The system is not really geared to what we need right now,"" Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. official on infectious diseases, said at a congressional hearing. ""The idea of anybody getting it (testing) easily the way people in other countries are doing it, we're not set up for that.""
Oscar-winning actor Tom Hanks and at least one player in the National Basketball Association are among those who have been infected with the coronavirus, which can lead to pneumonia and other respiratory problems, especially in the elderly and those with compromised immune systems. 
The NBA has suspended its season until further notice. The National Hockey League announced on Thursday it was pausing its season and Major League Soccer announced a 30-day suspension of its season. Major League Baseball also reportedly suspended spring training and delayed the start of its regular season.
The outbreak has forced the closure of many schools and prompted some universities, including Harvard and Princeton, to announce they will move to virtual classroom instruction after the spring break later this month.
'SELF-QUARANTINE'
U.S. citizens and permanent residents returning from Europe will be screened for the virus and asked to go into ""self-quarantine"" for 14 days as part of new travel restrictions that affect 26 nations but exempt Britain and Ireland, Pence said in an interview with CNN.
""Americans coming home will be funneled through 13 different airports, they'll be screened, and then we're going to ask every single American and legal resident returning to the United States to self-quarantine for 14 days,"" Pence said.
Trump on Thursday defended his decision to impose the measures, which go into effect at midnight on Friday and last for 30 days. Speaking to reporters at the White House, he said the ban could be lengthened or shortened.
The travel restrictions will heap more pressure on airlines already reeling from the pandemic, hitting European carriers the hardest, analysts said.
American Airlines Inc (O:AAL) and Delta Air Lines Inc (N:DAL) said they were capping fares for U.S.-bound flights from Europe amid reports of exorbitant pricing as U.S. citizens flocked to European airports trying to return home.
Delta said it would suspend eight U.S. flights to Europe on Friday and ""continues to evaluate additional schedule adjustments based on customer demand.""
Global stock markets sank again on Thursday. The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) fell about 10%. Airline and some cruise line stocks were particularly hard hit.
The U.S. House of Representatives plans to vote on Democrats' sweeping coronavirus bill on Thursday, according to a Democratic aide. 
Republicans have balked at the plan and called for a delay in considering the proposed legislation, and Trump said on Thursday he didn't support the bill. 
Instead, Trump has pushed for a payroll tax cut and instructed the Treasury Department to defer tax payments without interest or penalties for certain business and individuals hit by the health crisis.
The Senate plans to return next week to work on its legislation rather than have a week-long recess.

U.S. companies have announced 633 layoffs related to the outbreak through Thursday morning, according to global outplacement firm Challenger, Gray and Christmas.

KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan security services arrested on Thursday a retired general and former security minister who intends to challenge veteran leader Yoweri Museveni for the presidency next year, escalating a clampdown on political opponents.
Henry Tumukunde, who announced his candidacy earlier in March, said police and the military arrived at his house late on Thursday and arrested him.
""I have been told I am under arrest for treason,"" he told Reuters over the phone, adding that his house was being searched.
The police and military did not respond to requests for comment.
One of Africa's longest serving leaders, Museveni, 75, is widely expected to stand in elections expected for February 2021.
His ruling party has already been rattled by the growing support of pop star-turned-legislator Bobi Wine who is banking on his connection with the country's youthful population and a love of his music to unseat the president.
Tumukunde fought along side Museveni in the guerrilla war that catapulted him to power in 1986, he also served as head of the country's domestic intelligence.
Treason charges have been lodged against Museveni's political opponents on a number of occasions. Kizza Besigye, who has stood and lost against him four times has been charged with treason on more than one occasion.
The opposition and rights activists have accused the government of using security forces to intimidate political opponents, as activists are routinely jailed and opposition rallies broken up with teargas and beatings.
Officials deny targeting the opposition for political reasons."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Thursday imposed sanctions on another subsidiary of Rosneft, ramping up pressure on the Russian state oil giant that the Trump administration has said provides a financial lifeline to Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro.
The U.S. Treasury Department blacklisted TNK Trading International, a Swiss-based unit of Rosneft. Washington last month slapped sanctions on Rosneft Trading SA, another subsidiary of Rosneft, over accusations it had actively evaded U.S. sanctions and propped up the Venezuelan oil sector. 
""TNK Trading International S.A. is another Rosneft subsidiary brokering the sale and transport of Venezuelan crude oil,"" Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. ""The Trump administration remains committed to targeting those who support the corrupt regime’s exploitation of Venezuela’s oil assets.""
Rosneft called last month's sanctions on Rosneft Trading an ""outrage"" and said U.S. authorities, in conversations with the company, had repeatedly recognized that it was not breaching any restrictions. 
""The persecution of oil export vessels by the United States is brutal. They pursue the vessels, they threaten the countries that buy from us,"" Maduro said in a press conference that coincided with the Treasury announcement. Venezuela’s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The United States in January 2019 recognized Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the OPEC nation's legitimate interim president and has ratcheted up sanctions and diplomatic pressure in the aftermath of Maduro's 2018 re-election, which was widely described as fraudulent.
The Latin American country's oil exports have dropped by one-third since then, but more than a year on, Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela's military as well as Russia, China and Cuba. 
Frustrated by the socialist leader's grip on power, despite recognition of Guaido by dozens of countries, the Trump administration has increased pressure on Venezuela's oil industry in recent weeks.
ROSNEFT LIFELINE
Moscow has acted as a lender of last resort for Venezuela, with the government and Rosneft providing at least $17 billion in loans and credit lines since 2006, and has also provided diplomatic support.
Rosneft, among the world's largest oil and gas producers, has emerged over the past year as the key recipient of Venezuelan oil, which it receives as repayment of billions of dollars lent to the Venezuelan government and PDVSA.
Through units including Rosneft Trading and TNK Trading it took more than a third of Venezuela's oil exports last year, according to PDVSA's documents and Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data, for reselling to final customers, mainly in Asia. That way it became the largest intermediary of Venezuelan oil amid U.S. sanctions.
So far in March, Rosneft’s units have not taken any cargo of Venezuelan oil at PDVSA’s ports, according to PDVSA’s documents and Refinitiv Eikon vessel tracking data. The last cargo chartered by Rosneft set sail from Venezuela in late February. Two other large vessels scheduled to take Venezuelan oil for Rosneft remain anchored off Venezuelan waters, according to the data.
PDVSA did not immediately reply to a request for comment.

The Treasury Department also said it had issued a general license giving companies until May 20 to wind down transactions with Rosneft Trading and TNK Trading.

1065,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 03:07PM ET</span>",Russian lawmakers told to rally behind Putin's move to extend rule,"By Tom Balmforth and Andrew Osborn
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's parliamentary head told lawmakers on Thursday to rally behind Vladimir Putin against what he said was a foreign campaign to discredit constitutional reforms that could allow the president to stay in power until 2036.
Putin, who has been in power as president or prime minister since the turn of the century, would be cleared to run for president in 2024 under the proposed changes, overturning a constitutional ban which prevents him from doing so.
The changes must still be reviewed by the constitutional court and put to a public vote before they become law.
The 67-year-old president's critics say he is brazenly engineering a way to stay as president for life, an allegation rejected by the Kremlin.
Some Russian opponents of the change have mocked Valentina Tereshkova, the lawmaker who proposed it, on social media.
Vyacheslav Volodin, the lower house's speaker, told parliament that Tereshkova was being subjected to a campaign from abroad that was tantamount to an attack on Russia.
""We must ... be decent, be patriots, be aware that the attacks against Tereshkova are attacks on our country,"" Volodin told parliament.
""Today with all the challenges and threats in the world, it's not oil and gas that give us our edge. As you can see, oil and gas prices can fall. It's Putin who gives us our edge and we must protect him,"" Volodin added.
Tereshkova's amendment is now part of an array of constitutional reforms announced by Putin in January that were approved by the lower and upper houses of parliament and regional parliaments this week.
Putin is required to vacate the Kremlin when his second sequential presidential term and fourth overall, ends in 2024. The amendment would reset this tally, allowing him to run two more times.
Open Russia, a group financed by former oil tycoon and Kremlin critic Mikhail Khodorkovsky, said seven activists had been detained in St Petersburg while protesting against the constitutional changes outside the local legislative assembly.
Andrey Pivovarov, an opposition activist, said that the state communications regulator, Roskomnadzor, had also blocked an opposition website campaigning against the constitutional amendments under the slogan ""Nyet!""
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that Putin had not yet said whether he would run again in 2024 and would decide closer to the time.
Putin's decision to acquiesce with the amendment was motivated by a turbulence in global affairs, including the outbreak of coronavirus, regional conflicts and the unpredictable and unacceptable behavior of some other countries, Peskov said."

Under former President Robert Mugabe, Zimbabwe took over some 5,000 farms, mostly from white farmers, saying the policy was meant to address colonial imbalances. But the land seizures triggered economic collapse.
The southern African country's new Constitution, agreed with the opposition in 2013, provides for compensation of all farmers whose land was seized by the state. However, Zimbabwe's economic woes mean it has struggled to pay the former farmers.
It set aside US$17.5 million in its 2019 budget and a further 380 million Zimbabwe dollars (US$21 million) for the same purpose this year. The former farmers are demanding nearly US$7 billion in compensation, according to a committee representing them in negotiations with government.
In a change of approach, the government of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who replaced Mugabe after a coup in 2017, is offering some of the dispossessed farmers land as compensation, according to the regulations.
The dispossessed farmers covered in the land compensation scheme are citizens of countries that have bilateral investment agreements with Zimbabwe, as well as some black Zimbabwean commercial farmers who lost their farms.
These countries include former colonial ruler Britain, South Africa, Germany, Denmark, the Netherlands and Switzerland, all of which had significant numbers of farmers in Zimbabwe.
It was not yet known whether the farmers would accept the offer.
In 2015, the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes, which is part of the World Bank group, ordered Zimbabwe to pay US$196 million compensation to a Swiss-German family whose farm had been seized by the government.
Zimbabwe lost a bid to have the compensation award annulled in 2018.
Zimbabwe's government is still in talks with white Zimbabwean farmers on compensation for the loss of their farms."

The Pegasus plane flying in from the western city of Izmir sped off the end of the wet runway and broke into three pieces after a drop of 30 meters. State media later said the flight's captain was arrested.
According to a preliminary report seen by Reuters on Thursday, the control tower initially told the pilot to hold off from landing due to harsh weather.
But it said the Dutch co-pilot did not understand the Turkish guidance. It said the tower then allowed the plane to land, but that the pilots did not brake in a timely manner.
Officials from Pegasus were not immediately available to comment on the report.
""When the speed indicator showed 57 knots, speed brakes and thrust reversers were turned off and manual braking was turned back on,"" the report said.
""The deceleration when the first manual brake was used at a ground speed of 84 knots was not enough, therefore (the plane) ran off the runway at a speed of 60 knots,"" it said.
The report also said that audio recordings from the flight showed the pilots panicked over possible damage after the plane was struck by lightning some six minutes before landing."

OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie are in self-isolation after she came down with flu-like symptoms and was tested for the new coronavirus, according to an official statement on Thursday. 
The 48-year-old Liberal leader is exhibiting no symptoms and will continue to work from home until the results of his wife's test comes in, the statement said. However, face-to-face meetings with provincial premiers scheduled for Thursday and Friday will instead be held by phone.
""Having recently returned from a speaking engagement in London, UK, the Prime Minister's wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau began exhibiting mild flu-like symptoms including a low fever late last night,"" the statement from the prime minister's office read.
""She immediately sought medical advice, and is being tested for the COVID-19 virus. She is self-isolating at home awaiting test results, and her symptoms have since subsided.""
The statement does not mention whether their three children are staying home as well.
Trudeau's announcement comes as the spread of the new coronavirus appears to be gathering steam and as authorities canceled major events to try to limit contagion. 
Canada had just over 100 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus as of Wednesday, more than double the number from a week ago. With Manitoba and New Brunswick reporting their first presumptive cases in the past 24 hours, six of Canada's 10 provinces have recorded COVID-19 contagion. 
Two other ministers with flu-like symptoms have gone into self-isolation in recent days as they awaited test results for the virus. Indigenous Services Minister Marc Miller said that the rest of the cabinet had not been instructed to self-isolate.
Trudeau's move is ""a precautionary measure, and should Canadians find themselves in a similar situation, that is the recommendation,"" Miller said. 
Ontario, the country's most populous province, reported 17 new cases overnight, a 40%. In Alberta, Suncor Energy spokeswoman Erin Rees said a pre-school child in Calgary who attended a daycare in one of its buildings had tested positive for coronavirus. 
The daycare was closed and children and their families were advised to self-quarantine, Rees said. Alberta health officials have not confirmed the case. 
Also on Thursday, Canadian authorities canceled the JUNO, an annual music award show similar to the Grammys in the United States, citing virus concerns, and Toronto's annual St. Patrick's Day parade was suspended.
All 360 people working at the Ottawa office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions - Canada's top financial services regulator - were asked to start working from home on Thursday after an employee was tested for the coronavirus, said spokesman Michael Toope.
Trudeau's government committed C$1 billion ($723 million) on Wednesday toward bolstering the healthcare system and limiting the impact of the virus.

The government of Ontario, the province that has reported the highest number of cases, has set aside C$100 million in ""contingency funding"", Premier Doug Ford told reporters on Thursday.

Streets in the Gulf Arab state were largely empty on Thursday, the start of a two-week public holiday declared by the government, which also banned people from visiting restaurants, cafes and gyms.
American resident Gayle St. Clair described pandemonium at a supermarket on Wednesday night when the measures were announced. 
""Once I got in, they gave me sanitizer and gloves, but it was so crowded that I could hardly get to the aisles to get my items,"" she said. ""Luckily I found a self-checkout booth but it took others hours to get overflowing carts through the cashier.""
Kuwait, whose land borders with Saudi Arabia and Iraq are also closed to passenger movement, has 80 coronavirus cases. As in other Gulf Arab states, no deaths have been reported.
It was not clear how long the ban on commercial flights in and out of Kuwait would last. 
""I've seen and heard lots of people complaining about wanting to go out to public places and wanting to travel ... but frankly it's better to be safe than sorry,"" said Kuwaiti national Laila Al Qatami.
The government had been criticized by some members of parliament after reports that several expatriates had ignored instructions to self-quarantine upon arrival.
Lawmaker Badr Al-Mulla told Reuters the coronavirus outbreak was a ""global catastrophe"" that required exceptional measures.
For Egyptian resident Abu Ahmed, 45, the precautions seem necessary. ""It feels we are near Judgement Day with coronavirus and I worry about my children and family,"" he said.

""There is no need for all this panic because shipping lanes are still open and cargo flights continue. There are sufficient strategic food stockpiles for several months,"" he said in remarks released by his ministry.
Businesses and organizations providing essential goods and services remain open. The central bank said it was ready to support the financial sector.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is disinfecting its parliament chamber after a lawmaker ignored coronavirus quarantine to attend assembly sessions, including one where President Vladimir Putin gave a speech.
Sergei Katasonov, a member of the nationalist LDPR party, told Reuters he had ignored a requirement by Moscow authorities to self-isolate for 14 days after returning from France because he did not fully understand the risks.
""Considering that we were checked at the airport I didn't see a need for self-isolation,"" Katasonov said.
Katasonov confirmed he had attended a parliamentary session on Tuesday, where Putin made an unexpected appearance to open the door to constitutional changes that would allow him to remain in power until 2036.
Parliamentary speaker Vyacheslav Volodin said the chamber where plenary sessions were held would be disinfected and several lawmakers who had been in contact with Katasonov might be quarantined as well as a result.
Fellow lawmakers demanded more action.
""Cleaning and disinfection would take more than just one hour of work,"" Gennadiy Onishenko, a pro-Kremlin parliament member and a former Russian top public health official, said and proposed ending the parliamentary session early.
Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the LDPR, proposed recalling Katasonov's mandate and accused him of putting colleagues' health at risk.
Speaker Volodin was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying parliament had no right to fire him, but proposed disabling his access pass for as long as the quarantine lasts.
Katasonov said he now planned to observe the quarantine rules.
The Kremlin did not immediately respond when asked if it would be taking any precautionary measures such as testing Putin for coronavirus given his appearance in parliament on Tuesday.
Russia has recorded 28 cases of coronavirus. It says some of those infected have since recovered and that nobody has died.
France, along with China, South Korea, Iran, Italy, Germany, and Spain is on a list of countries designated by Russian authorities as having unfavourable epidemiological conditions because of outbreaks of the coronavirus.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's Economy Minister Paulo Guedes on Thursday called for calm to face the growing sense of crisis, saying the government hopes to reach agreement with lawmakers for a 10 billion reais ($2.05 billion) package to fight the spread of coronavirus.
His remarks come a day after Congress overturned a presidential veto, which will see spending on social assistance for elderly and disabled people cost an extra 20 billion reais ($4.2 billion) this year.
The surprise vote heaps further fiscal pressure on the government, which is trying to rein in spending to meet budget targets amid increasing financial and economic instability caused by the coronavirus pandemic.
""Both sides (executive and legislative) realized this quickly ... there's a mutual understanding again and I think we will settle this,"" Guedes said after a hastily-arranged meeting with key members of Congress on Wednesday.
He also reiterated his economic team is working ""with complete calm"" despite the surge in global market volatility after U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to ban flights to United States from Europe.
""We have the capacity to face any undue escalation of the crisis, all this anxiety in the foreign exchange and stock markets,"" he told journalists at the Economy Ministry in Brasilia.
Guedes repeated his plea that the current crisis be used as an opportunity to press ahead with the government's economic reform agenda, which he claims will create jobs, raise incomes and kickstart the economy.
Guedes expressed regret at Congress's vote late on Wednesday that threatens the government's budget goals, arguing that it undermines efforts to get the economy growing faster.

PARIS (Reuters) - Elbow to elbow, foot to foot or the occasional Namaste is how some candidates in France's local elections are greeting voters across cities, but for others direct contact is too valuable to give up even as the highly contagious coronavirus runs amok.
Even after Italy went into lockdown and countries from Japan to Greece shut down schools, the French government has publicly said it wants to press ahead with the national vote for control of France's 35,000 town halls.
But the virus has presented candidates with a dilemma: how to rally support when there are restrictions on public gatherings and French people have been told not to shake hands or greet with a kiss?
""We can't shake hands,"" said one Parisian as he greeted Agnes Buyzn, President Emmanuel Macron's candidate for Paris City Hall, in the capital's chic 6th arrondissement.
Parachuted in at the last minute by Macron to replace the previous candidate who pulled out after a sex scandal, Buzyn responds offering her elbow instead.
""It's a different contact, but we still need to have friendly exchanges, so you use your elbow, say hello like in Asia or give a kick. It creates a bond during a campaign that frankly resembles nothing like in the past,"" Buzyn told Reuters.
Countrywide, numerous candidates have taken to social media to reach their audience, but street campaigning remains the preferred way of getting their message across.
In the capital's 18th district, best-known for the Sacre-Coeur basilica which sits atop Montmartre, former French international soccer star Vikash Dhorasso struggled to keep his hands to himself.
Running in an election for the first time and attempting to win the district's town hall for the far-left La France Insoumise party, Dhorasso has put the coronavirus to the back of his mind as he seeks to show that politics is not just for career politicians.

MADRID/PARIS (Reuters) - Weary and confused travelers, many wearing face masks, rushed to board flights from European airports to the United States on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping travel restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus.
His 30-day travel order applies to citizens of 26 European countries but excludes Britain and Ireland as well as American citizens. It takes effect from midnight on Friday.
""It caused a mass panic,"" said 20-year-old Anna Grace, a U.S. student on her first trip to Europe who changed her booking to fly home from Madrid's Barajas airport instead of going on to France.
U.S. backpacker Keasy, from San Francisco, said: ""It kind of ruined my travel plans. I arrived here yesterday and so in 24 hours everything has changed.""
Though American citizens are exempt from the travel ban, she and many others said they preferred to return home in case the restrictions are expanded or for fear of contracting coronavirus while in Europe.
Cristina Elvira, a pensioner traveling to Miami, felt relieved to leave Spain, where new cases have increased exponentially over the past days.
""We are lucky to be able to leave Europe,"" Elvira said as she checked in for her flight, one of around 20 from Spain to the United States scheduled for Thursday.
Paola Mesa, 29, a Spanish woman flying from Barcelona to San Francisco, said she backed Trump's ban on travel from Europe.
""It’s what Spain should have done before,"" she said.
""A BIG MESS""
Many travelers, however, were critical of Trump's decision and his lack of coordination with European authorities.
""It's ridiculous. Why do we impose a ban now when the virus is already in the United States?"" said Leo Mota, 24, who had just arrived at Paris's main international airport, Roissy Charles de Gaulle, from Los Angeles.
Trump has said he had to act because the European Union had failed to take adequate measures to stop the coronavirus. The EU dismissed his comments and criticized the lack of consultation from the U.S. side.
Miguel Paracuellos, a Spaniard who works in the United States, said Trump was trying to compensate for his failure to expand testing and screening programs at home. ""He is blaming an external enemy, in this case Europe,"" he said.
Jon Lindfors, an American traveler in Paris, was equally scathing about Trump, who will seek re-election in November.
""Trump said it's not a health crisis but it is, that it's not an economic crisis but it is. We don't believe what Trump says anymore,"" Lindfors said.
A Delta crew member, who asked not to be named, said Trump’s travel ban had caught the airline off-guard.
""It's going to be a big mess... We were not expecting something like that. We don't have all the details to know what it means for us and for the company,"" the crew member said.
At Rome's Fiumicino airport, largely empty due to draconian measures taken by Italy to combat coronavirus, one Italian traveler just back from New York said the United States would soon face the disruption Europe is now experiencing.
""(In New York)... there were only a few flights canceled or delayed... They don't understand the situation yet,"" said Giuseppe Riccio, who wore a face mask. ""There are no controls in place, shops are full of people.""
Gregory and Ada Goldberg, an American couple from San Francisco, were trying to bring forward their flight home from Barcelona but were not getting much help at the airport.
""This was meant to be two weeks of pleasant vacation but it has become a nightmare,"" said 69-year-old Ada."

NUEVO LAREDO (Reuters) - Customers at the Esperanza tortilla factory in the northern Mexican city of Nuevo Laredo found their tortillas wrapped differently this month - in white paper with ""break the silence"" written in red, urging women to report abuse and seek help.
In a creative response to battling violence against women, the Nuevo Laredo Women's Institute printed 10,000 tortilla wrappers featuring help hotlines, support center addresses and the message that women who suffer violence should speak up.
Nuevo Laredo is a bustling border city, opposite the U.S. city of Laredo, Texas.
The new tortilla wrappers were timed to coincide with International Women's Day on March 8, when women around the country took to the streets to protest femicides in Mexico, which have more than doubled in the past five years, and other types of violence against women.
""Silence is lethal in the mistreatment of women. Dare yourself, be brave and report it,"" the text of the wrapping reads on the side of each tortilla package, which have been distributed to various tortilla factories.
Filadelfo Medellin, head of a local tortilla makers union, said he supported the idea when the Women's Institute asked him to help.
""Sometimes people stay quiet because of shame, because of fear,"" he said. ""However, we think with this advertising, a woman who suffers abuse could be encouraged to report it, and could also receive psychological aid to improve her family life or all her surroundings.""
He said shoppers have already remarked on the change of wrapping for the corn tortillas, which are a staple of the Mexican diet.
""When we explain that it's about women's issues, about abuse, they start to ask where's the institute, what types of services does it offer,"" said Medellin.
Maria Isabel Maldonado, 56, who bought about 2 pounds (1 kg) of tortillas, said she would recommend that women take inspiration from the socially conscious tortilla wrappers and reach out for help.
""We have to break the silence about women... So that there's no more killing of women. There have already been so many."""

1099,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 09:55AM ET</span>",Syrian fighter's nine-year journey from school protests to armed conflict,"By Dominic Evans
BINNISH, Syria (Reuters) - Ahmed Mansour was a schoolboy with dreams of becoming a lawyer when he joined the first protests at his secondary school in Syria's northern city of Aleppo.
Nine years and a failed revolution later, his studies halted by a war which has ravaged the country his whole adult life, Mansour and fellow fighters are stuck in a shrinking corner of rebel territory which still defies President Bashar al-Assad.
His journey from schoolboy demonstrator to veteran fighter, from early optimism to last-ditch defense in the towns and farmlands of Idlib province, echoes the dashed hopes of many Syrians who took to the streets to challenge authorities.
""I expected the regime to fall,"" Mansour said, recalling the early protests inspired by uprisings in North Africa which rapidly toppled autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt and then overthrew Libya's Muammar Gaddafi after Western intervention.
""It was a corrupt sectarian regime and we had to change it,"" he said, flanked by fellow fighters under a canopy of olive trees, hiding them from hostile warplanes and drones in the skies of Idlib.
Starting in Damascus on March 15, 2011, and then in the southern city of Deraa a few days later, unprecedented protests against decades of rule by Assad and his father before him spread across the country.
Mansour, then 16 and studying at secondary school in Aleppo, joined 30 other students in a demonstration at their school. ""We shouted 'Freedom, Freedom, Freedom',"" he said. ""Security forces came the next day and arrested 11 of my friends.""
The students were released after mediation. They continued to protest, but in small numbers and in short 15-minute bursts. ""We couldn't do it for longer because security forces came immediately and stormed the demonstration with tear gas and opened fire,"" he told Reuters.
The Syrian government, arguing that protesters were infiltrated by armed elements from the very start, cracked down with a determination unmatched in other countries caught up in what was briefly labeled the Arab Spring.
Despite growing casualties, protests persisted. As demonstrations became funeral marches, confrontation escalated.
Mansour joined a group to defend the demonstrators, but they could not match the strength of Assad's security forces. After several months a new force of military defectors and armed rebels was formed, the Free Syrian Army.
""I joined the Free Army with great pride because I was taking part in protecting civilians, our people, our brothers,"" he said. ""People who were calling for the most basic rights from a tyrannical, repressive, dictatorial regime.""
""THE WORLD WATCHED""
Syria was on the way to becoming the bloodiest and most protracted of the Arab uprisings, but in the first years of conflict rebel confidence was high. Assad's foreign critics said his remaining days in power were numbered, and a senior U.S. State Department official described him as ""a dead man walking"".
Mansour and the rebels swept into Aleppo in the late summer of 2012, a city they would hold in part for another four years.
Then he was based in towns around Aleppo, surviving a stomach injury from shelling, and fighting for a variety of rebel factions which jostled for power on Syria's chaotic battlefield.
Riven by division - which worsened dramatically with the emergence of the jihadist Islamic State group in 2013 - and lacking the international support they sought, the rebels failed to capitalize on the early gains.
Islamic State ""turned public opinion against us"", leading the outside world to equate the rebel fighters with terrorists.
""Then the Russians came, and changed the balance,"" Mansour said, referring to Moscow's decisive 2015 intervention which turned the war in Assad's favor.
""They put pressure on us in Aleppo, and then they took control,"" he said. ""They broke us in Ghouta (around Damascus) and in many areas until at last we ended up in Idlib,"" he said, the sound of bombardment occasionally punctuating his comments.
In some of the worst of the fighting in Aleppo's Khaldiya district, Mansour said one or two fighters died alongside him every day. Another bleak memory was an air strike which killed around 20 of his comrades sheltering in a cave in 2016.
The last few months, as Assad's Russia-backed forces launched an offensive across southern Idlib, marked the lowest point yet for rebels who once controlled large parts of Syria and almost encircled Damascus.
Three days before speaking to Reuters, Mansour's forces were driven from his hometown of Kafr Nabl by the advance of Syrian government forces, halted only by Turkish air strikes, artillery and a ceasefire deal agreed by Turkey and Russia last week.
Turkey's robust support for the rebels this month has sustained his optimism, despite the string of past military defeats, but also reinforced a sense of betrayal by other international powers.
""The world watched us and no one helped,"" Mansour said. ""If the world had helped us, we would have toppled the regime""."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dexter Johnson often comes to the Bowery Mission to get a free meal, having struggled off and on with homelessness, but the 33-year-old New Yorker is thinking twice about sitting down in the crowded cafeteria and risking exposure to novel coronavirus. 
Johnson, one of an estimated 550,000 people to go homeless on any given night in the United States, is worried crowds at the lunch service could expose him to a virus that has no vaccine.
""This is the type of thing where you need to stay away from other people,"" he said from the Bowery Mission dining room, where volunteers have hung posters detailing ways to avoid catching or spreading the virus. ""That's hard to do.""
As known cases of COVID-19 in the United States quickly multiply, homeless people and their advocates are preparing for an outbreak in a population more susceptible to illness and with no way to isolate or recover at home.
Shelters and healthcare providers from Los Angeles to Boston are attempting to erect quarantine zones and purchase protective gear to stop the virus from spreading to the roughly 1% of Americans who are homeless at some point in a given year.
But finding the space and the budget for even basic safeguards recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - washing hands regularly and waiting out a potential illness in private - will be a complex undertaking when it comes to the homeless, advocates and health experts say.
""In a shelter system that is already bursting at the seams, the ability to isolate and quarantine people and families is going to be very difficult and very expensive,"" said Aine Duggan, president of homeless advocacy group Partnership for the Homeless in New York.
SPREADS QUICKLY IN SHELTERS
New York City, Boston and Washington, D.C. have the highest rates of men, women and children in shelters, while West Coast cities have the largest overall number of homeless people, according to a White House report from last September. 
About 65% of homeless people, many of them children, sleep in shelters and roughly 35% live on the streets.
""As we've seen with tuberculosis, norovirus, and so many others, infections spread really quickly through the shelter system,"" said Dr. Jessie Gaeta, chief medical officer of Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program (BHCHP).
Homeless people also suffer disproportionately from chronic health disorders, including heart and lung disease as well as diabetes, that make them uniquely vulnerable to respiratory viral infections like COVID-19, Gaeta said.
The homeless are more likely to contract illnesses in part because of weakened immune systems due to additional stress, lacking nutrition and sleep. Unsanitary living on the streets, where restrooms are limited, pose additional risks.
Los Angeles' Union Rescue Mission, which has beds for about 1,200 men, women and children at its 24 shelters, has turned its gymnasium into a quarantine zone for unsheltered people to go if they have a fever or other symptoms linked to COVID-19. 
""Somebody who gets this and is alone on the streets will really suffer,"" said Union Rescue Mission Chief Executive Officer Andy Bales.
The shelter has also stepped up cleaning efforts to nine times a day and added hot-water hand washing stations outside of its buildings. 
San Francisco officials this week said the city would set up recreational vehicles and other temporary housing to isolate homeless people with potential exposure to the virus.
FEWER VOLUNTEERS
While there is no indication the virus has reached homeless shelters or encampments, it has already started to curtail the number of volunteers at food banks and shelters in Texas, New York and elsewhere.
Founded in 1879, the Bowery Mission on New York's Lower East Side provides food, medical services and employment assistance to the working poor and homeless men women and children.
Many volunteers for the Mission's meal services have canceled since the shelter's corporate sponsors began telling employees to work from home and avoid crowded areas, said James Winans, who heads the 370-bed shelter network, one of the oldest in the nation.
Cecil Barrow, who dines at the Bowery, said the new virus is just another hardship homeless people like him regularly endure. 

""The homeless are treated like we already have a virus, and most people probably wouldn't care if we do,"" said Barrow, 66.

Given the uncertainty, undertakers and even the local hospital refused to pick up the body.
""My sister is dead, in bed. I don't know what to do. I can't give her the funeral she deserves because the institutions have abandoned me,"" her brother Luca Franzese said in a video posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Franzese, a personal fitness trainer, showed her body laid behind him. ""We are ruined. Italy has abandoned us. Let's stay strong together. Please share this video everywhere,"" he said, struggling to hold back his emotions.
Finally, after waiting 36 hours, undertakers wearing protective clothing arrived and took the body directly to a local cemetery where she was interred without ceremony.
Her family had to stay in quarantine at home because of fears they might also have the disease.
Italy has shut down almost all its shops except food stores and pharmacies in Europe's toughest lockdown as virus deaths in the country rose to 827 with more than 12,000 cases of the illness confirmed.
Franzese said his sister suffered from epilepsy. As her condition worsened he said he insisted that she be tested for coronavirus. ""To keep her alive I tried to give her mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Nobody gave a damn,"" he said.
Results finally showed that Teresa Franzese had been suffering from coronavirus. Subsequent tests showed that two other family members had the illness, though not Luca Franzese, said Le Iene tv show, which interviewed him.
Only one person is reported to have died so far in the Campania region, which is centered on Naples, and Franzese said the authorities had decided she had died of epilepsy.
""How can they know this if a postmortem was not carried out?"" he said in a post on his Facebook page."

The Grand Princess was denied entry to San Francisco Bay last Wednesday en route back from Hawaii as authorities learned some passengers and crew had developed flu-like symptoms, and that patrons from an earlier cruise to Mexico aboard the same ship had tested positive for coronavirus.
The Diamond Princess cruise ship, which at one point had the highest number of infections outside China, was quarantined off the coast of Japan for the disease in February. Of those on board about 700 people became infected, and six have died.
The cruise line said the suspension was out of an abundance of caution.
""It is our intention to reassure our loyal guests, team members and global stakeholders of our commitment to the health, safety and well-being of all who sail with us,"" said Jan Swartz, president of Princess Cruises.

1108,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 09:10AM ET</span>",Exclusive: China-EU summit to be postponed due to coronavirus - sources,"By Robin Emmott and Francesco Guarascio
BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A summit planned for the end of March in Beijing between China and the European Union is set to be postponed due to the coronavirus, two EU officials and two diplomats said, in a blow for the bloc's efforts to pressure the Chinese over free trade.
China never publicly gave a date for the meeting between Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and the new European Commission and European Council presidents, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel, but EU diplomats said March 30-31 had been agreed.
""The summit is set to be postponed, but not canceled,"" one senior EU diplomat told Reuters, echoing information from other diplomats and officials who tried to prepare the meeting. 
The Chinese foreign ministry did not respond to a request for comment. 
Postponement robs the EU of a chance to push Beijing to make good on its promise in April last year to give European companies equal treatment in China and put an end to a practice of forcing foreign companies to share sensitive know-how when operating in China.
While the coronavirus pandemic has passed its peak in China, a series of preparatory meetings in Beijing and visits to Brussels by senior Chinese officials, including top trade negotiator Vice Premier Liu He, have all been canceled in recent weeks due to the health crisis. 
""CHINA PARALYZED""
That makes a summit virtually impossible to hold because little negotiation has been carried out to seal deals at the summit on areas from trade to green energy investments.
""China has been paralyzed. Everything is complicated by the coronavirus,"" an EU official said.
While all 27 EU leaders and China's President Xi Jinping are still due to meet in the German city of Leipzig in September, EU diplomats hoped to use the March meeting as a building block for a breakthrough on trade in Leipzig.
Brussels wants to strike an investment agreement with Beijing at the Leipzig summit. EU trade chief Phil Hogan has said that to do so, negotiations would largely have to be completed in July, but that a lot of time had already been lost.
An EU official close to the talks said that the two sides had not even started on a common official declaration for the March summit, seen as an essential step for progress to be made. 
In the past, such EU-China summits were seen mainly as ""feel-good"" gatherings to cement ties between two economies defending an open global economy based on multilateral rules.
But French President Emmanuel Macron has called for ""an end to naivety"" about Chinese power and the European Commission, the EU executive, last year labeled China a ""systemic rival"". 
Many European governments have felt frustration at what they say is China's failure to keep its promise to open up.

A second senior EU diplomat said China could try to use Leipzig as a ""huge propaganda machine"" to show close ties with the EU, the world's biggest trade bloc, in contrast to China's trade war with U.S. President Donald Trump.

1109,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 08:56AM ET</span>",China senior medical adviser: coronavirus pandemic 'over by June' if countries act,"By Stella Qiu and Kevin Yao
BEIJING (Reuters) - The global coronavirus pandemic could be over by June if countries mobilizes to fight it, a senior Chinese medical adviser said on Thursday, as China declared the peak had passed there and new cases in Hubei fell to single digits for the first time.
Around two-thirds of global cases of the coronavirus have been recorded in China's central Hubei province, where the virus first emerged in December. But in recent weeks the vast majority of new cases have been outside China. 
Chinese authorities credit strict measures they have taken, including placing Hubei under near total lockdown, with preventing big outbreaks in other cities, and say other countries should learn from their efforts.
""Broadly speaking, the peak of the epidemic has passed for China,"" said Mi Feng, a spokesman for the National Health Commission. ""The increase of new cases is falling.""
Zhong Nanshan, the Chinese government's senior medical adviser, said at a news conference on Thursday that as long as countries take the outbreak seriously and are prepared to take firm measures, it could be over worldwide in a matter of months.
""My advice is calling for all countries to follow WHO instructions and intervene on a national scale,"" he said. ""If all countries could get mobilized, it could be over by June.""
Zhong, an 83-year-old epidemiologist renowned for helping combat the SARS outbreak in 2003, said viruses in the same family typically become less active in warm months, which could help slow the spread.
""My estimate of June is based on scenarios that all countries take positive measures. But if some countries do not treat the infectiousness and harmfulness seriously, and intervene strongly, it would last longer.""
The World Health Organization on Wednesday urged the global community to redouble efforts to contain the outbreak, saying aggressive measures could still play a big role in curbing it.
Later on Thursday, Zhong held a teleconference with a group of U.S. medical experts, including from Harvard University, state television reported.
Zhong and his team shared their experiences of quickly testing and containing the virus, difficulties in treatment, and cooperation in clinical research, the report added.
The United States is now facing its own virus crisis as the number of infected people rises.
BUSINESSES REOPEN
With the marked slowdown of the spread of the virus in China, more businesses have reopened, with authorities cautiously easing strict containment measures.
Hubei province announced on Thursday a further loosening of travel restrictions and will also allow some industries to resume production in two of its cities and two counties.
Hubei's economy, driven by manufacturing and trade, including a sizable auto sector in the provincial capital Wuhan, had been virtually shuttered since Jan. 23.
While the virus is spreading quickly globally, its progress in China has slowed markedly in the past seven days. In all, 15 new cases were recorded in mainland China on Wednesday, down from 24 the day before. Seven of the new cases were outside Hubei, including six imported from abroad.
While only 85 of the cases in China have come from abroad, the rising number of such incidences has prompted authorities to shift their focus on containing the risk of imported cases.
The total number of cases recorded in mainland China was 80,793. As of Tuesday, 62,793 people had recovered and been discharged from hospital, or nearly 80% of the infections.
In Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, 34,094 patients had been discharged from hospitals, but over half of them were still under observation at so-called ""recovery stops"" - quarantine venues repurposed from hotels and student dormitories.
Hubei's health authority said the post-discharge quarantine was a precautionary measure, after a few discharged patients tested positive again. 
As of the end of Wednesday, the death toll in mainland China had reached 3,169, up by 11 from the previous day. Hubei accounted for 10 of the new deaths, including seven in Wuhan. 
'ENORMOUS STRAIN'
China is focusing on restarting factories and businesses hit by the containment policies. Factory activity plunged to its worst level on record in February, and while more businesses have reopened in recent weeks as containment measures have been eased, analysts do not expect activity to return to normal until April.
Airlines have been hit particularly hard. China's airlines reported total losses of 20.96 billion yuan ($3 billion) in February. The total number of airline passengers fell 84.5% year-on-year last month, China's aviation regulator said.
Local governments must do their utmost to ensure people return to work as soon as possible, the official China Daily said in an editorial.
Many businesses are still facing labor shortages and supply-chain disruptions, it said. 
""The epidemic control measures have put an enormous strain on China's enterprises, especially the small and medium-sized ones in the service sector,"" it said. ""Any further delay in their return to normal operations will entail widespread bankruptcies and job losses, which will threaten social stability.""
The Hubei government on Wednesday said Wuhan would allow some key industries to resume work.

On Thursday, it said containment measures would be relaxed in two other cities in the province - Qianjian and Shishou - and in the counties of Gongan and Zhuxi.

BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany will step up surveillance of a radical wing of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party after the domestic intelligence agency designated it as an extremist entity that threatens democracy.
Thursday's decision by the BfV intelligence agency to increase monitoring of ""Der Fluegel"" - The Wing - deals a blow to Germany's biggest opposition party, undermining its efforts to fend off accusations that it harbors racist views.
The AfD has ridden a wave of anger at Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 decision to welcome almost 1 million asylum seekers, and the BfV decision follows fatal attacks on Jews, Muslims and a liberal politician in Germany.
""Today I inform you that The Wing has been upgraded to an extremist entity,"" BfV chief Thomas Haldenwang told a news conference, calling its leaders ""right-wing extremists.""
The Wing, which is headed by Bjoern Hoecke, the AfD's leader in the eastern state of Thuringia, had already criticized the decision to conduct a 14-month review of its activities. Another of its leaders, Andreas Kalbitz, dismissed the BfV's conclusions on Thursday as politically motivated.
""This is no surprise because the political decision was made long ago even though it is groundless and motivated purely by political considerations,"" Kalbitz said. ""We will exhaust all judicial means available to fix this mistake.""
Hoecke has condemned an attack at shisha bars in western Germany last month by a racist gunman who shot dead nine people before killing his mother and himself. He also condemned attacks in October by an anti-Semitic gunmen in the city of Halle against a synagogue and a kebab restaurant that killed two.
Hoecke issued a statement with other AfD officials on Wednesday clarifying earlier comments about foreigners and the Holocaust that had caused controversy, apparently in anticipation of the BfV findings.
The deadly attacks shattered Germans' sense of security, renewed fears of far-right violence and prompted mainstream parties to accuse AfD politicians of contributing to an atmosphere of hatred that encourages violence.
JEWISH COMMUNITY WELCOMES DECISION
An investigation against the AfD as a whole is still under way. Haldenwang said the BfV estimates 20% of the AfD's 35,000 members belong to The Wing.
The designation of The Wing as extremist enables the BfV to deploy additional espionage methods to monitor its activities.
Haldenwang said the agency estimates that some 20% of AfD's 35,000 members belong to The Wing.
Joachim Seeger, which heads the BfV division for far-right extremism, denounced what he said was a racial purity agenda among some of The Wing's leaders that excludes non-Europeans, especially Muslims.
The Jewish community welcomed the BfV's decision.
""State organs must at the same time investigate how big The Wing's influence is within the AfD,"" said Charlotte Knobloch, a member of the Jewish community in Munich. ""The whole party should be monitored given that it enters elections as one and poses a threat to democracy.""
The decision could renew a debate in the AfD about Hoecke's growing influence in the party.
""Hoecke must ensure that The Wing draw a clear line between itself and extremists,"" said AfD Berlin lawmakers Georg Pazderski."

DUBAI (Reuters) - The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi movement in Yemen blocked southern separatist leaders from returning to Aden city, Yemeni officials said on Thursday, as a deal to end a power struggle in the south with the Saudi-backed government faltered.
The separatists are part of a Sunni Muslim coalition that intervened in Yemen in March 2015 to try to restore the government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi, which was ousted from the capital Sanaa in 2014 by the Iran-aligned Houthis.
However last year, the separatist Southern (NYSE:SO) Transitional Council (STC), which is backed by the United Arab Emirates and seeks self-determination in the south, turned on Hadi's government and seized its interim capital in Aden, sparking wider clashes that opened a new front in the war.
As part of a Saudi-brokered peace deal reached last year in Riyadh to end the stand-off between the Yemeni government and southern separatists, Saudi forces have taken control of most of south Yemen, following a withdrawal of the UAE military.
But the deal's implementation, including the formation of a new government, has stalled and tensions have been rising between Saudi-backed forces and STC fighters.
""Your southern resistance has been following closely the news about banning several southern leaders from returning to Aden,"" the STC said in a statement on Thursday.
""This sets a dangerous precedent that could trigger a popular uprising in the south which would be devastating,"" the statement added.
At least five STC leaders, including Aden's security chief Shalal Ali Shayea, were about to board a flight from Amman to Aden, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters.
The airplane could not take off after the Saudi-led coalition denied it clearance to enter Yemeni airspace, they said.
Coalition spokesman Colonel Turki al-Malki said no in-air flight was prevented from landing in Aden.
The kingdom's foreign ministry said it was committed to the implementation of the Riyadh agreement and called on both sides to work together and avoid escalation.
The move followed weeks of tensions between the two sides competing for control and influence.
Hadi's government had asked the UAE to stop arming and training separatist forces, while Abu Dhabi has said Hadi's government is ineffective and that it distrusts Islamists with whom the president is allied.
Riyadh began informal talks with the Houthis in late September on decreasing hostilities.
But fierce battles resumed last month and culminated with the Houthi group taking control of its capital al-Hazem.
The recent escalation has shattered more than three months of calm in the five-year-old conflict."
1121,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 06:55AM ET</span>","Sit, stay forever: Americans willing to pay top dollar to keep old dogs alive","By Barbara Goldberg
PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - On a follow-up visit after Sophie Cortellino's life-saving cardiac procedure, Dr. Anna Gelzer was delighted and family members were relieved to see her responding so well. Sophie agreed, her tail wagging excitedly. 
As the 9-year-old boxer lay on a metal table, Gelzer tried to push up her heart rate as part of a stress test following the procedure in August - a ventricular ablation for an arrhythmia, or irregular heartbeat, the first performed on a dog in the United States.
""You want a cookie?!"" Gelzer teased. ""Want to go for a walk?!""
The jagged line tracing Sophie's heartbeat on a monitor spiked dramatically but she lay calm and alert, and Gelzer grinned with satisfaction.
Sophie is one of countless aging American dogs undergoing cardiac treatments, stem cell transplants, tracheal stents, pacemakers and other sophisticated, expensive procedures to prolong their lives.
Owners of the dogs, many of whom have been around long enough to watch children grow up and provide support through countless family joys and traumas, are going to great lengths to prolong their lives, paying bills of up to $3,000 for stem cell therapy for arthritis and $7,000 for cardiac procedures like Sophie's.
""Dogs are like a person, a family member,"" said Gelzer, cardiology professor at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Veterinary Medicine in Philadelphia.
Nearly half of the nation’s 77 million pet dogs are aged 6 or older, a 15 percent increase since 1987, according to the American Veterinary Medical Association.
Larger breed dogs are considered geriatric at 6 years old, smaller breeds at 7 years old.
Aging dogs contend with many of the same illnesses as elderly humans, including heart disease, diabetes and senility. Cancer ravages canines at roughly the same rate as humans, striking nearly half of all dogs over age 10, experts say.
In Sophie's case, it was an arrhythmia, a condition that has been treated successfully in humans. 
In the procedure, a catheter was snaked through blood vessels into her heart's lower chamber, which pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body, and trouble spots were cauterized. Gelzer was joined in the operation by her counterpart who handles human patients, Dr. Cory Tschabrunn, on the Philadelphia campus.
LOYAL COMPANION
Karen Cortellino, a radiologist, recalled the time nearly a decade ago when she first met Sophie, an 8-month-old puppy who had been rejected by another family. Sophie has since helped celebrate Cortellino's son's college graduation and her daughter's law school commencement, and dressed up as a member of a family wedding party.
When Cortellino's elderly mother moved into their home in Montville, New Jersey, Sophie was her sole companion after others left each morning for work or school.
""They were the best of friends. My mom died last May and Sophie was there for that,"" Cortellino said. ""I would definitely sacrifice what I needed to in order for Sophie to have any procedure that would help her live longer - but well.""
When Sophie collapsed last summer and was diagnosed with an arrhythmia, Gelzer had just won a grant for a clinical trial to test canine ventricular ablations, so this procedure was free.
The eventual cost is likely to be $5,000-$7,000, Gelzer said, which Cortellino said she would be ""absolutely"" willing to pay if Sophie needs another one.
Her exam completed, Gelzer gladly accepted sloppy kisses from her patient.

""There is never a doubt that what we do is meaningful,"" Gelzer said. ""You have to enjoy working with the animals and with the owners. I like both - very much.""

1125,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 06:26AM ET</span>","In migrant crisis, Greece caught between EU job descriptions","By Luke Baker
ATHENS (Reuters) - When the current European Commission took office in December, its president, Ursula von der Leyen, created the role of a commissioner for 'Promoting our European Way of Life' and handed the job to a Greek politician.
The job title was originally 'Protecting our European Way of Life', but it was criticized for sounding xenophobic. Ironically, it is Greece that now finds itself caught between promoting and protecting what the EU stands for.
Since Feb. 28, when Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said he was opening the border and invited migrants and refugees based in Turkey - estimated at nearly four million - to cross into the EU, Greece has become Europe's bulwark against mass migration.
Erdogan made the move because he said the EU was no longer abiding by a 2016 deal under which Brussels offered 6 billion euros of aid to Ankara, provided it kept the refugees in Turkey.
Thousands of men, women and children from Syria, Iran, Afghanistan and as far afield as Morocco and Pakistan are now camped on the Turkish border, hoping to cross the Evros river and a steel-and-barbed-wire fence into Greece.
On March 1, Athens announced it was suspending asylum applications for a month, allowing for the immediate deportation of any migrants seized. Security forces say they have stopped nearly 45,000 people entering Greece in the past two weeks, with hundreds arrested and sent back.
EU leaders are desperate to avoid a repeat of the 2015/16 migrant crisis, when around one million people flooded into the bloc from Turkey, putting huge strain on national social services and straining relations among member states.
But in taking such a hard line, Greece has opened itself to criticism that it is flouting international humanitarian law and that the EU, which presents itself as a bastion of human rights and democracy, is an unwelcoming fortress.
NAZIS OR EUROPE'S SHIELD?
In the Turkish parliament on Wednesday, Erdogan showed members of his AK Party video footage of Greek security forces driving migrants back from the border and he compared them to Nazis.
""Opening fire on innocent people, exposing them to all kinds of inhumane treatment... is barbarism in the full sense of the word,"" he said, repeating a call for Greece to let the migrants cross and reach richer western European countries.
Greece, which denies that its forces are shooting at migrants, will find it especially galling to hear such criticism from Erdogan, long under fire from the EU over Turkey's own human rights record.
As well as wanting the EU to offer more cash and to fulfill other parts of the 2016 deal on customs rules and visas for Turks, Erdogan wants explicit European backing for his military engagement in Syria.
As a core member of NATO, to which most EU countries also belong, Turkey is sending the message that allies should be more grateful for what it is doing to check Russian influence in Syria and to try to bring order to warring Libya.
For Greece, which has endured a financial meltdown and one migration crisis already in the past decade and is now bracing for the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, the first priority is stability and defending its borders.
The European Commission has thus far given Athens full backing. Von der Leyen has described Greece as Europe's 'aspida', the Greek for shield. ""Our first priority is to ensure order is maintained at the Greek external border, which is also a European border,"" she said last week.
But after the New York Times reported on Tuesday that Greece was running a secret ""black site"" close to the border, holding migrants without access to lawyers or the ability to make asylum claims, - a claim denied by Athens - von der Leyen may have to find words that refer to the need to promote Europe's way of life, not just protect it."
1126,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 06:16AM ET</span>","Brazil's gangs emerge as major cocaine exporters, flooding Europe with white powder","By Gabriel Stargardter
SANTOS, Brazil (Reuters) - Years of rooting out drugs at the Brazilian seaport of Santos had given customs inspector Oswaldo Dias a good nose for suspicious cargo. A shipment of second-hand backhoes, bound for Europe late last year, seemed fishy.
So on the morning of Nov. 18, Dias sent the machinery through a scanner, which revealed a strange mass lodged inside one of the excavator's yellow arms. He hopped up for a look and saw cracks in the metal and a dodgy paint job. Dias called for a blowtorch.
Inside, he found 158 kilograms of cocaine - almost 350 pounds of white powder - destined for the Belgian port of Antwerp.
The use of decoy construction equipment, Dias said, was just the latest ruse employed by Brazil's drug gangs. In less than a decade, he had watched them rise from domestic street sellers to major international players, using Santos and other ports to ship narcotics offshore.
""Europe is the destination par excellence,"" said Dias, who retired late last year from Brazil's Federal Revenue Service.
Brazil has become one of the top suppliers of cocaine to Europe, transforming the country's role in the trans-Atlantic drug trade at a speed that has stunned anti-narcotics authorities.
Long regarded as a cocaine-consuming nation, a market for product manufactured in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, Brazil has turned into a critical launch pad to get it across the ocean. Local syndicates have infiltrated Brazil's ports, authorities said, sending record amounts of coke on container ships bound for Europe, where it fetches premium prices.
Brazilian gangs are now integral players feeding Europe's cocaine market, valued at more than 9 billion euros ($10.15 billion), according to a Reuters analysis of customs data on cocaine seizures, confidential intelligence reports and research studies on illegal drugs; and interviews with more than two dozen people, including law enforcement agents, public officials, diplomats, anti-narcotics experts and people involved in the illicit trade.
""For coke, Brazil has emerged as a major exporter nation,"" said Laurent Laniel, a senior analyst at the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA), the Lisbon-based EU drugs agency. ""This is definitely something that is new.""
The Brazilian cocaine trade spans vast distances across South America's largest nation. Reuters accompanied Brazilian and Peruvian police battling gangsters near the countries' shared border in the remote Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), where there has been an explosion of cultivation and processing of coca, the plant used to produce cocaine.
""It's out of control,"" Brazilian Federal Police Officer Antônio Salgado said after joining his Peruvian counterparts to take out coca processing labs. ""You go up in the helicopter and within two minutes you start seeing plantations here, there, everywhere.""
Reuters also reported from Paraguay, whose law enforcement has proven to be no match for Brazilian gangs using the country as a way station to move Andean product into Brazil; and from Santos, Latin America's largest port, where drug seizures keep breaking records.
Every link of this vast supply chain underscored Brazil's new status as a leading transshipment hub for coke to Europe, the world's second-largest economic bloc.
The shift can be seen in Belgium, the top gateway for South American cocaine entering Europe, almost entirely via the port of Antwerp, according to the EMCDDA. In 2019, authorities apprehended a record of nearly 62 tonnes of cocaine at Antwerp, Europe's second-largest port. The single-largest share of that - 15.9 tonnes, about a quarter of the total - came from ships arriving from Brazil, official Belgian data show. In 2015, Belgian customs seized just 293 kilograms (646 pounds) hailing from Brazil, less than 2% of that year's haul.
It's a similar story in Spain, Europe's second most important portal. Five years ago, Brazil did not rank among the major embarkation points for cargo ships caught bringing cocaine into Spain. The top five slots belonged to Colombia, Venezuela, Portugal, Ecuador and Chile, according to data provided to Reuters last year by Spanish customs. Brazil vaulted to the No. 1 spot in 2016 and again in 2018, when law enforcement seized a record 4.3 tonnes from ships arriving from Brazilian ports, the figures show.
Brazil was also the top point of origin for cocaine apprehended entering Germany in 2018, with a historic capture of nearly 2.1 tonnes, according to the most recent German customs data.
Experts cautioned that apprehension figures don't tell the whole story; bigger seizures can reflect better policing rather than increased flows.
But two things are certain: Europe is ""swimming in drugs,"" and Brazil plays an increasingly crucial role in getting them there, said Andrew Cunningham, another expert at EMCDDA, the EU drugs agency. ""There's absolutely no doubt about it,"" he said.

BRAZIL TAKES OFF
Brazil has always had the potential to become a major cocaine exporter, according to Elvis Secco, who leads a specialized anti-narcotics unit of Brazil's federal police. The country sits between coke-producing powerhouses to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east.
Brazil's three most important gangs - First Capital Command, Red Command and the Family of the North - have proven adept at moving drugs enormous distances to supply Brazilian consumers. With thousands of cargo ships leaving Brazil annually for Europe, Africa and beyond, there was no reason to stop at the water's edge, Secco told Reuters.
But other recent trends have helped Brazilian traffickers expand. Global cocaine production - almost exclusively from Colombia, Peru and Bolivia - more than doubled between 2013 and 2017, to reach an estimated 1,976 tonnes, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). South America has been awash with high-purity powder in need of buyers.
Burgeoning supplies have resulted in falling prices that have attracted new users worldwide, according to the UNODC's World Drug Report 2019.
With distribution into the lucrative U.S. market cornered by Mexican cartels, Brazil's gangs trained their sights on Europe. Prices there are higher than in the United States, due to the longer distances it must travel, authorities said. Europe is also a convenient pit stop for cocaine bound for growing markets in the Middle East and Asia, they added.
Like Europe, Brazil is also flooded with coke. In 2019, the federal police nabbed a record 105 tonnes, up 32% from 2018. Brazil's law-and-order President Jair Bolsonaro says it's proof the country is winning its war on drugs. ""We're suffocating organized crime,"" he tweeted in October.
Secco, the Brazilian federal police drug czar, was more circumspect. He said apprehensions are up because Andean production has risen sharply and more cocaine is entering Brazil, ""not because of any new investments"" in law enforcement.
DRUGS ON THE DOCKS
Much of the cocaine flowing through Brazil to Europe is trafficked by Brazil's largest and most powerful criminal organization, First Capital Command, known by its Portuguese acronym PCC, according to authorities.
They say the gang dominates a prime smuggling route that starts in Bolivia, then heads southeast to Brazil via Paraguay, where the syndicate is overwhelming that nation's weak institutions. In January, 75 PCC members escaped from a Paraguayan prison in a brazen jailbreak that top security officials knew was coming, but were powerless to stop, because the gang had so many prison guards under its sway.
Based in São Paulo, the PCC dominates the nearby port of Santos, which handles some 7,000 containers a day. Police say the gang bribes or threatens port workers to place cocaine in outbound shipping containers. Some drugs come aboard cargo ships at sea, with smugglers pulling alongside in smaller craft, said Cunningham of the EU drugs agency.
After reaching Europe, the merchandise is distributed across the continent by Eastern European, Moroccan and Italian mobsters partnered with the PCC, officials said.
In July 2019, Brazilian police arrested Nicola Assisi, reputedly a senior player in Italy's 'Ndrangheta mob, along with his son Patrick, near Santos. They are ""accused of being some of the biggest suppliers of cocaine to Europe,"" according to a Brazilian federal court document. Currently jailed in Brasília, they await extradition to Italy. Their lawyer, Eugênio Malavasi, declined to comment.
With Santos swamped with cocaine, port officials have tightened security. Since 2016, every Europe-bound container has been X-ray scanned, according to Dias, the retired customs inspector. In 2019, customs agents nabbed a record 27 tonnes of cocaine at Santos, a 154% increase from three years earlier.
Ciro Moraes, the federal police commander in charge of Santos, reckons authorities only catch a fraction. The only good news, he said, is that cargo theft at the port has declined precipitously. ""The guys who were stealing cargo are now in drugs logistics,"" he said.
COCAINE SURGE IN THE AMAZON
Brazil's gangs also import cocaine into the remote, northern Amazon region of the country along the so-called triple frontier with Colombia and Peru, according to federal police.
They say much of the product enters Brazil by boat along the Amazon River, bound for Manaus, a city of roughly 2 million people. From there, it moves downriver until it reaches northeastern seaports like Suape and Natal in preparation for the Atlantic crossing.
The Family of the North, known as the FDN, is the biggest player in the Amazon, authorities said. But booming European exports have lured challengers, with the PCC, Rio de Janeiro's Red Command and others looking to wrest control.
Much of the ensuing violence has played out in the region's jails where gangs recruit unaffiliated prisoners into their crews. Brazilian authorities blamed warring cartels for two prison riots that killed more than 100 people last year. Shootouts are common in Manaus and along the Amazon River. Police say they are increasingly outgunned.
Gangs are ""less scared and more powerful"" than they used to be, said Brazilian Federal Police Officer Charles Nascimento, a veteran of the Amazon drugs beat.
Bolsonaro's government has taken aim at the gangs by targeting their finances and moving jailed leaders to maximum-security federal lockups.
Brazil is also cooperating with other affected countries. Belgian and Brazilian authorities in 2019 pledged to deepen information sharing, tighten port security and tackle money laundering. And Bolsonaro's administration is stepping up anti-narcotics efforts with its Andean neighbors.
GANG PACT
Late last year, Reuters joined a joint mission between Brazil and Peru, spending a week with four Brazilian federal police officers and a few dozen Peruvian anti-narcotics cops in Caballococha, a Peruvian town of about 24,000 people. Accessible only by air or boat, Caballococha sits on the banks of the Amazon, just south of Colombia and about 100 kilometers upriver from the Brazilian border.
This region of Peru, classified as the Bajo Amazonas, accounts for just 4% of the nation's 50,000-hectare coca crop, according to the UNODC. But cultivation is growing, up 41% in 2017 from the previous year, the most recent data show.
Colonel Miguel Ángel Peric, the local head of Peru's anti-narcotics police, said those figures don't begin to capture the scale of the problem. He estimated almost all of Caballococha's residents had some direct or indirect link to the cocaine trade. Peruvian cops told Reuters they suspected some colleagues were in league with traffickers, although they presented no evidence.
Shifting gang alliances have added to the complexity. A partnership has emerged between Brazil's FDN and Los Caqueteños, a Colombian gang that supplies it with coke produced at home and in Peru, according to two classified intelligence reports seen by Reuters, one from Brazilian police and the other from Colombian cops.
Los Caqueteños was founded in 2010 by former members of a local paramilitary force and is based in the Colombian border town of Leticia. It is ""the most belligerent organization in the triple frontier region,"" according to the Colombian report.
The bi-lateral anti-narcotics force hoped to disrupt some of Los Caqueteños' operations around Caballococha. But out in the jungle, the police always appeared to be one step behind the traffickers.
DISAPPEARING ACT
The mission relied on two aging Russian Mi-17 helicopters provided by the Peruvians. One broke down immediately, causing a delay of a few days while a new part was flown in.
Once the chopper was repaired, the mission netted just three arrests. Suspects vanished into the jungle at the sound of approaching aircraft.
The team also torched five so-called paste labs, which perform the first stage of processing on coca plantations. These facilities are typically crude shacks where workers fill plastic barrels with coca leaves, gasoline and other chemicals to form coca paste. This green-hued sludge is then transported to more sophisticated labs to be processed into white, powdery cocaine.
But as the days passed, the paste seizures didn't amount to much. Then came a potential break. An informant said a small plane carrying 300 kilograms (661.4 pounds) of coca paste had crashed during takeoff from a clandestine landing strip. There were another 700 kilograms (1,543.2 pounds) by the side of the runway, guarded by as many as 10 heavily armed men, according to the informant.
Around noon the following day, a few dozen Peruvian police set off in the choppers. As the runway came into view, helicopter gunmen strafed it with machine-gun fire.
But upon landing they found no armed guards, no drugs and no plane. They located the charred wreckage of a Beechcraft Baron 58, a Brazilian-owned aircraft, hacked up and left in the river. It, too, was empty."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Sydney resident Dianne Regan has stockpiled enough food to last her household for eight weeks should the authorities impose a lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus.
Her sense of urgency is even more pronounced because she lives with her 23-year-old daughter who has asthma and her 83-year-old mother.
""Things have just been escalating day by day by day,"" Regan told Reuters at her home.
""I've started seeing the videos where people were being locked down. They couldn't go out. I thought: I'm going to not wait.""
A growing number of Australians are stockpiling household goods, fearing the coronavirus outbreak will result in shortages.
""I started going out and slowly, slowly each week, adding extra things into my normal shopping, making lists of things, if we did have to go into lockdown, if we were put into quarantine, things we would need,"" Regan said.
She says she has filled her pantry and a separate storage box in the living room.
Australia has had 140 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 virus, and three deaths - a fraction of those reported in Italy, for example - but shoppers around the country have stripped supermarket shelves of staples in a rush of panic buying.
The demand for toilet paper, in particular, sparked the trending hashtags #toiletpapergate and #toiletpapercrisis on Twitter. Baffled officials have called for calm.
Australia's major grocers Woolworths Group and Coles have put limits on purchases some routine grocery items, putting pressure on the country's supply chain.
""You don't need to go crazy,"" said Regan, who washes her hands frequently for 20 seconds, followed by a dousing of hand sanitizer.
""You don't need to go and clean out the shelves. You need to sit down, make out some lists, plan things, talk to your family about hygiene and about how to protect yourself."""

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (Reuters) - A year after New Zealand's deadliest mass shooting, a survivor who became a worldwide symbol of forgiveness says he still feels no anger about the attack, but misses his wife so much he forgets she is gone.
Farid Ahmed, whose wife Husna was one of 51 people killed by a gunman at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, reached out within days of the attack to express his forgiveness to the family of the man charged with the murders. He has since been a public face of the survivors, and has met Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and U.S. President Donald Trump.
""I have taken the tragedy as an opportunity to spread the message of peace and love,"" Ahmed told Reuters through tears in an interview ahead of the anniversary of the attack. ""I never felt angry but I ask what was her crime? She didn't hate anyone.""
Ahmed has written a book, Husna's Story, about his wife, the massacre and what he describes as his ""journey to forgiveness"". Proceeds are donated to an ambulance charity.
Husna was shot dead by the gunman while running from the building to look for Ahmed, who uses a wheelchair from an earlier accident. Sometimes he still imagines her sitting beside him in his car, he said.
""I'm driving (and) I look at my side and I feel she is there and suddenly not there,"" he said."

CASTILLETES, Colombia (Reuters) - In the sun-baked scrubland of northern Colombia's remote La Guajira province, a bitter quarrel rages between two neighboring Wayuu indigenous families, one of them seeking refuge from a humanitarian crisis across the border in Venezuela.
Their feud was sparked by goats. Without fences to stop them, their herds mingle amid the low bushes between the two homesteads, whipped by a hot and dusty desert wind here in ancestral Wayuu territory.
One family, the Ipuana Montiers - who recently arrived from Venezuela, fleeing shortages of food and medicine - say they have lost 50 goats to the herd belonging to their more established neighbors, the Ipuana, who count local leaders among their ranks.
Such conflicts over land, water and animals are increasingly common as Venezuela spirals into disaster and thousands of indigenous Wayuu who once left their Colombian homes for Venezuela return. The influx is testing the limits of tribal unity, according to Wayuu police and tribal mediators, known as pütchipü'üs.
In a dark green house with plastic siding at the end of a long, rutted dirt track, Rangel Ipuana - a pütchipü'ü who is the patriarch of the Ipuana clan - says he wants to avoid conflict, but many of the returnees from Venezuela have forgotten the Wayuu way of life.
""Families are returning to where their grandparents lived and there's been so much conflict and theft because they don't know how to manage the land,"" said the 72-year-old.
Wayuu people - who generally speak both their own Wayuunaiki tongue and Spanish - have citizenship rights in both countries.
Some migrated to Venezuela over the past two decades to take advantage of free education and other benefits. But hyperinflation and a six-year recession under President Nicolas Maduro have driven thousands back, part of a wave of some 1.7 million people who have fled Venezuela for Colombia in recent years.
For already-struggling communities - which often scrape by on subsistence ranching and gasoline smuggling - the needs of returning Wayuu are hard to meet. Malnourishment has long plagued Wayuu children and many communities can ill afford more mouths to feed.
With dozens of disputes now raging, Wayuu leaders say they hope mediation will head off escalations in violence, as brawls break out between neighbors and within families.
Yohedys Palmar, a Wayuu police inspector in Castilletes - which overlooks an aquamarine bay in the eastern reaches of Upper Guajira - said there are about 10 active disputes in his area alone, the majority involving returning Wayuu.
""There has been violence,"" said Palmar. ""Up to now it hasn't come to deaths, but that could happen if conflicts are not resolved.""
Palmar said he had heard of killings related to returnee disputes in the inland settlement of Jarara. Reuters was not able to independently confirm this.
Scant mobile phone service makes communication difficult in the impoverished and isolated region, where the Colombian state is virtually non-existent.
The hyper-localized system of pütchipü'üs also makes data collection on the conflicts difficult, said Alberto Henriquez, the secretary of indigenous affairs for the Uribia municipality, which includes Upper Guajira.
Palmar's father, Rafael Sapuana, is the pütchipü'ü in charge of the Ipuana dispute involving the Venezuelan returnees.
""They come with so many needs, with hunger, without work,"" said Sapuana, a father of 50 children, from a nearby grouping of houses where he lives with some of his family. ""We want to avoid blood-letting ... War doesn't bring anything good.""
""We hope the government, President Duque, will give us a hand with the crisis.""
MENDING FENCES
Maria Elena Ipuana is the matriarch of the Ipuana Montiers. She has returned to settle on this patch of family property with her husband Angel Jose Montier and more than 40 of her children and grandchildren, after years of sporadic travel back and forth to Maracaibo, a center of the oil industry in Venezuela.
""Food used to be really cheap in Venezuela, now it's so expensive,"" Ipuana said. ""We have to survive however we can.""
The family is squeezed into five small makeshift houses. Two of the grandchildren, ages 1 and 4, have frail limbs indicative of malnutrition.
And the family is about to grow - Ipuana's sister, brother-in-law and 22 of their children and grandchildren will arrive soon from Venezuela, she said.
A resolution to the goat disagreement would take at least one problem off the family's long list, Ipuana said.
""We need this problem to be mediated, to be resolved, to avoid conflict with the other family,"" she said.
The following day both families descended on the Sapuanas' homestead to shake on a deal: any further dispute between them would result in the aggressor owing the other family 50 goats or sheep. They sealed the agreement with shots of burning chirrinche liquor.
A reconciliation is the best-case scenario, but there is no shortage of disputes.
Uribia, where the population of 205,000 is 95% Wayuu, has had at least 38 cases of land conflicts to date involving people returning from Venezuela, said Henriquez.
Because local government has limited power in Wayuu territory, that may not be an accurate representation of the frequency of disputes, he added.
""There's lots of cases where the family uses a pütchipü'ü and it's solved based on custom."""

BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thailand's health authorities are encouraging people to make cloth face masks at home to guard against the spread of the coronavirus amid a shortage of surgical masks.
Thailand, which has reported a total of 70 cases, put surgical masks and sanitizers under its list of controlled goods last month, as the spread of the coronavirus led to shortages in stores.
The shortage of surgical masks prompted the Thai government to approve a 225 million baht ($7 million) budget last week for government agencies to produce 50 million cloth masks in a matter of days for nationwide distribution.
Cloth masks are enough to prevent people from catching the virus via droplets from coughing or sneezing, said Panpimon Wipulakorn, Director-General for the Department of Health.
""The droplet from coughing and sneezing is around five microns and we have tested already that cloth masks can protect against droplets bigger than one micron,"" Panpimon said, adding that the masks needed to be washed daily.
The official herself appeared in a public health ministry video teaching people how to make cloth masks at home. Workshops have also been set up nationwide to help produce the masks.
Many Thais answered the government's call by getting together in small groups at community centers around the country to make masks from cloth and distribute them to others for free.
It did not take long for Phongsai Kaewvichit, a 63-year-old retiree, to make one.
""I'm making these cloth face masks for my family and relatives because I can't find the surgical masks anymore and the price is very high,"" said Phongsai.
""I think it is better than nothing because at least it can protect me from people's saliva in close contact."""

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's highest court on Thursday deferred ruling on an appeal to overturn the conviction of former Vatican treasurer George Pell for sexually assaulting two teenaged choirboys in the 1990s.
After two days of legal arguments, the High Court of Australia said it was still considering whether to allow the appeal, the last avenue for the 78-year-old cardinal to clear his name.
If the court does agree to consider the appeal, the seven-member panel of justices will then move straight into deciding whether to acquit Pell or uphold his conviction, a process that will not require another public hearing. A third option - sending the case back to a lower court - is also possible.
""The court reserves its decision on this matter,"" High Court Chief Justice Susan Kiefel said, after hearing arguments from Pell's lawyer and the Crown prosecutor.
Kiefel did not give a timeframe for the court's decisions.
Pell became the highest ranked Catholic worldwide to be jailed for child sex offences when he was sentenced to a six-year term. He has been in prison for a year and will remain there while the High Court considers its judgments.
Pell was convicted by a jury in December 2018 on one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and four charges of an indecent act with a child under 16 when Pell was archbishop of Melbourne.
His legal team took the case to the High Court after the Court of Appeal in Victoria upheld his conviction with a 2-1 majority. His lawyers argued that the lower court verdict erred in shifting the onus of proof to the defense and in finding that it was open to the jury to find Pell guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Crown prosecutor Kerri Judd faced heavy questioning on Friday about the facts of the case, which highlighted potential doubts about whether Pell could have committed the offences.
Pell's lawyers argued that he would have been on the front steps of St Patrick's Cathedral greeting parishioners at the time that his accuser said he was in the priests' sacristy alone with two boys.
Pell's lawyer, Bret Walker, said it would be wrong for the High Court to send the case back to the Court of Appeal.
""We win this argument, we wish the matter to be over,"" he told the justices. ""The best way for it to be over is by an order of this court entering acquittal."""

LONDON (Reuters) - The Coq D'Argent restaurant in the heart of London's financial district is normally packed at lunchtime with diners enjoying Chateaubriand or Sole Meuniere while knocking back wines that go for up to 2,550 pounds ($3,300) a bottle.
On Wednesday the dining room was half-full, as bankers and traders stayed away thanks to restrictions, some self-imposed, on traveling to work during the coronavirus outbreak.
""Covers in all areas have dropped, for breakfast, lunch, dinner and evening, and there are also less people travelling in to Central London on the weekends,"" said Sean Gavin, who manages the restaurant just a stone's throw from the Bank of England.
As the spread of the coronavirus in London keeps many of its more than 750,000 financial services workers at home or in suburban backup centers, many high-end eateries are suffering.
From the Paternoster Chop House in the shadow of St Paul’s Cathedral to the Smith & Wollensky steakhouse in the art deco Adelphi building on the banks of the Thames, managers said customer numbers had fallen.
""We have seen an immediate and significant impact on our events and private dining business,"" said Nathan Evans, who manages Smith & Wollensky.
""No international company wants to be responsible for putting 200-plus employees or customers in a room together for a dinner or function while the true impact of COVID-19 is unknown,"" he said.
Britain has 456 confirmed cases of the virus so far, and as of Wednesday, the government had yet to declare it was moving from the 'containment' to 'delay' stage of a four-phase plan for combating the pandemic.
Measures that could be introduced when that switch happens could include a ban on large public gatherings and requirements for people to socialize less, threatening a further blow to the hospitality industry.
The outbreak of the coronavirus strain known as COVID-19 has cost the restaurant 75,000 pounds worth of bookings in 10 days, Evans said. Losses are exacerbated because insurers are refusing to recognize the virus as a claimable event, he added.
HAND SANITIZER
Those customers that do come have changed their behavior, said Sam Bernard, who runs German Gymnasium restaurant which serves European food in a cavernous former gym near St Pancras international train station.
""Guests bring their hand sanitizer to the table and do not dine very late,"" he said.
The rise in remote working has dried up the breakfast and lunch trade in particular, several of the restaurant managers said, and they called on the government to implement measures such as a temporary cut in business rates to keep them afloat.
Britain's finance minister on Wednesday unveiled a package of measures to help companies facing a cash-flow crunch, including a year-long suspension of a property tax paid by smaller firms.
The measures might not help high-end restaurants in London, however, which are often owned by larger investment groups such as D&D London in the case of Coq D'Argent, Paternoster Chop House and German Gymnasium.
Some restaurants hit by the drop in customer numbers have shied away from trying to lure more in with special offers, saying they felt such actions inappropriate, but have been bolstered by the continued custom of their regulars.
""Regular guests are still dining out and we are very grateful for the keep calm and carry on approach that the majority of the public have adopted,"" said Evans at Smith & Wollensky, where additional hygiene measures have been introduced.
Restaurants have been trying to cut costs elsewhere rather than lay off workers, according to Matthew Maynard who runs Bluebird restaurant in the affluent Chelsea area, in the hope that the city workers return sooner rather than later.
""It looks like some good weather is coming our way so we hope to see our guests flocking to our terrace where we will certainly be waiting  with an 'elbow bump',"" he said referring to the greeting now preferred by many to a handshake.

Beijing has been exerting pressure on foreign companies and organizations to identify Chinese-claimed Taiwan as part of China, and often to name it as a Chinese province.
Taiwan has strongly objected to this, saying it is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name, that it has never been part of the People's Republic of China and that Beijing has no authority over the island.
The issue has come to a head again during the virus outbreak, with the World Health Organization (WHO) listing Taiwan's case numbers under China's, referring to the island as ""Taipei and environs"".
The designation ""Taipei and environs, China"" had begun being used by Johns Hopkins on an interactive map https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html it publishes tracking the virus outbreak around the world.
But, in a rare diplomatic victory for Taiwan, the university has now changed that, and again calls the island simply ""Taiwan"". Taiwan's Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday it had asked its representative office in the United States to lodge a protest with Johns Hopkins.
""During a comprehensive review of the dashboard this week, Professor Lauren Gardner and her team decided to align the names of nations with the World Health Organization's naming conventions to achieve consistency in reporting,"" the university said in an emailed statement, referring to the professor who oversees the mapping project.
""Upon further consideration, the team now uses U.S. State Department naming conventions, including the use of Taiwan.""
Taiwan Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Joanne Ou expressed approval for the name change, and said the island was looking forward to ""deepening cooperation"" with the university.
""At the same time we thank the Trump administration and members of the United States Congress for their kind support for Taiwan,"" she added.
Taiwan has reported 48 virus cases, compared with more than 80,000 in China, and has won plaudits from experts for effective controls at keeping its tally so low, especially considering it is next to China and how many Taiwanese work and live in China.
Taiwan says its inclusion by the WHO as part of China's ""virus area"" has misled countries into believing its situation was as serious as China's, and to take measures to restrict or ban visits by Taiwanese nationals."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea on Thursday reported 114 new cases of the coronavirus and six more deaths, resuming a relative decline in new cases after a spike the day before.
The new cases bring the country's total to 7,869, with 66 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said (KCDC), as health officials seek to track down and contain a number of new clusters of infections, including at a call center in the capital Seoul.
The numbers are far lower than the peak of 909 cases reported on Feb. 29, and health officials said the trend does appear to be slowing in what has been the largest outbreak in Asia outside of China.
Still, authorities say the coming days will be crucial in South Korea's fight to contain the outbreak, and the government will double down on its efforts to prevent new clusters from spreading.
""It is too early to say we are overcoming the disease,"" Yoon Tae-ho, director general for public health policy, said at a briefing. 
""We are still witnessing sporadic outbreaks so we cannot lower our guard.""
Nineteen of the new cases reported on Thursday were in Seoul, where at least 102 people working at a call center have tested positive for the coronavirus, raising concerns about a wider outbreak in the capital.
Nearly 800 people working in the call center and 200 residents of the building have been tested, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon said.
""Containing the spread from the call centre is decisive in blocking additional transmission of the coronavirus,"" Park said. ""We will focus all necessary personal and material support on the area.""
Seventy-three of the new cases were from the city of Daegu, the epicenter of the country's outbreak.
Yoon urged South Koreans across the country to avoid public gatherings and maintain ""social distancing"" from other people.
The government also said it would expand fever screening and other monitoring measures for people arriving from certain European countries.
South Korea is one of several countries affected by a new U.S. Defense Department decision announced on Thursday to restrict travel by its troops and their families for the next 60 days.
Around 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, along with thousands of civilian employees and family members.

At least eight people connected to the U.S. military in South Korea have tested positive for the virus, and bases in the country have imposed some restrictions and additional screening at their gates.

1137,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 12, 2020 12:25AM ET</span>",Salvadoran police face trial for murder of trans woman deported from U.S.,"SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Three police officers in El Salvador will be tried for the murder of a transgender woman who was deported from the United States two years ago after failing to prove her life was at risk in the violent Central American country.
The unidentified police officers face prison sentences of up to 30 years. They all deny the charges.
Camila Diaz, a 29-year-old sex worker who fled from El Salvador following repeated threats on her life from a gang, was killed in early February after she was kidnapped and beaten.
Judge Sidney Blanco said in court proceeding on Wednesday that sufficient evidence existed to implicate the police officers for the crime of aggravated homicide.
El Salvador's attorney general's office has said that on Jan. 31 the accused officers arrested Diaz for supposedly creating a public nuisance and then forced her into a police vehicle.
Once in the vehicle, she was severely beaten and then thrown out onto a highway, according to prosecutors.
Diaz died of her injuries in hospital three days later.
She had turned herself over to U.S. immigration agents in August 2017 in a bid to apply for asylum protections, arguing that she had received death threats from members of Barrio 18, one of El Salvador's most violent street gangs.
But she was deported in November 2017 after her asylum request was rejected, and she returned to sex work in San Salvador.
Violence against transgender women in El Salvador has been a problem for years.
More than 600 transgender women were murdered between 1993 and 2020, according to one human rights group."

The former British colony was rocked by months of sometimes violent protests from last June, triggered by a now-suspended bill that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.
The U.S. State Department said in a report on Wednesday that significant human rights issues in the Chinese-ruled city included police brutality against protesters, interference with the right of peaceful assembly and restrictions on political participation.
Hong Kong's government said the police were duty bound to take appropriate action, including the use of necessary force, in the face of violence that endangered public order.
""The degree and extent of violence committed by radical protesters was unprecedented in Hong Kong, and it has seriously endangered people's personal safety, public order and security,"" the city's government said in a statement.
Safeguarding human rights and freedoms was a constitutional duty, it added.
""The government attaches the utmost importance to and is firmly committed to upholding human rights and various freedoms in Hong Kong.”
The U.S. State Department, in its Country Reports on Human Rights Practises, noted examples of police brutality against protesters including on Aug. 31 when police ""rushed onto a subway train and beat several individuals while making arrests"".
On press freedom, the State Department cited many journalists as saying they were harassed, detained or assaulted while covering the protests, while the house of democracy activist Jimmy Lai, who is also an outspoken critic of Beijing and owner of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Daily newspaper, was attacked.
The State Department also referred to vandalism on the part of protesters, including damage to the office of China's official news agency, Xinhua, in November.
The city government said freedom of speech and freedom of peaceful assembly were ""not absolute"".
""The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights provides that restrictions might be imposed by law if this is necessary to protect, amongst others, national security, public safety, public order or the rights and freedoms of others,” it said.
The unrest in Hong Kong developed into calls for greater democracy, fueled by worries about the erosion of rights guaranteed under a ""one country, two systems"" formula imposed when the city returned to Chinese rule in 1997.
The city government said universal suffrage was an ultimate aim but it needed dialogue in an atmosphere of peace and mutual trust leading to consensus.
""Any allegations of political censorship, restriction of the freedom of speech or deprivation of the right to stand for elections are totally unfounded,” it said."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - One British and two American personnel were killed and about a dozen people were wounded when 18 small rockets hit Iraq's Taji military camp north of Baghdad on Wednesday, U.S. officials told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
The officials, who cautioned the death toll may rise given the severity of some of the injuries, said it was too soon to assign blame. Any indication that Iran-backed militia were responsible could spark a new round of confrontation between the United States and Iran.
The last military escalation led to a U.S. strike in January that killed top Iranian General Qassem Soleimani, which, in turn, led Iran to fire missiles at a base in Iraq hosting U.S. forces, leaving more than 100 troops with brain injuries.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has argued the killing of Soleimani was necessary in part to deter Iran and Iran-backed groups from additional attacks. 
The U.S.-led military coalition in Iraq said in a statement that 18 107 mm Katyusha rockets struck the base and suggested they may have been fired from a truck.
It confirmed three personnel were killed and about a dozen wounded but declined to disclose the nationalities of the casualties or offer any other identifying information.
""The attack is under investigation by the Coalition and Iraqi Security Forces,"" the U.S.-led coalition said.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson issued a statement condemning the attack and added that Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab had spoken with Pompeo.
""We will continue to liaise with our international partners to fully understand the details of this abhorrent attack,"" Johnson said, without confirming British casualties.
WAR POWERS VOTE
In a sign of concern that tensions between the United States and Iran could be headed toward open conflict, the Democratic-led U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to limit President Donald Trump's ability to wage war against Iran.
The Republican president has been engaged in a maximum-pressure campaign of renewed sanctions and near-constant rhetorical conflict against Iran, after pulling the United States out of the international nuclear deal reached during the administration of his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama.
Tensions between Washington and Tehran have mostly played out on Iraqi soil in recent months.
Iran-backed paramilitary groups have regularly been rocketing and shelling bases in Iraq that host U.S. forces and the area around the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. 
The Kataib Hezbollah militia was blamed for an attack on a base last year that killed an American contractor, which led to retaliatory U.S. strikes against it in Iraq and Syria.
Syrian state media reported on Wednesday that unidentified jets hit targets southeast of a Syrian town along the border with Iraq.
But there was no indication so far that those strikes were by the United States. U.S. officials told Reuters the United States had not carried out any retaliatory strikes at this point.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation on Wednesday to limit President Donald Trump's ability to wage war against Iran, amid continuing concern about broader conflict after a January strike killed an Iranian commander,
The House voted 227 to 186 in favor of the war powers resolution, the latest effort by Congress to wrest back from the president its constitutionally guaranteed authority to declare war. Almost every Democrat voted in favor of the resolution. Just six of Trump's fellow Republicans supported it.
The measure - authored by Democratic U.S. Senator Tim Kaine - would require Trump to remove U.S. troops engaged in hostilities against Iran unless Congress declares war or passes a specific authorization for the use of military force.
""It's our responsibility to do something because we know the tensions could flare up again at a moments notice,"" said Representative Eliot Engel, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, urging a ""yes"" vote.
Trump has been engaged in a maximum pressure campaign of renewed sanctions and near-constant rhetorical conflict against Iran, after pulling the United States out of the international nuclear deal reached during the administration of Democratic President Barack Obama.
The Senate passed the war poweres resolution last month, so approval sends it to the White House, where Trump has promised a veto.
Although eight of Trump's fellow Republicans in the Senate - who rarely break from the president's policies - joined Democrats to support the resolution in that chamber, the resolution was not expected to muster the two-thirds majorities in both chambers to override a veto.
WAR FEARS
Representative Mike McCaul, the foreign affairs committee's top Republican, argued that voting on the resolution was irresponsible, and Congress would be better off addressing the coronavirus pandemic.
He said the measure ignored the ""remarkable restraint"" Trump had shown in dealings with Iran.
""This will be the fifth time that this Congress ... we are considering a war powers resolution directing the president to withdraw U.S. forces from wars we are not actually fighting,"" McCaul said.
The bill's supporters noted that they were gaining more support for efforts to take back Congress' authority to declare war. The Constitution gives that power to Congress, not the president, but presidents from both parties in recent decades have expanded the White House's authority to pursue military action without legislators' input.
""Our founding fathers did not want dictators running America,"" said Representative Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 Democrat in the House.
Many members of Congress, including some Republicans, have pushed the administration for more information about the killing in January of top Iranian military commander Qassem Soleimani at Baghdad's airport. [L1N29C1XS]
Trump did not inform Congress about the drone strike until after it took place and then, according to many lawmakers, his administration held back too much information about the reason for the strike and its legal justification.
Fears of wider conflict also could be fueled by the killing of two American and two British personnel on Wednesday when small rockets hit Iraq's Taji military camp north of Baghdad.
U.S. officials said it was too early to assign blame, but any indication that Iran-backed militias were responsible could ignite a new round of military escalation."

It gave no details. Western intelligence sources say the border town lies on a strategic supply route for Iranian-backed militias who regularly send reinforcements from Iraq into Syria to aid Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces.
Israel has attacked Iranian bases in the area several times since the start of the year, they added.
Two American personnel and one from Britain were killed, and about a dozen people were wounded when 15 small rockets hit Iraq's Taji military camp north of Baghdad on Wednesday, two U.S. officials told Reuters, citing preliminary information. 
Albukamal along the Iraqi-Syrian border crossing is crucial for Iran’s bid to cement its growing sway over a corridor of territory from Tehran to Beirut.
Iran-backed Iraqi Shi’ite militias known as the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF) captured Albukamal on the Euphrates River from Islamic State toward the end of 2017.
They now control the mainly Sunni tribal town and its outlying area and have a large presence, intelligence sources say. 
The Iranian-backed militias are also in control of large stretches of the frontier on the Iraqi side.

MONTREAL/OTTAWA (Reuters) - Iran has agreed to send black boxes from a downed Ukrainian jetliner to Kiev for analysis, an Iranian official said on Wednesday, a move that would end a two-month standoff over the recordings from the jet.
Top Iranian officials have until now refused to hand over the flight recorders from the Ukraine International Airlines flight, which was shot down by the Iranian military on Jan. 8 with the loss of all 176 people on board.
Farhad Parvaresh, who heads Iran's delegation at the U.N.'s Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), said Tehran's civil aviation authority had also invited other interested countries to participate in reading the data.
This effectively opens the door to the United States, Ukraine, Canada and ICAO itself, people familiar with the investigation said. Air crash investigations are usually left to ICAO's 193 member states.
Canadian Foreign Minister Francois-Philippe Champagne described the move as a step in the right direction.
""We welcome those words, but we will judge Iran obviously by their actions,"" he told reporters. Ottawa has repeatedly pressed Iran to hand over the damaged boxes from the crash, in which 57 Canadians died.
Iran had also made clear it would transfer the boxes to France if need be, Champagne said. 
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau urged Iran in January to send the recorders to France, one of the few countries with the ability to read damaged black boxes.
Andriy Shevchenko, Ukrainian ambassador to Canada, tweeted that the announcement was ""an important result"".
Under U.N. rules Iran retains overall control of the investigation while the United States and Ukraine are fully accredited as the countries where the jet was respectively built and operated. 
Canada is notionally on a lower rung of official access as the home of many of the accident's victims, but in practical terms it is expected to have an active role following strong pressure from Trudeau, safety experts said.
""We will have our experts there present so we can better assess (if there) was any tampering with the black boxes,"" Champagne said.
It remains unclear how much cooperation there would be on the probe between the United States and Iran, with relations at their lowest point in years.

Salvatore Sciacchitano, president of ICAO's governing council, welcomed what he said was Iran's confirmation of its intention to have the black boxes analyzed in either Ukraine or France.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Syrian defector who smuggled thousands of photographs of torture out of the country, helping prompt new U.S. sanctions, pleaded with U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday to enforce tough measures against Syria's government over atrocities during its civil war.
""We have worked and we continue to work in order to bring the pleas and the screams of tens of thousands of those that remain in detention,"" the defector, known only by the code-name ""Caesar,"" said amid tight security at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing.
Both the Senate panel and the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee held hearings on Wednesday to mark nine years since the start of the civil war in Syria.
The House hearing focused on the crisis in Syria's northwest Idlib region, which has seen escalating clashes involving Turkey and Russia.
The conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people, making millions refugees and devastating entire cities as one truce after the other failed.
Caesar smuggled thousands of photographs out of the country in 2013, exposing mass killings, torture and other crimes. He testified before the House committee in 2014, helping prompt legislation named after him calling for new sanctions on the government of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Russia and Iran, which support him. 
The measure became law as part of a defense authorization bill Trump signed in December. It has yet to be fully implemented.
Caesar said activists were grateful for the law, but more must be done.
""Killing has increased in the same places and in the same ways and at the hands of the very same criminals. And the reason simply is that the Assad regime considered the inaction of the international community and the mere statements of condemnation as a green light for him to continue his crimes,"" he said in prepared testimony.
Representatives from the Syrian Emergency Task Force and the Syria Civil Defence (or White Helmets) also testified in the Senate.
Senator Jim Risch, the committee's Republican chairman, said he was working with the Trump administration to ensure sanctions were implemented. ""The Syrian people deserve better,"" he said.
The committee's top Democrat, Senator Bob Menendez, said he hoped testimony about the war's impact ""pricks the conscience"" of the United States.

""We have not seen assertive policies from either of the past two administrations,"" he said, referring to the Republican Trump and his predecessor, Democratic former President Barack Obama.

VIENNA (Reuters) - One of the three sites in Iran about which the U.N. nuclear watchdog says it has raised questions that Tehran has failed to answer may have hosted uranium metal, the United States said on Wednesday, providing new details on the locations.
The International Atomic Energy Agency policing Iran's troubled nuclear deal with major powers rebuked Tehran last week for failing to reply to its questions about nuclear activities dating back to the early 2000s at three sites and for denying its inspectors access to two of them.
Uranium metal has long been an issue of interest to the IAEA in investigating Iran's past work. In 2005 Iran handed the IAEA a 15-page document given to it by a nuclear black market network showing how to make two uranium metal half-spheres like those that often make up the core of an atomic bomb.
""Iran has refused to address the agency's questions regarding possible undeclared natural uranium at a location that has been heavily sanitized,"" the United States said in a statement to the IAEA's quarterly 35-nation Board of Governors meeting, using a term that often refers to construction or demolition work aimed at removing traces of nuclear material.
""In the agency's assessment, the nuclear material in question may potentially be uranium metal,"" the U.S. statement said. The special IAEA report to the board made no mention of uranium metal, though the reference to natural uranium indicates that the uranium was not enriched for use as nuclear fuel.
Iran has long maintained that it did not ask for the uranium metal document given to it by the network that help it set up a secret uranium enrichment program exposed in the early 2000s. During its years-long investigation of Iran, the IAEA sought to find out to what extent Iran worked on uranium metal.
U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe Iran had a secret nuclear weapons program that it halted in 2003. While Iran's 2015 deal with major powers largely drew a line under its past nuclear activity, the IAEA must also account for all nuclear material in Iran regardless of when it was produced.
""Any refusal to cooperate with the IAEA on questions of possible undeclared nuclear material would be of serious proliferation concern,"" said the statement by the United States, which exited the deal in 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran.
""But given the potential for use of uranium metal in nuclear weapons research and development activities, the presence of even small quantities of undeclared uranium metal in Iran today would raise even more worrying questions,"" it added.
One of the two sites the IAEA sought to inspect and was denied access to could have hosted ""activities potentially related to uranium conversion"", a process that precedes enrichment in the fuel cycle, the U.S. statement said.
When asked about the U.S. allegations, Iran's ambassador to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, said that reports on such issues are confidential. ""Iran ... is not going into detail on the confidential issues,"" he said.
The Islamic Republic denies ever seeking nuclear weapons."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia put a U.S. student on trial on Wednesday for allegedly drunkenly assaulting two police officers as his father said state investigators had failed to secure basic evidence that could potentially prove his son's innocence.
Trevor Reed, 28, a student at the University of North Texas and a former U.S. Marine, was taken into custody in Moscow last August for allegedly endangering the lives of two police officers who had detained him.
Reed, who could face up to 10 years in jail if found guilty, is accused of grabbing an officer who was behind the wheel, causing the vehicle to swerve dangerously, and of elbowing a second officer.
Reed appeared downcast at the hearing and made a heart sign with his hands to his parents and sister who were watching proceedings. He told the court he was currently not ready to either plead guilty or innocent to the charges.
The police officers testified at the trial, saying Reed's actions had caused the car to swerve dangerously and that they had been scared for their lives.
Reed has no recollection of what happened after he drank vodka at an Aug. 15 party, which he attended with his Russian girlfriend, Alina Tsybulnik. He grew agitated after attending the party, prompting a colleague of his girlfriend to call the police, Tsybulnik said.
She said she had followed the car after his detention and saw no sign of it swerving dangerously. Reed's father, Joey, said traffic footage obtained by the defense showed the car did not swerve.
He said the defense had immediately asked investigators to obtain surveillance footage from inside the police vehicle as well as outside and inside the police station, but that investigators had failed to do so before it was later wiped.
""The defense attorneys believe that if we had those videos, we wouldn't be talking to the media today. This (case) would not even be in court,"" he said.
""There are a lot of irregularities (in the case)... Any of those things could have been answered if we had the video,"" he said.
Tsybulnik said Reed had sustained bruising to his nose and two parts of his legs the night of his arrest, but was told by prosecutors when he complained that the injuries had nothing to do with law enforcement authorities.
Reed traveled to Moscow last May to spend the summer with his girlfriend and learn Russian."

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday handed a win to President Donald Trump by leaving in effect a policy that requires thousands of people seeking asylum at the southern border to wait in Mexico while their claims are adjudicated.
The court granted an emergency request filed by the administration and lifted a partial block on the program imposed by the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court on Feb. 28 issued a ruling blocking the policy but then immediately put it on hold while the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to intervene.
The brief court order noted that one of the nine justices, liberal Sonia Sotomayor, would have denied the application.
""Asylum seekers face grave danger and irreversible harm every day this depraved policy remains in effect,"" said Judy Rabinovitz, a lawyer at the American Civil Liberties Union, which represents those challenging the policy.
Trump has declared the policy, announced in December 2018, a success in reducing the flow of hundreds of thousands of people from Central America into the United States as he campaigns for a second term in office. 
Challengers, including 11 asylum seekers who were returned to Mexico and several immigration advocacy groups, say the program, called the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), violates U.S. immigration law and international obligations on the treatment of asylum seekers. 
""The Migrant Protection Protocols, implemented pursuant to express authority granted by Congress decades ago, have been critical to restoring the government’s ability to manage the Southwest border and to work cooperatively with the Mexican government to address illegal immigration,"" a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement.
About 60,000 people have been sent back to Mexico to await the outcome of their cases in often dangerous border towns where they are vulnerable to kidnapping, rape, robbery and other crimes while living in sometimes unsanitary conditions. The government says 36,000 cases have now been resolved and warned that those with pending claims might have rushed the border if the policy was partially blocked.
Trump, who has made cracking down on immigration a central theme of his more than three years in the White House, has sought, through a series of new policies and rule changes, to reduce asylum claims..

The policies on curbing asylum applications have cut the number of illegal crossings and have been more successful than Trump's efforts to build a physical barrier on the border.

Talking through a face mask, she wiped the counter clean with an alcohol spray.
Across the Usera neighborhood and elsewhere in Madrid, many Chinese shop owners have either closed or said they were considering doing so. Most other stores across the city were still open despite a steep rise in coronavirus cases in Spain.
""It's to protect clients and our workers too,"" said 29-year-old Aurora Li, the Chinese owner of a cosmetics shop, when asked why so many Chinese-owned stores were shutting.
Li said her parents, who also live in Spain, were thinking about going back to China, the country where the coronavirus first appeared but where the number of new cases has slowed following drastic measures to contain the outbreak.
With over 2,100 confirmed cases and 47 deaths so far, Spain has overtaken France as Europe's second-largest coronavirus hub after Italy.
It started taking measures such as shutting down some schools and public libraries this week. Half of the nation's confirmed cases occurred in Madrid.

The rival Fianna Fail and Fine Gael parties decided on Tuesday to open coalition talks this week, saying the coronavirus outbreak had increased the urgency in forming a new government which can command a majority.
Ireland on Wednesday confirmed its first death of a patient diagnosed with the coronavirus.
Fianna Fail and Fine Gael need the support of at least one other party or eight independent lawmakers in the fractured 160-seat parliament. They singled out the Greens on Tuesday saying they would talk with the party's 12 lawmakers, however the Greens rejected the approach.
They have previously talked with both parties separately.
""The party are calling on all parties to suspend discussions on forming a majority government and work towards forming a crisis national government to be reviewed in three months,"" the Green said in a statement, following a party meeting.
Acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar ruled out the prospect of a cross-party national government this week and both Fianna Fail and Fine Gael steadfastly refuse to govern with Sinn Fein, the third of three large parties in parliament, over its role as the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army.

The IRA fought British rule in Northern Ireland for decades in a conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal.

1152,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 02:02PM ET</span>",The revolution that wasn’t: Bernie Sanders' second presidential bid falls to earth,"By Simon Lewis and Michael Martina
DETROIT (Reuters) - Michigan voter Monique Dooley believed in Bernie Sanders’ forceful message of support for America’s working class.
So she cast a ballot Tuesday in Detroit for the Democratic candidate she believes can win back the White House: Joe Biden.
“If we are going to be unified, I think we should go with him,” said Dooley, an African-American fifth-grade teacher.
Millions of Democrats across the country agreed with Dooley during Tuesday's nominating contests, adding to the momentum and delegate count that has resurrected the former vice president's campaign. Biden won at least four of the six states that voted, including the biggest prize of Michigan, dealing another blow to the ""political revolution"" promised by 78-year-old Sanders.
Many voters said they admired the Vermont senator's authenticity and consistent message, and like his policies, but had cast ballots strategically for Biden, the candidate they think can beat President Donald Trump in the November general election.
“This isn’t the time for extreme,” said Kurt Nortin, a 55-year-old substitute teacher who saw Biden speak in St. Louis on Saturday.
Sanders fell short of his primary performances against Hillary Clinton in 2016, when he pulled off an upset in Michigan and lost by a whisker in Missouri. On Tuesday he lost handily in both those states, places where he hoped to demonstrate his strength among Midwestern voters. Sanders only pulled off a win in North Dakota, a small state with few delegates. In Washington state, Biden and Sanders were in a virtual tie with more than two-thirds of the votes counted.
""Last night obviously was not a good night for our campaign,"" Sanders told reporters in his hometown of Burlington on Wednesday. He insisted he was staying in the race and would draw a sharp distinction with Biden in a televised debate scheduled for Sunday in Arizona.
Sanders said he was winning ""the ideological debate"" on issues such as universal healthcare that are popular with many Americans, as well as the ""generational debate"" with his appeal to younger voters. Yet he acknowledged many Democrats were still choosing Biden because they believe the former vice president is the best candidate to defeat Trump.
""Needless to say, I strongly disagree with that assertion,"" Sanders said. ""But that is what millions of Democrats and independents today believe.""
Sanders had promised his platform of ambitious social programs and raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy would expand the electorate. Instead Americans of all stripes turned out for Biden: women and men, white and black voters, those with or without college degrees, and self-described liberals and moderates. Sanders only dominated among young voters and Latinos.
State after state, voters by roughly 2 to 1 said they would rather pick a candidate who can beat Trump than one they agree with on major issues, according to Edison Research exit polls in the states that voted on Tuesday as well as last week's Super Tuesday contests.
The overwhelming majority of these voters who cited beating Trump as the top priority - 61% in Michigan, 67% in Missouri, and 82% in Mississippi - voted for Biden, the polls show.
It was a stinging setback for Sanders, who just two weeks ago was riding high with back-to-back strong showings in Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada.
Wall Street investors fearful of a government takeover of healthcare dumped shares in health insurers, while Democratic Party insiders sounded the alarm that the self-described democratic socialist would not only lose to Trump in November but would also hurt the party's chances down ballot.
Biden, the moderate former vice president under Barack Obama, was helped in part by a wave of endorsements from moderate Democrats and former rivals, including Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar who ended their own presidential bids and rallied behind him. On the eve of the pivotal Michigan primary, former rivals Kamala Harris and Cory Booker stumped for Biden at a Detroit rally.
But progressives, whose loyalties had been split between Sanders and Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who dropped out of the race on Thursday, have yet to close ranks around Sanders.
While nearly all of Biden's moderate rivals endorsed Biden after ending their own presidential bids, Warren has yet to throw her support behind her longtime progressive ally.
Some Warren supporters said they were unable to overcome concerns about Sanders’ electability or the perceived divisiveness of his supporters, despite agreeing with much of his policy platform.
Dooley, the Michigan teacher who voted for Biden, said she liked the platforms of both Sanders and Warren. But when Warren dropped out, Dooley said her personal admiration for Sanders could not bring her to vote for him. She said she was thinking about November.
“For the general population, I feel that (Sanders) might be a little too liberal, Dooley said.
On Tuesday, even voters describing themselves as liberal broke for Biden in Missouri and Mississippi, and were evenly split between Biden and Sanders in Michigan, according to exit polls.
At the same time, many of the ideas Sanders has been taking around the country for the better part of the last five years appear popular among voters. Even in Mississippi, where Sanders was routed by a 66-point margin, 60% of voters said they favored the idea behind Sanders' Medicare for All bill, replacing private healthcare with a single government plan for everyone.
“Democrats right now aren’t necessarily voting on policies,” said Andrew Feldman, a Democratic political consultant in Washington.
“The reality is they're prioritizing electability because of the unique threat of Trump, and they're saying that Biden is across the board more electable,"" he said.
TAKING ON THE ESTABLISHMENT
After losing the Democratic nomination to Clinton in 2016, Sanders built a formidable campaign apparatus for his 2020 run, bolstered by an army of devoted supporters who contributed small donations to his campaign in unprecedented numbers. [L4N2A00B6] 
It all seemed to be paying off when he emerged out of Nevada's Feb. 22 caucuses as the clear delegate leader after three states had voted.
But exuberant crowds of 10,000 people or more at Sanders' rallies masked his narrow coalition of voters. His mostly young supporters did not turn out to the polls in large numbers, while Biden dominated among the older voters who did show up.
In Michigan, even as turnout surged from 1.2 million in 2016 to an estimated 1.7 million in 2020, Sanders' core base - voters between the ages of 18 and 29 - made up just 15% of the Democratic primary electorate, down at least 4 percentage points from four years ago.
Sanders showed little interest in reaching out to the Democratic Party's moderate wing, fueling criticism that he, and his fiercest supporters are sowing intra-party division ahead of a bruising general election battle against Trump.
When Sanders’ campaign on Monday held a call with former Warren supporters to get their input on how to court those who have yet to back him, “it did not go well,” according to a person familiar with the call. 
The Warren supporters suggested adopting some of her policies and addressing abusive language of some Sanders backers online, but found the campaign unwilling to take responsibility for the behavior, the person said. 
The Sanders campaign did not respond to a request for comment about the call. 
When Sanders emerged as a front-runner, Republicans began casting November's vote as ""America vs. Socialism."" Sanders' Democratic rivals warned that his history of positive comments about left-wing governments like Cuba and Venezuela would damage the party and play into some Americans' fears of a socialist takeover.
Gary Williams (NYSE:WMB), a 64-year-old physical therapy assistant from Detroit, said he did not see Sanders as a socialist, but that he had a ""message for the people.""
Still, Williams said he feared that with what he called the “establishment” of the Democratic Party against Sanders, Biden was a better bet to beat Trump.
“If you were to ask what Biden’s message is, I don’t even know,” said Williams. He said he voted for Biden anyway. 
That kind of singular focus among Democratic voters was on display at Biden's St. Louis rally.
Nortin, the substitute teacher, showed up wearing an t-shirt emblazoned with AOC, the acronym for Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive lightning rod who has challenged the party’s Old Guard and supports Sanders.

But 55-year-old Nortin said he's casting his lot with Biden with one thing in mind: “We gotta get (Trump) out.""

The overwhelming majority of East Jerusalem's more than 340,000 Palestinians identify as such. The Palestinians have long sought the city's east, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally, as capital of a future state.
Palestinians in Jerusalem hold Israeli residency permits but few have citizenship in Israel, which considers the entire holy city as its eternal, undivided capital. Jerusalem is also home to more than 500,000 Israelis.
The change in U.S. terminology comes amid increased wrangling over the contested city following the release of President Donald Trump's Middle East plan, which says Jerusalem should ""remain the sovereign capital of the State of Israel"" under any Israeli-Palestinian peace accord.
State Department reports on human rights practices from 2018 and 2019 referred to East Jerusalem Palestinians as ""Palestinian residents of Jerusalem"" in sections on civil judicial procedures, discrimination and freedom of movement.
Those same sections in the 2020 report referred to Palestinians as ""Arab residents"" or ""non-Israeli citizens"".
Palestinian leaders criticized the change.
""Palestinian Jerusalemites are Palestinians, and they've been living there for centuries,"" said Hanan Ashrawi, a senior Palestine Liberation Organisation official who herself holds a Jerusalem residency permit.
""Just to decide this, to eradicate their identity and history and culture and rename them at will, is not only preposterous, its unconscionable,"" Ashrawi said.
Israel embraced Trump's Middle East plan, released in January, while Palestinians rejected it out of hand, in part because it designated the urban sprawl to the north and east of Jerusalem but cut off from it by an Israeli military barrier as a future Palestinian capital.
The Palestinians have boycotted Trump's peace efforts since he recognized Jerusalem as Israel's capital in 2017 and later moved the U.S. Embassy there, accusing Washington of pro-Israel bias."

AZAZ, Syria (Reuters) - In Syria's northwest, where people uprooted by war are crammed into camps, medics fear the coronavirus would spread widely if it reaches a country with its healthcare system in ruins.
Doctors and aid workers say they have recorded no cases so far. But they warned that camps would not cope in the event of an outbreak, with hospitals already struggling to treat even basic illnesses after nine years of war.
Omar Hammoud, a children's doctor in Azaz town, says a clear plan has yet to be drawn up for Syria's northwest, the last big insurgent bastion outside state hands.
""I've taken my precautions in dealing with patients and I'm trying to calm their panic, because there is so much talk about the virus,"" he told Reuters at a clinic that belongs to IDA, a Turkey-based aid agency that runs healthcare facilities on the Syrian side of the border.
Across the world, the number of coronavirus cases has topped 119,000 and nearly 4,300 have died as the outbreak spread to more countries, prompting greater economic damage.
Within the Middle East, Iran has been worst hit with around 9,000 people infected and 354 deaths. Turkey by contrast, which borders northwest Syria and has forces stationed across the frontier, confirmed its first case on Wednesday.
The World Health Organization said on Wednesday only half of health facilities remained operational in northwest Syria, where fighting has forced about 1 million people to flee since December.
Many live in squalid makeshift camps and sleep outdoors in olive groves in a region where much of the population had already fled battles in other parts of Syria earlier in the war.
""If the virus spreads in the camps, controlling it would be very difficult, with the tents so close to each other,"" Hamoud said. ""There is no safe distance between people here, there is overpopulation.""
He said medics, who received gloves and masks from the aid group, were checking patients, disinfecting everything and trying to keep camp residents informed about symptoms of the virus.
But there was only so much they could do.
The UK-based Islamic Relief charity warned that healthcare in Idlib in the northwest was already ""at the brink of collapse"".
The population suffers from mass homelessness and chronic illnesses such as heart disease and diabetes as well as trauma injuries from the conflict, it said in a statement on Wednesday.
""People's immune systems have been systematically worn down by the violence and years of malnutrition and poverty,"" it said. ""The conditions are rife for an outbreak that we simply do not have the resources to handle."""

Rwanda has not recorded any cases of the virus so far but neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo confirmed its first case on Tuesday, making it eight countries in sub-Saharan Africa hit by the epidemic.
At the biggest car park in Kigali, passengers must wash their hands before they board buses - adopting the hygiene mantra advocated by health authorities across the world to tackle the outbreak.
“Authorities advised us to buy these hands washing machines and ask customers to use them. We are doing this to fight the coronavirus outbreak,” said Jimmy Blaise Bugingo, an inspection officer at Alpha Express, a bus company that travels to Congo.
Banks, shops, restaurants as well as bars, have all been equipped with portable wash sinks and customers seem keen to use them.
“I just washed my hands at the bank and I now I just did again,” said Jean Pierre Habimana 48-year-old father of four as he was boarding a bus.

DUBLIN (Reuters) - The Irish government will not prioritise a particular part of its economy in its fiscal response to the coronavirus epidemic, the finance minister said on Wednesday after calls from the hospitality sector for help.
Ireland also recorded its first death from the outbreak on Wednesday, an elderly woman with an underlying illness, national broadcaster RTE reported.
The confirmed cases of coronavirus in Ireland rose to 34 on Tuesday from 24 a day earlier, the health department said in a daily update.
Although Ireland is in the early stages of the outbreak, the government has set aside 3 billion euros to deal with the economic fallout, primarily through boosts to sick pay.
With hotels and restaurants already reporting cancellations, the Restaurants Association of Ireland has called for a temporary cut in sales tax for the sector and a halving of social insurance contributions.
""In the coming days and weeks...we will feel and will hear many different parts of our economy indicating the acute challenge that they are going to face,"" Paschal DonohoeDonohoe told a news conference.
""It wouldn't be appropriate to begin to be prioritising a particular part of our economy given this will be an economy-wide challenge.""
A 2011 cut in the VAT rate for hotels, restaurants and other tourist businesses to 9% from 13.5% helped lift a sector reeling from Ireland's financial crisis to a boom in recent years that continued past the resoration of the sales tax rate in 2019.
However the Restaurant Association said its members reported that 80% of their corporate booking had been cancelled, and that was before all St. Patrick's Day parades around the country - big draws for tourists each March - were called off this week.

Owen Ncube, Zimbabwe's state security minister, was blacklisted over accusations that he ordered security services to abduct and mistreat members of the opposition group, the Treasury Department said in a statement.
The Treasury Department said it imposed sanctions on Anselem Sanyatwe, Zimbabwe's ambassador to Tanzania, accusing him of directing security forces to attack protestors during demonstrations after the 2018 elections, when he was commander of the National Army's Presidential Guard Brigade.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in a statement on Wednesday urged Zimbabwe's government ""to immediately end state-sponsored violence including against peaceful protesters, civil society, labor leaders and members of the opposition in Zimbabwe, and to investigate and hold accountable those responsible for human rights violations and abuse.""
Six protesters and bystanders died and dozens were injured in 2018 in violence following delays in announcing results that made Emmerson Mnangagwa the first elected head of state since Robert Mugabe's removal from power.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. authorities on Wednesday sought ways to deal with a growing outbreak of coronavirus, the Trump administration is considering cutting taxes, Democratic presidential candidates are canceling events and the governor of New York state is saying the federal government had ""fallen down on the job.""
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the administration was looking into taking steps that could put hundreds of billions of dollars into the U.S. economy to shield it from a slowdown brought on by the disruption from coronavirus.
Health Secretary Alex Azar said federal leaders were working with local officials in the hardest hit states, including Washington, California, New York, Massachusetts, and Florida, saying ""strong mitigation steps"" could help buy valuable time.
The governor of New York, however, said federal officials had left states scrambling to act on their own, including ramping up testing for the highly contagious - and sometimes fatal - respiratory illness.
""We can't wait for the federal government because it's not going to happen,"" said Andrew Cuomo, who has deployed the National Guard to help contain an outbreak in the suburbs of New York City.
""The federal government has just fallen down on the job,"" Cuomo, a Democrat, told MSNBC, adding that he had told other state governors, ""You're on your own.""
The number of U.S. coronavirus cases has risen steadily and has affected almost three-quarters of the states. More than 1,000 cases and 31 deaths have been reported.
As the outbreak spreads, daily life in the United States has been increasingly disrupted, with concerts and conferences canceled and universities telling students to stay home and take classes online.
Public gatherings have been suspended in a coronavirus ""hot zone"" in New Rochelle, a New York City suburb, and Chicago canceled its St. Patrick's Day parade scheduled to take place on March 14, according to the parade's website
Police wearing riot gear broke up a protest by hundreds of students at the University of Dayton in Ohio after the school announced the suspension of classes and on-campus housing on Tuesday, the Dayton Daily News reported.
Democratic presidential contenders Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders were left to reassess how to campaign in the face of the spreading outbreak, after the former vice president nearly swept a big day of nominating contests.
The two candidates canceled election night rallies on Tuesday, citing recommendations from public health officials to avoid assembling large indoor crowds.
Biden's campaign also scrapped a Thursday get-out-the-vote event in Florida, which holds a primary vote next week to nominate a Democratic challenger to Republican President Donald Trump in November.
The White House is examining tax relief measures, loan guarantees, reimbursing workers for lost pay, aid to small and mid-sized businesses, and support for airlines, hotels and other travel businesses, Mnuchin said.
He likened the coronavirus outbreak to a hurricane, and said the costs needed to be picked up. But he said Trump felt strongly that U.S. companies needed to be protected, not bailed out.
""Whatever we do, kind of in the next 48 hours, that's just the first step. We'll be back. And I think there's big bipartisan support. People understand that we have to help small and medium-sized businesses and certain industries,"" Mnuchin told a House of Representative committee.
A central feature of the administration's plan to counter the economic effects of coronavirus is payroll tax relief, although the extent and duration of the proposal were unclear.
Trump is scheduled to meet with bank executives at the White House on Wednesday.
New York and Washington state are struggling to make testing for the virus widely available, with local officials estimating it could take weeks more to reach peak testing capacity.
An unidentified flaw in test kits distributed by the federal government in February, which gave some false results, has set the country back in containing an outbreak that has infected more than 121,000 people worldwide.
Vice President Mike Pence said on March 4 that roughly 1.5 million tests would be available by the end of that week, while Trump told reporters on Friday that ""anyone who wants a test, gets a test"".
But more than a week later, the ramp up has been much slower due to regulatory hurdles at the federal and state level, as well as logistical and technical challenges, according to healthcare providers, public health officials and test makers.
Washington Governor Jay Inslee was expected on Wednesday to restrict large gatherings in three counties at the center of the coronavirus outbreak in the state, according to the Seattle Times. The move will be aimed at sports, concerts and other cultural events and will not affect retail stores, the newspaper reported.
A package of Democratic proposals to address problems arising from the coronavirus outbreak could be voted on by the House as early as this week, including paid sick leave for those affected, a House Democratic aide said.
The bill, still under development, could also expand federal food aid programs, especially to low-income families whose children might not be able to attend schools where they receive meals."

LONDON (Reuters) - The family of the only man ever found guilty of the 1988 Lockerbie aircraft bombing can appeal against his conviction, an independent Scottish review body ruled on Wednesday, after it concluded there might have been a miscarriage of justice.
Pam Am Flight 103 was blown up over the Scottish town of Lockerbie in December 1988 en route from London to New York, an attack that killed 270 people, mostly Americans on their way home for Christmas.
In 2001, Libyan intelligence officer Abdel Basset al-Megrahi was jailed for life after being found guilty of the murder of 243 passengers, 16 crew and 11 residents of Lockerbie who were killed in the attack.
Megrahi, who denied involvement, died in Libya in 2012 after being released three years earlier by Scotland's government on compassionate grounds following a diagnosis of terminal cancer.
On Wednesday, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission said it had referred his conviction to Scotland's High Court, the second time the SCCRC had given permission for an appeal.
""The commission now believes that a miscarriage of justice may have occurred in Mr Megrahi’s case,"" it said, saying there were two reasons for its decision: unreasonable verdict and non-disclosure of evidence.
""We note that since our last review further information has become available, including within the public domain, which the commission has now been able to consider and assess,"" Bill Matthews, the commission chairman, said in a statement.
""I am satisfied that the matter is now returning to the appropriate forum – the appeal court – to consider fully all of the issues raised in our statement of reasons."" 
Megrahi first appealed in 2002 but this was refused by Scotland's High Court. In 2003 he appealed to the SCCRC and the case was referred to the High Court for a second appeal in 2007. But he abandoned this in 2009 just before his return to Libya.
In 2017, his family asked the SCCRC to look at the case again.
In 2003, then-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi accepted his country's responsibility for the bombing and paid compensation to the victims' families, but did not admit personally ordering the attack. Scotland's top prosecutor said in 2014 that no evidence had emerged to cast doubt on the conviction.

However, Megrahi's family and some relatives of the Scottish victims have always doubted his guilt.

Sudan's ruling council said on Tuesday it would step up its drive to remove loyalists of former President Omar al-Bashir, a day after Hamdok escaped the assassination attempt unscathed.
They have not said who was behind it, but by reasserting that Bashir loyalists will be firmly dealt with, they have suggested possible links with old regime supporters trying to disrupt a democratic transition.

""A drone killed six people in a mini bus yesterday, including a 13-year-old boy named Abdifatah Farhan Mohamud,"" he said. ""Six of them were civilians and they were buried near the area where they were bombed by the drone, because they could not be carried as they were burnt into pieces.""
U.S. Africa Command said in a statement that Tuesday's strike near Janaale town had killed ""five terrorists"" and added ""while we currently assess that this air strike injured no civilians, we are aware of social media reports alleging civilian casualties ... U.S. Africa Command said it will review any information it has about the incident.""
Africa Command said it investigates any reports of civilian deaths, but so far it has only verified two civilian deaths in 2018 despite carrying out scores of strikes. There have been 26 strikes this year so far. There were 63 strikes last year.
It's unclear how strikes are investigated or the dead identified as al Shabaab militants. Somalia's bloody civil war means large swathes of the country are off limits to government forces or their allies.
The air strikes are largely aimed at the al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab insurgency, which is fighting to oust the weak, internationally-backed government and rule using the insurgency's own strict interpretation of Islamic law.
Mohamed Aden Bare, who told Reuters he was the brother of the minibus driver, said his brother was a civilian and the others aboard the bus were farmers and local residents.
""The drone hit the front part of the mini bus which mybrother was driving. We found no trace of him save a small piece of flesh that was found stuck on the destroyed seat,"" he told Reuters.
Last month a U.S. air strike in a town held by Somali Islamist insurgents killed a telecommunications worker, the man's employer said. Africa Command said he was a member of al Shabaab.
International rights group Amnesty International released a report a year ago alleging U.S. strikes were killing civilians.
The report said 14 civilian had been killed in just five air strikes between 2017 and 2018. Africa Command initially denied the allegation but later concluded that two civilians died in a 2018 strike.
Somalia has been at war since 1991, when warlords in the Horn of Africa nation overthrew a dictator and turned on each other. "

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean President Sebastian Pinera celebrated 30 years since Chile's return to democracy on Wednesday, even as scattered incidents of violence broke out across the capital alongside renewed calls for a mass protest against social injustice and inequality. 
Dictator Augusto Pinochet overthrew the democratically elected socialist government of Salvador Allende in September 1973. During Pinochet's reign, which ended in 1990, some 3,000 people died or disappeared in Chile. Many more were tortured, according to government truth commission findings. 
Pinera said in a speech at the La Moneda presidential palace Wednesday that democracy was squandered in 1973 when political forces turned to violence, urging against substituting ""dialogue for intolerance."" 
""We must combat violence and care for our democracy,"" he said, warning that ""democracy is never guaranteed.""
Opposition party leaders nonetheless boycotted Pinera's mid-morning ceremony, calling the celebrations inappropriate given a resurgence of abuses by police during protests late last year. 
Several human rights groups have filed reports detailing allegations of torture, unnecessary force and sexual assault following months of riots in late 2019.
Allegations against security forces have lingered through March, when protests began anew after many Chilean workers and students returned from the summer holiday in the southern hemisphere.
On Sunday, onlookers captured video footage of police beating a male protestor, sparking renewed fury in Chile. 
Patricio Bao, 69, required 14 stitches in his eyelid and head after an assault in which, footage shows, he was beaten with batons, and then throttled and dragged by two heavily armed riot policeman after he attended the Womens’ Day march through central Santiago with his wife and daughters. 
As barricades burned in the background, several women are seen screaming, begging the police to stop and trying to put themselves between the officers and the man in the video which went viral on social media. 
The incident was widely condemned, with Chile’s interior minister declaring it an “excessive use of force.” 
Jose Miguel Vivanco, the Americas director of Human Rights Watch, which has studied Chilean police handling of almost five months of unrest, said it was a “grotesque, brutal spectacle.” 
Police said Bao had attacked an officer prior to the beating and been detained for affray. 
On Tuesday, Bao lodged a complaint against police at the Chilean investigative police (PDI)’s human rights unit.

The Chilean prosecutor’s office will oversee the case, a spokesman confirmed.

Beside Macron as he welcomed King Felipe in the courtyard of the Elysee Palace in Paris, French first lady Brigitte Macron played her part too, blowing a kiss in the direction of Queen Letizia by way of greeting.
European public health authorities say people should avoid shaking hands to curb the spread of coronavirus, which can be transmitted through skin-to-skin contact.
Spain has 2,124 confirmed cases of the virus, while in France there are 1,784 cases, according to the latest data collated by Reuters.
In France, the outbreak has reached the heart of political power, with Macron's culture minister testing positive, and his chief of staff in isolation after coming into contact with an infected person.

1171,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 10:25AM ET</span>",Sixteen more years? Russian parliament backs move to keep Putin in power,"By Andrew Osborn and Polina Ivanova
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Constitutional changes allowing Vladimir Putin to run for president again in 2024 sailed through both houses of Russia's parliament on Wednesday, raising the prospect he could clock up over three decades in the Kremlin.
Putin, 67, who has dominated Russia's political landscape for two decades as either president or prime minister, made a dramatic appearance in the lower chamber a day earlier to argue that term limits were less important in times of crisis. 
A former KGB officer, Putin is currently required by the constitution to step down in 2024 when his second sequential and fourth presidential term ends. But the amendment which he backed would formally reset his own presidential term tally to zero. Successors would face a two-term limit however. 
The 450-seat State Duma, the lower house of parliament, on Wednesday backed the term reset for Putin, along with other amendments to the constitution, by 383 votes, in a third and final reading. Nobody voted against; 43 lawmakers abstained.
Hours later, the 170-seat Federation Council, the upper house of parliament, gave its approval by 160 votes to one with just three abstentions. 
If, as Putin critics expect, regional parliaments and the constitutional court now give their blessing and the overall changes are backed in a nationwide vote in April, Putin would have the option to run again for president in 2024. 
Were he to do that, and his health and electoral fortunes allowed, he could potentially stay in office for another two back-to-back six-year terms until 2036 at which point he would be 83 and have spent 36 years at the top of Russian politics.
Such a scenario would see him wield power longer than Soviet leader Josef Stalin, but still leave him well short of Tsar Peter the Great, who reigned for 43 years.
PRESIDENT FOR LIFE?
Kremlin critic and opposition politician Alexei Navalny has said he believed Putin was trying to become president for life.
Putin has not spelled out his plans after 2024, but has said he does not favor the Soviet-era practice of leaders remaining in place until they die. 
Opposition politician and former lawmaker Dmitry Gudkov said on Wednesday he thought the changes had dealt a mortal blow to the country's constitution. 
""Russia has lost its constitution, which didn't work anyway,"" Gudkov wrote on social media. ""The fig leaf has fallen off the regime and we can see who turned out to be beneath it.""
Putin in January unveiled a major shake-up of Russian politics and a constitutional overhaul, which the Kremlin billed as a redistribution of power from the presidency to parliament.
But Putin's critics say the reform was merely a smoke screen to give the country's ruling elite a way to keep Putin in power after 2024.
Opposition activists have said they plan to organize protests as early as Friday. Their plans are complicated however by an order from Moscow's government which has banned public gatherings of more than 5,000 people until April 10 due to coronavirus-related risks.
Putin remains popular with many Russians, who see him as a welcome source of stability, even as others complain that he has been in power for too long. 
Two people staged lone pickets outside the State Duma on Wednesday. One of them Gleb Tumanov, 31, said he was a member of the Yabloko party, and held a banner calling the move ""an usurpation of power.""
""I’m here because of Vladimir Putin’s desire to stay for a fifth term or even maybe a sixth,"" said Tumanov. 

“It just feels sad. And reminiscent of the Soviet Union. I didn’t spend very much time living in the Soviet Union obviously but neither do I have any desire to do so.""

1175,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 09:33AM ET</span>","Life under lockdown: Wuhan's windows, balconies and rooftops","(Reuters) - The central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus is believed to have originated, remains under lockdown after more than 50 days, even as the world's attention has shifted to other hotspots.
Reuters pictures show - through windows and on balconies and rooftops - how Wuhan residents holed up in their apartments are getting on with their lives. People can be seen hanging laundry. Children play. One man eats noodles. Another smokes a cigarette.
Chinese officials and some public health experts have credited the draconian confinement measures on a city of 11 million, and much of Hubei province, of which it is the capital, with slowing the spread of the disease and turning the tide of infection across China.
Other countries, including Iran, Italy and the United States, are struggling to manage their outbreaks.
But even as the number of new reported cases falls in Wuhan, people in the city remain suspended in an isolated new normal.
Residents are forbidden from venturing out of their homes even to buy food, which must be delivered. Schools and most shops remain shut, and roads are virtually empty.
On Tuesday, Wuhan closed the last of 14 makeshift hospitals set up to treat and isolate patients after the outbreak had overwhelmed the city's healthcare system.
In a dramatic sign that the situation is improving, President Xi Jinping made a high-profile visit to the stricken city on Tuesday, his first since the outbreak began.
Nearly 50,000 coronavirus cases have been reported in Wuhan, with 2,423 deaths, making it the location hardest-hit by far in an epidemic that has infected more than 119,000 people globally and killed nearly 4,300.
The outbreak has also exacted an unquantifiable psychological toll on people in Wuhan as families cope with loss, children are unable to go to school or play outside, and livelihoods are imperiled as people can't go to work.

About two-thirds of those struck were in Syria's northwest where fighting has intensified in recent months as Damascus, backed by Russia, has sought to capture the last slice of the country beyond its control.
A ceasefire between Russia and Turkey, which back opposing sides in the conflict, was agreed last week and only minor violations have occurred.
The data documented 494 attacks on health facilities between 2016-2019, the report showed in what the WHO says is the first comprehensive time it has released of data on medical strikes.
Since the start of this year, it has confirmed nine further attacks, all in northwest Syria, that resulted in 10 deaths, without saying who was responsible.
The total death toll of medical workers and patients was 480 from January 2016 to present, it said.
""What is troubling, is that we've come to a point where attacks on health – something the international community shouldn't tolerate - are now taken for granted; something we have become accustomed to,"" said Richard Brennan, WHO's Regional Emergency Director in the Eastern Mediterranean.
He added that only half of facilities in northwest Syria, where about 1 million people displaced by recent violence are based, remain operational.
The WHO, a Geneva-based U.N. agency, is mandated to keep track of attacks on health facilities and began doing so in 2016. The system has since then been formalized under its Surveillance System for Attacks.
Such data could help the U.N. Board of Inquiry which last year began investigating a series of incidents in northwest Syria, including attacks on health facilities.
U.N. officials have previously denounced ""deliberate"" attacks by the Syrian government and its allies on protected civilian sites, including hospitals and schools. If proven, these would amount to war crimes.

Tens of thousands of migrants have been trying to get into Greece, a European Union member state, since Turkey said on Feb. 28 it would no longer keep them on its territory as part of a 2016 deal with Brussels in return for EU aid for the refugees.
Greece has used tear gas and water cannon to deter the migrants and says it has stopped more than 42,000 people from entering its territory over the past two weeks.
In its article, The New York Times quoted migrants who said they had been captured by Greek security forces, stripped and beaten and held in a complex of buildings near the border.
Using satellite imagery and mobile phone data, the newspaper said the site was near the village of Poros, in the northeast, not far from the Greek-Turkish border in the Evros river delta.
""There is no secret detention center in Greece,"" government spokesman Stelios Petsas told reporters, adding that if an international newspaper knew about the site, it wasn't secret.
""All issues related to guarding the borders or issues of security are transparent. The constitution is being applied... and there is nothing secret.""
On March 3, Greece passed a decree suspending asylum applications for a month and allowing for the immediate deportation of any migrants seized crossing the border.
Erdogan's decision to open the border appears designed to put pressure on the EU to provide more aid for some 3.6 million refugees and migrants Turkey is hosting. Ankara says it has received only about half of some 6 billion euros promised by the EU under the 2016 deal for the refugees.
The New York Times article, citing video evidence and witness testimony, also alleged that Mohammed Yaarub, a 22-year-old Syrian from Aleppo who was shot dead near the border last week, had been killed by a Greek security officer.
Petsas, the government spokesman, reiterated Greece's previous denials that its forces have killed any migrants.
""We have categorically denied there was such an issue, at least on the part of Greece ... This is organized Turkish propaganda and the spreading of fake news,"" he said."

Zyad Elelaimy, a prominent rights lawyer and former member of parliament already in detention since June last year over separate charges, was also fined 20,000 Egyptian pounds ($1,272) by a Cairo misdemeanor court on Tuesday, they added.
The court found Elelaimy guilty three years after a lawyer reported him to prosecutors citing an interview he had given to the BBC, his lawyer Ahmed Fawzi told Reuters.
Fawzi said the defense team had been unable to clarify in court which comments Elelaimy was being prosecuted for. The defense team has appealed against the sentence, and a hearing is due to be held on April 7, Fawzi added.
Amnesty International condemned the ruling as based on ""unfounded charges"" and called on Egyptian authorities to immediately release him.
""He is a prisoner of conscience, who has been swept up in Egypt's ruthless purge of critics and opponents,"" it added in a statement.
Elelaimy was one of the leading Egyptian activists during the 2011 popular revolts across the region that toppled long-serving autocrat Hosni Mubarak and several other Arab leaders. Mubarak died last month.
President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi - like Mubarak a former senior military officer - has overseen a crackdown on dissent that has targeted liberal opponents as well as the Islamists who briefly held power after the Arab Spring.
Tens of thousands of people have been detained, though Sisi has denied holding political prisoners. He and his backers say the measures are necessary to stabilize Egypt.
Elelaimy was detained with several others last June on charges including spreading false news and coordinating with a terrorist group - charges commonly used against protesters and political opposition figures.
Colleagues and activists said the arrests were aimed at preventing the formation of a secular coalition ahead of parliamentary elections due later this year."

Most of Francis' general audiences are held in St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) and attract tens of thousands of people.
But the square was empty on Wednesday as the Vatican, which is surrounded by Rome, adhered to a national lockdown aimed at stopping the virus by outlawing gatherings in public. 
Francis and ten priests, some of whom translate his words into other languages - all sitting in a horseshoe pattern of chairs with space between them - gathered in the official papal library for an audience that was streamed on the internet and broadcast live on television.
Francis, who has suspended all similar public appearances, said he felt close to ""all the sick people who have contracted the virus and are suffering from sickness and the many who are suffering from uncertainty"".
The 83-year-old pontiff thanked medical staff and volunteers laboring ""in this very difficult moment"". Italy is the worst-affected country in the world after China, with some 631 deaths and 10,149 confirmed cases.
But, speaking without prepared remarks, he said that ""this pain, this epidemic,"" should not make the world forget about Syrian refugees on the Greek-Turkish border.
""They are a people who have been suffering for years. They have to escape from war, hunger and illness. Let's not forget our brothers and sisters, so many children who are suffering there,"" he said.

""This is criminal case where the EC is the complainant. The legal process will be handled by the police,"" Sawang Boonmee, deputy secretary-general of Election Commission, told Reuters.
The complaint comes less than month after the Constitutional Court dissolved the Future Forward Party and banned 16 of its top officials, including its leader, from politics for 10 years over what the court ruled was an illegal loan from its founder.
The legal moves, which sparked protests by students and were condemned by pro-democracy activists, strengthened the position in parliament of a coalition led by Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former junta leader who first took power in a 2014 coup.
Thanathorn, a charismatic billionaire who founded the party, already faces two criminal charges, one for computer crimes over a speech he posted on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) criticizing the junta and another for sedition for allegedly aiding anti-junta protesters in 2015.
The Election Commission said in a statement it would file criminal charges against the former party leader for breaching an electoral law that says he applied to be a candidate for member of parliament knowing he was not qualified, which carries a jail term of one to 10 years, a fine of up to 200,000 baht ($6,370) and a 20-year ban from politics.
The complaint follows the Constitutional Court's decision last year to disqualify him as member of parliament for holding shares in a media company on the date his election candidacy was registered.
Thanathorn has previously denied breaching electoral law, saying he sold his shares in the media company prior to registering as a candidate.
Future Forward came in third in last year's election and emerged as a major adversary to the government. Prayuth's pro-army party came first in the March 2019 election, but opposition parties say electoral laws written by the junta were designed to give the military establishment control over politics.
The remaining 55 members of parliament of the disbanded party will be officially joining an existing party called Move Forward Party.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. blood banks are concerned about potential shortages as Americans concerned about catching the new coronavirus avoid donation sites and companies with employees working from home cancel blood drives.
There have already been shortages over the past week in Washington that required other blood banks to move blood in from outside the region, according to Brian Gannon, who runs the Gulf Coast Regional Blood Center and chairs a disaster task force for AABB, formerly known as the American Association of Blood Banks. Supplies in New York were also low because of blood drive cancellations, he said.
""I'm concerned. This is different than most of the types of pandemics we've had in the past or the other types of disasters that I've been involved with because it has to do with people social distancing themselves,"" Gannon said. ""Blood has a short shelf life, so it's not like we can stockpile it.""
Most blood centers try to keep an inventory of a three-day supply, according to the AABB.
The disease has so far sickened more than 800 in the United States and killed 28, mostly in Washington state.
Blood supply in Seattle started to dwindle at the beginning of the month, according to Bloodworks Northwest, which collects and distributes blood around the Northwest U.S.
""Last week was really bad and we were at critical and emergency levels,"" said Vicki Finson, executive vice president of blood services at Bloodworks Northwest. 
Finson said 60% of Bloodworks Northwest's blood is from mobile blood drives, and the push to have people work from home has resulted in many being canceled.
""If this gets worse, people will quit responding and then we will be in a very difficult situation,"" Finson said.
The AABB task force led by Gannon sent 600 units of blood to Seattle over the weekend, he said. 
He is encouraging individuals and sponsors of blood drives to schedule appointments and keep their commitments, and that blood banks around country can continue to shift supply to where it is needed. 
China saw sharp shortages in blood donations as quarantine measures to prevent the spread of the virus took its toll on inventories around the country. 
Coronavirus is not transmissible via transfusion, according to the American Red Cross.
""There is absolutely no evidence that the coronavirus or any respiratory viruses are transmitted via blood transfusion,"" said Dr. Pampee Young, chief medical officer of the American Red Cross.
Still, the Red Cross and AABB said their donation centers are asking that sick people wait until they are healthy to donate in order to protect staff and other donors. People who have recently traveled to China, Iran or Italy are also being asked to wait to donate.
Young said that cancer patients who need platelets, people in trauma who need emergent transfusions and newborns with critical need for blood are all particularly vulnerable if supplies dip. 
In Seattle, Finson said donations picked up over the weekend, but on Tuesday, Bloodworks Northwest was around 140 short of its 1,000 donor-per-day target. 

""We need people every day,"" she said. ""This will continue and if this virus is weeks, if not months, we'll have to be diligent every single day, because the patient usage has not decreased at all.""

PRISTINA (Reuters) - Concern is growing in Kosovo that the United States may pull its troops out of the Balkan country in retaliation for tariffs imposed by Pristina on goods from its rival Serbia.
Some politicians have called for the tariffs to be lifted rather than jeopardize the relationship with Washington, where senators have threatened to push for a withdrawal.
Kosovo introduced the tariffs in November 2018 after Serbia blocked the breakaway former province's membership in international organizations, including Interpol and UNESCO.
In response, Belgrade quit a dialogue with Pristina, saying it would continue only once the tariffs were removed.
The European Union and the United States, both of which still have peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, kept pressure on Kosovo's new government to remove taxes to continue the dialogue that would enable Kosovo to become a United Nations member.
U.S. President Donald Trump's administration has taken a key role in the past months in trying to negotiate a deal between the two countries.
But U.S. envoy Richard Grenell has warned the Kosovo government that it will face consequences if it does not remove the tariffs.
Senator David Perdue said Kosovo should abolish all duties imposed on Serbia or ""the US should reconsider its presence there"". About 700 U.S. troops are stationed in Kosovo.
""Time to bring our troops home after so many years over there,"" tweeted Rand Paul, another US senator.
U.S. troops arrived in Kosovo in June 1999 after the separatist war ended and in the past two decades, together with other NATO member states, have maintained a fragile peace under control.
Under U.S. command, NATO bombed Serbian forces in 1999 to halt killings and expulsions of Kosovo Albanians. Backed by the United States and most EU countries, Kosovo declared independence in 2008. It is not recognized by Serbia, Russia or China.
Washington remains Kosovo's biggest supporter both politically and financially.
Prime Minister Albin Kurti said Kosovo would remove the tariffs partially and with some conditions but Washington said this was not enough.
Kurti's coalition partner, the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), said it would quit the government rather than break relations with Washington.
Kosovo President Hashim Thaci, who believes a final deal with Belgrade is only possible with Washington's mediation, has urged the government to lift the tariffs.
""You have greatly undermined our special relationship with the US and without it we would have neither freedom, nor the state, nor the future. This approach is also questioning the future of our state"" Thaci wrote on social media."

1190,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 07:16AM ET</span>","As pressure for coronavirus vaccine mounts, scientists debate risks of accelerated testing","By Julie Steenhuysen
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Drugmakers are working as quickly as possible to develop a vaccine to combat the rapidly spreading coronavirus that has infected more than 100,000 people worldwide.
Behind the scenes, scientists and medical experts are concerned that rushing a vaccine could end up worsening the infection in some patients rather than preventing it.
Studies have suggested that coronavirus vaccines carry the risk of what is known as vaccine enhancement, where instead of protecting against infection, the vaccine can actually make the disease worse when a vaccinated person is infected with the virus. The mechanism that causes that risk is not fully understood and is one of the stumbling blocks that has prevented the successful development of a coronavirus vaccine.
Normally, researchers would take months to test for the possibility of vaccine enhancement in animals. Given the urgency to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, some drugmakers are moving straight into small-scale human tests, without waiting for the completion of such animal tests.
""I understand the importance of accelerating timelines for vaccines in general, but from everything I know, this is not the vaccine to be doing it with,"" Dr Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, told Reuters.
Hotez worked on development of a vaccine for SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), the coronavirus behind a major 2003 outbreak, and found that some vaccinated animals developed more severe disease compared with unvaccinated animals when they were exposed to the virus.
""There is a risk of immune enhancement,"" said Hotez. ""The way you reduce that risk is first you show it does not occur in laboratory animals.""
Hotez testified last week before the U.S. House Committee on Science, Space and Technology about the need for sustained funding for vaccine research. There remains no vaccine for any of the new coronaviruses that have caused outbreaks in the past 20 years.
At least for now, the world's experts have concluded that accelerated testing is a risk worth taking.
At a specially convened World Health Organization (WHO) meeting in mid-February, designed to co-ordinate a global response to the new coronavirus, scientists representing government-funded research organizations and drugmakers around the world agreed that the threat was so great that vaccine developers should move quickly into human trials, before animal testing is completed, four people who attended the meeting told Reuters.
""You want to have a vaccine as quickly as possible,"" Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, former assistant director-general at the WHO, who co-chaired the meeting, told Reuters. ""You have to balance this with the risk that you impose on a very small number of people, and do all you can do to mitigate this risk as much as possible.""
The conclusion of that meeting, which was not open to media, has not been officially publicized by the WHO. It does not reflect any official position adopted by the WHO, a United Nations body whose job it is to help shape global health policy.
Regulatory oversight of drugmakers and medical research is in the hands of national regulators. The most powerful of those, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has signaled that it is in agreement with the consensus and will not stand in the way of accelerated testing schedules.
""When responding to an urgent public health situation such as novel coronavirus, we intend to exercise regulatory flexibility and consider all data relevant to a certain vaccine platform,"" FDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said in a statement. The agency had no comment specifically on animal testing for vaccine enhancement.
Coronavirus vaccine developers are still required to conduct routine animal testing to make sure the vaccine itself is not toxic and is likely to help the immune system respond to the virus.
SEATTLE RISK
Some 20 coronavirus vaccine candidates are being developed by research institutes and drugmakers including America's Johnson & Johnson and France's Sanofi (PA:SASY) SA. The U.S. government has earmarked more than $3 billion for coronavirus treatments and vaccines.
Biotechnology company Moderna Inc, which is working with the U.S.-funded National Institutes of Health (NIH), is the closest to human testing, announcing plans to start a trial with 45 people in Seattle this month.
Testing for the specific risk of vaccine enhancement in animals will proceed simultaneously with human trials, the NIH told Reuters, which it said should establish whether it is safe to expose larger numbers of people to the vaccine. Moderna did not respond to requests for comment.
The plan is consistent with the WHO consensus and FDA requirements, said Dr Emily Erbelding, director of the Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the NIH. The trial is expected to take 14 months, a spokeswoman for the NIH said.
Dr Gregory Poland, a virologist and vaccine researcher with the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, expressed doubts about that approach. ""This is important, but it has to be done in a way that reassures scientists and the public that these (vaccines) are not only efficacious, but safe,"" he told Reuters.
Hotez said he was surprised human trials were going ahead. ""If there is immune enhancement in laboratory animals vaccinated with the Moderna vaccine, that's a showstopper,"" he said.
U.S. immunotherapy company Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing a coronavirus vaccine in collaboration with a Chinese company, also expects to start human clinical trials in 30 U.S. volunteers in April rather than wait for animal studies on vaccine enhancement.
""The community as a whole weighed that and said we don't want to delay the clinical process. We've been encouraged to go as rapidly as possible into Phase 1 studies,"" Inovio Chief Executive Joseph Kim told Reuters.
The company plans to start human safety trials shortly thereafter in China and South Korea - two countries that have been hit hard by the virus. Kim said he expects to have an answer to the question of vaccine enhancement at some point this year.
The Moderna/NIH trial is enrolling patients at the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The choice of location, made several weeks ago, could prove to be problematic.
To reduce the risk to volunteers, scientists at the WHO meeting recommended that drugmakers restrict early clinical trials to small groups of healthy people and conduct them in places where the virus is not spreading, according to Kieny, who now works at French research institute Inserm. That lowers the chances that people who get the vaccine could encounter the virus and trigger a more severe reaction.
Since the location was chosen, the Seattle metro area has emerged as the epicenter of infections in the United States. Washington state has reported 162 coronavirus infections and 22 deaths, out of a total of 755 infections and 26 deaths in the country as of Tuesday, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.
Nevertheless, Moderna and the NIH plan to go ahead.
""We think there is no reason to have to change the site. If you change it, there might be community transmission in another site over the next couple of weeks,"" Erbelding said. ""Any risk of that to participants is very small. It would be manageable as the trial progresses. People are being observed very, very carefully.""
EARLY WARNING SIGNS
Tragic lessons from other vaccines and prior work on coronaviruses have raised some warning flags for developers.
The best-known example occurred in a U.S. trial in the 1960s of a vaccine created by the NIH and licensed to  Pfizer  Inc (NYSE:PFE) to fight respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which causes pneumonia in infants. The vast majority of babies who received the vaccine developed more severe disease, and two toddlers died. A more recent example occurred in the Philippines, where some 800,000 children were vaccinated with Sanofi’s dengue vaccine, Dengvaxia. Only afterward did the company learn that it could increase the risk of more severe disease in a small percentage of individuals.
Research, including that conducted by Hotez, has shown that coronaviruses in particular have the potential to produce this kind of response. But testing for the risk of vaccine enhancement is time-consuming because it requires scientists to breed mice that are genetically altered to respond to the virus like humans. Work on these and other animal models is just getting under way in several laboratories around the world.
Moderna, Inovio and several other vaccine developers are not waiting for that process to be completed and are planning to launch human trials in record time for a virus that was only discovered in December.
Both Moderna and Inovio say their vaccines are likely to have a lower risk of vaccine enhancement because they are made using newer technology that focuses on specific genes on the outer 'spike' portion of the virus. Coronavirus vaccines that caused vaccine enhancement were typically made using an inactivated version of the entire virus. Neither company has produced a licensed vaccine to date.
J&J said it is developing animal models to test for vaccine enhancement and hopes to have a vaccine candidate ready for human trials in October. A Sanofi spokeswoman said the company will examine this risk before testing the vaccine in clinical trials.
""People know how traumatic the RSV experience was,"" said Dr Johan Van Hoof, global head of Janssen Vaccines, J&J's vaccine unit. ""When you see signals in animals like this, we should not ignore them."""

Bank of England leads coronavirus charge
Once not too long ago, the burning question in the UK was about how Brexit would impact the economy. Whereas that concern wasn't quite enough to tip the Bank of England into an interest rate cut, the coronavirus outbreak clearly is: witness its surprise half-percentage point cut on Wednesday.
In what looked very much like a move choreographed with Boris Johnson's government, the bank announced the cut and further support for bank lending just hours before the unveiling of an expected budget splurge designed to stave off a recession. Whether it will be enough remains to be seen.
Trump plan still in the works
Meanwhile as U.S. coronavirus cases rose steadily, Donald Trump is under growing pressure to deliver on his promises to safeguard the economy. The White House and Congress are deep in negotiations but there is still no sign of a deal. The challenge, simply put, is how to get money into the pockets of ordinary Americans quickly.
The president has been pushing for a broad payroll tax cut but others inside the White House want a targeted response that benefits industries and areas hardest hit by the virus, advisers say. Trump will also meet with the heads of some of the largest U.S. banks on Wednesday.
The spread
There are over 119,000 cases of coronavirus globally and 4,296 deaths linked to the virus as of early Wednesday, according to a Reuters tally.
There were over 4,800 cases and 270 deaths reported in the past 24 hours, with the vast majority of cases now being reported outside of China. Almost half of all new global cases were reported by Italy, Iran and Spain. Fatalities were up over 26% globally from a day earlier, with Italy and Iran reporting 168 and 54 deaths respectively.
Over 55% of cases have been reportedly cured, including roughly 61,400 of China’s total 80,909 cases.

For weeks, Olympic organizers have relentlessly pushed a consistent message: The Summer Games in Tokyo will not be canceled or postponed. But behind the scenes, sponsors who have pumped billions of dollars into the Games are increasingly nervous about how the coronavirus will impact the tournament.
A delay of one or two years would be the ""most feasible"" option if the Tokyo Olympics cannot be held this summer, a member of the organizing committee's executive board told Reuters - a suggestion that Tokyo has dismissed out of hand, for now.

DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran expressed concern on Wednesday about the health of imprisoned Iranians in the United States amid the coronavirus outbreak, a day after Washington called on Tehran to free detained Americans.
Iran, the fourth worst-affected nation after China, South Korea and Italy, has temporarily freed about 70,000 prisoners to help curb the epidemic.
That prompted calls from the United Nations and the United States for political prisoners, including dozens of dual nationals and foreigners held mainly on spying charges, to be released from overcrowded and disease-ridden jails.
""The United States will hold the Iranian regime directly responsible for any American deaths,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement https://www.state.gov/united-states-calls-for-humanitarian-release-of-all-wrongfully-detained-americans-in-iran on Tuesday.
In response, Iran's Foreign Ministry said Tehran had similar concerns about several dozen Iranians held in U.S. prisons, mostly for violating sanctions.
""The state of America's prisons and their health situation are worrying ... we are ready to bring the jailed Iranians in America back to Iran,"" spokesman Abbas Mousavi told an online news conference.
""American officials should pay serious attention to the health conditions of the Iranians who have been taken hostage in America. They have been imprisoned without any legal basis.""
In his statement, Pompeo noted ""deeply troubling"" reports that the coronavirus had spread to prisons and said any nation offering aid to Tehran should seek a reciprocal humanitarian gesture of releasing prisoners.
""The Iranian regime recently released 70,000 prisoners due to the outbreak of COVID-19, demonstrating its ability to grant clemency and show mercy. Yet it continues to unjustly detain several American citizens, without cause or justification,"" he said.
Washington has long demanded Iran release American citizens including father and son Baquer and Siamak Namazi, Navy veteran Michael White and former FBI agent Robert Levinson.
Frictions have risen between Iran and the United States since 2018, when Washington quit Iran's nuclear deal with the West and reimposed economic sanctions.

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - A ship captain involved in the worst accident in more than half a century on the Danube River went on trial in Hungary on Wednesday over the crash in Budapest that killed 25 South Korean tourists and two Hungarian crew last year.
Yuri Chaplinsky's cruise liner, the Viking Sigyn, hit a smaller tourist boat, the Mermaid, under a bridge in the capital during torrential rain on May 29. All 27 victims were from the Mermaid, which sank within seconds of the crash.
Hungarian prosecutors on Wednesday charged Chaplinsky, a Ukrainian from Odessa, with one count of gross negligence leading to an accident with mass casualties. They also charged him with failing to provide assistance to those aboard the Mermaid, saying he did not immediately order his crew to assist them as the boat sank.
Chaplinsky, 64, had a window of several minutes to slow or steer his ship to avoid the collision, prosecutor Miklos Novaki said. Despite the downpour, there was visibility of over a kilometer, he added.
""For at least five minutes ... the defendant failed to focus on steering the ship, including locating other possible vessels under the bridge,"" Novaki told the court. ""He did not sense the Mermaid's presence, did not radio or send out emergency sound signals.""
The prosecutors asked the Budapest court to impose a nine-year prison sentence on the captain and strip him of his boating license for an additional nine years, if he pleaded guilty to the charges and forewent a trial.
Chaplinsky, who has denied wrongdoing, rejected the prosecution's offer on Wednesday and said he wanted a trial. He did not comment further.
""At the moment I am not ready to make a statement,"" he told the court.
River boats, from 100-room luxury liners to smaller, rickety vessels have become common sights in Budapest as tourism has boomed in recent years.
Chaplinsky had worked on the river for more than 40 years, 30 of them as a ship captain. Prosecutors formally charged him in November.
The collision turned the Mermaid crosswise in front of the much larger Viking cruiser, and it sank within about 30 seconds, according to video footage released by police last year.
Seven survivors were rescued from the river, but one woman is still missing.
The cruise liner's owner, Swiss-based Viking Cruises Ltd, has said it is cooperating with Hungarian investigators."

ROME (Reuters) - Shops and restaurants closed, hundreds of flights were canceled and streets emptied across Italy on Tuesday, the first day of an unprecedented, nationwide lockdown imposed to slow Europe's worst outbreak of coronavirus.
Just hours after the dramatic new restrictions came into force, health authorities announced the death toll had jumped by 168 to 631, the largest rise in absolute numbers since the contagion came to light on Feb. 21.
The total number of confirmed cases rose at a much slower rate than recently seen, hitting 10,149 against a previous 9,172, but officials warned that the region at the epicenter, Lombardy, had provided incomplete data.
The government has told all Italians to stay at home and avoid non-essential travel until April 3, radically widening steps already taken in much of the wealthy north, which is the epicenter of the spreading contagion.
""Our civic duty is the only thing that can save us,"" said Marzio Tonilo, 35, a teacher from the northern town of San Fiorano, which was placed under quarantine last month.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte unexpectedly expanded the so-called red zone to the entire country on Monday night, introducing the most severe controls on a Western nation since World War Two.
The move shocked many small businesses, which feared for their future.
""It looks like an apocalypse has struck, there is no one around,"" said Mario Monfreda, who runs Larys restaurant in a smart Rome residential area. Under the government order, all bars and restaurants will now have to close at 6.00 p.m.
""It is a total disaster. This will reduce us to nothing ... More people are going to die as a result of the economic crisis that this lockdown is going to cause than the virus itself.""
However, the prosperous northern region of Lombardy, centered on Italy's financial capital Milan, called on the government to introduce even more stringent measures.
""I would shut down all the shops. I would certainly close down public transport and I would seek out all businesses that could be shut without creating excessive damage to the economy,"" said Lombardy Governor Attilio Fontana.
While Lombardy accounts for 74% of all the fatalities, the disease has now touched all of the country and the government is worried that if it worsens, the health system in the less developed south will collapse, causing deaths to spike.
ECONOMIC HIT
Rome landmarks including the Trevi Fountain, the Pantheon and the Spanish Steps were largely empty on Tuesday, while the Vatican closed St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) and St. Peter's Basilica to tourists. Police told holidaymakers to return to their hotels.
For at least the next three weeks, anyone traveling in Italy will have to carry a document declaring their reasons. Outdoor events, including sports fixtures, have been suspended and schools and universities are all shuttered.
A former Treasury chief economist predicted that the lockdown measures were reducing Italy's economic output by around 10-15%, with the tourism and transport sectors down about 90% on their normal levels.
Looking to mitigate the impact on ordinary Italians, the government is considering making banks offer customers a pause in their mortgage repayments. It also called for the European Union to relax its rules to allow more state spending.
""We will ask for the rules to be changed, it is a necessary condition, otherwise people will die,"" Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli told Radio Capital.
The Milan stock exchange fell a further 3.3% on Tuesday, meaning it has now slumped 29% since Feb. 20. Italy's borrowing costs are also shooting up, reviving fears that an economy already on the brink of recession and struggling under the euro zone's second-heaviest debt pile could be plunged into crisis.
In the wake of the clampdown, neighboring Austria said it would deny entry to people arriving from Italy, Malta and Portugal cut all travel links to the country, while British Airways and Easy Jet canceled their flights to and from Italian airports. Spain also banned flights from Italy. 
The coronavirus first emerged in China last year and the country's foreign ministry said on Tuesday its top diplomat, Wang Yi, had called his Italian counterpart, Luigi Di Maio, to offer his condolences for the situation in Italy. 

He said he would increase efforts to send Italy more masks, and medical equipment, and also offered to send a medical team.

Turkey and Russia, which back opposing sides in Syria's war, agreed on a ceasefire to stop escalating clashes in Idlib that brought the two countries close to direct confrontation and displaced almost a million people.
In a speech to lawmakers from his AK Party in parliament, Erdogan said there had been small violations of the ceasefire and that Turkey's priority was the safety of the 12 observation posts which it has established in the region.
""We will not just retaliate (against) even the smallest attack here (in Idlib), we will give a much harsher response,"" he said. ""Turkish soldiers, the sons of this nation, are never in need of the cruel Assad's protection, so let that be known,"" he added, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.
Turkish Defence Minister Hulusi Akar was quoted separately as saying that talks between Turkish and Russian officials on implementing the ceasefire have so far been ""positive and constructive"". 
In recent weeks, Russia-backed Syrian government forces intensified their campaign to retake Idlib, the last rebel-held stronghold in the country. That prompted Turkey, which backs some rebels looking to oust Assad, to mount a counter-offensive to repel their advances.
A Russian delegation arrived in Ankara on Tuesday for talks on details of the agreement, which the two sides said would be finalised by next week. The deal establishes a security corridor and joint patrols along a key east-west highway in Idlib.
Speaking to reporters in parliament, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu acknowledged minor violations of the truce, but added Moscow had warned Damascus to stop.
""We are currently discussing measures to be taken for the M4 highway to be opened to traffic safely. There were talks last night and these will continue,"" Cavusoglu said. ""At the moment, we are working to make this temporary ceasefire a lasting one. That is where we are at currently.""
Turkey's Defence Ministry later said the second day of talks with the Russian delegation had begun in Ankara.

While the ceasefire meets Turkey's most pressing concern - stopping a fresh influx of migrants from Idlib - it cements recent Syrian government advances and allows Russia to move further north than they have been able to before.

It also closed the border with its eastern neighbor Myanmar, although no cases have so far been confirmed there yet.
""As a precautionary measure (to prevent) transmission of Coronavirus/COVID-19, the international border with Myanmar has been closed... until further orders,"" N. Biren Singh, chief minister of the north-eastern state of Manipur, which shares a border with Myanmar, said in a tweet on Tuesday.
India, which has confirmed 52 cases of the virus, advised citizens to avoid all non-essential travel to countries affected by the virus, and asked those returning from these places to self-quarantine at home.
The country's southern state of Kerala, which reported three new cases over the weekend, said on Tuesday it was shutting schools and movie theaters to avoid a further outbreak. Schools in at least two more states have also been closed.
In Afghanistan, the number of confirmed cases rose to 7 from 4, the country's health ministry said on Wednesday.
Bangladesh's High Court has directed the government to take measures to curb the soaring prices of masks and sanitizers, after it reported its first three cases of the virus on Sunday.
Two of those cases have since tested negative.
Mobile courts launched after the court directive fined at least 30 pharmacies in Dhaka for hoarding face masks and selling them at up to 40 times the retail price, officials said on Wednesday.
Worldwide, at least 4,296 people have died and almost 120,000 people have been recorded as infected by the coronavirus, which originated in China late last year."

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (Reuters) - A man shot three times by an armed attacker who stormed a mosque in New Zealand last year says the incident has left him physically and mentally damaged for life.
Sheikh Hasan Rubel, 35, was offering prayers at the Al Noor mosque in Christchurch on March 15 last year when the gunman burst in and started shooting.
The attack, streamed live of Facebook (NASDAQ:FB), killed 51 Muslim worshippers and injured dozens of others in New Zealand's worst mass shooting.
Two bullets ripped through Rubel's pelvis while another one went through his leg.
As New Zealand prepares to mark the one-year anniversary of the attack, Rubel says he is getting really anxious as the memories flood back.
""As 15th of March is approaching it's a really shaky feeling for me,"" he said in an interview with Reuters.
""That (attack) has damaged me physically a little bit but mostly it damaged my inside. Even nowadays when I remember that moment, how scared I was ... how helpless I was,"" he said.
Rubel, who is an accountant by profession, uses a walking stick now and needs more surgery to repair his pelvis. He is undergoing counseling for mental trauma and also physiotherapy treatment.
""I still remember the feeling when I was getting shot by one after one bullet ... at one point I was thinking that at any time I can get shot anywhere and I’ll be dead,"" Rubel said.
Throughout the attack, Rubel said he was thinking of his wife and young daughters.
Plans are underway for a prayer event in Christchurch on Friday and a national remembrance ceremony on Sunday, expected to be attended by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern.
The events will be held under tight security following recent threats against Al Noor mosque.
The attack took away all his confidence and he lives in fear now, Rubel said.
""I get really afraid for small things. Nowadays I think any incident can happen anytime.""
Brenton Tarrant, a suspected white supremacist, is facing 92 charges related to the attack. He has pleaded not guilty and will face a trial in June.
Rubel, who moved to New Zealand from Bangladesh in 2015, says he has faith in New Zealand's justice systems and hopes the culprit is punished. It would be hard, however, to ever forgive his attacker, he said.
""I’m not going to say that I forgive ... it’s a big word to say,"" he said."
1205,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 03:04AM ET</span>","With sadness but no ceremony, Japan marks disaster anniversary","TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan marked the somber nine-year anniversary of devastating natural disasters and a nuclear accident on Wednesday as official commemorations and vigils were canceled because of fears over the spread of the coronavirus. 
The March 11, 2011, earthquake and tsunami triggered the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl at Tokyo Electric Power Co's (T:9501) Fukushima Daiichi plant, 220 kilometers (130 miles) northeast of Tokyo. 
The natural disasters and meltdowns at the Fukushima plant forced hundreds of thousands of residents to flee their homes.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and other government officials attended a small memorial ceremony and observed a moment of silence on Wednesday, sitting in chairs spaced a few feet apart. 
In his speech, Abe apologized for not holding an official memorial for the anniversary, saying it was a necessary step to contain the spread of the respiratory disease.
Abe also lauded the reconstruction of Japan's disaster-struck region and said he hoped the Tokyo Olympics would be a chance for the country to showcase its recovery efforts. 
""I think there were other ways to handle (the memorial),"" said Natsumi Hoshi, a 42-year old Tokyo resident, who was among a group of around a hundred people gathered in a city park to lay flowers. 
""I think people are still hurting,"" he said. 
Despite the many signs of recovery in Japan's northeast, some residents are still unable to live in the areas closest to the Fukushima plant. Radiation levels in such areas remain high despite repeated decontamination efforts.
""I think the memory (of the disaster) is fading away,"" said Masahiko Sano, a 47-year old company owner, who also joined the event at the park. 
The government called off a memorial event that was scheduled for Wednesday as Japan sought to contain a widening outbreak of the coronavirus. The country has closed schools, theme parks and zoos, as part of its wider effort to scale back public events and mass gatherings to slow the transmission of the virus. 
Japan has nearly 1,300 cases, including about 700 from the Diamond Princess cruise ship that was quarantined near Tokyo last month.
With every new spike in the figures, speculation has grown that the Tokyo 2020 Games, which are due to open on July 24, could be canceled, delayed, or held without spectators like many pre-Olympic qualifiers and other unrelated sports events in recent weeks.

The virus has infected more than 117,000 people and killed over 4,000 globally.

1206,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 11, 2020 02:19AM ET</span>","One year after mosque massacre, New Zealand is fighting rising hate","By Praveen Menon
WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Days before the first anniversary of a shooting in Christchurch that killed 51 Muslim worshippers, a post appeared on an encrypted messaging app showing a balaclava-clad man outside one of the attacked mosques with a threat and a gun emoji.
The message was the latest in a number of threats against minorities in New Zealand, evidence of what experts say is an increase in hate crime and xenophobia since the mosque massacre by a suspected white supremacist on March 15 last year.
The gunman, armed with semi-automatic weapons, attacked Muslims attending Friday prayers in the South Island's largest city, broadcasting New Zealand's worst mass shooting live on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Brenton Tarrant, an Australian national, faces 92 charges in relation to the attacks on Al Noor and Linwood mosques. He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in June.
New Zealand's extraordinary outpouring of love and compassion for the Muslim community after the attack was led from the front by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern. She swiftly introduced new gun laws and started a global movement to stamp out online hate in a response that was hailed as a model for other leaders.
But the attack also inspired far right nationalists and anti-immigration campaigners to be more active both online and offline, according to Muslim leaders, activists and experts.
""The attack certainly emboldened people who want to spread hate,"" said Anjum Rahman from the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand.
The council has repeatedly alerted the government in the past year about the rise of the extreme right and the growing threat felt by Muslim women in New Zealand.
Rahman reported the latest threat against the Al Noor mosque to police after she was shown the image which was being shared on the encrypted social media messaging app Telegram.
Police said a 19-year-old man was charged with failing to assist police with a search warrant in relation to the incident and would appear in court later this month.
Local media reports have linked the man to a white nationalist group called Action Zealandia, which was formed in July 2019, just months after the Christchurch attack. On its website it says it is focused on ""building a community for European New Zealanders"".
In response to the incident, Action Zealandia said in a statement on Twitter the alleged actions of the accused are not within its code of conduct and was ""immature and unproductive as we do not use violence to reach our goals"".
Police said they were working to ensure they have an in-depth knowledge of individuals and groups whose actions pose a threat but did not comment on any specific group.
MORE EXTREMISTS
In a parliamentary committee meeting chaired by Ardern last month, New Zealand's spy chief laid down the growing challenge since the attack.
""It (the attack) has given encouragement to some people, it has been inspirational to other people, and so it remains still quite a fluid picture,"" NZ Security Intelligence Service Director-General Rebecca Kitteridge told the committee, according to transcripts of the meeting seen by Reuters.
""We have got more information about more people who are expressing extremist views than we had before 15 March, and some of those people existed beforehand, and then there is the impact of the attacks themselves afterwards,"" she said.
Between 30 and 50 people are being actively investigated by the agency at any given moment for posing a terror threat, a higher number than in previous years.
Kitteridge said between March 15 and the end of June 2019 the spy agency received leads about people who had expressed racist, Nazi, identitarian, or white supremacist views.
A survey by online safety agency Netsafe in December showed hate speech online increased in New Zealand in the last 12 months, with about 15% of the adult population targeted with online hate.
Offline too, white supremacist posters have appeared in Auckland universities in the past few weeks leading up to the March 15 memorial.
There are about 60 to 70 groups and somewhere between 150 and 300 core right-wing activists in New Zealand, said Paul Spoonley, from Massey University, who has been researching far-right extremism for decades.
Proportionate to population the number was similar in size to far-right activists in Germany, he said.
""New Zealand is now part of an international far-right ecosystem in a way that you can't have said 20 years ago,"" Spoonley said.
""We do well on the league tables for tolerance, but that does not mean there are no extreme elements,"" he said.
HATE SPEECH
Ardern said she was ""devastated"" by the latest threats against Al Noor mosque and it indicated that more the work needed to be done.
""We have to get back to the basics of why is it that people would feel that they can make those kinds of threats against other people's lives,"" she told reporters.
A big part of the problem was that unlike the United States or Britain, New Zealand has never recorded specific hate crime offences, raising questions about what signs security agencies may have missed.
Police have now started recording instances of offences that appear to be motivated by hate, Justice Minister Andrew Little told Reuters.
The ministry is also reviewing the country's hate speech laws, although these plans have been challenged by groups who say free speech would be curtailed by such laws.
""Further work is needed on where the line on free speech is drawn. But I anticipate a balanced approach will be taken when the review process is complete,"" Little said.
A decision is expected within months."

The brazen skirmishes in the city of Celaya in Guanajuato state sparked rumors on social media that security forces had closed in on Jose ""El Marro"" Yepez, the head of the Santa Rosa de Lima criminal cartel, and possibly arrested him.
The cartel is believed to be behind the massive theft of gasoline from illegal taps on pipelines belonging to national oil company Pemex, a criminal racket that had grown significantly in recent years.
""El Marro"" is also suspected of organizing the theft of fuel directly from a nearby Pemex refinery in the city of Salamanca.
His wife was arrested in late January only to be released a few days later after a judge determined there was insufficient evidence against her. Last week, Yepez's father was detained, accused of driving a stolen car.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador aggressively confronted fuel theft early last year, shortly after taking office, ordering the temporary closure of especially vulnerable pipelines which in turn provoked weeks of fuel shortages. 
Pemex data shows that the illegal taps fell dramatically last year.
Luis Ernesto Ayala, a senior Guanajuato security official, wrote on Twitter that rumors spread on social media suggesting that an unnamed leader of a criminal group in the state had been arrested were false.
""We continue working in an operation,"" he added in the post, without providing more details.
Other state and federal security sources also denied that Yepez had been detained.
The violence in Celaya recalled the gunbattles last October in Culiacan, in northwestern Mexico, where hundreds of Sinaloa Cartel fighters temporarily took over the city of about a million people and forced the government to release a son of jailed drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman who had been briefly detained.

The chaos marked a major security setback for Lopez Obrador, who has pledged to pacify the country after years of drug-war violence.

The USS Theodore Roosevelt and its escorts completed a five-day visit to the central Vietnamese city of Danang on March 9, the embassy said in a statement.
""Visits like these not only strengthen the United States' partnership with Vietnam, but they also continue to ensure peace and stability and freedom of commerce across the region,"" Ambassador Daniel Kritenbrink said, according to the statement.
The port call follows a stop by the USS Carl Vinson in Vietnam in March 2018, in what was the first such visit since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, underscoring growing strategic ties between Hanoi and Washington at a time when China's regional influence is rising.
U.S. carriers frequently cross the disputed South China Sea and are routinely shadowed by Chinese navy vessels, naval officers in the region say.
The United States accuses China of militarizing the South China Sea and trying to intimidate Asian neighbors who also have claims to parts of it and might want to exploit its extensive oil and gas reserves.
Vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of China's extensive territorial claims to the sea and has been buying U.S. military hardware, such as a Hamilton-class coastguard cutter.
Last year, Vietnam and China became embroiled in a months-long standoff over incursions by Chinese survey vessels into Vietnam's exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

Mainland China had 24 new confirmed cases on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said on Wednesday, up from 19 new cases a day earlier. 
Of the new infections, 10 were imported cases, bringing the overall cases from abroad to 79. 
The Chinese capital of Beijing on Tuesday saw six new cases involving individuals who traveled from Italy and the United States, while Shanghai had two imported infections, Shandong province one and Gansu province one.
Taiwan too has begun reporting an uptick in imported cases. The government said on Wednesday the island's 48th case was a woman in her 30s who had returned from holiday in Britain and had most likely been infected there. 
As China's efforts to control the spread of the pathogen at home start to payoff, Beijing is turning its focus on overseas cases as the coronavirus expands its footprint across the globe.
New infections in central Hubei province, the epicenter of the outbreak, continued to stabilize, with new cases declining for the sixth day. 
In Wuhan, the provincial capital, just 13 new infections were reported on Tuesday, or all of the new cases in Hubei.
President Xi Jinping on Tuesday made his first visit to Wuhan since the coronavirus outbreak forced a lockdown of the city of 11 million people. 
A few cities in Hubei have started to loosen restrictions on movement of people and goods.
Hunan province and the municipality of Chongqing lowered their emergency response level as domestic infections eased across the country.
So far, 24 municipalities, regions and provinces have cut their emergency response level from the highest tier previously.
The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far stood at 80,778 as of Tuesday.
The death toll in mainland China had reached 3,158 as of the end of Tuesday, up by 22 from the previous day. 

The central province of Hubei accounted for all of the new deaths, including 19 fatalities in the provincial capital of Wuhan.

Veteran politician Mahathir, 94, led the country from 1981 to 2003, and made a surprise return to power in 2018 defeating an alliance than had governed for more than 60 years and one he himself had led as premier.
But his latest stint as prime minister ended with his shock resignation on Feb. 24, a day after some of his coalition partners were seen in talks with his opponents.
Mahathir said in an interview with the Malay-language Sinar Harian newspaper that he no longer commanded a majority in parliament after some supporters abandoned him to join Muhyiddin's camp.
""We had more than 114 seats but now that has become less,"" he said.
""It will not succeed,"" he said of the vote of no-confidence.
""This is because he has taken my people to his side.""
Mahathir would have required the support of at least 112 lawmakers in the lower house of parliament to win the vote.
His Pakatan Harapan coalition, which includes his old rival Anwar Ibrahim, had vowed to bring a confidence vote in parliament when it reconvened on March 9.
But Muhyiddin has since delayed the opening of parliament by two months.
The political changes in Malaysia in recent days have seen the old establishment forces re-assert themselves.
Muhyiddin, a former interior minister in Mahathir's cabinet, joined hands with the old ruling UMNO party - which lost a general election for the first time ever in 2018 - and the Islamist party PAS to form a new coalition.
King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah appointed Muhyiddin as the prime minister on Feb. 29, saying he believed Muhyiddin possibly had the support of a majority in parliament.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea reported a jump in new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as authorities tested hundreds of staff at a call center where the disease appeared this week, reversing 11 days of slowing infections, health officials said.
Another 242 new cases were reported compared with only 35 a day earlier, bringing the total in Asia's worst outbreak outside mainland China to 7,755, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. The death toll rose by one to 60.
The daily tally of new cases in South Korea peaked at 909 on Feb. 29, as authorities tested about 200,000 followers of a fringe Christian church at the center of the nation's epidemic.
With that task almost done, the infection rate had slowed in recent days, raising hopes that South Korea might be bringing the virus under control.
But new clusters at the call center in Seoul, and among teachers and students of a dance school with classes around the country, have kept authorities on high alert for a fresh spike in infections.
Fifty two of the latest infections were in Seoul but authorities did not say how many of those were linked directly to the call center operated by an insurance company.
Authorities say they are testing the 200 staff who worked on the floor where the first cases were discovered, while monitoring others in the center's workforce of up to 800 people.
More than 140 new infections were in the worst-hit city of Daegu, where the church is based, and the nearby province of North Gyeongsang.
""There has been a stagnating trend in Daegu cases despite a slight increase today,"" said Yoon Tae-ho, director general for public health policy."

CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia's highest court began hearing the final bid on Wednesday by former Vatican treasurer George Pell to overturn his conviction for sexually assaulting two teenaged choirboys in the 1990s when he was archbishop of Melbourne. 
Cardinal Pell, 78, began serving a six-year prison sentence a year ago, becoming the highest ranking Catholic clergyman worldwide to be jailed for child sex offences.
He was not expected to appear either in person or via videolink, in line with the justice system's protocols, throughout the two-day hearing in front of the High Court of Australia's seven justices.
Pell was convicted by a jury in December 2018 on one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and four charges of an indecent act with a child under 16. He was sentenced in March 2019.
His appeal to the High Court in the country's capital follows a ruling by the lower Court of Appeal in Victoria last August that upheld his conviction by a 2-1 majority.
The High Court could throw out the case, acquit Pell, reject his appeal or send the case back to Victoria's Court of Appeal.
If the court decides against throwing out the appeal and hears the full case, a judgment would likely be handed down in several months.
The hearing began on Wednesday morning with arguments from Pell's legal team, based on two main points: that the Court of Appeal majority erred by shifting the onus of proof to the defense, and that they incorrectly concluded it was open to the trial jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Pell was guilty.
Pell's lawyer Bret Walker told the court that a key factor that made Pell's alleged offences implausible was that they took place after Sunday mass in a busy area of St Patrick's Cathedral in Melbourne, not in secretive or private settings, ""unlike so many appalling historical sexual misconduct cases"".

KABUL/UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani is preparing to release 1,500 Taliban prisoners in coming days, according to a decree viewed by Reuters on Tuesday, as the United Nations backed a U.S.-led push to end Afghanistan's 18-year war.
The two-page decree signed by Ghani, which requires all released Taliban prisoners to provide ""a written guarantee to not return to the battlefield"", is aimed at paving the way for direct talks with the hardline insurgent group.
The United States warned the Taliban that the current high level of violence was ""not conducive to advancing the peace process"" after the 15-member U.N. Security Council unanimously adopted a U.S.-drafted resolution.
The United States signed an agreement with the Taliban last month for a phased withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces if the Taliban keeps its commitments. It also prescribed the start of talks between the insurgents and an Afghan government delegation on a political settlement to end decades of conflict.
The prisoner release decree, which is expected to be made public later by Ghani's office, said the process will begin in four days.
""The process of releasing 1,500 Taliban prisoners will be completed within 15 days, with 100 prisoners walking out of Afghan jails every day,"" it said. 
The decree said talks between the government and the Taliban will run parallel with the prisoner release, and requires the insurgents to stick to commitments to a reduction in violence.
Taliban commanders have sent vehicles to be ready to collect the prisoners and said they will honor the deal by handing over 1,000 government troops.
Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Cherith Norman Chalet said the Taliban had taken steps to stop attacks in cities and against major bases.
""But more needs to be done and we urge them to also reduce violence against Afghan forces in the countryside to give intra-Afghan negotiations and peace the opportunity to succeed,"" she said.
The peace process has been complicated by differing wording of documents drafted in separate meetings between the United States and the Taliban, and the United States and the Afghan government.
Earlier on Tuesday, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton appeared to take a swipe at the U.S. deal with the Taliban, saying: ""It is difficult to have an agreement when you leave out the government of the country that you are expecting to uphold and live under that agreement.""
Speaking at a U.N. event on Afghan women's rights, Clinton also stressed the need for women to be at the negotiating table. 
""Afghan women today are rightly afraid... that the gains they have made with all of our help will be washed away in a rush to achieve a peace that will not hold anyway,"" she said. ""This is not just morally wrong, this is dangerous.""
The Security Council resolution emphasized the importance of including women, youth and minorities and ensuring any political settlement protects their rights. 
POLITICAL TENSIONS
An escalating political feud is compounding the challenges, with U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus confirming an electoral crisis has delayed Ghani's naming of a national negotiating team.
Ghani was sworn in for a second term on Monday, but the ceremony was marred by a rocket attack, while his political rival, former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, held his own inauguration ceremony.
Both Ghani and Abdullah say they are Afghanistan's rightful leader following a disputed election in September. 
""We are strongly against the establishment of any parallel administrations or government structures and we call on all concerned to come together and resolve differences constructively,"" British U.N. Ambassador Karen Pierce said in remarks directed at Adbullah. 
Ghani has told U.S. negotiators that he plans to announce ""an inclusive team in the coming few days,"" Ortagus said.
If the talks make progress, the government said it will release a further 500 Taliban prisoners every two weeks until a total of 5,000 Taliban prisoners have been freed.
It was unclear whether prisoners would be released from other prisons aside from Bagram, a detention facility located next to a U.S. military base.
Zalmay Khalilzad, U.S. Special Envoy who was the key negotiator urged the two sides to sit down immediately to work out the details, saying the prisoner release deal ""will be a significant step in the peace process.""

1214,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 08:53PM ET</span>",Washington considers actions to bolster U.S. economy as coronavirus cases mount,"By Steve Holland and Richard Cowan
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As U.S. coronavirus cases rose steadily, the White House and Congress negotiated measures on Tuesday to bolster the U.S. economy and Americans' paychecks against the outbreak's impact, although there was no immediate sign of a deal.
The rise in the number of U.S. cases of COVID-19, a highly contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness, has concerned health officials and spurred calls within Congress for action to expand testing and avert an economic meltdown.
Almost three-quarters of U.S. states have confirmed COVID-19, with almost 1,000 cases in the United States and 29 deaths. Washington state's governor warned of tens of thousands more cases without ""real action,"" and New York's governor deployed National Guard troops as a containment measure in a hard-hit New York City suburb.
""We had a good reception on Capitol Hill. We're going to be working with Republican and Democratic leadership to move a legislative package,"" Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House's coronavirus task force, told a White House briefing.
U.S. stocks rebounded in their largest daily gain since late 2018 on hopes that a government stimulus package was in the making.
A central feature of the administration's legislative proposal is payroll tax relief, although the extent and duration of the proposal were unclear.
White House officials have also said the administration could undertake executive action to help small businesses and workers, including those who do not receive paid sick leave. 
U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who is leading negotiations on behalf of Republican President Donald Trump, met with Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to discuss a possible deal.
""We're going to work together on a bipartisan basis to figure out how we can get things done quickly that are going to help the Americans that are most impacted by this and small and medium-sized businesses that are impacted,"" he said.
Pelosi said the meeting was aimed at seeing ""where our common ground was"" on a set of legislative proposals.
In remarks to reporters, she warned that any package should not contain ""trickle-down solutions that only help a few.""
Democrats are challenging the Trump administration to tightly target new measures at people directly affected by the coronavirus. Any measure would need to pass the Democratic-controlled House as well as the Republican-controlled Senate before reaching Trump's desk.
""I hope we don't play politics with this. Mixing politics with a pandemic is not good. It's terribly counterproductive,” said Republican Senator Pat Roberts. 
'MIXED REVIEWS'
All three major U.S. benchmark stock indexes rose nearly 5%, one day after suffering their largest losses since the 2008 financial crisis. 
But prospects for a second day of gains on Wednesday dimmed as U.S. equity index futures slid 1% after the overnight trading session got under way.
Trump met with Republican lawmakers and again downplayed the risks from the coronavirus. ""It will go away. Just stay calm. It will go away,"" he said.
A senior Senate Republican aide said Trump’s payroll tax proposal got “mixed reviews” among Republican senators who attended. 
Some Senate Republicans said a potential deal could include $300 billion in payroll tax relief that could help people make rent and mortgage payments, or pay medical bills if family members' work hours are reduced during the outbreak.
Democrats accused Trump of being more focused on soothing Wall Street's nerves than on protecting the public from the health and economic fallout of the fast-spreading epidemic. The White House has been accused of inadequate preparation for the outbreak and a slow rollout of coronavirus testing. 
""President Trump and his administration should be putting people before corporations, and they should be focused on taking appropriate steps to keep the American people and their economic security safe,"" Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said.
Democrats are pushing for paid sick leave, expanded and free testing for the coronavirus and other measures.
OUTBREAK EXPANDS
More than 116,000 people have contracted the coronavirus worldwide since it surfaced in China late last year, according to the World Health Organization. More than 4,000 people have died.
Italy, which has the highest death toll outside of China, has put its entire population of 60 million on virtual lockdown.
At least 35 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have reported infections of COVID-19. New Jersey on Tuesday reported its first death.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said schools would be closed and public gatherings suspended in a coronavirus ""hot zone"" in New Rochelle, a New York City suburb, and deployed National Guard troops there. 
The United Nations said it would be closing its headquarters in New York to the public until further notice.
As the outbreak spreads, daily life in the United States has been increasingly disrupted, with concerts and conferences canceled and universities telling students to stay home and take classes online. 
Democratic presidential contenders Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders both canceled rallies in Ohio on Tuesday night, citing warnings from public health officials, as six states voted in the party's nominating contests. 

The Democratic National Committee said its presidential debate in Arizona on Sunday would be conducted without a live audience because of health concerns.

""The process of releasing 1,500 Taliban prisoners will be completed within 15 days, with 100 prisoners walking out of Afghan jails every day,"" according to the decree.
Talks between the Taliban and Afghan government to end the war will run parallel with the release, the decree said.
If the talks make progress, the government said it will release a further 500 Taliban prisoners every two weeks until a total of 5,000 Taliban prisoners have been freed.
The decree said that the Taliban will have to stick to its commitment to a reduction in violence during this period and beyond.
The release of the prisoners is part of a confidence-building measure to pave the way for the opening of direct talks between the government and the insurgents, after talks with both sides and the United States individually.
The issue has become one of the biggest sticking points in any progress towards peace, complicated by differing wording of documents between the United States and the Taliban, and the United States and the Afghan government.
""I urge the two sides to sit down immediately for talks on this issue in Doha, Qatar to work out the details,"" Zalmay Khalilzad, U.S. special envoy who was the key negotiator in the talks, said in a tweet. 
""The Afghan government has agreed to do so. When implemented, this will be a significant step in the peace process,"" he said.
Commanders of the hardline Islamist group have sent vehicles to be ready to collect the fighters in a prisoner exchange and said they will honor the deal by handing over 1,000 government troops.
It was unclear whether prisoners would be released from other prisons aside from Bagram, a detention facility next to a U.S. military base.

Deputy Foreign Minister Nelly Jerez told reporters that the migrant flights will be stopped since the country does not have a designated area to quarantine people who may be infected arriving at the airport.
Only about a quarter of the 8,835 Honduran deportees from Mexico this year through March 8 have arrived in planes, while the rest arrive via buses, according to government data.
Bus deportations are not affected by the suspension. It was unclear if Honduras' main bus terminal where the deportees arrive has a designated area to hold possibly infected persons."

ALGIERS (Reuters) - Algeria's government has canceled political gatherings because of the coronavirus, it said on Tuesday, though it was not immediately clear if this would entail a ban on the mass protests that have convulsed the state for more than a year. 
Health Minister Abderrahmane Benbouzid said in comments broadcast on state television that the government was acting to slow the spread of the disease, with 20 confirmed cases in the country. 
""All sports, cultural, political and economic gatherings are canceled. We do not take any risk,"" he said.
There was no immediate comment from leading figures in the political opposition, known as the Hirak, over the move. 
However, one student demonstrator, Riad Mekrez, 25, said: ""I disagree with it. Hirak must goes on even if I acknowledge that we need to protect people from corona.""
Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad said the country faced an unprecedented ""multi-dimensional crisis"" and urged people to make fewer demands of the government and reduce their street presence.
The demonstrators are demanding wholesale changes in the political establishment, including the departure of the entire ruling elite and the army's withdrawal from politics. 
The protests forced the ousting last April of Abdelaziz Bouteflika after 20 years as president, and the arrest of many senior figures on corruption charges. 
Algeria's authorities have publicly praised the protest movement as a moment of national renewal and pledged to meet its demands, while using a big police presence and arrests to put pressure on demonstrators. 
In December, the authorities held a presidential election to replace Bouteflika despite vehement opposition from the protest movement, which said any vote held while the old ruling elite remained in power would be illegitimate. 
President Abdelmadjid Tebboune, who was elected in the vote, has promised to change the constitution in order to satisfy public demand for change. 
Algeria's 20 confirmed coronavirus cases so far are mostly from one family in the town of Blida south of the capital.

CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan security forces used teargas on Tuesday to stop protesters led by opposition leader Juan Guaido from marching on the national legislature, which pro-government lawmakers seized control of in January.
The march, attended by several thousand opposition demonstrators, advanced only a few blocks towards the congress in downtown Caracas before a phalanx of riot police barricaded the road and began firing teargas to disperse the crowd.
""It once again demonstrates the totalitarian nature of this regime,"" said lawmaker and Guaido supporter Williams (NYSE:WMB) Davila, his face and eyes red from the teargas.
Opposition legislators later held a extramural session in the fashionable Las Mercedes district nearby, setting up chairs on the neighborhood's main avenue and hanging a large Venezuelan flag as a backdrop. 
""We are a powerful majority that can change this country,"" said Guaido during the session. ""The dictatorship thinks it can take us on, that it can keep us quiet."" 
Guaido for weeks had urged Venezuelans to join the march as a way of reviving street protests against the government of President Nicolas Maduro, who Washington has sought to oust through economic sanctions. The protests surged in 2019 but have waned as the ruling Socialist Party has clung to power.
Tuesday's march was the opposition's first since Guaido returned on Feb. 11 from a diplomatic tour that included a meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump at the White House. It marked another test of Guaido's capacity to mobilize supporters, who are increasingly weary with his inability to oust Maduro despite a broad U.S. sanctions program and Venezuela's long-running economic crisis.
Maduro's government held its own separate rallies in downtown Caracas on Tuesday that were attended by hundreds of red-shirted supporters. 
""I don't miss a single march, even if I'm tried or sick,"" said Maria Isabel Luna, 62, a homemaker. ""I'm here for my commander Hugo Chavez and for my president Maduro,"" she said, referring to Maduro's predecessor who died in 2013.
A group of legislators backed by the Socialist Party installed themselves as leaders of congress in January after troops blocked Guaido from attending a session in which he was expected to be elected to a second term as assembly head.
Opposition lawmakers later re-elected Guaido, but they have been largely unable to meet at the legislative palace, once home to the only branch of government beyond Maduro's control.
More than 50 countries last year recognized Guaido as Venezuela's legitimate president following Maduro's disputed 2018 re-election, which was widely dismissed as fraudulent.

Venezuela this year is slated to hold parliamentary elections, but the opposition has not determined if it will participate due to concerns over free and fair conditions.

A branch of Sudan's security services that was closely linked to Bashir will be brought under control of the civilian government and a committee tasked with dismantling the old regime will be given additional powers, sovereign council spokesman Mohamed al-Faki said in a statement.
Authorities have launched an investigation into Monday's assassination attempt, when a blast targeted Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok's convoy as he drove to work.
They have not said who was behind it, but by reasserting that Bashir loyalists will be firmly dealt with, they have suggested possible links with old regime supporters trying to disrupt a democratic transition.
Hamdok heads a government of technocrats serving under a 39-month power-sharing deal between civilian groups and the military that was struck after Bashir was overthrown last April.
As part of efforts to disempower Bashir's supporters, the ""dismantling"" committee has already moved to disband the former ruling party and dismiss senior officials at banks and embassies.
Some officers at the National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS) have also been dismissed, and the name of the agency has been changed to the General Intelligence Service (GIS).
Faki said on Tuesday that the part of the GIS that operates inside Sudan would be brought under the interior ministry.
In mid-January, armed security agents linked to Bashir fought soldiers in Khartoum for several hours, after a dispute linked to severance packages."

The legislative proposal is not expected to advance in Brazil's Congress, where dozens of lawmakers are under investigation for corruption and money laundering.
Congressman Emerson (NYSE:EMR) Petriv, better known by his political name Boca Aberta, said such a drastic measure was needed in a country fed up with widespread corruption committed with impunity.
""It is a shocking bill, but unfortunately a majority of politicians steal taxpayers' money,"" he said by telephone. In Arab nations, nobody steals anything for fear of having their hand cut off, he added.
Petriv said there was public support for his proposal, but to get approved the bill would need the backing of lawmakers who have not been caught robbing.
Brazil has jailed dozens of businessmen and politicians in the country's biggest ever corruption scandal known as the ""Car Wash"" investigation, but many have since been freed, including former leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva who was convicted of receiving bribes.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's Supreme Court on Tuesday awarded the father of a young U.S. psychologist who was beaten to death in southern Chile $240,000 in compensation for mistakes by police and prosecutors that allowed her killer to get away.
Erica Faith Hagan, 22, from Murray, Kentucky, was working as a teaching assistant in English and religious education at the Colegio Bautista school in the city of Temuco, 400 miles (640 km) south of the capital Santiago. Her lifeless body was found in her dormitory bathtub on Sept. 6, 2014.
In December 2015, Domingo Cofre, 44, a security guard at the school, was acquitted of her murder. There have been no further leads in the case.
The Supreme Court ruling on Tuesday upheld another by the Temuco appeal court in May 2019.
The court ruled that ""negligent performance and unjustifiable errors"" by police and prosecutors meant Hagan's father Chris ""lost the opportunity"" to turn the page on her death through the conviction of her killer or killers.
Cofre's DNA, and that of another person, was found on the poker used to kill Hagan but it was contaminated by police during its recovery and could not be used in evidence, the Supreme Court ruling said.
Hagan's watch was also lost during the investigation, and the crime scene was not properly secured, the court finding said.
The court ordered the Chilean state to pay Chris Hagan $200m Chilean pesos ($239,000) in moral damages."

ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States has offered to sell Turkey its Patriot missile defense system if Ankara promises not to operate a rival Russian system, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said, in what he called a significant softening in Washington's position.
Two Turkish officials told Reuters that Turkey was evaluating the U.S. offer but that Ankara had not changed its plans for the Russian S-400 systems, which it has said it will start to activate next month.
In Washington, the Pentagon said that U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper had not changed his position on the issue, which was: ""Turkey is not going to receive a Patriot battery unless it returns the S-400.""
NATO allies Turkey and the United States have been at odds over Ankara's purchase last year of the S-400s, which Washington says are incompatible with the alliance's defense systems.
After heavy fighting in northwestern Syria's Idlib region this year Turkey asked Washington to deploy Patriots along its border with Syria for protection but the United States said Turkey cannot have both the S-400s and the Patriots.
Speaking to reporters on his return flight from Brussels, Erdogan said Ankara had told Washington to deploy Patriot systems to Turkey and that it was ready to purchase the systems from the United States as well.
""We made this offer to the United States on the Patriot: If you are going to give us Patriots, then do it. We can also buy Patriots from you,"" he said.
""They also softened significantly on this S-400 issue. They are now at the point of 'promise us you won't make the S-400s operational',"" Erdogan added.
Previous talks between Turkey and the United States on the purchase of the Patriots have collapsed over a host of issues, from the S-400s to Ankara's dissatisfaction with Washington's terms. Turkey has said it will only agree to an offer if it includes technology transfer and joint production terms.
While ties between Ankara and Washington have been strained, the United States has offered support for its ally as it battles to stop Russia-backed Syrian government advances in Idlib.
But U.S. officials said on Tuesday Ankara had to clarify its position on the S-400s for their security ties to advance.
U.S. special representative for Syria James Jeffrey and U.S. Ambassador to Turkey David Satterfield told reporters on a conference call from Brussels that Washington was discussing with NATO what support it can offer Turkey militarily.
Jeffrey also said they had considered possible responses should Russia and the Syrian government break a ceasefire in Idlib, officials said.
He suggested other NATO states could individually or as an alliance provide military support to help Turkey. But he ruled out sending ground troops and said there still needed to be a resolution to the S-400 issue for the security relationship to move forward. 
""You can forget ground troops. Turkey has demonstrated that it and its opposition forces are more than capable of holding ground on their own,"" Jeffrey said. ""The issue is the situation in the air and it's what we are looking at,"" he said.
Washington did not believe that Russia and Syrian had any interest in a permanent ceasefire in Idlib, he said.
""They are out to get a military victory in Syria and our goal is to make it difficult for them to do that,"" Jeffrey said.
""Our goal is...to make them think twice. If they ignore our warnings and preparations and move forward, then we will react as rapidly as possible in consultation with our NATO and European allies on what the package of sanctions and other reactions will be.""
POSITION ""UNCHANGED""
While Erdogan has frequently referred to the S-400 purchase as a ""done deal"" and said Turkey will not turn back from it, he did not repeat that stance in his comments on Tuesday. Turkish officials, however, said Turkey's position remained unchanged.
""The United States has once again brought up the Patriot offer. The United States' previous strong stance isn't the case anymore. They are approaching Turkey more empathetically now,"" a senior official said.
""The core condition is that the S-400s are not activated, or in other words that they are not unboxed. This offer is being evaluated, but there is no change of stance on the S-400s,"" the official, speaking on condition of anonymity said.
A separate Turkish official told Reuters the latest offer by Washington also included Turkey's return to the F-35 stealth fighter jet program, which Turkey was involved in both as manufacturer of plane parts and customer for the jets. 
After Ankara bought the S-400s, Washington suspended its involvement in the program and threatened sanctions.
""There is a U.S. offer for Patriots, but this offer includes the F-35s,"" the Turkish official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ""Air defense systems can be purchased, but Turkey’s conditions are clear: there has to be issues like the know-how transfer and joint production.""
Turkey has said it plans to activate the S-400s it received from Russia in April. The United States has warned that such a move will trigger U.S. sanctions, though Ankara has repeatedly said good ties between Erdogan and U.S. President Donald Trump may be able to avert this.

1224,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 02:22PM ET</span>",Coronavirus pushes Irish rivals into open government talks,"By Padraic Halpin
DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland's Fianna Fail and Fine Gael parties decided on Tuesday to open formal coalition negotiations after an inconclusive Feb. 8 election, saying they were acutely aware of the enormous challenges brought by the coronavirus outbreak.
Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin has been seeking to form a government but both he and acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Fine Gael have ruled out governing with Sinn Fein, the left-wing pro-Irish unity party which topped the poll and has an equal number of seats to Fianna Fail in parliament.
That means some kind of deal will be needed between the two center-right rivals and traditional dominant forces who have never formed a coalition government together.
Having sunk to 35 seats in the 160-seat house compared to the 37 each held by Fianna Fail and Sinn Fein, Fine Gael had been initially reluctant to move beyond exploratory talks but the 24 coronavirus cases identified to date led Varadkar and Martin to meet twice in the last 24 hours.
""Both leaders are acutely aware of the enormous challenges facing the country particularly with the onset of COVID-19 (coronavirus). They enter the talks as equal partners determined to develop proposals which will serve the interests of the people of Ireland,"" the parties said in identical statements. 
They two parties, which have swapped power at every election since emerging from opposing sides of Ireland's 1920s civil war, will continue talks with the smaller Green Party, whose support will be needed to reach a majority in the fractured parliament.
Fianna Fail facilitated the last Fine Gael-led minority government from opposition but Martin said last week that he favored a full coalition this time.
If the parties cannot agree a government deal and maintain their steadfast opposition to Sinn Fein - chiefly over its role as the former political wing of the Irish Republican Army - a second election would be the only way to break the deadlock.
The IRA fought British rule in Northern Ireland for decades in a conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal.
Acting Finance Minister Paschal Donohoe of Fine Gael said earlier on Tuesday that the coronavirus spread - which the caretaker government on Monday set aside 3 billion euros to tackle - had changed the dynamic.
""We are in a situation now in which the context of these kind of discussions has very significantly and fundamentally changed and even more importantly, it's possible this context could change for quite a while,"" Donohoe told national broadcaster RTE.

1225,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 02:04PM ET</span>",Putin approves changes allowing him to stay in power until 2036,"By Andrew Osborn and Tom Balmforth
MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday opened the door to constitutional changes that would allow him to remain in power until 2036, but said he favored term limits once the country became politically ""mature"".
Putin, who in January unveiled a major shake-up of Russian politics and a constitutional overhaul, is required by the constitution to step down in 2024 when his second sequential and fourth presidential term ends. 
But addressing the State Duma, the lower house of parliament, he gave his qualified blessing to a proposed change to the constitution that would formally reset his presidential term tally to zero.
""The proposal to remove restrictions for any person, including the incumbent president ... In principle, this option would be possible, but on one condition - if the constitutional court gives an official ruling that such an amendment would not contradict the principles and main provisions of the constitution,"" Putin said.
He said U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt serving four terms because of the upheaval his country was going through at the time was an example of why presidential term limits were sometimes superfluous.
""In conditions when a country is experiencing such shocks and difficulties, of course ... stability is perhaps more important and must be a priority,"" he said, adding that Russia was still recovering from the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
If, as Putin's critics suspect, the constitutional court gives its blessing to the amendment and it is backed in a nationwide vote in April, Putin could serve another two back-to-back six year terms.
Were he to do that, and his health and electoral fortunes allowed, he could stay in office until 2036 at which point he would be 83.
Kremlin critic and opposition politician Alexei Navalny said he believed Putin was now set to become president for life, while Navalny's ally, Ivan Zhdanov, decried the move as tantamount to a constitutional coup.
'ROOM TO MANEUVER'
Putin, 67, now had more room to maneuver politically, said Tatiana Stanovaya, a non-resident scholar at the Carnegie Moscow Center.
His stance handed him the option to run again in 2024 should he choose to do so and removed political challenges raised by what had been seen as his last term in the Kremlin, she added.
""The successor issue disappears. The issue of Putin as a lame duck disappears,"" said Stanovaya.
Opposition activists said they planned to protest against what some called a rewriting of the constitution in the interests of the ruling elite. One group said it had applied for permission to stage a demonstration on March 21.
Moscow's government said in a statement late on Tuesday that it would stop all public gatherings in the city of more than 5,000 people until April 10 due to coronavirus-related risks.
A former KGB officer, Putin, who is serving his fourth presidential term and has also served as prime minister, has dominated the Russian political landscape for two decades. 
Putin has not spelled out what his plans for the future are, but he has said he does not favor the Soviet-era practice of having leaders for life who die in office.
Putin appeared before parliament on Tuesday after Valentina Tereshkova, a lawmaker from the ruling United Russia party and the first woman in space, told parliament she was proposing to amend the constitution in a way that would reset his presidential term count to zero.
Explaining the surprise move, Tereshkova said voters had told lawmakers in recent meetings that they wanted Putin to ""stay nearby"", whatever constitutional changes occurred.
""What if suddenly something goes wrong?"" asked Tereshkova. ""He (Putin) will be able to support, help and have our backs.""

Her proposal came as parliament was examining and preparing to vote on Putin's constitutional shake-up in the second of three readings, something it later did, approving it and Tereshkova's amendment.

DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - A court in Tanzania convicted nine opposition leaders and legislators on Tuesday of making seditious statements and imposed five-month jail terms or a fine, which could heighten activists' fears that democratic dissent is being stifled.
The defendants were all from Chadema, the leading opposition party and included Chadema chairman Freeman Mbowe, the deputy secretary general, ex-secretary general, head of the women's wing and four other legislators. The accused were fined a total of 350 million Tanzanian shillings ($152,000).
The nine had been charged with various offences that included unlawful assembly, rioting, and making seditious statements on Feb. 16, 2018 during a by-election campaign in Kinondoni constituency in Dar es Salaam. They had denied the charges.
""I have been satisfied with the evidence...in video tapes. I have seen their faces and I know their faces, the evidence is enough to confirm that there was unlawful assembly,"" Principal Resident Magistrate Thomas Simba said.
Last year, President John Magufuli's government passed legislation that gave powers to a government-appointed registrar over political parties. Magufuli's government has also banned newspapers, restricted opposition rallies and detained dozens of opposition politicians.
Tanzania, a nation of 57 million people, has long been regarded as one of Africa’s most stable democracies. The ruling CCM party, and its predecessor TANU, have governed since independence from Britain in 1961.
Magufuli, nicknamed ""the Bulldozer"", swept to power in 2015 promising an end to corruption. But repeated state intervention in sectors like mining and agriculture, have dimmed investment.

The comments by Prime Minister Abdelaziz Djerad were an apparent reference to a year of weekly mass protests, which are continuing even though they have already led to many changes at the top of the ruling hierarchy.
The demonstrators are demanding wholesale changes in the power structure and the army's withdrawal from politics.
An oil market crash has followed years of growing economic strain in Algeria as lower energy prices since 2014 and falling hydrocarbons output have hit state coffers.
""It would be wiser to reduce the tendency to make demands and the overblown occupation of public roads, which only aggravate the current situation more,"" Djerad told state news agency APS.
The Algerian authorities have in public mostly praised the mass protests as a national revival, while simultaneously putting pressure on the demonstrators through a heavy police presence and arrests.
In addition to the mass protests that take place each Friday, there have been smaller demonstrations demanding better living standards and public services.
""Given the seriousness of the current economic and social situation, all parties are expected to be mobilized to get out of this multi-dimensional crisis,"" Djerad told state news agency APS.
Elected in December last year in a vote largely rejected by demonstrators, President Abdelmadjid Tebboune has said repeatedly he will meet the protest movement's demands with changes to the constitution.
He has also pledged steps to improve living standards, build more schools and construct better transport infrastructure around the country.

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch prosecutors accused Russia on Tuesday of trying to sabotage the investigation into the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 in Ukraine in 2014, saying this cast ""a dark shadow"" over the impending trial of four suspects in the crash.
Pre-trial hearings began in Amsterdam on Monday. Prosecutors say the defendants - three Russians and a Ukrainian - helped arrange the Russian missile system used to shoot down MH17, a civilian aircraft.
All 298 people on board were killed. Most of the passengers were Dutch nationals.
""The sum of all the facts casts a dark shadow over this investigation because there is strong indicative evidence that Russian government is keen to thwart the investigation,"" prosecutor Thijs Berger told the hearing, part of which focused on testimony by witnesses who have not yet been named.
""Several witnesses in this investigation have said that they fear for their lives if their identities would come to light.""
Lawyers for one defendant protested at the prosecutor's remarks about Russia, and argued that witness intimidation should not be addressed in open hearings.
MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014, when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Moscow rebels amid fighting in eastern Ukraine.
A team of international investigators in May 2018 concluded the missile launcher which shot down the aircraft belonged to Russia's 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade.
Russia denies any involvement.
The defendants - Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko - held senior posts in pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine in 2014, according to prosecutors.
The four face preliminary charges of the murder of 298 people and of causing the aircraft to crash. The suspects are believed to be in Russia and are not expected to attend.
On Monday, judges decided the trial would continue with the suspects absent.
Only Pulatov has appointed defense lawyers. Defence lawyer Sabine ten Doesschate told the court on Tuesday that her client ""has nothing whatsoever to do"" with the plane's downing.
She said Pulatov has not decided whether he might give the court a statement.
Countries participating in the investigation - Ukraine, the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia and Belgium - agreed in 2017 to hold trials in the Netherlands under Dutch law after attempts to set up a U.N.-backed tribunal foundered over Russian opposition.
The Netherlands and Australia have said they hold Russia responsible for the crash.
A second defense lawyer, Boudewijn van Eijck, criticized the prosecutor's statements about Russia as ""sailing a little too close to the wind."" He said that possible defense witnesses could be influenced by such comments about intimidation.
""We regret that this has been discussed publicly,"" he said.
Van Eijck also questioned prosecution accusations that Russia had mounted a disinformation campaign about the crash and tried to undermine the investigation.
""The Russian Federation has cooperated in the release of judicial documents,"" Van Eijck said. ""Everything that was asked of the Russian Federation...was delivered.""
Prosecutors said one witness had already been given protection. He was described as M58, a Russian national who had volunteered to join Ukrainian rebels.
Prosecutor Dedy Woei-a-Tsoi said M58's statement was that he had been near the site of the missile launcher at the time the fatal missile was launched, assigned to help guard it. She said the witness gave evidence that Russian military personnel and separatists at the scene were ""initially pleased"" as they were told shot they had down a military transport plane.
""However, when the first people returned from the crash site they said it was a civilian aircraft,"" Woei-a-Tsoi said, discussing M58's videotaped testimony."

Alexei Nesterenko's father was convicted in the house on Nikolskaya Street by the NKVD, the forerunner to the KGB and FSB security services. Nesterenko, now in his eighties and who was only a baby when his father was killed, protests every Wednesday at the site, on what is today a busy shopping street.
""He was convicted in this building, sentenced to capital punishment for being in a terrorist, counter-revolutionary organization,"" Nesterenko told Reuters. ""At that time, the NKVD gave such sentences to anyone.""
Nesterenko said the house represented ""the essence of all the injustice of that time"" and said he would support a memorial or museum being erected in its place.
According to official records from the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, almost 700,000 people were sentenced to death from 1937-8 during the peak of the Great Terror.
Some estimates put the figure at more than one million.
SCENT OF TERROR
The perfume, cased in the shell of a real Soviet bullet, opens with notes of ink and stale paper, to evoke the signing of a death penalty, followed by the stench of a damp basement, gunpowder and burning embers, said Nikita Petrusyov, the campaign's creative director.

Petrusyov said it was ""awful and absolutely crazy"" to have a luxury boutique at a site where thousands were killed.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday made his first visit to Wuhan since a coronavirus outbreak forced a lockdown of the city of 11 million people, in a sign that authorities' efforts to control the virus are working.
Xi's arrived on the same day that Wuhan shut the last of 14 temporary hospitals that had been opened to manage a surge in coronavirus patients, news website The Paper reported..
Earlier on Tuesday, China said it had just 19 new coronavirus infections on Monday, down from 40 a day earlier. That also marked the third straight day of no new domestically transmitted cases in mainland China outside of Hubei province, where Wuhan is located, even as the disease spreads rapidly in other countries, including Italy and the United States.
""The situation of coronavirus prevention in Hubei and Wuhan has shown positive changes and achieved phased results, initially realizing goals to stabilize and turn around the situation,"" the official Xinhua news service cited Xi as saying.
He acknowledged that people under lengthy quarantine - Wuhan and much of Hubei province have been under strict controls since late January - may have frustrations to vent.
""We must understand and tolerate them,"" he was quoted as saying.
During his visit, a masked Xi was shown meeting with local officials, medical staff, and volunteers, state broadcaster CCTV reported. He addressed frontline medical workers and a hospitalized patient by videolink. 
Residents of Wuhan were shown cheering Xi from their apartment windows, while negative comments on China's heavily censored social media were quickly removed.
""Why only come now when the epidemic is almost over?"" one comment on the official People's Daily's Weibo feed said before disappearing.
News of Xi's Wuhan visit gave a lift to Chinese stocks, with the blue-chip index (CSI300) ending the day 2.1% higher after falling into negative territory in morning trade.
""It is obvious that Xi could not have visited Wuhan earlier because the risk of him contracting the virus there was initially too high,"" Zhang Ming, a professor at Renmin University in Beijing, told Reuters.
""He is there now to reap the harvest. His being there means the CCP (Chinese Communist Party) may declare victory against the virus soon,"" Zhang said.
China came in for criticism at home and globally over its early response to the outbreak, suppressing information and downplaying its risks, but its draconian efforts at control, including the lock-down of Wuhan and Hubei province, have been effective at curbing the spread.
Xi, who was mostly absent from Chinese state media coverage of the crisis in its early days, has become far more visible in recent weeks. 
DWINDLING NEW CASES 
Of the new coronovirus cases announced by China, 17 were in Wuhan. Two others - in Beijing and Guangdong province - involved people who had arrived from Britain and Spain, respectively.
That brings the total number of confirmed cases in mainland China so far to 80,754.
Chinese authorities have ramped up warnings about the risks from foreigners and Chinese nationals traveling to China from viral hot spots abroad such as Iran and Italy. As of Monday, there were 69 imported cases.
Also on Tuesday, Hubei said it would implement a ""health code"" system to allow people in areas at medium or low risk to start traveling. Qianjiang, a city in Hubei, said that all traffic checkpoints will be removed, public transportation will restart and firms will resume work in the near future, according to a report on an official website.
Globally, more than 114,300 people have been infected by the coronavirus and over 4,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements.

Since the outbreak, 59,897 patients have been discharged from hospitals in China. Recently discharged patients need to go into quarantine for 14 days.

For the most part, though, residents in Saudi Arabia's Qatif region are adapting to new restrictions after the oil-producing area was sealed off from the rest of the kingdom on Sunday to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Vigilance against the infection appears high. Like others in the eastern region on the Gulf coast, Abu Ali and his family watched a religious sermon on their mobiles instead of gathering with other worshippers.
Husseiniyas -- Shi'ite Muslim religious gathering places -- were empty on Monday when Qatif's large Shi'ite community commemorated the death of Sayida Zaynab, daughter of Imam Ali, considered the father of Shi'ite Islam.
Religious leaders broadcast sermons on the Internet. 
""Everybody was on their phones watching Youtube channels,"" Abu Ali told Reuters by telephone on Tuesday.
Authorities locked down Qatif on Sunday, placing cement blocks and checkpoints to prevent movement in and out of the region while ensuring trade flows continued.
Authorities have said the lockdown was temporary, to contain the infection. Most of the kingdom's 20 cases have involved people who had been in either Iran or Iraq or met individuals who had visited those countries, home to Shi'ite holy sites. 
They said several people had not disclosed their visits to the Islamic Republic upon returning to the kingdom, which has long banned its citizens from traveling to arch-foe Iran.
LIVELIHOOD 
In several towns of the region, streets and markets were still bustling. One vendor gutting fish wore a face mask, while his colleague did not. Fisherman went about their business.
""Things are normal in Qatif,"" a 59-year-old man who identified himself as Abu Hussein said, adding that his daughter continued her medical studies remotely like many students throughout the kingdom where schools have been closed.
""The only thing is that masks and sanitizers have disappeared from pharmacies,"" he said.
Work at government and private entities was suspended with the exception of essential activities, such as medical and security services and petrol stations.
As the lockdown began, there was a rush to grocery shops by residents that went on until midnight. One said he had stocked up on meat, vegetables, bread and water. 
""On day one, people were a bit anxious. But since then everything is back to normal ... People understand and accept the situation,"" Abu Ali said. 
But some residents are worried about businesses outside the zone which sits next to swathes of agricultural land.
Jassem al-Jabroudi said he cannot visit his farm which lies 65 km (40 miles) outside the lockdown area and where he raises chickens, sheep and camels and grows onions and beans.
""I have seven workers on the farm entrusted to my care and I cannot go see them,"" he said. ""How will I get my livelihood?""
Qatif has historically been a flashpoint between the Sunni-dominated government and minority Shi'ites who have complained of discrimination and marginalization, charges the government denies.
Some Qatif residents found a silver lining in the closures.
""We needed more time to spend with our families,"" said a 30-year old woman, who asked not to be named.

1234,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 12:56PM ET</span>",British PM Johnson defeats lawmaker revolt on Huawei's 5G role,"By Paul Sandle and Kylie MacLellan
LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday defeated his first party rebellion over a government decision to allow China's Huawei to have a role in building Britain's 5G phone network.
Huawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, has been caught in a stand-off between Washington and Beijing after the United States accused it of spying on Western secrets, allegations which the company has denied.
Britain decided in January to allow Huawei into what the government said were non-sensitive parts of the country's 5G network, capping its involvement at 35%.
This angered the United States, which wants to exclude Huawei from the West's next-generation communications systems and has urged Britain to rethink.
Some senior Conservatives shared the U.S. unhappiness. They wanted Huawei eliminated entirely from Britain's 5G networks by the end of December 2022.
The government tried to placate the rebels by saying it would work toward increasing the supply of 5G telecoms gear so operators would not need to use Huawei, but it refused to commit to any timetable to ban the Chinese company.
It was not enough, however, and the rebels pushed their plan to a vote. 
The government, which has an 80 seat majority, won by 24.
Digital Infrastructure Minister Matt Warman said the government had ""heard loud and clear the points made on all sides of the house"".
Bob Seely, one of the rebels, signaled the group would continue to pursue their cause, describing the vote as ""a strong first showing"" in a posting on Twitter.
The rebels wanted to amend the Telecommunications Infrastructure Bill to ensure that companies termed by British security experts as ""high-risk vendors"" - such as Huawei - were stripped out of networks completely by the end of 2022.
The government said it did not want high-risk vendors to have any role, but in a market dominated by three players, Huawei, Sweden's Ericsson (ST:ERICb) and Finland's Nokia (HE:NOKIA), some network operators were relying on Huawei.
""We would like to get to the point where we won't need to have any high risk vendors at all,"" digital minister Oliver Dowden told parliament.
Huawei vice president Victor Zhang said the company had been ""reassured"" by the government's decision in January, which would ""result in a more advanced, more secure and more cost-effective telecoms infrastructure"". 
""An evidence-based approach is needed, so we were disappointed to hear some groundless accusations asserted,"" he said. ""The industry and experts agree that banning Huawei equipment would leave Britain less secure, less productive and less innovative.""
TIMETABLE 
Conservative lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith, who put forward the amendment, said he wanted a clear timetable from the government on its plan to completely remove high-risk vendors. 
""I am always flexible on the date, providing the intent and commitment to eradicate the involvement of high risk vendors from our system, across the board, full stop,"" he said. 
Dowden said the government would work with international partners to increase the choice of vendors during this parliament, which is due to end in 2024.
While the Conservative rebels failed to change government policy, they fired a sizeable warning shot across the newly-installed government's bows.
Mike Rake, the former chairman of broadband and mobile company BT  and an adviser to Huawei, said the Chinese firm has a vital role in building the 5G network Britain needs.
""Any attempt to further restrict Huawei 5G equipment, or to remove existing 4G equipment, will not only incur very significant costs but prejudice trade relationships with China and will significantly set back the government's broadband ambitions,"" he said in an open letter. 
""This, in turn, will further damage our competitiveness as an economy at what is a critical moment.""

Britain is in the process of negotiating new trading relationships, having left the European Union.

The government has also banned travel to Lebanon and Syria and from Monday will bar entry to travelers from France, Germany and Spain, Saad Jaber told a news conference.
Jordan announced earlier this month that a man who had arrived on a flight from Italy had tested positive for coronavirus, the first case confirmed in the country. Jordanian authorities have not announced any new cases.
Jaber said the moves approved by the cabinet were part of emergency measures that also included reducing airline service by half to Egypt and only allowing travel for emergency reasons.
""These measures are to minimize the chances of the virus entering and its spread,"" he told reporters.
Only overland commercial traffic would be allowed from its northern border crossing of Jaber with Syria and to the east with Iraq via the Karameh crossing.
The move will affect the daily flow of thousands of people from the occupied Palestinian territories who have close family ties with Jordan. 
It will also impact tens of thousands of Egyptian workers who comprise Jordan's largest expatriate work force, crossing daily by sea from Egypt's Sinai region.

MARACAIBO/SAN CRISTOBAL, Venezuela (Reuters) - In a hospital in Venezuela's western city of Maracaibo, chronic water shortages have left staff using paint buckets as toilets. With medical gloves in short supply, workers use the same pair on multiple patients.
Years of recession, hyperinflation, and underinvestment in public services have left Venezuela in poor condition to confront any cases of the coronavirus that is spreading rapidly worldwide. Its hospitals suffer from chronic shortages of medicine and supplies, as well as frequent lapses in electricity and running water.
So far, Latin America has been spared the worst ravages of the virus. Around 100 cases have been reported in the region since Brazil announced the first case on Feb. 26.
But - with neighboring Colombia confirming its first case last week - it is only a matter of time before it reaches Venezuela, officials say.
The Pan American Health Organization said last week it would be prioritizing Haiti, Venezuela and a handful of other Central and South American countries who have ""more challenges to their health systems."" 
Hania Salazar, president of Maracaibo's nursing school in the western state of Zulia, said hospital workers have been without supplies for years.
""Workers bring their own kits with soap and towels, and their own water to drink and wash,"" said Salazar. 
""They also carry paint containers because here there is no hospital that has a bathroom in good condition."" 
As in other parts of Venezuela, Zulia's health system has hemorrhaged workers. Salazar said only emergency units were operating and workers often clock upwards of 18 hours a day. 
Residents say a lack of access to water or affordable soap can make basic hygiene practices - needed to guard against the spread of the virus - out of reach for many. 
""I am very concerned that in Venezuela there are no supplies, medicines, or even water in hospitals or homes,"" said Josefina Moreno, a 50-year-old university professor with a history of respiratory disease. ""The prevention measures that everyone is talking about are hard to comply with here."" 
Gustavo Uribe, president of a medical school in the state of Tachira near the Colombian border, said hand-washing would be difficult due to water shortages. 
""We're asking everyone to comply with hygienic norms, but we all know about the precarity of the system,"" he said. ""The worry is that it will come here first, being by an international border.""
Vice President Delcy Rodriguez said on state television on Monday that the country was implementing ""strict controls"" at ports of entry and a series of protocols in health centers. The government has issued a list of hospitals charged with handling cases. 
But some of those hospitals were not even open, said Douglas Leon, head of the Venezuelan Medical Federation. 
""There is no hospital in Venezuela with capacity to attend to a patient with a condition as serious as this,"" he told a news conference on Monday.

PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron warned France on Tuesday that it was at just the start of a health epidemic as the coronavirus outbreak crept closer to the heart of French political power.
Culture Minister Franck Riester said late on Monday he had tested positive for the virus, and Macron's chief of staff is self-isolating after contact with an infected person, said an official at the Elysee Palace, the presidential residence.
Measures are in place to protect Macron: meetings are kept to a minimum, video conference calls are being encouraged and non-essential visitors are being turned away.
""Don't start thinking we're creating a bubble,"" the Elysee official said, adding that ""we're still in line with the kind of advice we're giving to the whole French population.""
Macron's government had led calls for a fiscal shock in Europe to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak. There has been global disruption to businesses and supply chains, and neighboring Italy is in lockdown.
Macron visited a pediatric hospital on Tuesday and urged the French people to stay calm after signs of panic buying of staple goods in and around Paris.
But he cautioned: ""We're only at the beginning of this epidemic.""
The coronavirus has infected more than 1,400 people in France and killed 30.
Riester became the first French government minister to go down with the coronavirus. He said he had been tested on Monday afternoon after feeling flu-like symptoms.
He attended last Wednesday's cabinet meeting, chaired by Macron, and sessions last week in parliament where five lawmakers have tested positive.
A policy of no handshakes between ministers was already in place by then. This week's cabinet meeting was still due to take place, an official at the prime minister's Matignon office said.
Desks are being cleaned twice a day and the distance between seats is being widened, the Matignon official said.
Macron's chief-of-staff, Patrick Strzoda, was working from home as a preventative measure and had not shown any symptoms of a coronavirus infection, the Elysee official said."

Putin presides over an annual parade on May 9 to commemorate the Soviet Union's World War Two victory over Nazi Germany and uses the occasion to show off the country's military hardware.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Moscow did not yet know who would represent the United States at the commemorative event. 
Trump had wrestled with the decision on whether to go, U.S. officials said. He had wanted to go but faced pressure from advisers not to embark on such a journey.
The first two years of Trump's presidency were consumed with an investigation into whether his presidential campaign colluded with Russia in 2016.
Trump survived the Russia probe, only to be impeached by the Democratic-led House of Representatives for seeking to pressure Ukraine into investigating Democratic rival Joe Biden. The Republican-led Senate acquitted him of the allegations in February.
While Trump has maintained sanctions on Russia, he has faced criticism from Democrats over what they consider a softer attitude toward Putin, who the president says he wants to get along with.
Former National Security Council Russia expert Fiona Hill told CBS' ""60 Minutes"" in an interview broadcast on Sunday that Trump has a reason for not criticizing Putin.

""President Trump understands that President Putin does not like to be insulted. Putin takes it very personally. He harbors a grudge. He doesn't forget. And he will find some way of getting some degree of revenge,"" she said.

The house, in The Bishops Avenue, Hampstead, along with two other properties, is worth 80 million pounds ($104 million), the NCA says, and has an underground swimming pool and a cinema.
It is occupied by Nurali Aliyev, his wife Aida, and their children. Aliyev, 35, is the grandson of former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev.
The NCA has barred any attempt to sell the properties and argues that the wealth used to buy them was linked to Rakhat Aliyev - Nurali Aliyev's father and the former president's son-in-law - who was found hanged in an Austrian jail in 2015 after being charged with the murder of two bankers in 2007.
This is only the second time so-called Unexplained Wealth Orders (UWOs) have been used in Britain since being introduced in 2018.
The NCA can use them to require owners to disclose how they managed to acquire assets. If they do not agree with the explanation, they can ask the courts to confiscate them.
In the High Court on Tuesday two offshore companies that own the properties applied to have the orders squashed.
Clare Montgomery, acting on the companies' behalf, said the NCA's grounds for the wealth order was ""tissue paper thin"".
""The case presented ... was tissue-paper thin on the claim that there was a link to Rakhat Aliyev,"" she said.
Montgomery said the funding for the properties came from Nurali Aliyev's mother, Darga Nazarbayeva, who she said was economically independent.
In a statement issued later, the mother denied any wrongdoing.
""She has furnished the NCA with all the information it needed to conclude she has not been involved in any wrongdoing and there was no merit to their case,"" her spokesperson said.
""Dr Nazarbayeva wishes to make it clear she has not been party to any wrongdoing and looks forward to the matter being concluded swiftly.”
Lawyers for Nurali Aliyev also issued a statement later saying he had tried to help the NCA's inquiries.
""Nurali Aliyev has sought to assist the NCA by providing them with relevant information in relation to this case,"" it said. ""He is now challenging the NCA’s approach and will robustly defend the proceedings.""
Aliyev was appointed head of Kazakhstan's top music channel in 2006 at the age of 21 and became a banker a year later, earning $26,000 a month for sitting on the board of the country's seventh-largest bank, along with his mother.
The ex-president of oil-rich Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, has been widely criticized by opponents for giving his family members powerful posts in government, industry, construction and banking.
More than 5 billion pounds worth of property in the UK has been bought with suspicious wealth, which could come from corruption, according to Transparency International UK.
Britain's first UWOs were issued against assets belonging to Jahangir Hajiyeva, who was in prison in Azerbaijan for embezzlement from the state bank, and his wife, Zamira, who spent 16.3 million pounds in the London department store Harrods."

KABUL (Reuters) - After a day of political chaos that left many in Afghanistan stunned, some citizens took to social media to vent their frustration and to highlight the absurd elements of their country's political predicament.
Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was sworn in for a second term on Monday, but the ceremony was marred by a rocket attack and his rival Abdullah Abdullah held his own inauguration ceremony after guests waited all morning for last-ditch negotiations between the two that ended in a deadlock.
Both men say they are Afghanistan's rightful leader after a disputed election last September. The standoff threatens political chaos days after Washington and the Taliban signed a deal on the withdrawal of U.S.-led international forces.
Afghanistan's youth representative at the United Nations likened the situation to the fantasy TV drama 'Game of Thrones', others said it reminded them of childhood scraps and make-believe games. Journalists wondered how they would refer to the two men, particularly 'self-inaugurated' Abdullah.
The residents of Police District 8, a residential area in Kabul, marked the occasion by staging a mock inauguration ceremony for 'president' of their suburb and posting the video on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) and Youtube.
A resident playing the part of president swore a mock oath: ""I swear... that I will bring Afghanistan into crisis. I swear... that I am trampling over 35 million people.""
A popular parody Twitter account known as 'The Afghan Onion' tweeted:
""Breaking... breakthrough in negotiations between Abdullah, Ghani and Taliban. It's a three-way split now with each leader presiding over 8 hours per day. — Torsan will be President during lunch break.""
Mohammad Hakim Torsan, a candidate who won less than 1% of the votes, said on Monday he was ""president of the people's heart"".
Mirroring a moment in which Ghani responded to the sound of rockets landing on the edge of his compound on Monday by pulling off his jacket to show he was not wearing a bulletproof vest while yelling he was not afraid, people around the country posted photos of themselves in the same pose.
Washington-based Afghan journalist Shaista Sadat Lameh tweeted a photo of her two young sons, chests puffed out with their coats held open: ""My Hewad and Maihan also have not put on body-armor.""
On a graver note, however, both Abdullah and Ghani's Twitter accounts on Tuesday read: ""President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan""."

KUALA LUMPUR (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Hong Kong prison authorities rejected criticism of ""modern slavery"" on Tuesday as female inmates started working night shifts to produce millions of face masks after the fast-spreading coronavirus triggered shortages.
Inmates at the Lo Wu prison have complained about their health and low pay after monthly production for government agencies was doubled to 2.5 million masks amid surging demand, said lawmaker Shiu Ka-chun who met with the prisoners.
""This is an exploitation and another form of modern slavery,"" said Shiu, a former social worker who has been campaigning for prisoners' rights.
Prison officials defended the decision on Tuesday.
""All persons in custody participating in the night shift are on a voluntary basis,"" said a spokeswoman at the Hong Kong's Correctional Services Department, which oversees prisons.
""If they found themselves not adaptable to the night shift work, they may approach the management at any time,"" she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in emailed comments.
More than 114,000 people have been infected by the COVID-19 coronavirus globally and over 4,000 have died since it emerged in China in December, sparking a rush for face masks even as health officials have said healthy people do not need them.
Across Asia, the spread of the flu-like virus has sparked a run on masks, with some hospitals struggling to procure enough for their staff, leading to rationing and arrests for hoarding.
With round-the-clock production, female prisoners, often working night shifts, earn about HK$800 ($103) a month, Shiu said, which he said compared poorly to Hong Kong's minimum wage of HK$37.50 per hour.
""This is not an incentive payment - this is a disincentive,"" said Shiu, himself a prison laborer when he was jailed for five months last year over his role in Hong Kong's 2014 pro-democracy protests.
The prison official said about 100 women prisoners work six days a week, for shifts of six to 10 hours, sometimes at night, and earn about HK$25 to HK$200 per week, depending on their skills or exact work.
About 1,200 retired or off-duty prison officers are also working to produce the masks, the government said.
Prisoners around the world have been put to work for centuries, although the United Nations guidelines stipulate that inmates should not be held in slavery and deserve a fair wage and decent work conditions."

The accident killed all 157 people aboard when the new Boeing 737 MAX plunged into farmland six minutes after taking off from the capital. It was the second accident involving the 737 MAX in five months and led to the plane being grounded worldwide.
People from 33 nations were aboard Flight 302 and hundreds of relatives and friends from across the world traveled to Ethiopia for the memorial. Separate events were scheduled at embassies, the United Nations and the pilots' association. 
Families from nations including Canada, the United States, Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, Italy and France attended the ceremony at the crash site, which is about a three-hour drive from the capital, Addis Ababa. 
Organizers say the program included a tree planting and the reading out of victims' names. Police set up a roadblock a kilometer from the site to prevent the public from attending the event. 
The 737 MAX, Boeing's best-selling aircraft, remains grounded. The plane maker has lost billions of dollars since the Ethiopian crash and an October 2018 accident involving Indonesia's Lion Air, which killed all 189 people aboard. 
Boeing's CEO was forced to step down and the company is facing hundreds of lawsuits from bereaved families.
Monday's interim report from Ethiopia's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau bolstered the findings of Ethiopia's initial assessment, which linked the crash to the plane's MCAS anti-stall software.
It identified no issues with the airline or the pilots' handling of the plane, which crashed shortly after take-off.
Inaccurate sensor readings activated the plane's MCAS anti-stall system, pushing the nose of the aircraft lower as the pilots struggled to control it, the report said.

ROME (Reuters) - It's hard being a Catholic in Italy these days.
You can walk into a church but you can't cross yourself with holy water because the font is dry. You can't get baptized or married in a church and you can't even have a funeral.
Just about the only thing a person can do in a church in Italy is pray - but at least a pew away from someone else.
Overwhelmingly Catholic Italy is adapting to religion in a time of coronavirus after a clampdown across the entire country was imposed to slow Europe's worst outbreak.
Last Saturday, the Italian government issued a decree locking down much of the north, where the virus first broke out, and severely restricted indoor activities in the rest of the country.
So on Sunday, Father Riccardo Lamba of the parish of San Ponziano, in a modern Rome neighborhood, took matters into his own hands. He moved the Mass outdoors and said it from the steps of his modern church.
About 70 parishioners sat on plastic chairs with space between them and those who stood did so in formation as if they were about to take a gym class.
The government later took measures restricting outdoor gatherings. Lamba said he has not decided what he will do this Sunday.
""We are praying. Many people are entering the church to pray during the day but trying to keep apart,"" he said on Tuesday.
His parish is not alone. Even St. Peter's Basilica was eerily almost empty on Tuesday after the Vatican said only faithful who wanted to pray would be allowed in. Tourists and guided groups would not be allowed until at least April 3.
""We are living day to day to see what happens. Sometimes the government changes its mind in a matter of hours,"" Lamba said. ""Thank God the hard-core faithful can watch a Mass on TV.""
Church weddings have been blocked until at least April 3. The trickle down effect has hit the wedding planner industry on the cusp of spring, its high season.
""We have closed the office for now and have to wait and see how things develop,"" said Sabrina Bucci, head of Esclusivevent, which organizes weddings in Rome's churches and receptions in an ancient villa with a view of the dome of St. Peter's Basilica.
She said five weddings had been postponed indefinitely.
The coronavirus crisis has also changed the way Catholics say farewell to their dearly departed.
Since funerals in churches have been banned, bodies are being taken directly to cemeteries either from hospitals or homes, denying families a traditional rite of passage that brings people together.
""This morning's funeral could not be held. A priest came to the home to bless the body and we took it directly to the cemetery,"" said Stefano Chiericoni, head of one of Rome's best-known undertakers.
""We are doing what the health authorities are telling us to do and, in any case, we are wearing masks and protective gowns,"" he said."

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - A Turkish prosecutor said on Tuesday a U.S. consulate employee should be acquitted on charges of espionage and trying to overthrow the government, but should face jail on a lesser charge of belonging to a terrorist organization.
The prosecutor told an Istanbul court that the evidence did not back up the original charges against Metin Topuz, who has been in jail for nearly 2-1/2 years while facing trial.
Topuz's trial has been one of many sources of strain between NATO allies Turkey and the United States, who have also been at odds in recent years over policy differences in Syria and Turkey's purchase of Russian missile defense systems.
In a 78-page indictment that includes telephone calls, text messages and CCTV images, Topuz is accused of links to officials who led a 2013 corruption investigation and were later found to be members of a network blamed for a failed 2016 military coup.
The investigation implicated officials in the government of then-prime minister, now President Tayyip Erdogan.
The prosecutor said the frequent contact Topuz had with members of Fethullah Gulen's network taking part in the investigation showed he was a member of the group, which is considered a terrorist organization by Ankara.
He requested that Topuz be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison, compared to a life sentence that he could have received if found guilty on the original charges.
The court rejected a request by defense lawyers for Topuz's release and postponed the trial until June 11, according to one of the defense lawyers.
A translator and fixer for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) at the U.S. consulate in Istanbul, Topuz has maintained throughout the trial that he contacted the individuals, who at the time held high-ranking positions in the police and judiciary, as part of his job.
Gulen has lived in self-imposed exile in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania since 1999, and has denied any involvement in the coup attempt."

Marchers held mass protests in November and December to demand a laundry list of actions from President Ivan Duque's right-wing government, on everything from the murders of human rights activists to youth unemployment.
Duque's administration has been meeting with representatives of the protesters since, in talks hailed as a success by the government. Dissatisfied major unions and students groups will hold a new national strike on March 25.
Though marches last year were largely peaceful, in several instances, police beat protesters and used crowd-control weapons inappropriately, advocacy group HRW said.
""We have gathered worrying accounts and evidence of abuses by Colombia's police, including arbitrary detention and brutal beatings against peaceful protesters, detainees, and bystanders,"" said Jose Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch said in a statement.
""President Duque should send a clear message that these violations will not be tolerated and the authorities should ensure that those responsible for violations are held to account.""
The national police did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
HRW said it interviewed 26 victims of police abuse and met with officials to discuss the cases.
It specially cited the death of teenager Dilan Cruz, fatally injured by a projectile fired by riot police. Cruz's death became a rallying cry for many marchers, who have demanded the riot force be dissolved.
The country's procurator asked the squad to stop using the weapon that killed Cruz, but HRW said the head of police told them in late January the force continues to use the weapon.
Colombia uses weapons reviewed by the United Nations to control disturbances during protests, the defense ministry said at the time of Cruz's death.
The Colombia government expelled 61 foreign nationals, all but one Venezuelan, in connection with the protests, the report said.
""Some of these expulsions appear to be arbitrary,"" it added.
The government said at the time the Venezuelans had been involved in vandalism.
Rumors blaming migrants for violence and looting sparked an increase in xenophobia following the protests.
Though the demonstrations were largely peaceful, more than 300 police were injured and the cities of Bogota and Cali put in place the first curfew in a generation to curtail isolated looting and the widespread destruction of public transport stations."

President Tayyip Erdogan, whose decision on Feb. 28 to open Turkey's border to migrants wishing to leave triggered the crisis at the border, repeated on Tuesday his call for EU member state Greece to let the people through.
In a briefing to reporters on the border, Greek officials said 963 people had been prevented from illegally crossing into Greece between 6 a.m. on Monday and 6 a.m. on Tuesday, with 52 of them arrested. 
The arrested included migrants from Syria, Afghanistan and Iran, the officials said. 
Greek military vehicles and soldiers on foot continued to patrol along the wire and steel fence that separates Greece's Kastanies crossing from Turkey's border post at Pazarkule.
A Greek military band marched close to the Pazarkule crossing playing the Greek national anthem, a reminder of the nationalist passions the crisis has unleashed on both sides.
Greek security forces say they have stopped some 42,000 people from trying to enter Greek territory since the migrants flocked to the border from all over Turkey after Erdogan's decision to open the border.
That decision appeared designed to put pressure on the EU to offer more financial support to Ankara to handle the 3.6 million migrants it has absorbed from Middle East conflicts and provide the NATO ally with more backing for its role in Syria.

In Brussels, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Charles Michel told Erdogan on Monday he needed to pull the migrants back from the border before the EU would consider further support for Turkey.

BERLIN (Reuters) - The first trial of suspected members of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's security services for crimes against humanity, including torturing and killing opposition activists, will start next month, a German court said on Tuesday.
In a move welcomed by campaigners as sending a signal to those affected by oppression in Syria, German prosecutors have used universal jurisdiction laws that allow them to prosecute crimes against humanity committed anywhere in the world.
The court in the western city of Koblenz said it had given the green light to a trial starting on April 23.
The first suspect, identified under Germany's privacy rules only as Anwar R., 57, is charged with 58 murders, at least one rape and multiple sexual assaults in a Damascus prison where at least 4,000 opposition activists were tortured in 2011 and 2012.
Victims were believed to have been beaten, kicked and given electric shocks by interrogators trying to extract information about the opposition movement, the court said in a statement.
In addition, prisoners were believed to have been refused medical treatment, underfed and confined to overfull cells where there was no room to sit down.
Prosecutors say Anwar R. oversaw interrogations before leaving Syria in 2012. He arrived in Germany in 2014.
The second suspect, Eyad A., 43, is charged with facilitating the torture of at least 30 opposition activists arrested after an anti-Assad demonstration in 2011. He arrived in Germany in April 2018.
Efforts to prosecute members of Assad's government have failed because Syria is not a signatory to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Russia and China have also vetoed attempts to set up a Syria special tribunal.
However, lawyers in Europe have collected testimony from survivors among the hundreds of thousands of Syrians who have sought refuge to prosecute members of Assad's government.
The European Centre for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), which is supporting 16 Syrians in the proceedings, welcomed the trial.
""The trial in Koblenz is an important step, if only a beginning on the long road to justice,"" said Patrick Kroker, head of the ECCHR's Syria project.
""Our goal is to bring to justice high-ranking members of Assad's security apparatus who are responsible for torture, sexual violence, executions and the disappearance of tens of thousands of people in Syria,"" he added.
The suspects, in detention, were arrested in Feb. 2019. The court set trial dates through to Aug. 13, but said there may be more beyond that."

BAGHDAD (Reuters) - They survived censorship under Saddam Hussein and the years of violence that followed his downfall, so the booksellers of Baghdad are not too worried by coronavirus.
Iraqi authorities have urged people to avoid public gatherings and ordered cafes to close as virus cases have hit 67, mainly blamed on travelers from Iran.
Yet the booksellers of Mutanabbi Street on the banks of the River Tigris are still meeting their customers to do business and discuss politics in the usual way.
Some cultural events have been canceled but writers, musicians and painters still flock there on Fridays, gathering near the imposing statue of Mutanabbi, the 10th century poet after whom the street is named.
Numbers are down due to the virus and months of violent anti-government street protests, but staying at home is not an option for hard-core book lovers, even if it does mean wearing a face mask.
""I have been coming here every Friday since the 80s when I was a student,"" said Jawad al Bidhani, a university professor, who bought four academic books.
""The disease is dangerous and fatal. But this won't prevent us coming to Mutanabbi Street. So we take the opportunity to sit here with our friends for an hour or two,"" he said.
The market, where books are brought on trolleys from store-rooms in nearby buildings to be displayed on tables in the street, is a barometer of intellectual life.
The city's literary tradition is summed up in the saying: ""Cairo writes. Beirut prints. Baghdad reads.""
Choices were limited under Saddam, who banned anything critical. After he fell, political and religious literature was popular, but tastes are changing as Iraqis lose confidence in a political system many see as corrupt.
""There is little demand for political books, also not religious books,"" said Hamza Abu Sara, a bookseller. ""People buy more self-help books ... to be positive, or fiction,"" he said.
An economic crisis has hit sales, but Saraa al-Bayati, the book market's only female trader, is not thinking of closing.
""We are doing kind of okay,"" she said in the one-room shop where she sells her own publications and works in translation.
Her bookshop is her dream. Her family would not let her study journalism at university, deeming the job too dangerous in turbulent Iraq.
She graduated in engineering but decided to found a publishing house. ""I simply love books,"" she said."

MADRID (Reuters) - Parents across the Madrid region scrambled for ways to cope with a two-week shutdown of schools starting Wednesday in the hope of stemming the spread of coronavirus, while authorities prepared to carry out daily disinfection of the metro network.
Confirmed infections have risen over the past week by 17 to 782 in the capital region, and to more than 1,200 in the country as a whole over the same period. Twenty-one people have died from coronavirus in Madrid, among more than 30 nationwide.
""It was chaos yesterday when I learnt about it. The phone started ringing and we started to see how we could organize ourselves. Thank God both the father and myself can work from home,"" said Ester Force as she dropped her child at a Madrid primary school.
The closure of schools - from kindergarten to universities - in Madrid, Spain's most populous region, will affect at least 1.53 million pupils and students, regional authorities said.
""It's a pain in the neck, but we'll have to trust the health authorities who we understand have done what's best for society,"" said Enrique Lopez, who also has a child in primary school.
In some schools' WhatsApp groups, several parents pointed out what they saw as the inconsistency of closing schools and keeping the subway or swimming pools open.
Schools have also been closed in the northern Basque region capital Vitoria-Gasteiz, and in the Rioja wine-growing region which alone was reporting 102 cases of coronavirus.
Spanish far-right lawmaker Ortega Smith was diagnosed with coronavirus and the party said all its parliamentarians would be working from home until further notice. It asked for parliamentary sessions to be suspended.
Madrid's public transport network will be disinfected every day as a precautionary measure, regional authorities said. Some 2.3 million trips are made daily in the Madrid metro.
Amid signs in some supermarkets that people were starting to hoard essential goods, causing long queues, for fear of suddenly being confined to their homes, the  Carrefour  (PA:CARR) chain issued a tweet to say its shops were open as usual.
""We are working with our staff and providers to guarantee the availability of products for our clients,"" Carrefour said.
Major sports were also affected. All of Spain's La Liga football matches will be played behind closed doors for at least two weeks, the top soccer league said.
European Union leaders planned emergency talks in a video conference call on Tuesday afternoon to discuss a joint response to the virus outbreak. Italy is the hardest-hit EU country, with a nationwide lockdown, 9,172 cases and 463 deaths.

Finance Minister Nadia Calvino, speaking to TVE broadcaster, declined to give an estimate of the impact the epidemic could have on growth in the euro zone's fourth-largest economy.
""Rather than devote my energy to say if it will be a tenth (of GDP growth percentage point) or two, we will focus on ... minimizing the economic impact and helping the companies and sectors that could be most affected,"" Calvino said.
The government is expected to start unveiling a package of measures at a weekly cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Steps could include credit lines for small- and medium-sized firms as well as measures to help parents cope with school shutdowns.
""What we want is that companies, depending on their activity, make it easy for workers to meet their family obligations and not necessarily have to be present at workplaces,"" government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero told Cadena Ser radio.

Unidas Podemos, which is part of the government coalition together with Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez's PSOE, had together with other smaller left-wing parties called for an inquiry into reports by Switzerland's La Tribune de Geneve.
La Tribune wrote last week that Juan Carlos, who was king at the time, received $100 million dollar from Saudi Arabia's king 12 years ago, and later gave $65 million to Corinna zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, a businesswoman whose close relation with Juna Carlos led to his abdication in 2014.
According to La Tribune de Geneve, which cited unnamed sources, a Swiss prosecutor's office is investigating the origin of the bank transfer to zu Sayn-Wittgenstein, which it said came via a foundation in Panama.
The king's office, the Geneva prosecutor's office and representatives for zu Sayn Wittgenstein declined to comment on the matter.
According to a statement sent to EFE news agency by zu Sayn Wittgenstein's lawyer Robin Rathmell, she ""received an unsolicited gift"" from Juan Carlos for her and her son.
""The donation was clearly documented as a gift, and professional services firms and banks performed the necessary compliance and due diligence on the funds,"" the lawyer was quoted as saying.
The Socialists opposed the investigation on the grounds that the Spanish Constitution gives the king blanket immunity, describing him as ""inviolable.""
""I am surprised that there are political parties that are again asking for a committee of inquiry when they know that there is no constitutional room for it"", said Adriana Lastra, the Socialists' spokeswoman in parliament.
Parliament's governing body rejected the proposal for an investigation with the votes against from PSOE, and parties on the right - People's Party and Vox - after the lawyers of the House advised against its legality.
The parties who asked for the inquiry are allies of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, instrumental for him to stay in power and pass laws.
""These are the differences that we are clear about between the two parties. They are spoken and agreed discrepancies, so they are not going to mean a break from the government,"" a Podemos spokesman said."

TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Orders for all visitors arriving in Israel to self-isolate for two weeks could be eased if the coronavirus outbreak begins to spread locally en masse, one of the country's epidemic management team said on Tuesday.
They may need to be replaced by other measures such as changing practices at schools and workplaces, said Ran Balicer, chief innovation officer for Clalit Health Services, Israel's biggest healthcare provider.
Israel has so far reported 50 cases of the virus after testing thousands of people. There have been no fatalities.
Full containment is not possible in the long term, Balicer told Reuters by phone. He himself has been in home isolation since returning from a trip to Germany.
""We know this is bound to eventually fail and we are only trying to delay as much as possible this kind of massive dissemination,"" he said.
At some point the travel restrictions will not be necessary and the moderate social distancing currently in place will not suffice, he said. Authorities will instead use ""more disruptive efforts such as interfering in school and work"".
Balicer noted that Israel's conditions were unique, with only one major airport, Ben Gurion International near Tel Aviv, and relatively limited movement across borders.
In Ramallah in the neighboring occupied West Bank, Palestinian authorities ordered cafes and restaurants closed as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the territory's 26 positive cases.
Until this week all the cases in Israel were linked to foreign travel. But the case of an infected ambulance driver suggests community spread may be starting.
El Al Israel Airlines has already suspended routes, announced layoffs and warned of a drop in revenue. The airport has moved international travel into a single terminal and hotels have issued profit warnings.
On Tuesday, the arrivals board at Ben Gurion showed canceled flights from countries with restrictions, and outgoing travelers wore facemasks as they filed through near-empty security checks.
In some parts of the concourse the robot floor cleaner was the only thing moving.
Some arriving home were caught unawares by the new measures.
“We landed in Israel and we heard from the news that we need to be two weeks in our homes, nobody told us here in the airport,” said Tom Yatzkan, 27, an Israeli student returning from Bulgaria. “It’s very sad because we are not going to work or study, but that's life."""

In the first day of voting on a series of proposed constitutional amendments, lawmakers vetoed changes backed by the ruling party that would have altered the 2008 charter drafted by the former ruling military junta.
The rejected amendments would have gradually reduced the number of military MPs, over a period of 15 years, and abolished a section that names the commander-in-chief of the defense services as the ""supreme commander of all armed forces"".
The constitution guarantees military members of parliament a quarter of the seats in the legislature. Any changes to the charter require the approval of more than two thirds of lawmakers, giving the army an effective veto.
A spokesman for Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) did not answer telephone calls seeking comment. A government spokesman declined to answer questions.
Lawmakers also rejected removing the word ""disciplined"" from the definition of the country's political system as a ""genuine, disciplined multi-party democratic system"".
But they approved an amendment that would allow civil servants to belong to political parties.
Nobel laureate Suu Kyi has been under pressure to show progress on constitutional reform - seen as a major stumbling block to democratic hopes – ahead of a general election expected later this year.
She took power in 2016 after a landslide election win, vowing to continue democratic reforms that began in 2011 and end the country’s long-running civil wars.
Since then, the administration has come under foreign pressure over a 2017 military crackdown against the Rohingya minority, as well as escalating ethnic conflict. 
Myanmar has been accused of genocide at the International Court of Justice in the Hague but denies the charges, saying it was carrying out a legitimate campaign against Rohingya militants who attacked police posts.
Voting on other proposed amendments will continue until March 20, although analysts say the military veto means they are unlikely to pass.

Key sections the NLD aim to reform include one that blocks Suu Kyi from the presidency on account of her foreign-born children, who are British citizens.

1268,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 07:00AM ET</span>","South African court clears Ramaphosa of misleading parliament, money-laundering alleged by graft watchdog","JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South Africa's High Court on Tuesday cleared President Cyril Ramaphosa of lying to parliament about the source of donations to his 2017 campaign to lead the ruling party, setting aside a potentially damaging report by a powerful anti-graft watchdog.
The high court judges described the watchdog's approach as based on a mistaken and ""fatally flawed"" reading of the law.
The case was seen by many analysts as a proxy of the bitter power rivalry inside the ANC between supporters of Ramaphosa and his scandal-plagued predecessor Jacob Zuma.
Public Protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane had alleged in July that Ramaphosa deliberately misled parliament about the 500,000 rand ($32,500) donation for his campaign to succeed Jacob Zuma as head of the ruling African National Congress (ANC).
In her report she said there was also prima facie evidence of money laundering involving millions of rand in the handling of the donations, sparking an angry response from Ramaphosa, who swiftly challenged the legality and motivation of the report.
The high court, in a sitting of three justices, concurred with Ramaphosa's complaint.
""It is apparent from the report that the Public Protector was confused about the legal foundation of her finding,"" said Keoagile Elias Matojane.
""The Public Protector's finding on the issue of misleading parliament is fatally flawed due to a material error of law."" 
The court added that there was no evidence to support the allegation of money laundering and that it was also outside of the watchdog's jurisdiction to investigate the donations as they were of a private, and not public, nature.
The finding against Mkhwebane's conduct, which includes the award of costs for Ramaphosa's lawyers, is likely to bolster calls for her removal from office by opposition parties.

PESHAWAR/KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban sent vehicles for fighters set to be released by the Afghan government in a prisoner swap expected to be announced on Tuesday, and were ready to honor their side of the deal by handing over 1,000 government troops, militant leaders said.
The expected release is part of a deal signed by the United States and the Taliban last month that would allow U.S. forces and NATO troops to withdraw from Afghanistan to end more than 18 years of war.
The Taliban have demanded the release of the prisoners as a confidence-building measure to pave the way for the opening of direct talks between the government and the insurgents after talks with the both sides and the United States individually.
A senior Taliban leader in Doha, the group's political headquarters, said vehicles had been sent to an area near Bagram Prison to fetch the freed fighters.
However, a government source said any release was likely not to be in the coming days, but could be weeks away.
The issue has become one of the biggest sticking points in any progress toward peace, complicated further by differing wording of documents between the United States and the Taliban and the United States and the Afghan government. 
""The Taliban needs this to show to their rank and file. For the foot soldiers on the ground, a reduction in violence agreement, a troop withdrawal agreement signed in Doha means nothing, fighters returning is something they can feel,"" said an Asian diplomat in Kabul. 
The senior Taliban leader said: ""After our conversation with Zalmay Khalilzad on Monday, in which he conveyed to us the release of our 5,000 prisoners, we sent vehicles to pick them up."" 
Khalilzad, U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan, attended the swearing-in ceremony of Ashraf Ghani as president on Monday. Ghani had previously rejected the Taliban demand for its fighters to be released.
DECREE EXPECTED
It was unclear whether prisoners would be released from other prisons aside from Bagram, a detention facility located next to a U.S. military base.
It was also not known how many prisoners would be released immediately, but three sources told Reuters on Monday that it could vary between 1,000 and 1,800. 
A senior government official, who declined to be named, said: ""In principle we have agreed to release prisoners in order to show our commitment toward bringing peace in Afghanistan but in what conditions the government is going to release them and how many, will be in the decree later this afternoon."" 
But he added that the release would not be on Tuesday or Wednesday but could be ""within weeks or months"".
The U.S. Embassy declined to comment. A spokesman for NATO's mission referred questions to the Afghan government. 
Abdul Shukoor Qudoosi, governor of Bagram district, said his office had reports of an unusual arrival of multiple buses in the area, but they could not confirm what the buses were for and whether they were connected to the release.
The Taliban leader in Doha also confirmed the group had finalised arrangements for the release of 1,000 prisoners held by them, adding that they had shifted all prisoners to safe locations in Afghanistan.
""We are planning to release the 1,000 prisoners of the Afghan government to the Red Crescent and they could then shift them to their hometowns or pay them cash for traveling home,"" he said.

An official Taliban spokesman said he could not comment as he had yet to be informed of the plans.

The apology addressed the violence by Dutch forces during the period from Indonesia's declaration of independence in 1945 until 1949, when the Netherlands recognized it as an independent nation.
""I would like to express my regret and apologize for excessive violence on the part of the Dutch in those years,"" King Willem-Alexander said at the presidential palace in Bogor during a visit to Indonesia.
""I do so in the full realization that the pain and sorrow of the families affected continue to be felt today,"" he said in his speech, a copy of which was posted on the website of the Royal House of the Netherlands.
The Dutch government has previously apologized to Indonesia and paid some damages to survivors for violence carried out during colonial rule.
In 2011, Tjeerd de Zwaan, then the Dutch ambassador, apologized for killings in 1947 in a village in the province of West Java. Two years later, de Zwaan also apologized for killings in 1947 on the island of Sulawesi.
Last year, a Dutch appeals court in the Hague ordered the hearing of a lawsuit by five Indonesians who hold the Netherlands responsible for the execution of their fathers by Dutch soldiers in 1947.
During the four-day trip, the king and his wife Queen Maxima are set to visit the ancient capital of Yogyakarta and the Sebangau National Park in Indonesia's province of Central Kalimantan on Borneo, according to the royal website.
In his speech, the king also offered condolences for seven people killed when two boats collided in Central Kalimantan during preparations for the royal visit.

In an interview with state-owned Anadolu news agency, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said that European Union visa liberalization and an update of the country's customs union with the bloc must be implemented to help solve the migrant issue.
Late on Monday, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan left meetings in Brussels with EU and NATO leaders without issuing a joint statement nor appearing at a joint news conference, as had been planned.
Erdogan made the trip to Brussels as a dispute deepened over the fate of tens of thousands of migrants trying to enter EU-member Greece. Ankara decided last month to encourage the migration to extract more European support and funding in its military effort in Syria's Idlib region. 
Turkey hosts 3.6 million Syrian migrants and has stemmed migration to Europe under the 2016 deal in return for billions of euros in aid. But it has become frustrated with what it regards as too little European support over the war in Syria, where its troops faced off against Russian-backed government forces.

The pact also envisaged the EU taking in thousands of Syrian refugees directly from camps in Turkey, rewarding Turks with visa-free travel to the bloc, faster progress in EU membership talks and upgrading their customs union.

Truong Duy Nhat was arrested in Vietnam last year after disappearing in Thailand, fanning fears that officials in Southeast Asian countries have been cooperating to track down and arrest each others' exiled dissidents.
The Hanoi People's Court said Nhat abused his position as the branch head of a state news outlet to help a disgraced business tycoon illegally acquire land from 2003 to 2004, the Ministry of Public Security said after Monday's trial.
It was not immediately clear who was defending Nhat at the trial. Telephone calls to the Hanoi People's Court went unanswered on Tuesday.
The sale of the plot, which was under the control of the Danang branch of the state-run Dai Doan Ket newspaper, caused losses of 13 billion dong ($561,000), the ministry said in its statement.
Nhat, who is also a contributor to Washington-based Radio Free Asia (RFA), had already served a two-year prison term after a 2014 trial over accusations of ""abusing democratic freedoms to infringe upon the interests of the state"", the ministry said.
The statement did not refer to any of Nhat's journalism or his contributions to RFA or its website, which remains blocked in Vietnam.
In an emailed statement, RFA said Nhat's lawyer was convicted of tax evasion in November 2019.
The president of RFA, Bay Fang, condemned the sentence.
""This miscarriage of justice only reinforces RFA's mission to provide the people of Vietnam with uncensored perspectives, and accurate news and information,"" RFA quoted Fang as saying in the statement.
Phan Van Anh Vu, a business tycoon accused of collusion with Nhat, had fled to Singapore seeking passage to Germany, but was arrested in Vietnam in early 2018.
He was sentenced to a total of at least 66 years in jail at several trials on separate charges ranging from deliberate disclosure of state secrets to abuse of power to acquire property and violations of state asset management rules."

The two-day spring festival is a rowdy explosion of color, with people smearing each other's faces with green, yellow and red powder.
But the coronavirus, which has infected nearly 40 people in India, looks set to spoil the fun this year.
""Avoid participating in large gatherings,"" the Ministry of Health said in notice warning of the danger of the virus, while wishing everyone a ""Happy and Safe Holi"".
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has said he would not celebrate Holi this year. Shopkeepers said rumors that the colored powders and dyes revelers use in the festival were imported from China had hurt their sales.
The virus originated in China late last year.
""Customers are down by at least 50 to 60%,"" said Suresh Singh, a shopkeeper in Lucknow, the capital of the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, who sells the powders and dyes.

1281,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 10, 2020 03:13AM ET</span>","Over beer and herrings, CDU's eastern faithful spurn Merkel 2.0","By Joseph Nasr
APOLDA, Germany (Reuters) - In a beer hall in eastern Germany, locals are toasting the man they are counting on to see out Chancellor Angela Merkel and her brand of liberal conservatism.
Friedrich Merz, whose line on Syrian asylum-seekers is ""we can't accept you here"", goes down well with his audience as he campaigns to succeed Merkel as leader of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and possibly the country.
Merz's promise to shift the CDU to the right is as popular as the beer and herrings laid on to accompany his pitch to a party rally in the town of Apolda.
The CDU veteran is locked in a battle for the party's soul with Armin Laschet, a centrist offering continuity after Merkel steps down in time for the next election, due by October 2021.
The CDU plans to pick a new leader at a special congress on April 25, with Merz currently leading Laschet in the polls by 35% to 24%.
At stake is Germany's reputation - personified by Merkel - as Europe's champion of the post-war liberal order, an issue now being blurred by the CDU's domestic preoccupation with the rise of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).
Whoever wins the CDU leadership faces the daunting challenge of uniting the party.
""Laschet is Merkel 2.0,"" said Axel Zimmermann, 51, a bank clerk and one of 1,500 supporters who gave Merz a standing ovation at the beer hall rally in Apolda, a small, left-behind town in the eastern German state of Thuringia.
""Laschet will win elections and compromise to build coalitions, but he won't be able to unite the CDU,"" Zimmermann said. ""Merz will take the CDU to the right. This will unite the CDU and weaken the AfD. What's the point of winning elections if your party is falling apart?""
Straight-talking Merz, a 64-year-old lawyer, offers a socially conservative, pro-business pitch that appeals to the CDU's core of mainly western, Catholic men who see Merkel - a Protestant from the east - as an anomaly.
Earlier this month Merz had a simple message for Syrian refugees who may be hoping to leave Turkey: ""There is no point in coming to Germany.""
That strikes a chord in Thuringia, where Merkel's decision in 2015 to open Germany's borders to a million refugees fleeing war in the Middle East fueled the rise of the nationalist AfD.
By contrast, Laschet, 59, is making a more inclusive offer and last month won the support of Health Minister Jens Spahn, who appeals to some on the CDU's more conservative wing, as a running mate.
""The CDU is bigger than either one of us, this is about the future of our country and the CDU,"" said Spahn, adding it was time to build bridges within the party.
'PARTY IN CRISIS'
Germany's most successful political party since the end of World War Two is now struggling to find a way forward after many of its voters have fled to the far-right AfD and the leftist Greens.
Merkel's supporters, who back Laschet, premier of Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, fear that any shift to the right will cost the CDU dearly at the ballot box.
They point to the Greens, now the second most popular party in opinion polls, as the main threat to the CDU, and say the conservatives should stick to the middle-ground strategy that has handed Merkel's party four straight election victories.
But Merz's supporters say Germany desperately needs a distinctively conservative party to counter the AfD, to which the CDU has lost most voters.
""We have a crisis and this is that we don't know what we stand for anymore,"" said Christian Sitter of the Werte Union, or Values Union, an ultra-conservative grouping in Merkel's conservative bloc, which has ruled with the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) during 11 of the chancellor's 15 years in power.
""Merkel has been more interested in surviving as chancellor than in uniting the party,"" added Sitter. ""To survive she cut wishy-washy deals with the SPD and silenced the conservative wing. Now we are saying we want to be heard again.""
The debate over what the CDU stands for and its position vis-à-vis the AfD came to a head in Thuringia last month, when CDU lawmakers sided with the AfD to elect a new state premier, shattering the post-war consensus among established parties of shunning the far right.
So great was the resulting controversy that the newly elected premier quit after a few days and Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who defeated Merz to win the CDU leadership in December 2018, abandoned her ambitions to run for chancellor.
Her authority crushed, Kramp-Karrenbauer decided to step down - opening the way for Merz and Laschet to duke it out.
""We have two choices: more of the same or a new start,"" Merz said to loud applause in Apolda. ""And we choose a new start."""

SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has started charging visitors for coronavirus treatment, the city-state said as it reported new imported infections involving people who had traveled from neighboring Indonesia.
Indonesia, the world's fourth-most populous country, reported its first virus case earlier this month and officially has just 19 infections compared to 160 in Singapore. Disease experts have questioned how many cases could be going undiagnosed in Indonesia. 
Singapore's new measures announced late Monday came into effect on March 7, when authorities said two symptomatic Indonesian travelers arrived in Singapore. 
Both had reported coronavirus symptoms in Indonesia before arriving in Singapore. One had previously sought treatment at a hospital in Indonesia's capital Jakarta.
Another case involved a Singaporean who had visited her sister in Indonesia who had pneumonia.
The health ministry did not say whether its new stance on payment for treatment related to specific cases.
""In view of the rising number of COVID-19 infections globally, and the expected rise in the number of confirmed cases in Singapore, we will need to prioritise the resources at our public hospitals,"" the health ministry said in a statement.
Foreigners who are short-term visit pass holders who seek treatment for COVID-19 in Singapore need to pay but testing for the virus remains free.
Treatment of severe respiratory infections in Singapore public hospitals typically cost between S$6,000 - S$8,000 ($4,300-5,800), according to the Ministry of Health's website. 
Of 33 imported cases reported by Singapore to date, 24 involve travel to China - where the virus first surfaced late last year - three to Indonesia and the others to Italy, Britain, France and Germany. 
Singapore has also determined that some of its local cases had travel history to Indonesia.
Researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in the United States, said in a study last month Indonesia's lack of confirmed cases at that time ""may suggest the potential for undetected cases"", urging authorities there to strengthen outbreak surveillance and control.

""Are they (Indonesia) lucky or are they missing cases? It’s a little bit hard to say...but it’s certainly got people asking the question,"" said Dale Fisher, a Singapore-based diseases expert who chairs the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network coordinated by the World Health Organisation.

OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Weary passengers aboard a cruise ship idled at sea for days by a coronavirus outbreak erupted in cheers on Monday as the vessel sailed into San Francisco Bay en route to the Port of Oakland and the next, unexpected phase of their voyage - two weeks of quarantine.
The 2,400 passengers, who have been largely confined to their staterooms since Thursday, were to begin disembarking on Monday for transport to quarantine stations or hospitals, depending on whether they are well or need immediate medical attention.
Except for those with acute illness, the 1,100 crew members are to remain aboard the Grand Princess, which will depart the Port of Oakland as soon as possible to be quarantined for two weeks in an as-yet undisclosed location outside San Francisco Bay, officials said.
Video footage shot by one of the arriving cruise guests and shared with Reuters showed jubilant passengers cheering from their stateroom balconies and open windows, some shouting, ""We're home!"" as the vessel passed beneath the Golden Gate Bridge into the bay.
Twenty-one people aboard the ship, mostly crew, tested positive on Friday for coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19, in an initial round of diagnostic screenings performed on about 45 people with symptoms.
The remaining passengers are to be tested and monitored for signs and symptoms of the illness that can lead to pneumonia once they reach their designated quarantine sites.
Denise Stoneham, 52, a Bay area resident on the cruise with her husband, seemed to take the ordeal in stride as she spoke to Reuters by Facetime while the ship glided into the port.
""It hasn't been too much of a hardship for us; it's just been more of an inconvenience, I guess,"" she said. ""We're just anxious to get home.""
Princess Cruises, owner-operator of the ship, announced that passengers would receive a full refund for the price of the cruise, including air travel, hotel, ground transportation and pre-paid shore excursions.
The company also offered patrons credit for a future cruise equal to the fare paid for the voyage.
But at least one couple aboard the Grand Princess were seeking more than a refund.
In what was believed to be the first civil case stemming from the cruise outbreak, Ronald and Eva Weissberger of Broward County, Florida, sued the cruise line for more than $1 million, saying they were traumatized by the fear of developing coronavirus.
Parent company Carnival Corp (N:CCL), the world's leading cruise operator, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
LINKS TO PREVIOUS CRUISE
The Grand Princess was first denied entry to San Francisco Bay on Wednesday as it sailed back from Hawaii after state and local health authorities learned that some passengers and crew had developed flu-like symptoms, and that guests from an earlier cruise to Mexico aboard the same ship later tested positive for coronavirus.
Health authorities have said at least two, including a California man who died, probably contracted the virus aboard the vessel. Since then, a total of 12 coronavirus cases have been linked to the previous Mexico trip.
California Governor Gavin Newsom had insisted the current cruise be halted and the ship kept at sea until individuals aboard who were sick could be tested, and diagnostic kits were flown to the ocean liner by helicopter on Thursday.
But it took federal, state and local authorities until Sunday to decide on a return-to-port strategy and quarantine plan for the ship, and to work out logistics of keeping the ship and everyone board isolated from the general public.
The U.S. Coast Guard flew medical teams to the vessel on Sunday to assess the health of passengers and crew ahead of their arrival.
Under plans announced on Sunday, California residents were to go to two existing quarantine sites near Sacramento and San Diego. Out-of-state residents will be transported to two quarantine stations in Texas and Georgia.
Newsom said on Sunday the government was arranging to repatriate foreign cruise passengers by charter flights to their home countries. He said they would be ferried on special buses to a non-commercial terminal at Oakland International Airport.
The Port of Oakland, located across San Francisco Bay from the vessel's home berth, was chosen because it was one of the few in the region able to accommodate a large cruise liner and was deemed relatively easy to seal off while passengers are unloaded and moved elsewhere, Newsom said.
Princess Cruises also owns the Diamond Princess, which was quarantined off Japan in February and was for a time the largest cluster of coronavirus cases outside of China, where the outbreak originated. About 700 people aboard that ship became infected, and six have died."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea was on alert on Tuesday for coronavirus infections in small clusters such as workplaces and dance classes, as a downward trend in new cases raised hopes that Asia's biggest outbreak outside mainland China may be slowing.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 35 new coronavirus cases, down from the peak of 909 on Feb. 29. The new data brought the national tally to 7,513, and the death toll rose by three to 54. The numbers are expected to be updated later on Tuesday.
The daily rate of new infections in South Korea fell to its lowest level in 11 days on Monday as most of the roughly 200,000 followers of a fringe Christian church at the center of the nation's epidemic have been tested.
""The rate of increase is declining but there are still many new cases"", Yoon Tae-ho, director general for public health policy at the health ministry, told a briefing.
""We need to pay attention to crowded workplaces including call centers. The cooperation of business owners is essential as they shouldn't let employees come in if they show symptoms like fever.""
New cases over the past few days include about 40 call-center workers for an insurance company in Seoul, prompting the city government to launch a probe into other similar offices.
""This is the largest case of mass infections happening in Seoul,"" Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon told a briefing. ""We will urgently check companies where many people work in the same space like call centers.""
More than 90 out of 102 cases in the central province of South Chungcheong were traced to a workshop for Zumba dance teachers, attended by 29 people of which at least eight were confirmed to have contracted the flu-like virus.
President Moon Jae-in expressed guarded hope for the fight against the virus on Monday, saying the downward trend in new infections could lead to a phase of stability, while warning that it was too early to be optimistic."

SEATTLE (Reuters) - The Seattle-area nursing home at the epicenter of one of the biggest coronavirus outbreaks in the United States said on Monday it had no kits to test 65 employees showing symptoms of the respiratory illness that has killed at least 13 patients at the long-term care center.
The staff in question, representing more than a third of the Life Care Center's 180 employees, are out sick with symptoms consistent with coronavirus, and a federal strike team of nurses and doctors is helping to care for 53 patients remaining in the center.
With the facility in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland accounting for more than half of the known U.S. coronavirus deaths, and all its patients tested, it was unclear why Life Care lacked diagnostic kits for staff, even as the University of Washington offered to process test samples for them.
“We would like more kits to test employees,” Life Care Center spokesman Tim Killian told reporters, adding he did not know why they had not been forthcoming.
“We’ve been asking the various government agencies that have been supplying us with test kits.”
Twenty-six of 120 patients who were residing at the nursing home as of Feb. 19 have since died, with 13 of 15 autopsies carried conducted to date confirming coronavirus was the cause, Life Care officials said on Monday. Among 53 residents still in the facility as of Monday, results for 31 out of 35 tested have so far come back positive for the coronavirus, they said.
The Seattle-King County Public Health agency on Monday reported three more Life Care residents had died from coronavirus infections at local hospitals in recent days, raising the statewide total to 22. But it was not immediately clear whether those fatalities were already included in Life Care's own latest figures.
Washington as a whole has documented 162 confirmed cases, one of the largest tally of any single U.S. state. The nationwide number has surpassed 600.
The outbreak has shown how quickly coronavirus can spread through elderly residents with weak immune systems and underlying health conditions living in close quarters.
“We’ve had patients who, within an hour’s time, show no symptoms to going to acute symptoms and being transferred to the hospital,"" Killian told a news conference on Sunday. ""And we’ve had patients die relatively quickly under those circumstances."" 
Two other nursing homes in the greater Seattle area have reported that at least two residents and one staff member have the virus.
Killian said he was not sure whether nurses who worked at Life Care Center Kirkland also worked shifts at other nursing homes in the Seattle area before the outbreak came to light over a week ago. 
The University of Washington School of Medicine said on Monday it could test all Life Care staff. The lab's current testing is running at about 500 specimens a day, but it has capacity for over 1,000 tests a day.
“We’re happy to perform testing if they can get samples and send them through the University of Washington Department of Laboratory Medicine,” said Alex Greninger, assistant director of UW Medicine Clinical Virology Laboratories.

He did not know why Life Care had not received kits, but said a general reason why testing was not higher was a shortage of people to pick up specimens and bring them to his university lab.

Children ranging from six to 12 years old use every school break and any chance they can get to line up to use their self-built alcohol disinfectant robot that some of their peers have assembled under the guidance of their robotics coach.
""Washing hands is super,"" shouts a recorded voice after the dispenser senses a pair of hands in front of its ultrasonic sensor and dispenses alcohol disinfectant from a spray bottle by pulling back its handle with a motor and gearwheel mechanism.
Next to the robot, there are scenes crafted by the younger students showing various situations that require the washing of hands: an operating table in a hospital, a toilet and a flower garden.
One year after the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011, teachers at the Linyuan Elementary School decided the students should learn about the basic principals of robotics.
The school is situated in an industrial area, dominated by the petrochemical sector.
Teachers wanted to teach the children to be able to solve problems in their hometown in the future - such as fire, air pollution and gas explosions.
Since then, the school has represented Taiwan in many international competitions abroad and won several prizes with its robotics club.
While Taiwan has only recorded 45 cases of the coronavirus, compared with more than 80,000 on the other side of the Taiwan Strait in China, the island is on high alert to prevent further infections."

Maria Ochoa, 22, from the poor San Marcos region near Guatemala's border with Mexico, died on Sunday in a hospital in Houston, Texas, months after she was detained at the border by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE (NYSE:ICE)) in September.
Ochoa, whose two brothers live in the United States, had an operation on her gallbladder in the neighboring state of Oklahoma on Feb. 7 and spent a week in hospital afterwards, Guatemala's foreign ministry said in a statement.
Weeks earlier, she had passed the ""credible fear test"", the statement said, which is among the first tests U.S. asylum seekers must pass before they are allowed to press their case while remaining in the United States.
A surge of mostly Central American migrants have made the perilous journey north to try to enter the United States in recent years, many with children in tow and most fleeing rampant violence and extreme poverty in their home countries.
Several have died in U.S. custody in recent months."

ECATEPEC, Mexico (Reuters) - Millions of women across Mexico stayed home from factories, offices and schools on Monday in protest at gender violence - but some who turned up to their jobs said work was its own kind of protest.
The wildcat strike, dubbed ""a day without us,"" was intended to show what life would be like if women vanished from society. It followed massive protests on Sunday to mark International Women's Day.
In Ecatepec, a sprawling, working class Mexico City suburb that has seen a spike in gender violence, several women interviewed by Reuters said they saw Mexico's growing feminist movement as positive, but would not take part in the strike.
Beauty salon owner Alma Delia Diaz, 45, said she supported the movement, not least because she herself had been the victim of a kidnapping from which she had escaped. However, she said staying at home did not send the right message for her.
""Yes, I support the movement, but will do so by working,"" she said.
Likewise, Yasmin Rodríguez, 18, said she worked because she believes in gender equality and sees that in itself as a statement against the violence in Ecatepec.
""Working in Ecatepec isn't easy. The violence towards women around here worries me. I travel from Tecamac every day, and yes, it makes me nervous,"" she said.
The protests are focused on a surge in femicides, or gender-motivated killings of women. These jumped 137% in the past five years, government statistics show, as gang violence pushed the national murder tally to record heights. Most violent crimes go unsolved.
Other women said they would have liked to take part, but could not afford to lose a day's wages.
Maria Guadalupe, 45, said that she agreed with the strike and would have liked to participate, but that she could not skip work because she needed the 150 pesos ($7.50) a day to support her two grandchildren.
Florist Maria Trinidad Perez also supported the strike, but said that she had to come to work to look after her shop.
""I won't take part in it because I don't want to neglect my flowers. If I don't come, they dry up and die,"" she said."

MADRID (Reuters) - Kindergartens, schools and universities in the Madrid region will close for two weeks from Wednesday as a precaution against coronavirus, officials said on Monday, as the disease spread further around Spain.
Media including Cadena Ser radio said this would send 1.2 million pupils home, as Spain starts to follow Italy's lead in taking drastic measures to try to delay the spread of the virus.
Twenty-eight people have died in Spain from coronavirus, with cases jumping on Monday to 1,204, one of the highest numbers in Europe, though still far behind Italy's tally.
""It wasn't easy to make this decision but public health must come above everything,"" the head of the Madrid region, Isabel Diaz Ayuso, told a news conference.
The shutdown includes nurseries and vocational training centers as well as primary and secondary schools and universities. Ayuso advised the elderly and people with chronic illnesses to stay at home.
""These measures imply a disruption to normal activity in these places, but I appeal for your understanding as they are measures that we consider necessary in these areas,"" Health Minister Salvador Illa told another news conference.
Schools and universities in the Basque capital Vitoria will also close for two weeks, sending tens of thousands of pupils home. This will affect 63,000 students, the Basque newspaper El Correo said.
Some parents expressed concerns, not least about finding childcare.
""I don't know if it will be beneficial or will cause more alarm,"" Mikel Arrikstain, 38, said as he collected his child from school in Vitoria.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said the government was preparing what he called a ""shock therapy"" plan to mitigate the impact of the virus on the economy.
Economy Minister Nadia Calvino said the government was considering temporary measures to support the worst-hit industries, such as tourism, but that it expected the economic impact of the virus to be temporary and limited."

North Korea launched multiple projectiles into the sea on Monday as part of firing drills, according to South Korea's military, drawing U.S. and Chinese appeals for Pyongyang to return to talks on ending its nuclear and missile programs.
Kim was joined by the commanders of the Korean People's Army and expressed ""great satisfaction with the result,"" North Korean state news agency KCNA reported.
""The purpose of the firepower strike drill was to inspect the sudden military counterattack capability of the long-range artillery units on the front,"" KCNA said.
Photos released by KCNA showed troops firing a number of artillery guns, as well as missiles from a multiple-launch rocket system (MLRS) with four launching tubes.
The missiles flew up to 200 km (124 miles) and reached 50 km in altitude, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.
Britain, Germany, France, Estonia and Belgium raised North Korea's recent launches at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, calling them provocative actions that violated U.N. resolutions.
But North Korea's foreign ministry criticized the European stand as ""U.S.-instigated reckless behavior"" and Kim's sister said the drills were not meant to threaten anyone."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Elizabeth Warren's departure from the Democratic presidential race appears to have benefited front-runner Joe Biden more than Bernie Sanders, her liberal ally on many issues, according to a Reuters/Ipsos national opinion poll released on Monday.
The poll conducted from Friday to Monday showed that 47% of registered Democrats and independents said they would vote for Biden if their state's nominating contests were held today, up 7 points from a similar poll that ran just before Warren suspended her campaign last Thursday.
Thirty percent said they would vote for Sanders, a senator from Vermont, unchanged from the previous poll.
The results suggested that Warren's supporters, rather than gravitating toward Sanders, have fallen in line with Biden, who shifted the dynamics of the race with a commanding victory in the South Carolina primary, followed by wins in most of the Super Tuesday nominating contests last week.
Six more states, including Michigan and Washington, hold nominating contests on Tuesday.
Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, has not endorsed a candidate. More moderate former rivals, including Pete Buttigieg, Amy Klobuchar, Michael Bloomberg and Kamala Harris, have rallied behind Biden, the former vice president.
The poll also found that about six in 10 Sanders supporters said they would vote for Biden if he ended up winning the party's nomination to take on Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Three in 10 said they either would not vote, vote for a third-party candidate or did not yet know what they would do.
One in 10 Sanders supporters would vote for Trump if Biden is nominated. That is similar to the proportion of Sanders supporters who political scientists believe voted for Trump in 2016, although academics disagree over how much of an impact that had on Trump's upset victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,114 American adults, including 541 who identified as registered Democrats or independents. It had a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 5 percentage points."

TORONTO (Reuters) - The Canadian federal government introduced new legislation on Monday to criminalize LGBTQ conversion therapy, as Justin Trudeau's Liberal government moves to fulfill one of its 2019 election promises.
The proposed amendments to Canada's Criminal Code include offenses such as causing a person to undergo conversion therapy, advertising and profiting from conversion therapy and removing a minor from Canada.
Conversion therapy is any practice designed to change a person's sexual orientation to heterosexual, gender identity to one that matches the sex assigned at birth, or to repress or reduce non-heterosexual sexual attraction or behaviors, according to the legislation.
The bill also amends the Criminal Code to authorize courts to order disposing of or deleting advertisements for conversion therapy.
""Conversion therapy has been discredited and denounced by professionals and health associations in Canada, the United States and around the world. It has no basis on science or facts,"" said Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada David Lametti.
The legislation would not criminalize personal views expressed in private conversations by individuals looking to provide support to those struggling with their sexual orientation or gender identity.
The bill was introduced by Lametti and Bardish Chagger, minister of Diversity and Inclusion and Youth.
Conversion therapy has been banned in some Canadian cities such as Vancouver and Calgary. Ontario was the first Canadian province to ban the practice in 2015.
Several U.S. states, including California, Colorado, New York and Washington, have banned conversion therapy."

ROME (Reuters) - All of Italy under lockdown, reeling financial markets and rioting prisoners made clear on Monday how the global coronavirus epidemic was extending its reach into all aspects of social and economic life.
Major European stock markets dived more than 7%, Japanese indexes fell over 5% and U.S. markets sank over 7% after Saudi Arabia launched an oil price war with Russia that sent investors already spooked by the coronavirus epidemic running for the exits. 
In Italy, scene of Europe's worst outbreak with infections and deaths still soaring, took its most drastic steps yet to contain the outbreak, moves that affect some 60 million people. It ordered everyone across the country not to move around other than for work and emergencies, banned all public gatherings and suspended sporting events, including soccer matches.
Deaths in Milan's Lombardy region - which had already been on lockdown with cinemas, theaters and museums closed and restaurant hours restricted - jumped 25% in a day to 333, while the national death toll soared by 97 to 463, the highest in the world after China.
Over 9,000 people have become infected in Italy in little over two weeks, out of a global total of more than 110,000 in over 100 countries. Some 3,900 people have died across the world, the vast majority in mainland China.
""Now that the virus has a foothold in so many countries, the threat of a pandemic has become very real,"" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference.
But he welcomed Italy's tough measures, noting that just four countries - China, South Korea, Italy and Iran - accounted for 93% of cases worldwide. Israel ordered anyone entering the country to self-quarantine for 14-days on Monday.
""It would be the first pandemic that could be controlled,"" Tedros added. ""The bottom line is we are not at the mercy of the virus.""
TRUMP TO MEET OFFICIALS
In the United States, which has reported well over 500 cases and 26 deaths, the administration scrambled on Monday to assure Americans it was responding to the outbreak as stock markets plunged and top health officials urged some people to avoid cruise ships, air travel and big public gatherings.
U.S. President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly played down the threat posed by the flu-like virus, was planning to meet with his economic team to weigh possible action, an administration official told Reuters. Paid sick leave is among policy steps being considered, the official said on condition of anonymity.
A source also said top Wall Street executives had been invited to the White House on Wednesday for talks on the coronavirus. 
Around the world, flights have been canceled, communities and cruise liners isolated, and concerts and trade fairs postponed. While some countries, such as China and Italy, have turned to drastic measures to try to delay the spread of the virus, others remain in a ""containment"" phase, where individual cases can still be tracked.
Britain, with five deaths from almost 300 confirmed cases, said it would remain in that phase for now, allowing major gatherings and sporting events to continue, while making extensive preparations to move to the ""delay phase.""
In neighboring Ireland, acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said a 3 billion euro ($3.4 billion) coronavirus package had been agreed.
Funds set aside for a potential sudden rupture in trade ties with Britain, which has left the European Union, were to be diverted to coronavirus mitigation.
Perhaps just as dramatically, Varadkar announced cancellation of all parades planned for the national St. Patrick's Day festival on March 17, including one in Dublin that draws more than 500,000 people from all over the world.
In Spain, schools were closed across the Madrid region and the Basque capital Vitoria for two weeks as cases topped 1,200 nationwide.
Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said an emergency economic plan had been prepared.
SAUDI FINES
In the Gulf region, where most cases stem from travel from Iran, the emphasis has been on border control. Saudi Arabia said it would fine people who did not disclose health information and travel details at entry up to $133,000. 
Iran, with 7,161 cases and 237 deaths, said it was temporarily releasing about 70,000 prisoners because of the coronavirus.
China and South Korea both reported a slowdown in new infections. Mainland China, outside the outbreak center of Hubei province, recorded no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases for the second day.
South Korea reported 165 new cases, bringing the national tally to 7,478, while the death toll rose by one to 51. 
With the rate of increase in new infections at its lowest in 11 days, President Moon Jae-in said South Korea could enter the ""phase of stability"" soon. 
In Italy, that phase still seems far off.
Authorities said seven prisoners died as riots spread through more than 25 jails across the country over measures imposed to contain the coronavirus.
Police and fire trucks massed outside the main prison in the northern town of Modena, the site of some of the worst violence.
Barkeepers in Rome and Milan said police had visited them to warn that they risked closure if they let customers huddle together.
""We went into the cafe together but were told to stand far apart. It was really odd because we are friends,"" said Ilaria Frezza, a 21-year-old student.
But the bar she was in was, in fact, almost deserted.
""I wish I was having problems keeping people apart, but that's the least of my worries,"" said Franco Giovinazzo, who runs the Spazio Caffe in Rome. ""The real problem is there's no-one here.""

Conte told reporters that measures introduced just two days ago in much of the north were no longer sufficient after a jump in deaths tied to the highly infectious disease, and said the entire nation had to make sacrifices to stop its spread.
""The right decision today is to stay at home. Our future and the future of Italy is in our hands. These hands have to be more responsible today than ever before,"" Conte said.
Italy's 60-million people will only be able to travel for work, medical reasons or emergencies until April 3. All schools and universities, which were closed nationwide last week until March 15, will now not reopen before next month.
The contagion only came to light near Italy's financial capital Milan on Feb 21. Since then there have been some 9,172 confirmed cases and 463 deaths, putting the national health system under massive strain.

Conte said any public gatherings, including in the open air, would be forbidden and announced that all sports events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, would be suspended.

Kavala had been cleared of charges related to nationwide protests in 2013, but was re-arrested the following day, accused of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order in a failed coup in 2016.
On Monday, a second arrest warrant was issued in relation to the coup attempt, this time for espionage.
Court documents seen by Reuters said Kavala had been in contact with a man alleged to have spied for foreign governments.
Kavala denies all the charges. After his re-arrest last month, he said President Tayyip Erdogan had intervened to prevent his release from prison.
""The government should find a different occupation for itself,"" Kavala's lawyer Ilkan Koyuncu said.
The cases against Kavala have been criticized by Turkey's Western allies and rights activists who say the charges are political.
""#OsmanKavala must be released, not face further fabricated charges that are manifestly unfounded,"" Milena Buyum, Turkey campaigner for Amnesty International, said on Twitter.
EUROPEAN COURT RULING
In December, the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) said there was insufficient evidence to support the accusation that Kavala had been involved in the abortive coup. That ruling will become final on Tuesday.
Deniz Tolga Aytore, another lawyer for Kavala, was quoted in the court records as saying that the new warrant was aimed at circumventing the implementation of the ECHR ruling.
The independence of Turkey's judiciary has been hotly debated in recent years. Critics say court rulings are influenced by politicians but Erdogan and his ruling AK Party say the judiciary makes its decisions independently.
Ankara says the coup attempt was carried out by supporters of the U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in self-imposed exile in Pennsylvania since 1999. Gulen has denied any involvement.
Since the putsch, authorities have carried out a sustained security crackdown, jailing about 80,000 people, dismissing 150,000 civil servants, military personnel and others, and closing some 180 media organizations.
Ankara says the clampdown is necessary in the light of the threat Turkey faces."

KABUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani will issue a decree for at least 1,000 Taliban prisoners to be released this week, five official sources said on Monday, paving the way for opening direct talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban insurgents.
Ghani was sworn in for a second term on Monday, in a ceremony attended by U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and other international representatives including NATO forces commander Scott Miller.
His political rival Abdullah Abdullah, who contested the election results, held a parallel inauguration ceremony of his own, escalating the feud between the arch rivals and casting a shadow over the commencement of intra-Afghan peace efforts. 
Talks that both camps carried out with Khalilzad over the day and weekend failed to forge a deal that would prevent rival swearing-in events, official sources said.
A prisoner release is part of an agreement between the United States and the Taliban that allows U.S. forces and NATO troops to withdraw from Afghanistan to end more than 18 years of war.
The Taliban demand for the release of 5,000 prisoners as a confidence-building measure has been the most contentious part of the U.S.-Taliban deal signed in February. Ghani, earlier in March, rejected the demand, saying the Afghan government made no such commitment.
Ghani said in a speech after being sworn in that he would issue an order on Tuesday about the 5,000 Taliban prisoners the militant group has demanded be released in order to begin talks with the Afghan government. 
Ghani had previously rejected the demand as a condition for talks, but five official sources said Ghani agreed to release the prisoners in order to secure U.S. and other international endorsement for his inauguration as president.
Three of the sources said Ghani would announce on Tuesday he was releasing around 1,000 prisoners, with the elderly and those nearing the end of their sentences prioritized. 
A spokesman for Ghani's office declined to comment. The U.S. State Department and U.S. Embassy in Kabul did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Waheed Omer, the general director of the office of public affairs for Afghanistan's government, declined to comment ""for the moment"", adding ""there will be a decree on this"" soon.
""This is the 'price' that Ghani had to pay in return for Khalilzad attending his inauguration,"" a former senior Afghan official told Reuters.
A senior Afghan security official said Ghani will release Taliban prisoners who are above the age of 52 to prove that he is willing to start talks with the Taliban.
""Young Taliban prisoners will not be released at this stage - the (release) numbers may vary between 1,000 to 1,800,"" said a senior Afghan security official.
On Monday, Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for the U.S. forces in Afghanistan, said U.S. forces had begun its conditions-based reduction of forces to 8,600 over 135 days.

""U.S. Forces for Afghanistan maintains all the military means and authorities to accomplish our objectives - including conducting counter-terrorism operations... and providing support to the Afghan National Defense and security forces,"" he said in a statement.

With 42 confirmed cases of the virus, Israel has already taken some tough counter-measures, forcing visitors from many countries in Asia and Europe into home isolation. The virus has hit travel and trade, with tourism in particular expected to suffer.
""Anyone who arrives in Israel from abroad will enter a 14-day isolation,"" Netanyahu said in a video statement. He said the new measures would be in effect for two weeks initially.
""This is a difficult decision. But it is essential for safeguarding public health, and public health comes first.""
Government officials said the order would come into force immediately for Israelis returning to the country. From Thursday, any non-Israelis seeking to enter the country will have to prove they have the means to self-quarantine, the officials said.
Israeli media said the latest measure would mean quarantine for some 300,000 citizens in a country of around 9 million.
Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied West Bank have also been hit by the virus, reporting 25 confirmed cases. The Palestinian Authority (PA) has turned foreigners away at checkpoints and ordered schools and national parks closed.
The PA said on Monday it was barring Palestinians from traveling to neighboring Jordan through the Israeli-controlled Allenby Bridge crossing, with immediate effect. Foreigners would still be allowed to leave and all entries allowed, the PA said.
Israeli officials had no immediate comment on the Allenby measures.
Uncertainty in Israel about the impact of the new measures hit Tel Aviv's blue-chip stock index and the broader TA-125 which were both down around 6.5%.
The shekel, which peaked against the dollar in mid-February at 3.416, was trading at about 3.5 on Monday.
Israel’s central bank has said it did not expect a major economic impact if the virus was halted in the coming months, but that it was ready to use monetary policy tools “whenever necessary” should conditions worsen.
Netanyahu invited the media on Monday to a video conference he held with leaders of Italy, Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, Croatia and Cyprus to discuss cooperation on the crisis. Among his proposals was to regularly disinfect select airports in Europe to help preserve international deliveries of supplies.
Israeli public broadcaster Kan said the quarantine restrictions were even affecting the country's intelligence service. Kan said, without citing sources, that returning Mossad operatives had been ordered to stay at home for two weeks.
Thirteen Americans were heading home from the Holy Land on Monday after they were cleared in a coronavirus scare, the mayor of the Palestinian town where they had been quarantined said.
The group, from the 3Circle Church in Fairhope, Alabama, was placed in quarantine at the Angel Hotel in Beit Jala on Wednesday after several hotel staff there tested positive."
1298,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 04:21PM ET</span>",Exclusive: Millions of masks stockpiled in Canada's Ontario expired before coronavirus hit,"By Allison Martell and Moira Warburton
TORONTO (Reuters) - Millions of face masks stockpiled by Ontario in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak to protect healthcare workers during a future epidemic have expired, according to provincial officials and documents, raising questions about the readiness of Canada's most populous province to deal with the spreading coronavirus.
Thirteen years ago, Ontario stockpiled some 55 million N95 masks and other medical equipment after the province bore the brunt of the SARS epidemic in Canada in 2002 and 2003. But provincial officials have confirmed that the masks in the stockpile have passed their expiration date and sidestepped questions about how many masks, including expired ones, remain.
Public health officials have said masks may be less effective beyond the expiration date determined by the manufacturer. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the past has recommended use of expired masks only under ""crisis"" shortage situations.
Healthcare providers in Ontario have expressed worry about shortages of protective supplies like masks, given the expected spike in demand during an outbreak like the novel coronavirus that originated in China and has spread to various parts of the world. Canada has reported more than 70 cases of coronavirus infections as well as one death. Canadian hospitals have been told by provincial officials to maintain a four-week supply as standard policy. 
Ontario, which includes Canada's largest city Toronto, said in 2007 it would buy 55 million N95 masks and other medical supplies to prepare for future epidemics. A report by the province's auditor general, completed in December 2017, found that more than 80 percent of that stockpile had expired.
Officials did not say how many masks remained in the stockpile.
""You are correct in your understanding that the N95 masks purchased 13 years ago have expired,"" Ontario's health ministry said in a statement to Reuters.
Asked whether provincial officials have any masks on hand, the ministry did not answer directly. It said health organizations are getting their usual supply shipments, adding: ""We are working with them and our supply chain partners to ensure they continue to have adequate access to supplies as they continue to effectively respond to COVID-19,"" the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Ontario Nurses' Association president Vicki McKenna said in an email, ""We believe that there is a supply problem but government officials will not confirm supply. ... This question is asked at every meeting with ministry officials.""
The spread of the coronavirus has triggered a global shortage of N95 respirator masks. The United States, for example, has said it has about 12 million, but needs roughly 300 million.
Canadian officials have said they are prepared to deal with the novel coronavirus because of lessons learned from the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak involving another coronavirus. SARS killed 44 people in the Toronto area in 2002 and 2003 after a series of hospital and public health failures.
NO BUDGET TO MANAGE STOCKPILE
As of 2017, the preparatory stockpile amassed by Ontario included 26,000 pallets of supplies: respirators, face shields, needles and more. But no one had ensured that the supplies would be given to hospitals before their expiration and then replaced with fresh ones in the stockpile, according to the auditor general report.
""The ministry informed us that its budget for these supplies only allowed for storage and not the management of them,"" the report stated. Storage costs were running at more than C$3 million a year, and the ministry had started to dispose of the supplies, the report stated.
If some expired respirators are still in storage, they may still be usable. In 2017, the CDC tested stockpiled masks and found many models continued to perform effectively years after their expiration.
""We are hearing from you through our email address about concerns about ... supply,"" Ontario's health ministry wrote in a Feb. 12 document sent to healthcare organizations. ""We are confident that we have sufficient inventory across the province to respond to the situation on the ground today.""
It also said it was aware that supplies contained in the stockpiles of many other health organizations had expired. It made no mention of the province's own stockpile. 
Canada has a federal emergency stockpile of supplies, described by Chief Medical Officer Theresa Tam as mainly for ""rare high-impact events."" 
Asked during a news conference on Friday how many masks the federal government possesses, Tam declined to say, adding that key medical supplies like N95 masks are a provincial responsibility rather than a federal one, though the federal government can coordinate group purchases. 
In a Monday letter to provincial premiers, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said the federal government is ""already leading a bulk procurement of personal protective equipment."" 
British Columbia, which along with Ontario has reported the bulk of Canada's coronavirus cases, said its mask supply is sufficient. 

""We have had a pandemic stockpile for many years. It's based on usage in different healthcare facilities over time, with an added amount to be able to cover a flu pandemic,"" said the province's health officer Bonnie Henry.

""The test was negative. I'm going to keep working from home, even though it was negative, until the fifteen days are up,"" broadcaster SIC showed Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa as hollering. ""I want to be an example.""
The head of state, who is known for rarely missing a social gathering where he eagerly poses with people for selfies, was tested earlier on Monday after his office announced the previous day that he had suspended all engagements and trips abroad for a fortnight and would work from home.
The decision was taken after a school in the northern municipality of Felgueiras which had sent a group of children to visit the presidential residence last Tuesday announced that one of its students had tested positive for the virus. The student in question was not present at the residence.
""I had commitments involving hundreds, thousands of people in the coming weeks. It's not worth the risk,"" Rebelo de Sousa told broadcaster RTP over the phone.
A total of 35 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Portugal so far, with the majority concentrated in two municipalities in the north - Felgueiras and Lousada.
Schools and public spaces in both municipalities were closed on Monday until further notice, the health ministry said."

ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopian investigators singled out faulty systems on a Boeing (N:BA) 737 MAX plane in an interim report on last year's Ethiopian Airlines crash that killed 157 people, piling pressure on the U.S. jetmaker on the eve of the disaster's anniversary.
The accident, following the 2018 crash of the same model plane in Indonesia killing 189 people, led to the grounding of Boeing's 737 MAX worldwide, wiped billions off the company's value and sparked hundreds of lawsuits from bereaved families.
Monday's report focused purely on technical matters and identified no issues with the airline or pilots' handling of the brand-new 737 MAX, which crashed shortly after take-off.
Inaccurate sensor readings activated the MCAS anti-stall system that pushed the plane down as pilots struggled to right it, the report said. The fully loaded jet burrowed into a field with its nose down 40 degrees and dropping at 500 feet a second.
""Most of the wreckage was found buried in the ground,"" it said.
The interim report http://www.aib.gov.et/wp-content/uploads/2020/documents/accident/ET-302%20%20Interim%20Investigation%20%20Report%20March%209%202020.pdf bolstered findings of Ethiopia's initial assessment, which linked the crash to a Boeing automated system. It said two sensors recording the plane's angle - known as the ""angle of attack"" or AOA - differed in readings by 59 degrees. 
Under the plane's design, regulators have found that flight computers were only capable of consulting one AOA sensor at a time, meaning there was no backup beyond the presence of trained crew, due to miscalculation of the risks of failure.
The 130-page report devoted some 20 pages to listing a cascade of problems caused by the loss of accurate AOA data, including flight computer and throttle settings, signaling where Ethiopian authorities will argue the root cause lies.
But the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration adopted a cautious stance and suggested it would consult other reports, while remaining open to human as well as technical factors.
""We believe it’s important to have the full final report to evaluate it against other independent reports so that we might fully understand all of the factors - both mechanical and human - that played a role in this tragic loss of life,"" it said.
The Ethiopian interim report contrasted with a final report into the Lion Air crash by Indonesia which faulted Boeing's design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX but also cited errors by airline workers and crew.
Safety experts say most airliner accidents are caused by a cocktail of factors.
Ethiopian authorities did not release the report at a press conference, and neither the transport ministry nor the airline answered calls seeking comment. 
In a short statement, Boeing reiterated condolences to relatives of victims and said it looked forward to seeing full details and formal recommendations in Ethiopia's final report.
'MOMENT OF GRIEF'
Passengers from 33 nations had been aboard the plane and families from many nations gathered in the capital of Addis Ababa ahead of a memorial at the crash site on Tuesday. 
Some welcomed the report, but others said they were too consumed by grief to read it. 
""We wish the report had come earlier or after this moment as we are now in a moment of grief, and want to focus on remembering our loved ones,"" said Zekarias Asfaw Shankut, 42, who lost his brother. ""Now it is actually a distraction."" 
The Ethiopian report criticized Boeing for ""inadequate"" training for pilots flying the new model because it had not included scenarios where MCAS was erroneously activated. 
Some industry experts have questioned certain aspects of the pilots' handling of flight ET302, including the engines being left at hard-to-manage take-off power, while acknowledging they were grappling with overwhelming physical forces and flawed control software. The airline strongly denies any pilot error.
But the report said the throttles did not move during the flight because the flight computer was looking at wrong data.
The report backed safety recommendations already underway, including modifications to sensors and anti-stall MCAS software. Boeing recently endorsed calls for more costly simulator training after holding out for months against it.

The U.S. House Transportation Committee on Friday faulted the FAA's approval of the plane and Boeing's design failures, saying the two 737 MAX flights were ""doomed"".

“We will target and designate anybody that stores Iranian oil, petrochemicals or refined petroleum in violation of U.S. sanctions, no matter where they are,"" said David Peyman, the deputy assistant secretary of state for counter threat finance and sanctions.
Peyman also said the United States will encourage ship captains to take photos, and submit them to the U.S. government, of anyone conducting ship-to-ship transfers in case those transfers involve sanctioned oil. In addition, he said the advisories will warn shipping vessels against turning off tracking devices in an effort to avoid U.S. sanctions on Iran.
""Transponders that provide the location of vessels should never be turned off. If they are, that presents a risk that requires heightened diligence,"" Peyman told the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a think thank that supports tough sanctions on Iran.
The International Maritime Organization requires vessels to use transponders for safety and transparency. Crews can turn off the devices if there is a danger of piracy or similar hazards. But transponders are often shut off to conceal a ship's location during illicit activities.
The Trump administration pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018 and soon after unilaterally re-imposed sanctions on the Islamic Republic's oil exports, saying it wants to bring the shipments down to zero. Iran says its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.
Despite the sanctions, China still imports Iranian oil. The Trump administration imposed sanctions on Sept. 25 last year on units of Chinese shipper COSCO for transporting the blacklisted crude.
The Trump administration has been warning Chinese shipping companies since at least October about turning off transponders in attempt to hide shipments of Iranian oil."

Debate has raged in deeply religious Greece on whether it would be prudent for the Church to continue the ritual, where worshippers sip from the same spoon.
The Greek Orthodox Church attempted to put a stop to the chatter on Monday: ""This cannot be the cause of the spread of illness,"" the Holy Synod, the ruling body of the Church, said in a statement.
Although it didn't elaborate, senior members of the Church have told Greek media Holy Communion, representing the blood and body of Christ, was without blemish. ""Whoever attends Holy Communion is approaching God, who has the power to heal,"" Metropolitan Seraphim (eds:one name) told Greece's Alpha radio.

Not everyone is convinced by the Church's approach.
""I'm not saying that its bad to do that (Holy Communion), but there is a 50-50 chance you could catch it,"" said George Moros, 37.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Britain's Prince Andrew has declined to cooperate with a U.S. investigation into possible co-conspirators of deceased financier and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein, a U.S. prosecutor said on Monday.
""Contrary to Prince Andrew's very public offer to cooperate with our investigation into Epstein’s co-conspirators, an offer that was conveyed via press release, Prince Andrew has now completely shut the door on voluntary cooperation and our office is considering its options,"" U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman said when asked about Epstein at a news conference about an unrelated case.
Berman's spokesman James Margolin declined comment on the options being considered. He said the prince's lawyers had said Andrew would not submit voluntarily to an interview. He said this was after Jan. 27, when Berman told a news conference Andrew had not offered any cooperation.
Andrew, 60, had said in a public statement in November that he was stepping down from public duties and would be willing to help ""any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.""
A friend of Epstein's, the prince has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. He has described his association with the financier as ""ill-judged."" A spokeswoman for the royal family declined comment.
Clare Montgomery, a senior London barrister who British news reports say represents Andrew on matters related to Epstein, also declined to comment, citing professional rules limiting her ability to speak publicly about legal issues.
Andrew, Queen Elizabeth's second son, has denied an accusation by a woman who said she was trafficked by Epstein and forced to have sex with his friends, including the prince, when she was 17.
A U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation probe is focusing on British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein's, and others who facilitated the wealthy financier's alleged trafficking of underage girls, law enforcement sources told Reuters in December.
Epstein had socialized with the prince and other high-profile figures including U.S. President Donald Trump and former president Bill Clinton.
Epstein's suicide in Manhattan's Metropolitan Correctional Center in August, at age 66, occurred little over a month after he was arrested and charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. Prosecutors said he recruited girls to give him massages, which became sexual in nature. Epstein had pleaded not guilty."

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City acupuncturist and herbalist Clayton Shiu says demand for traditional Chinese remedies has surged at his practice since March 1, the day New York announced its first case of the novel coronavirus.
""It was like a light switch was flipped,"" said Shiu, who had stocked up and had an ample supply of herbs on hand for his patients.
Kamwo Meridian Herbs, a shop in the heart of New York's Chinatown and a longtime supplier to practitioners like Shiu, has experienced a similar jump in demand for traditional Chinese remedies for respiratory and other ailments.
To counter the outbreak in China, which has reported nearly 81,000 cases, the government initiated a series of emergency research programs that include traditional Chinese medicines, which are widely used in the world's most populous nation.
Last year, the World Health Organization formally recognized traditional medical therapies such as acupuncture and herbal supplementation medicine, conferring more mainstream recognition of the practices, which date back more than 2,500 years.
At Kamwo, prescription orders for herb formulas used to treat flu-like symptoms and boost the immune system almost doubled since late February as confirmed cases of coronavirus started spreading across the United States.
On a recent afternoon, the store was bustling with activity as the delicate scent of medicinal herbs wafted through the air. Against the backdrop of an imposing apothecary cabinet, workers loaded herbs onto old-fashioned weighing scales as customers placed orders for formulas that include honeysuckle, cinnamon twig, peony root and other substances.
Since the outbreak began, members of the close-knit traditional Chinese medicine community have been sharing formulas for prevention and treatment, helping boost demand for certain ingredients and driving up prices, Shiu said.
Patients infected by the coronavirus, which has already contributed to at least 22 deaths in the United States as of Monday and nearly 4,000 worldwide, often present symptoms such as fever and cough, similar to those found in influenza patients.
To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-19.
SUPPLY WOES
At Calihouse Nutrition, a tiny shop in the heart of New York's Chinatown, Patrick Siu was dealing with a steady stream of customers who were inspecting shelves and barrels filled with herbs and roots.
A 40-pound supply of medicinal herbs that would normally last two to three weeks now sells out in just a few days, he said.
Best-selling items such Japanese honeysuckle and the popular cold remedy Ban Lan Gen Chong Ji were already hard to find and prices were rising fast, according to Siu, 48, who emigrated to the United States from Hong Kong in the late 1980s.
With demand so high, herb purveyors and practitioners have become concerned about a growing supply crunch for certain herbs that come almost exclusively from China.
Mayway, a Chinese medicine business in San Francisco, said on its website that it had experienced an ""unusual increase in ordering quantities"" and asked its customers to limit their orders to what was needed. It said it anticipated supply delays ""due to the low volume of container ships currently leaving China,"" according to its website.
""Vendors have told us you can't order more than 50% of what you normally do, (you) have to ration for flu herbs,"" said Thomas Leung, chief executive of Kamwo. ""I'm not freaking out about it, but we are keeping an eye on it.""
Worldwide, traditional medicine, including Chinese practices, generate some $60 billion a year, according to a WHO Bulletin."

""Marshal Haftar assured (us) that he was committed to signing the ceasefire but this commitment would cease if the militias do not respect it,"" the official said after Haftar met President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.
The official gave no further details.
Despite a peace conference held in Berlin in January, violence has increased in Libya, with combatants in the west and east preparing for a long conflict as foreign weapons flood in, eastern factions close oil ports and rival alliances wrangle over revenues from Africa's largest petroleum reserves.
Several countries backing rival factions in Libya have violated an arms embargo, according to the United Nations, which has previously named the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey for breaching the embargo. 
After the Berlin conference the violations increased and the U.N. denounced them without naming countries.
The Libyan National Army led by Haftar and forces aligned with the internationally recognized Government of National Accord (GNA) in Tripoli have been fighting for control of the capital since April last year.
The UAE and Egypt support Haftar, while the GNA is backed by Turkey. France has been accused of lending political support to Haftar, but Paris has denied this.
""Haftar is one of the main actors on the Libyan political scene and must be taken into consideration,"" the French presidential official said.
The official said there were no plans for Macron to meet or speak to the head of the Tripoli government, Fayez Seraj.
The standoff over oil is one of several factors that could prolong the almost year-long conflict over the capital, where the GNA last month secured military backing from Turkey including Turkish-backed fighters from Syria.

The official said Macron had raised the issue of oil and moves to ensure the revenues serve all the population and lead to blockades of ports being lifted, but Haftar said it had nothing to do with him.

There was no immediate response from the government which has been proposing talks in recent weeks to try and end an insurgency that has spread violence across the West African state and its neighbors.
But Malian authorities have repeatedly said they want French forces to stay, and France has promised to boost its military presence in the Sahel region.
Attacks by groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in Mali and neighboring Burkina Faso and Niger killed hundreds of civilians last year, and stoked even deadlier ethnically-charged reprisals.
The bloodshed has worsened despite the presence of more than 11,000 U.N. peacekeepers in Mali and around 5,000 French troops across the region.
""There can be no talking about negotiations under the shade of occupation, before the departure of all French forces and their followers from Mali,"" al Qaeda-linked Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM) said in a statement issued on social media on Sunday.
JNIM also called on the U.N. peacekeeping mission MINUSMA to leave, saying it was echoing the demands of Malian protesters, some of whom have called on foreign troops to withdraw.
Mali has been in chaos since 2012 when jihadist fighters hijacked an insurrection by Tuareg separatists to seize Mali's entire desert north. They were forced back by an intervention led by Mali's former colonial ruler France the following year.
The militants have since reconstituted and extended their range of influence, striking hotels and restaurants in regional capitals and terrorizing villages in the hinterlands, where nearly 1 million people have fled their homes."

LUXOR, Egypt (Reuters) - Egypt has stepped up action to contain the coronavirus in the popular tourist destination of Luxor following an outbreak of the disease on a River Nile cruise ship.
At least 45 coronavirus cases have been detected on the ship since it arrived in Luxor, and a German tourist who died on Sunday in a hospital in the Red Sea resort of Hurghada had visited the southern city. Egypt has reported 55 cases in all.
Health authorities started sanitizing hotels and cruise ships in Luxor on Monday and began testing staff and guests for the virus, tourism workers and witnesses said.
Tourists and staff were not allowed in or out of hotel facilities or cruise ships until the health workers finished the sanitization and testing, they said.
Three government ministers visited Luxor on Sunday and toured archaeological sites, hotels and cruise ships to try to reassure travelers that it is safe to visit.
The tourism sector is an important source of hard currency for Egypt and the old and ancient temples, monuments and burial sites in or around Luxor make it one of the country's top destinations for tourists.
Revenue from tourism in Egypt was a record high $12.57 billion in the financial year that ended last July, according to central bank figures.
The government also decided on Monday to suspend events in Egypt that include big gatherings, hoping to contain the virus. It gave no details but a cabinet source said religious festivals, concerts, exhibitions and seminars would be affected.
IMPACT FEARED ON TOURISM
Archaeological and tourist sites in Luxor were open on Monday and many people were visiting them, Reuters journalists in the city said.
The tourism and antiquities ministry said the flow of tourists ""continued regularly and in accordance with the normal visitor rates"" in Luxor.
But some tourism workers are worried about the potential impact of the coronavirus on business.
""The industry will definitely be impacted. It is the first time for us to see these measures,"" said Ashraf Ismail, manager of a cruise ship in Luxor. ""There are cancellations, but not major so far.... We will have to wait and see how this will impact the industry in general."" .
Hamada Mohammed, owner of a tourism company that deals exclusively with tourists from China, where the coronavirus originated, called it ""a big catastrophe for us.""
""We have not been working for the past two weeks after the suspension of flights from China. Some companies decided to shut down completely,"" he said."

NAIROBI (Reuters) - Frustrated by incompetence and corruption in his native Kenya, Jared Babu, a 28-year-old activist and entrepreneur, set up a program to train high school students about leadership.
When he and his young wife Mercy were killed in the Ethiopian Airlines crash a year ago, leaving a baby daughter, it looked like his dreams might die with him. 
But like other victims' families who have founded charities or taken other measures to honors them, Jared's family also wants to ensure his vision lives on. 
""If you don't teach integrity, the consequences are catastrophic,"" said his dad Joshua Babu in a leafy backyard of their home in a Nairobi suburb. Jared's daughter Emmy - now two - clambered over family members before pointing at a big photo of her parents and saying ""mama"" and ""daddy"". 
Jared's parents blame his death on a failure of leadership by U.S. aviation giant Boeing (NYSE:BA) - which designed the 737 MAX plane that crashed - and U.S. authorities, who failed to ground the plane after a similar crash in Indonesia five months earlier. 
On Friday, U.S. lawmakers released preliminary findings into the two crashes faulting the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s approval of the plane and Boeing’s design. 
And on Monday, an interim report by Ethiopia's government said a faulty sensor reading and the activation of an anti-stall system preceded the crash, which killed 157 people.
Boeing did not immediately comment on the report. 
Last week, however, David Calhoun, Boeing's new chief executive, told The New York Times there were ""weaknesses in our leadership"" but also raised questions over the pilots' abilities in both crashes. 
'YOU AND I'
Jared's mother Emily has no doubt where the blame lies: the same issue her son spent his life trying to fix. ""There are so many sources that are pointing to the fact there was a laxity in the issues of (Boeing's) governance,"" she told Reuters. 
Jared, she said, set a different example. She smiled with pride as she recalled the time he chose to go to court rather than pay a small bribe for a minor motoring offense. 
He posted a picture of himself in the dock online, she said, encouraging others to face honest punishment for their mistakes. 
His wife Mercy worked with a local children's home to educate students there. ""They did not deserve to die. They did not deserve to die,"" Emily Babu repeated on the edge of tears. 
The crash victims' families have no monument to grieve at nor graves to visit given the impact of the crash. So some have founded groups to help the environment or support the bereaved. 
Jared's family want his work to be a living memorial.
His businessman father Joshua said he would continue Jared's role in ""You and I"", the mentorship organization Jared founded with his best friend Simon Kioko in 2016. 
The group's name came from Jared's habit of telling people who needed to change the world. 
So far, the group has worked with about 2,000 students during pilot program in more than a dozen high schools, said Kioko. They will hold a formal launch on March 20 to expand the program and talk about Jared's legacy. 

""We can't all just sit back and grumble,"" said Joshua Babu. ""Jared always said, 'it is for you and I to make the change we want to see'.""

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union leaders will hold emergency talks soon to discuss a joint response to the coronavirus, officials said on Monday, as the bloc's executive considers relaxing state subsidy rules to allow extra public spending.
The announcement of the teleconference, likely to take place on Tuesday, came after Italy and France called for Europe-wide stimulus to counter the economic impact of the epidemic.
The spread of coronavirus from China across Asia, Europe and the Americas has caused huge disruption to business operations, supply chains and economic activity. Analysts say the world economy is headed for a sharp downturn, possibly a recession.
""Following consultations I will hold a EUCO members conference call shortly on COVID-19 to coordinate EU efforts,"" tweeted Charles Michel, who chairs EU summits. ""We need to cooperate in order to protect the health of our citizens.""
Separately, the head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen said on Monday the bloc's executive was considering all options to help the economy.
The commission was assessing conditions to grant flexibility to states in providing public subsidies to crisis-hit sectors, she added .
Temporary suspensions to the bloc's state aid framework, which is meant to avoid unfair competition, were introduced after the 2008-09 financial crisis and let governments spend hundreds of billions of euros to bail out banks.
RESOURCES SCARCE
On Saturday, Brussels effectively authorized Italy's emergency measures to tackle the impact of the outbreak, using a waiver under EU fiscal rules that allows for more spending in exceptional circumstances.
That flexibility will allow Italy, the worst-hit EU country, to increase its budget deficit above EU limits.
Von der Leyen said the EU could also spend some of its own money to combat the crisis, but admitted resources were scarce.
""If I look at the tasks ahead of us, we are running short of the flexibility to act in crises as we see them right now,"" she said.
As she spoke, EU institutions and other Brussels-based bodies were arranging for staff to work from home.
The EU Parliament on Monday shortened its monthly four-day plenary sitting to only one-and-half days to reduce contagion risks, after it had earlier decided to extraordinarily move it from Strasbourg to Brussels .
The EU council, which hosts meetings of national diplomats and ministers, last week sent home more than 50 people after two infections among its staff.
A first case was also detected at the EU Commission, a spokeswoman for the body said on Monday.
A NATO spokeswoman said on Monday the military alliance had sent home some staff after one official working at the Brussels headquarters had tested positive."

ROME (Reuters) - Six prisoners died as riots spread through crowded jails across Italy over measures imposed to contain the coronavirus.
Inmates, many angered by restrictions on family visits, went on the rampage and started fires from Sunday into Monday, authorities said. In one prison, inmates took guards hostage and in another some escaped.
By Monday afternoon, violence that started at the heart of the coronavirus outbreak in northern Italy had spread south, hitting more than 25 penitentiaries nationwide.
Justice Minister Alfonso Bonafede said the government was open to discussing prison conditions but the rebellions had to stop.
In a sign of the political pressures piling onto his coalition government, the leader of the far-right opposition League, Matteo Salvini, called for an ""iron fist"" response.
Italy - the worst-hit country in Europe - has reported 366 deaths linked to the virus.
The biggest rebellion began on Sunday in a prison in the northern town of Modena.
Three prisoners died there, and another three in prisons where they were moved after the violence started, Francesco Basentini, a prison administration official at the justice ministry, said.
Some died from overdoses of drugs they had stolen from prison clinics, a justice ministry source said, without giving details on what had caused the other fatalities.
Police and fire trucks massed outside the prison as black smoke swirled into the sky on Sunday. A justice ministry spokesman said the situation there was under control by Monday, and officials were assessing the damage.
Two guards were taken hostage in a prison in the northern town of Pavia on Sunday night, and then freed in a police raid hours later, the prison police group UILPA said.
Inmates revolted in Milan's San Vittore prison, taking to the roof and unfurling a banner demanding a general pardon.
Further south, prisoners in the Tuscan city of Prato set fire to mattresses.
On Sicily, inmates rebelled at Palermo's Ucciardone prison, which houses some Mafia convicts, but guards managed to regain control, officials said.
SkyTG 24 television said about 50 inmates managed to escape from a jail in southern Foggia and more than half of them had been captured.
Italy's prisons are among the most over-crowded in Europe. ""The spread of the virus is a real concern,"" said Andrea Oleandri of the Italian prison rights group Antigone."

Lesbos is one of the closest Greek islands to the Turkish coast and was one of the main gateways for hundreds of thousands of refugees and asylum seekers who headed to Europe in 2015 and 2016.
There has been a resurgence in arrivals after Turkey announced in late February it would no longer contain 3.6 million refugees it has hosted under an accord with the EU in 2016 to stem the flow.
Lesbos still hosts more than 20,000 people in overcrowded filthy camps, and sentiment toward them, and aid organizations, has progressively turned sour.
The Mare Liberum, a wooden ship belonging to the Berlin-based non-governmental organization of the same name, has been conducting human rights monitoring in the narrow sea straits between Turkey and Greece for the past two years.
The group says it needs supplies and a safe port to continue its work on human rights monitoring."

After publication, the army said its artillery fire had not killed the women or caused other civilian injuries and blamed insurgents of the Arakan Army (AA), who are fighting for greater autonomy in Rakhine state. The AA denied responsibility and accused the army. Reporters are banned from the area where the incident happened.
Police Lieutenant Kyaw Thu, the acting station head in Buthidaung township, in the north of Rakhine state, told Reuters both the news agency and the lawmaker were being sued under section 66D of the Telecommunications Act.
The section, which has been used to jail government critics in the Southeast Asian country, outlaws online defamation and carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison.
Kyaw Thu said that police had not yet contacted Reuters about the case and would seek to do so.
""We are trying to make an approach in so far as we can, to find out where Reuters news agency is, what kind of organization it is and the reporter and the editor,"" he told a Reuters reporter on Sunday before putting down the phone.
He said that police had requested permission from the speaker of Myanmar's national parliament with regards to proceeding with the case against lawmaker Maung Kyaw Zan, who represents Buthidaung.
The case follows an army complaint about a story published by Reuters on Jan. 25 in which the lawmaker was quoted as saying that the army’s artillery fire had caused the deaths of the two Rohingya women.
The army held a news conference on Feb. 4 to complain about the story, after which Reuters updated the story to reflect the army’s position.
The army subsequently filed a complaint objecting to the Reuters story to the Myanmar Press Council (MPC), which adjudicates disputes between authorities and news media.
""Reuters stands by the reporting that is of concern to the military and is the subject of an ongoing discussion with Myanmar’s Press Council,"" a Reuters spokesperson said.
""We do not believe there is any basis for a criminal action against Reuters or our journalists under Myanmar law. We have not seen any criminal complaint against Reuters, and so cannot comment further at this time.""
The member of parliament said that it was unfair to bring a lawsuit against him.
""As a representative of the people, I listened to what the people told me and I spoke about it,"" he told Reuters by phone. ""I will just have to face the lawsuit and receive the judgment from the court.""
Zaw Min Tun, a spokesman for the military, confirmed the complaint against the lawmaker but said he did not know about the lawsuit against Reuters.   
Rakhine state is the western region from which more than 750,000 Rohingya fled in 2017 following a military crackdown.
Myanmar is facing charges of genocide at the International Court of Justice in the Hague over the crackdown. The army denies genocide, saying it was fighting a legitimate battle against Rohingya militants who attacked police stations.
Two Reuters reporters were released from a Myanmar jail last May after spending more than 18 months behind bars, accused of breaking the official secrets act in a case that sparked an outcry from diplomats and human rights advocates.
Before their arrest in December 2017, they had been working on an investigation into the killing of 10 Rohingya Muslim men and boys by security forces and Buddhist civilians in Rakhine state."

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was sworn in for a second term on Monday but his main rival refused to recognize the inauguration and held his own swearing-in ceremony as a rival president.
Both Ghani and former chief executive Abdullah Abdullah say they are Afghanistan's rightful leader following a disputed election last September, a stand-off that threatens political chaos days after the United States and the Taliban signed a deal on the withdrawal of U.S.-led international forces.
Ghani's ceremony was disrupted by the sound of two rockets hitting the edge of the compound of the presidential palace compound in the capital Kabul, Reuters witnesses said, but there was no word of any casualties and he continued his speech.
Planned morning ceremonies were postponed, and guests kept waiting, while U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad tried to broker a last-minute deal between the longtime political foes, but there was no immediate word of a breakthrough. 
Television footage showed Ghani taking an oath at the presidential palace in a ceremony attended by foreign diplomats including Khalilzad and NATO forces commander Scott Miller.
Ghani said in a speech that the government he was forming would not include only members of his political camp though he would continue with the previous cabinet for two weeks.
""Then we will form an inclusive government after consultation,"" he said.
He plans to finalize a negotiating team for talks with the Taliban on Tuesday and to make a further announcement on demands by the Islamist militant group for the release of 5,000 prisoners. 
The Taliban, which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and has been waging an insurgency since shortly after its fall from power, has made their release a condition for talks but Ghani said last week he had rejected the demand. 
Diplomats are now waiting to see whether Abdullah appoints rival ministers and governors, and whether they take up office by force, said two diplomatic sources who declined to be named. 
Ghani and Abdullah have been holding talks with U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad as he tries to secure a deal between the two camps, an official for Ghani said earlier on Monday. 
""We have been in serious negotiations with the Abdullah team since last night, and it is still underway,"" the official said, requesting anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to media. Details of the talks were not made available.
RIVAL LEADERS 
The Election Commission last month announced that Ghani had retained power by winning the Sept. 28 election. But Abdullah rejected that and proclaimed himself winner.
Ghani and Abdullah both held roles in the previous government under a U.S.-brokered power-sharing agreement that followed the previous election in 2014. 
The government is meant to be preparing for talks with the Taliban, to follow up on the Feb. 29 pact on the withdrawal of U.S. troops after 18 years of war. 
Abdullah had offered to postpone his ceremony if Ghani did the same, Abdullah's spokesman, Omid Maisam, said. Ghani's team later said he had postponed his inauguration until the afternoon.
Four diplomatic sources said the negotiations led by Khalilzad were not going well and the chance of reaching a solution was fading. The U.S. embassy declined comment on the negotiations. 
Abdullah called for what he described as a fraudulent votes to be ruled invalid.

""No one should have underestimated our commitment to genuine democracy,"" he said on Twitter. ""Invalidation of all fraudulent votes is the way out.""

The two U.S. military members, killed on Sunday, were not being publicly identified until their families could be notified, the Combined Joint Task Force for Operation Inherent Resolve said in the statement released by the command.
The deaths highlight that despite losing its territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria, Islamic State can still pose a threat. 
An Inspector General report published earlier this year said that despite the death of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the militant group continued low-level attacks and while it did not appear to grow stronger, it did not ""lose its freedom of movement or ability to hide and transport fighters and supplies in Iraq’s desert and mountainous terrain.""
""ISIS in Iraq retains enough manpower and planning capabilities to conduct regular small-scale attacks ... and
occasionally infiltrates urban centers, but has not tried to hold territory,"" the Inspector General said it was told by Combined Joint Task Force for Operation Inherent Resolve.
There are about 5,200 U.S. troops in Iraq.

Selcuk Mizrakli, from the pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), was removed from his post in August over alleged links to the militant Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) along with mayors of two other major Kurdish cities.
The judicial source said Mizrakli had been sentenced to nine years, four months and fifteen days in jail for membership of a terrorist organization.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan frequently accuses the HDP of links to the PKK, which is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the EU and the United States. The HDP denies such links.
The central government has so far appointed trustees to 32 municipalities that were formerly held by the HDP since local elections in March 2019, according to an HDP source. More than twenty co-mayors are either in jail pending trial or have been handed prison sentences for crimes related to terrorism.
The HDP appoints two people as mayors and leaders within the party to promote gender equality.
The removal of the mayors echoed the dismissal of dozens of mayors in 2016 over similar accusations, part of a purge that began after a failed coup. Nearly 100 mayors and thousands of HDP party members were jailed in a crackdown that drew expressions of concern from the United States and European Union."

This will be one of the first measures geared toward protecting tenants by the new government, which made accessible housing a priority in its coalition manifesto.
Spanish rental prices have increased by more than 54% on in the last six years, according to data collected by Idealista, a portal with wide coverage of the nation's rental prices.
""The government has decided to take measures to put the brakes on another social scourge ... evictions due to unpaid rent,"" one source said.
""We will take the necessary measures to avoid this kind of eviction, especially in areas of the market where renting is under pressure and where major property owners dedicate themselves to real estate investment.""
The second source said the measure would fall under the broader reform of Spain's Urban Lease Law, expected to pass before the summer.
Neither source could spell out in detail how the government planned to make it harder to evict non-paying tenants.
The same sources said the government would prolong a ban on evicting vulnerable home-owners who miss mortgage payments, due to expire on May 15. Such evictions fell 25.1% in 2019 to their lowest level in 12 years.
U.N. Special Rapporteur Philip Alston said last month that Spain was facing housing problems of ""stunning proportions"", affecting people who were already struggling, without jobs or adequate welfare benefits.
The government said last month that it would publish an index of nationwide rental prices, which could be a first step toward enabling rent controls.
Spain's real estate market suffered deeply during the economic crisis. A Bank of Spain report published in August 2019 cited Idealista's data to underline the sharp increase in the average cost of rent.
The average monthly rent in February was 11.1 euros per sq meter, compared to 7.22 euros in February 2014, an Idealista official said on Tuesday."
1321,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 10:06AM ET</span>",Names of victims read aloud at murder trial over doomed flight MH17,"By Toby Sterling and Anthony Deutsch
AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Relatives sat listening with bowed heads and eyes closed as the names of all 298 victims of a missile strike on a Malaysian airliner were read out in a Dutch court on Monday as the murder trial of four fugitive defendants began.
Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was hit by a surface-to-air missile on July 17, 2014 while flying over Ukrainian territory held by pro-Russian rebels fighting government forces. The airliner was on its way from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur.
None of the accused in the disaster - three Russians and a Ukrainian - were present in the courtroom and all four are believed to be in Russia. Only one sent a defense lawyer.
Judges ruled that the men had waived their rights to attend and said proceedings would continue without them.
The mood in the courtroom was somber and hushed as prosecutor Dedy Woei-a-Tsoi read out the names of those who died when MH17 crashed in eastern Ukraine on July 17, 2014.
""The silence in this court during the reading of all the names of the victims makes it (MH-17 disaster) clear once again and that means a moment of silence was fitting,"" Presiding Judge Hendrik Steenhuis said. 
Prosecutors say the suspects helped supply the Russian missile system that downed the plane. Russian authorities have consistently denied any involvement in the missile strike.
The four defendants face preliminary charges of the murder of 298 people and of causing the aircraft to crash, resulting in the death of all aboard.
""Many people have long waited for this day,"" Steenhuis said in opening remarks. ""This tragic loss of so many lives has touched many all over the world.""
'NOBODY EXPECTED A TRIAL AT ALL'
The defendants - Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko - held senior posts in the pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine in 2014, according to prosecutors.
""It is very important for us because nobody had expected there would be a trial at all,"" said Anton Kotti, who lost three family members in the disaster. ""We hope the judge gets so much evidence that he can only come to one conclusion: 'guilty'.""
Sabine ten Doesschate, a lawyer for defendant Platov, told the panel of three judges that her client ""had nothing to do with the crash"" ... He is not responsible, not in any way, not with any participation, not in any capacity."" 
A Dutch-led international Joint Investigation (JIT) team spent years collecting evidence before issuing arrest warrants for the four suspects last year. If convicted, the four men could face sentences of up to life in prison. 
However, Russia does not extradite its citizens, and the Kremlin has questioned both the legitimacy of the international investigation and the independence of the Dutch court. 
""They (defendants) are now under the protection of the regime in Russia...,"" Peter Langstraat, part of the team of lawyers representing 398 relatives of 244 victims, told journalists. Langstraat said he hoped ""the long arm of justice"" would catch up to the suspects eventually.
""Look at what happened to the Lockerbie case,"" he said, referring to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over which a Libyan intelligence officer was jailed for life. ""Finally you know, justice was done.""
Prosecutor Ward Ferdinandusse told the court that the investigation was complicated by ongoing fighting at the crash site in Ukraine and ""active obstruction"" by Russian authorities.
Russia has denied such accusations, and President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, has said the Kremlin will wait to see how the trial pans out before commenting.
Ferdinandusse also said that Ukrainians were sometimes forgotten as additional victims of the plane's destruction.
""Wreckage and bodies fell from the sky, sometimes straight through the roofs of their houses in eastern Ukraine,"" he said.
""Many ordinary citizens and emergency personnel worked in difficult conditions in the midst of an armed conflict to recover the victims' bodies.""
The aircraft's downing led to sanctions against Russia by the European Union. It also heightened tension between Russia and Western countries who blame it for the disaster.

The dead included 196 Dutch citizens, 43 Malaysians and 27 Australians, among others.

Papua police spokesman Ahmad Mustafa Kamal said in a statement ""an armed separatist group had attacked Indonesian police and TNI (army) personnel"" and 917 residents from the Tembagapura district had taken shelter in Timika.
The clashes broke out more than a week ago and Kamal said a police officer had died on Feb. 28, while Dax Sianturi, deputy spokesman of the Papua military command, said an army officer had also been killed on Monday in Timika.
Sianturi denied a claim in a statement by Sebby Sambom, a spokesman for the West Papua National Liberation Army, a separatist group, that five members of the security forces had been shot dead.
Freeport Indonesia spokesman Riza Pratama said by text message that operations at the mine had not been affected by the latest unrest, but asked employees to report immediately any unusual events.
Indonesia's state-owned miner PT Inalum took control of Grasberg, the world's second-biggest copper mine, in late 2018, though Freeport remains the operator.
The area around the Grasberg mine has suffered outbreaks of violence in recent years with separatists declaring they were ""at war"" with the police, military and Freeport. There have also been sporadic shootings and ambushes on vehicles traveling on the main supply route to the mine.
Resource-rich Papua, which shares the island of New Guinea with the nation of Papua New Guinea, was a Dutch colony that was incorporated into Indonesia after a controversial U.N.-backed referendum in 1969. The region has since endured decades of mostly low-level separatist conflict."

European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell unveiled the five-point strategy for member governments to approve ahead of an EU-African summit in October, hoping for a new start with Africa after the 2015 migrant crisis.
""This is one of the most important international partnerships we are going to build,"" Borrell told a news conference. ""Our growth and security depend on what happens in Africa maybe more than in any other part of the world.""
The 18-page plan did not detail how much money the EU plans to spend in African nations but if successful would mean multi-billion euro investments through the EU's budget, its development banks and by attracting private sector finance.
In part, the plan is an attempt to involve Africa in the EU's new policy to make the bloc the world's first ""climate-neutral"" continent by 2050 - not adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere beyond what can be absorbed.
The EU will seek to help finance Africa's fossil fuel-dependent regions' transition to clean industries and retrain workers for higher-tech sustainable growth.
However, aid charities including Oxfam and Caritas warned the plan risked being overshadowed by migration, which since 2015 has marred the EU's relations with Africa as the bloc seeks to close borders, stem arrivals and return migrants to Africa.
While the number of migrants risking their lives to reach Europe has fallen since the 2015-2016 crisis, instability and droughts in the Sahel and the lack of jobs in sub-Saharan Africa mean thousands of people still seek to cross the Mediterranean.
An EU trust fund for Africa set up in 2015 to provide more development money for the continent has so far been mainly focused on deterring migration, non-governmental groups say.
""If the EU does not stop giving with one hand and taking away with the other, this new proposal to foster sustainable growth and development in Africa will be doomed to failure,"" Caritas Africa and Caritas Europa said in a joint statement."

In January, China's embassy in Prague said in a letter sent to the Czech president's office that Beijing would retaliate against Czech companies operating in China if a senior Czech lawmaker went ahead with a planned visit to Taiwan.
The Jan. 10 letter suggested that Czech companies operating in mainland China, such as the Volkswagen (DE:VOWG_p) subsidiary Skoda Auto and lender Home Credit Group, would suffer if then- Senate speaker Jaroslav Kubera visited the island.
Kubera died before he could make the trip. His successor, Milos Vystrcil, is likely to push for China to replace the ambassador, and Babis would support such a demand, Czech Television reported.
""This man is quite distinctive, and what he has written, that is absolutely unacceptable, we must reject that,"" Czech Television quoted Babis as saying.
Four top Czech officials, including President Milos Zeman, who has pushed for closer ties with China in recent years, will meet on Wednesday for a regular debate on foreign policy, where they are expected to address the matter.
Diplomatic ties between the two countries cooled last year when city authorities in Prague showed support for Tibet and demanded changes to an intercity partnership agreement with Beijing over a reference to China's policy on Taiwan.
China quit the agreement and Prague instead entered a partnership with Taipei, the capital of Taiwan. China considers Taiwan part of its territory and has pushed for a ""one country, two systems"" model, which Taiwan rejects. Babis's government has repeatedly said it adheres to the one-China policy.

1331,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 07:08AM ET</span>",Saudi princes' detentions sent a message: don't block my path to the throne,"DUBAI (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's crown prince meant to send a strong message to critics within the royal family by detaining senior princes this weekend: Don't you dare oppose my succession to the throne.
The main target in the crackdown, sources said, is King Salman's brother, Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz, one of only three members of the Allegiance Council, the royal body that endorses the line of succession, to oppose Mohammed bin Salman becoming crown prince in 2017 in a palace coup.
Four sources with royal connections said the move aimed to ensure compliance within the ruling Al Saud family, in which there have been rumblings of discontent, ahead of an eventual succession upon the king's death or abdication.
One of the sources described the detentions as a preemptive effort to ensure Prince Mohammed's ""ascent will be rubber stamped by the Allegiance Council when the time comes"".
Ahmed, 78, was detained on Friday along with Mohammed bin Nayef, who was crown prince until he was ousted in 2017 and replaced by Mohammed bin Salman. Ahmed's son Nayef and Mohammed's brother Nawaf were also detained, said two other sources with royal connections.
The princes have been held at royal villas in the capital Riyadh and some were allowed to contact their families, those sources said.
Crown Prince Mohammed, who has moved ruthlessly to tighten his grip on power, feared disaffected princes might rally around Ahmed and Mohammed bin Nayef as potential alternatives to take the throne, said two of the sources with royal connections, and a senior foreign diplomat.
""This is a preparation for transferring power,"" said one of those sources. ""It is a clear message to the family that no one can say 'No' or dare challenge him.""
Saudi authorities have not confirmed or commented on the detentions, which have not been covered by Saudi media. The media ministry has not responded to detailed requests for comment.
If Mohammed bin Salman, 34, succeeds his father, it will be Saudi Arabia's first generational transfer of power since the death of state founder Abdulaziz Ibn Saud in 1953, who was followed by six of his sons in succession.
The Allegiance Council, made up of one member from each house of 34 sons of Abdulaziz, is designed to ensure that the hundreds of princes that make up the royal family's next generation unite behind the new king.
The senior foreign diplomat said the detentions were another blow to the country's image abroad just as it appeared to be recovering from the furor over the 2018 killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi and criticism of the Yemen war.
Crown Prince Mohammed previously detained senior royals and prominent Saudi businessmen in 2017 at Riyadh's Ritz-Carlton hotel, unnerving investors at home and abroad. More recently, it seemed those days of unpredictability had been put to rest as Riyadh assumed this year's presidency of the Group of 20 major economies.
ROYAL DISCONTENT
When sources initially described the latest detentions in recent days, several of them said the detained princes had been accused of plotting a coup to thwart Mohammed's accession. However, some of those sources, and others who later spoke about the detentions, have since offered milder justifications, describing the arrests as a response to an accumulation of misbehavior rather than a plot against the crown prince.
Two sources used the same phrase, saying the princes were being warned with a ""twist of the ear"" to stop criticizing the crown prince.
While hosting traditional gatherings known as majlis, Prince Ahmed had raised questions about the crown prince's stance on several issues, including a U.S. plan for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one of the sources said.
There was no way to contact Ahmed or the other princes to comment on the allegations. Sources said he returned from a trip abroad the night before he was detained.
Ahmed on Saturday asked his family to deliver his bisht, a traditional coat worn at formal occasions, suggesting he might soon make a public appearance, said two sources including one with royal connections.
Saudi insiders and Western diplomats say the family is unlikely to oppose the crown prince while the king is alive, and the monarch would not turn against his favorite son, to whom he has delegated most responsibilities of rule.
The recent detentions sparked speculation about the health of 84-year-old King Salman, but sources have said he remains mentally and physically sound. State TV on Sunday aired a clip of him accepting oaths of office from two new Saudi ambassadors.
Mohammed bin Nayef's brother Saud and Saud's son, Interior Minister Prince Abdulaziz, who were both rumored to have been among those detained, also appeared conducting official business in photographs published by state media on Sunday.
Royals seeking to change the line of succession have viewed Prince Ahmed as a possible choice who would have support of family members, the security forces and some Western powers, sources have said.
The other two members of the Allegiance Council who opposed Mohammed bin Salman becoming crown prince in 2017 are younger and less prominent than Ahmed. One of them lives abroad.
""Disgruntlement was gathering around him (Prince Ahmed) and he was letting it happen,"" said the fourth source with royal connections.
Critics have questioned the crown prince's ability to lead after the 2018 murder of Khashoggi by Saudi agents and an attack last year on a Saudi oil facility, the sources said.
Some royals became disaffected after Prince Mohammed reigned in traditional largesse for many family members, heavily restricted their movements and replaced their security details with guards who report to him.
Mohammed bin Nayef's movements have been heavily controlled and monitored since 2017.
Ahmed has kept a low profile since returning to Riyadh in October 2018 after 2-1/2 months abroad, when he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the Al Saud's downfall. Saudi watchers say there is no evidence he wants the throne.
The second source with royal connections said the crown prince may have wanted to clear his path before the U.S. presidential election, fearing that a loss by Donald Trump could affect his standing.

The foreign diplomat said he may have moved against his uncle and cousin out of an abundance of caution, fearing that ""the Americans might one day turn to them"".

The deal, reached in Moscow on March 5, was designed to contain a conflict which has displaced nearly a million people in three months and raised the risk of a military clash between Turkey and Russia.
Turkey said at the weekend that there had been no violations of the ceasefire. Operational details of the agreement are yet to be worked out.
Under the deal, they agreed to establish a secure corridor near the M4 highway, which runs east to west through Idlib. They said they would agree on the parameters of the corridor within seven days. Joint patrols there were to begin on March 15.
The corridor will stretch 6 km (about 4 miles) to the north and 6 km to the south of the M4. However, it was not clear what would happen to the pocket of rebels which it will create to the south of the highway.
Russia and Turkey back opposing sides in Syria's nine-year conflict, with Moscow supporting President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey backing some rebel groups. Several previous deals to end the fighting in Idlib have collapsed.
The latest offensive by Assad's forces, backed by Russian air strikes, targeted the last rebel stronghold in the northwest region of Idlib and it sparked what the United Nations says may be the worst humanitarian crisis in the nine-year war.
Turkey, with the second largest army in NATO, has sent military equipment and thousands of troops into the region in recent weeks. President Tayyip Erdogan said on Sunday 59 Turkish soldiers had been killed in the conflict."

KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok survived an assassination attempt early on Monday targeting his convoy in the capital Khartoum, state television and a cabinet source said.
Hamdok, who was appointed to head a transitional government after the overthrow last year of long-time President Omar al-Bashir, was well and had been moved to a safe location, state media reported.
The attack came as Hamdok's government is struggling to manage a severe economic crisis that triggered months of protests against Bashir, and continued after his downfall.
Images broadcast on regional TV channels and social media showed a convoy including several damaged white SUVs and a badly damaged car.
Three witnesses told Reuters the attack happened near the northern entrance to Kober bridge, which connects Khartoum North with the city center, where Hamdok's office is.
The convoy appeared to have been targeted from above, they said. State radio said the convoy had been hit by gunfire and a projectile, while state TV said it had been targeted by a car bomb.
""I saw the moment of the explosion and the strike, and the strike came from a high building,"" one eyewitness said.
Large crowds of onlookers gathered as police tried to secure the site.
Hamdok leads a government of technocrats under a power-sharing agreement between the military and civilian groups for a transitional period due to last until late 2022.
Relations between civilians and the military have been tense, and the government has come up against resistance as it tries to implement economic reforms.
Transitional authorities are also taking steps to disempower Bashir's supporters, including parts of the security services.
In mid-January, armed security agents linked to Bashir fought soldiers in Khartoum for several hours, after a dispute linked to severance packages.
Soon after Bashir's ousting, authorities said they had thwarted several coup attempts by military officers.
""The attempted assassination of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok is the new episode in a series of coup plots against the revolution,"" Khalid Omer, a leading member of the civilian coalition that backed last year's uprising, said on Twitter.
Hamdok is an economist and former senior U.N. official who is well connected with the international community.
Thousands of anti-military protesters have held demonstrations in recent weeks to support Hamdok and his government.
After Monday's attack the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), which spearheaded the anti-Bashir movement, called for further demonstrations to show unity and support for civilian rule."

LUCKNOW, India (Reuters) - The top court in India's most populous state ordered authorities on Monday to remove large displays of the names, pictures and addresses of dozens of anti-government protesters, amid fears that they encourage attacks by vigilante mobs.
The government of Uttar Pradesh in northern India put up six hoardings last week in prominent places in Lucknow, the state capital, identifying people it says joined in violent protests against a new citizenship law based on religion. 
Allahabad High Court in Uttar Pradesh ordered the state government to remove the posters by March 16, saying they were ""an unwarranted interference in (the) privacy of people"".
The state government, run by an ally of India's Hindu nationalist Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will comply with the court order but is considering its ""legal options"", the chief minister's top adviser, Mrityunjay Kumar, said.
The state government accuses the 57 people depicted in the posters of rioting in December, though none has been convicted of any crime. Those depicted accuse the authorities of trying to ""name and shame"" the protesters.
Hundreds of thousands of people have held demonstrations across India since late last year to protest against the citizenship law, which they say discriminates against Muslims.
Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says the law is required to protect non-Muslim refugees across South Asia. 
ENDANGERING LIVES
Criticizing the posters, Sadaf Jafar, the only woman to appear in them, told Reuters: ""The action by the police and administration has made our lives more vulnerable. How will we feel secure in our city?"" 
Jafar said she was considering taking legal action against the government.
While it was not possible to verify the religion of those featured in the posters, the majority had names commonly used by India's minority Muslim population. 
The actions of the government are ""totally illegal"", said S.R. Darapuri, a former police officer who also appeared on the billboards for supporting the protests.
""We are not absconders or hardcore criminals,"" he said. ""The government by this act has put our lives in danger.""
The adviser, Kumar, has previously defended the billboards, saying they are an attempt to recover damages from those accused and insisting on their legality.

India's demonstrations have spurred often-violent clashes between protesters and police, some along sectarian lines, in which more than 70 people have died, a majority in last month's bloodletting between Hindus and Muslims in the capital Delhi.

1340,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 06:19AM ET</span>","Master, president, god? On the trail of Peru's mysterious new political power broker","By Marcelo Rochabrun
LIMA (Reuters) - In Peru's capital, a group dressed in biblical-style robes, veils, and sandals gathered one recent Sunday night to celebrate an unlikely victory: their congregation had overnight become a major force in the country's new Congress.
One by one, a dozen of those who had ran for office paraded on stage, thanking their ""master"" and party president Ezequiel Jonas Ataucusi Molina, who is sometimes revered as a god.
""In 2021, our master will be president!"" proclaimed Esther Yovera, alluding to presidential elections next year.
Ataucusi himself was not there, however. He has ruled the secretive Christian group behind the party for 20 years but has been seen in public just once. Most followers have never met him and so little is known about his day-to-day whereabouts and activities that his sister and some followers have previously gone to the police to report him missing.
The rise of this fringe party, the Agricultural People's Front of Peru (Frepap), is one of the effects of a political upheaval in the copper-rich country that has toppled much of the ruling class - leaving an enigmatic religious leader in charge of the country's no. 3 legislative force.
""As president of our party, he can propose laws, and that's what we are here for, to make them happen,"" said Maria Teresa Cespedes, one of 15 Frepap lawmakers who will be sworn in later this month.
Ataucusi could not be reached for comment.
""He's very busy, as you all know,"" Cespedes added.
While Frepap ran in January's election on a secular platform focused on stronger labor laws and more congressional accountability, over a dozen followers told Reuters that the party's mission is religious at heart.
""Strategically, it is to show the world that we are the chosen people,"" said Isai Huanaco, who has been part of the church since birth and ran unsuccessfully for Congress.
The church, called the Israelite Mission of the New Universal Pact, has for 50 years preached strict Bible adherence, while proclaiming that Peru's most powerful pre-Columbian indigenous people, the Incas, were blessed by the Judeo-Christian God. Its followers have been encouraged to wear robes and colonize remote lands in Peru's rainforest.
Now, their mysterious leader wields potentially significant political power, but his agenda remains unknown. Frepap's elected lawmakers have been noncommittal on potential alliances with other parties while Ataucusi, who has made no known political statements, remains silent.
""I think nobody before the election could have predicted this,"" said Eduardo Dargent, a professor at Peru's Catholic University. ""We'll have to explore it and study it.""
POLITICS AND RELIGION
In a turquoise room awash with burning incense, Felipe Pumacayo, dressed in a gray robe, spoke to a group of believers. He mixed religion and politics, diagnosing Peru as filled with corruption and injustice that needed fixing.
""That's why we have been called on, our people, to know God's commandments and spread them in society,"" he said of Frepap.
The church's services last a full day, from Friday evening running overnight into Saturday. Women sit on the left, men to the right. They sing biblical psalms to the rhythms of ""chicha"" music, created by Andean migrants who moved to Lima.
Juan Caceres, an elder preacher, explained that entering politics was a way to expand the congregation's influence.
""Politics is just another mass media to spread our faith,"" he told Reuters.
Frepap's shock political victory has given the group's oft-repeated concept that they are the chosen people a major boost.
""Our master said the world would come to find us one day,"" said a congregation member who works at a robe store. ""And what finally made us known to the world? It was politics.""
""HE IS GOD""
The church was founded by Ataucusi's father, Ezequiel Ataucusi Gamonal, an indigenous Peruvian who worked as a carpenter and said God spoke to him in a series of revelations.
The elder Ataucusi was a natural orator with a catchy cadence, who founded Frepap in 1989 and ran unsuccessfully for president thrice. After he died in 2000, his followers venerated his corpse for three days, awaiting his resurrection.
That's when the younger Ataucusi took the helm, aged 28. He spoke for four minutes at his inaugural ceremony. Then he was not seen again.
The mystery around him has helped imbue him with a godly aura that is different from his father's.
""To me, in spirit, he is God,"" said Fredy Cabrera, a taxi driver and congregation member. ""In his body resides the holy spirit.""
The congregation celebrates Ataucusi's birthday every Jan. 22, but he has yet to make an appearance. At the end of the night, a church leader diligently gives a reason for his absence.
Those who have met him told Reuters he is shy and dislikes the spotlight. His followers see this as a sign of humility.
Raquel Ataucusi, his younger sister, said he enjoys driving trailer trucks. She has been estranged from her brother and reported him as missing in February, forcing Ataucusi to show up at a police station.
Public records say he lives in a poor settlement in Lima next to a dirt road. On a recent sweltering afternoon, a woman answered the doorbell after about a dozen tries. Ataucusi was away.
""I don't know when he will be back,"" she said."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan is set this week to revise a law allowing Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to declare a formal state of emergency over the coronavirus, if needed, as Abe faces persistent criticism for his handling of the outbreak ahead of the Tokyo Olympic Games.
In perhaps his biggest test since returning to office in 2012, Japan's longest-serving premier has come under fire for what critics have called an initial lack of leadership, followed by abrupt steps like school closures that left parents and employers scrambling.
Japan more than 1,000 cases of the virus including about 700 from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo last month. Fourteen people have died, including seven from the liner. The virus has spread rapidly around the world, with more than 100,000 confirmed cases and 3,600 deaths.
Among criticisms is that Abe's government was too slow to put curbs on visitors from China - a key source of economic growth - after the outbreak originated there late last year. In a recent opinion poll, 50% said they didn't approve of Abe's handling of the outbreak, versus 37% who said they did.
Commentators have also said Japan has lacked sufficient capacity to test for the virus, while failing to mobilize what capacity it has, leading to suspicions that the virus is spreading faster than data show. Vigorous testing programs in countries like South Korea have detected high numbers of infections.
Speculation - denied by organizers - is swirling that the global outbreak will scupper Japan's dream of hosting the Tokyo Olympics, an outcome that could become more likely if a state of emergency is declared. 
""I want the Olympics to succeed more than anyone, but the negative factors are increasing,"" Yoichi Masuzoe, a former Tokyo governor who was health minister during a 2009 influenza epidemic, told Reuters.
In its latest move, the government plans on Tuesday to submit to parliament a bill to revise a 2012 law, enacted after the 2009 epidemic, so it can be applied to the coronavirus if necessary. Parliament is expected to sign off on Friday.
The 2012 law was enacted while Abe's Liberal Democratic Party was in opposition. Officials have said it could not be applied to the coronavirus without changes, although opposition parties and other critics say reinterpreting it is enough.
""APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC""
The law would let the prime minister declare an official state of emergency if the disease poses a ""grave danger"" to lives and if its rapid spread could have a huge impact on the economy. The impact of the virus outbreak is already increasing Japan's risk of recession.
Governors in hard-hit regions could then ask residents to stay inside, close public facilities, expropriate land and buildings for medical facilities and request or order emergency transport of goods. The state of emergency could last up to two years with a possible one year-extension.
In the virus-hit northern island of Hokkaido, the governor declared a state of emergency late last month, although he acknowledged there was no legal basis to do so.
Abe has already requested that schools nationwide close and large-scale events be pared back or canceled.
""Abe could apply the law by re-interpreting it. He's good at that,"" said Masahiro Kami, head of the Medical Governance Research Institute and a critic of the government's response.
Abe's government in 2014 controversially reinterpreted the post-war, pacifist constitution to let troops fight abroad.
""He wants to appeal (to the public) because things are not going well,"" Kami said. He added the most urgent issue was not further limits on public activities, but beefing up virus testing and early treatment of elderly and other high-risk patients.
Abe has not made clear what exactly would trigger a state of emergency, repeating on Monday that the revision was to prepare for a ""worst-case scenario"". 
That has left some analysts thinking he is reluctant to do so for fear of scuppering the Olympics.

""I suspect Abe doesn't want to declare a state of emergency because it would be killing the Olympics himself,"" said Koichi Nakano, political science professor at Sophia University.

1344,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 09, 2020 05:01AM ET</span>",China reports no locally transmitted coronavirus cases outside Hubei,"BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Mainland China, outside Hubei province, reported no new locally transmitted coronavirus cases for the second day on Monday, as a top Communist Party official warned against reducing vigilance and of the risk the epidemic poses for social stability.
China had 40 new confirmed cases of coronavirus infections as of Sunday, the National Health Commission said, down from 44 cases a day earlier, and the lowest number since the health authority started publishing nationwide data on Jan. 20. 
Of the new cases, 36 were in Wuhan, the provincial capital of Hubei, while the remaining four in Gansu province were imported from Iran.
Despite the positive news, Chen Yixin, secretary general of the Communist Party's Politics and Law Commission, said no one should let their guard down.
""We must stay cautious, not be blindly optimistic and must not have war-weariness,"" Chen said.
""We should not reduce the vigilance against the epidemic and the requirements of prevention and control.""
The coronavirus emerged in the central province of Hubei late last year. The new cases on Sunday brought the total accumulated number of cases in mainland China to 80,735.
While the domestic spread of the virus has significantly slowed in recent days, authorities are mindful of risks stemming from people - foreigners and Chinese nationals - traveling back to China from new hot spots abroad.
China's total number of imported cases hit 67 with the four Gansu cases.
Zhong Nanshan, head of the National Health Commission's team investigating the novel coronavirus outbreak, said it would persist globally until at least June, media reported.
Shanghai stepped up airport screening over the weekend as worry about imported infections from countries such as Italy and Iran grew.
There is also concern about the tens of millions of migrant workers returning to offices, malls and factories, triggering a new round of infections.
Chen acknowledged that while the outbreak in Wuhan was improving, control and prevention work was still arduous, according to a statement posted on his commission's Wechat account on Monday.
Chen said epidemics may bring risks to social stability and recommended that the government took precautions and made early plans to ensure peace and stability.
WUHAN AIRPORT EYES REOPENING
Meanwhile, public facilities are slowly getting back to normal.
Wuhan's Tianhe International Airport said in a statement it was preparing to resume work, taking measures such as staff training, equipment maintenance and security inspections. It did not give a date for the resumption of commercial operations.
Walt  Disney  (NYSE:DIS) Co's Shanghai Disneyland said it would partly resume operations in a first step of a phased reopening, though the main theme park would stay shut.
The resort has been closed since Jan. 25. 
Trip.com, China's largest online travel firm, said in an internal letter its senior executives were taking a pay cut of up to half their salaries, while chief executive Jane Sun and Chairman James Liang would stop taking salaries from March, to help the company weather the impact of the outbreak.
As of Sunday, 58,600 patients had been discharged from Chinese hospitals. Authorities are aware of the potential for re-infection and have told recently discharged patients to go into quarantine for 14 days.
On Saturday, a small hotel used to quarantine people under observation in Fujian province collapsed, killing 11.Of the 71 people inside the hotel in Quangzhou city at the time of the collapse, 58 were in under quarantine, the Quangzhou city government said.
The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China reached 3,119 as of the end of Sunday, up 22 from the previous day. 
Hubei, the center of the outbreak, reported 21 new deaths. In Wuhan city, 18 people died. 

Total deaths outside of mainland China have surpassed 500, with most in Italy and Iran. Cases are increasing in other countries, including the United States.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's President Moon Jae-in expressed guarded hope for the country's fight against the coronavirus on Monday, saying an ongoing downward trend in new infections could lead to a phase of stability.
But he warned against prematurely calling the peak of the coronavirus outbreak, as new cases continued to emerge from smaller clusters.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported 69 new coronavirus cases, although a more complete figure would be provided in another update later on Monday.
The new cases brought South Korea's total infections to 7,382, while the death toll rose by one to 51, the KCDC said.
The rate of increase in new infections fell to its lowest level in 10 days on Sunday.
South Korea is one of the countries most severely affected outside mainland China.
Moon said South Korea can enter the ""phase of stability"" soon if it continues to reduce the number of new cases.
""We must maintain this trend"", he told a meeting with senior aides. ""We've come this far thanks to the citizens who were united and cooperated well with the government.""
""But it's too early to be optimistic...Please be a little bit more patient and stay away from mass gatherings such as religious events"", Moon added.
Health authorities say the number of new infections being identified has dwindled as most of the roughly 200,000 followers of a fringe Christian church at the center of the epidemic in the hard-hit southeastern city of Daegu have now been tested.
Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun also said at a separate meeting that he was still extremely cautious but ""there's hope we can reach a turning point in the near future"".
Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said it was premature to say the crisis was over, pointing to newly confirmed infections from smaller clusters such as hospitals and nursing homes.
""In fact, now is the time to concentrate all our capabilities to bring a clear reduction in infections"", Kim told a briefing.
South Korea started rationing surgical masks on Monday after imposing an export ban amid panic buying. Dozens of citizens were seen lining up outside pharmacies across the country.
CANCELED FLIGHTS, CONCERTS
Mutual travel restrictions imposed by South Korea and Japan also took effect, an issue that rekindled a diplomatic and economic feud between the old foes.
South Korea suspended visas and visa waivers for Japan on Friday, after Tokyo announced travel restrictions, joining more than 100 other countries limiting arrivals from South Korea.
The spat, together with oil price swings, sent South Korean shares and the won sharply lower and prompted the finance ministry to issue a verbal warning against disorderly market movement.
A series of K-pop concerts planned in Japan has been called off or postponed, including by Super Junior, Stray Kids and CJ ENM which had planned a major annual festival featuring TWICE and IZ*ONE.
Korean Air, which had previously operated 17 flights to Japan, said it had stopped all but one between Seoul and Tokyo, while Asiana Airlines halted all of its 11 routes for the first time since it started flying to Japan 30 years ago, company officials said."

The one-day action dubbed ""a day without us"" is intended to show what life would be like if women vanished from society. In Mexico, the strike stems from a surge in disappearances of women and femicides, or gender-motivated killings of women.
Femicides in Mexico jumped 137% in the past five years, government statistics show, as gang violence pushed the national murder tally to record heights. Most violent crimes go unsolved.
On Sunday, women took to the streets in unprecedented numbers across Latin America as part of International Women's Day, demanding abortion rights and action from leaders to stem the violence.
The mostly peaceful protests saw anger boiling over into some outbreaks of violence, such as Molotov cocktails thrown at Mexico's national palace, after the killing of a 7-year-old and the murder and skinning of a young woman shocked the nation.
The impact of Monday's strike, in contrast, will stem from the absence of women in businesses, universities and government ministries. Not all women, however, will take part.
""We are tired of being victims, of being abused and mistreated. Enough is enough,"" said Alma Delia Díaz, 45, a beautician in the Mexico City suburb of Ecatepec.
Diaz said she supported women making their voice heard, but personally could not miss a day's work.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said government employees are free to join the walkout. But he has also accused political opponents of seeking to exploit Mexico's security problems to undermine his administration."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two schools in the Australian city of Sydney closed on Monday after three students tested positive for the coronavirus, taking Australia's tally of cases to more than 80 as the government prepares a fiscal stimulus to ward off recession.
Australia has seen a worrying increase in coronavirus cases in the past couple of days, though Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the majority were travelers who caught the virus abroad, with only one instance of community transmission. 
Two year-10 students at Sydney's St Patrick's Marist College Dundas had tested positive for the virus while a year-7 pupil tested positive at the Willoughby Girls High School.
""This is likely to be the new norm,"" said Brad Hazzard the minister of health for New South Wales state.
The school closures come days after another high school in Sydney shut down when a 16-year-old there tested positive.
Epping Boys High School reopened on Monday though nearly 70 students and staff who had close contact with the infected student remained in self-isolation.
The coronavirus has infected 107,000 people around the world in an ever-growing list of countries and caused hefty economic damage, prompting central banks to ease monetary policies. 
Three people have died in Australia.
""This is a public health emergency of an unprecedented nature that our nation and that the entire global community is facing,"" the health minister of Victoria state, Jenny Mikakos, told a televised briefing.
Her state also recorded a jump in the number of cases after two people who recently arrived from the United States and one who returned from Iran were diagnosed as infected with the virus.
""We do anticipate that this likely pandemic will have significant impacts on our health system. This has been my absolute focus, making sure that our system is prepared to respond,"" Mikakos said.
Worries about the hit to the economy saw nearly A$108 billion ($70.5 billion) wiped off Australian shares (AXJO) in yet another day of panic selling in global financial markets. 
FISCAL RE-THINK?
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) last week became the first in the developed world to ease monetary policy to fight the economic fallout.
The government is finalizing a fiscal stimulus package though the size of the measure is not known.
An announcement on the likely A$10 billion package is expected this week, media reported.
Economists are less optimistic about the scale of the stimulus.
Citi economist Josh Williamson expects an initial package of A$3 billion to A$5 billion, or about 0.1% of Australia's gross domestic product. 
""Such a package would be designed to offset the expected loss of output, rather than deliver a material boost to activity that closes the negative output gap that existed prior to COVID-19,"" he added, referring to the illness caused by the virus.

""If the broader economy is impacted more severely than currently assumed, then the government could be forced to rethink its fiscal strategy in May, that is, abandon hopes of a near-term budget surplus and bring forward other stimulatory measures.""

He will present the list of ministers to the king before making an announcement in the afternoon, his office said.
Muhyiddin could tap someone with finance experience as the finance minister or keep the role himself and name a technocrat as his deputy in the department, said a source who spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of an official announcement.
One of the top contenders for a ministerial position in the finance department is Mustapa Mohamed, an economist turned politician from Muhyiddin's party, the source and another person with knowledge of the matter said.
The prime minister's office declined to comment. Mustapa did not respond to requests for comment.
While the current government that replaced a multi-ethnic one could steer policies towards Malay nationalism, its immediate priority would be to try and shield Southeast Asia's third biggest economy from the impact of the coronavirus spread.
Malaysia has so far reported 99 cases of coronavirus infection.
The government has cut its growth forecast for this year and announced a 20 billion ringgit ($4.76 billion) stimulus package. The economy grew at its slowest pace in a decade in the fourth quarter.
The sharp fall in world oil prices, which intensified on Monday, will also be a drag on the country, the world's third-biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas. Another worry is its diplomatic row with India, the biggest buyer of Malaysian palm oil."

SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea launched multiple short-range projectiles into the sea on Monday as part of ongoing firing drills, a week after it resumed missile tests following a three-month break, South Korea's military said.
The projectiles included artillery fired from a multiple launch rocket system (MLRS) and flew up to 200 kms (124 miles) and reached 50 km in altitude, according to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS).
They were launched from the eastern coastal town of Sondok, home to a military airfield where nuclear-armed North Korea fired missiles last year, the JCS said in a statement.
The JCS said the latest test appeared to be part of firing drills that have been under way since late last month and personally overseen by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. 
After a three-month halt in missile testing, North Korea tested an MLRS on March 2, which Seoul officials said was part of the same exercises.
The JCS expressed ""strong regret"" over the launch and said it was watching for additional tests. 
South Korean national security advisor Chung Eui-yong held a video meeting with the defense minister and intelligence chief to analyze the North's latest test and intent, the presidential Blue House said. 
""The ministers once again pointed out that the continued firing drills are unhelpful for efforts to build lasting peace on the Korean peninsula,"" the Blue House said in a statement. 
Japanese Defence Minister Taro Kono said the projectiles appeared to be ballistic missiles and did not fall into Japan's exclusive economic zone, though the government was examining details about the launch. 
A U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the subject, said North Korea had fired at least three projectiles towards the eastern sea and a detailed analysis was being conducted. 
Britain, Germany, France, Estonia and Belgium raised North Korea's recent missile firings at the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, calling them a provocative action that violated U.N. resolutions.
Pyongyang's foreign ministry slammed the European action as ""U.S.-instigated reckless behaviour"", and the sister of Kim Jong Un said the drills were not meant to threaten anyone.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's senior royals will come together on Monday for what is expected to be the last family gathering before Prince Harry and his wife Meghan set off on a new career path.
The Commonwealth Service at London's Westminster Abbey is an annual event that this year brings together Harry and Meghan with Queen Elizabeth, his elder brother William and wife Kate, and father Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, for the first time in public since the couple thrashed out an exit deal from their royal roles in January.
""It will be fascinating to see how it plays out,"" said royal biographer Penny Junor. ""I imagine everybody will be on absolutely best behavior. But goodness knows what they will all be thinking privately.""
The January agreement, which comes into action at the end of the month, will see the couple - the Duke and Duchess of Sussex - seek to carve out ""a progressive new role"", mainly based in North America, that they aim to finance themselves.
Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, will stop using their HRH titles - His or Her Royal Highness, will not use ""royal"" in their branding and Harry, who will remain a prince, will relinquish his military titles.
Their announcement two months ago that they wished to step back from some of their royal duties sent shockwaves through the monarchy. It led to a crisis meeting involving the 93-year-old queen, her heir Charles, William and Harry that concluded he and Meghan would have to give up all their royal duties.
The couple have spent most of their time since in Canada, but returned at the start of the month for a farewell round of engagements. Harry and Meghan's baby son Archie has remained behind in Canada.
Monday's event to mark Commonwealth Day is expected to be their last official appearance, with no certainty about when the royal family will next be seen together.
""Our hope was to continue serving the queen, the Commonwealth and my military associations without public funding. Sadly that wasn't possible,"" the prince, the sixth-in-line to the throne, said in a speech in January.
'GIVING UP EVERYTHING'
Polls show Harry, whose mother was the late Princess Diana, is one of the most popular royals. Junor said his leaving would be a huge loss for the family and the institution itself.
""I thought that he had absolutely embraced his destiny as a member of the royal family,"" she told Reuters. ""He recognized what he could do with his position, the power he had to change things for good. I think he will miss that ability to make people's lives better.""
However, Harry, who served in the military for 10 years, has never hidden his discomfort with his royal role and the intense media attention it attracts. He has spoken candidly about his mental health struggles following his mother's death. 
He has also been angered by the treatment his American wife, a former actress, has received from some British tabloids, which he has described as bullying. She has also said how difficult she found it.
Junor said Harry might find life in the United States and Canada difficult away from his family, friends and former life.
""He is giving up everything he's known, a huge family that he's very close to and his work to go and live in Canada where he actually knows nobody and he has no job,"" she said.
Last weekend, Harry and the queen had a meeting at her Windsor Castle home to discuss his future. A royal source confirmed a report in the Sun newspaper that the queen told Harry he would always be welcome to rejoin the royal fold. 
""I could imagine Harry coming back,"" Junor said. 

""I hope that they will not wake up one day and think 'what on earth have we done and what does life hold for us? We're sitting in paradise ... but what else do we have in life?' I hope that doesn't happen to them.""

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The first hearing in the trial of four fugitive suspects in the downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 was set to start in Amsterdam on Monday, more than five years after the plane was downed in Ukraine.
Prosecutors say the suspects, three Russians and a Ukrainian, helped arrange the Russian missile system used to shoot down MH17, a civilian aircraft. The suspects are believed to be in Russia and are not expected to attend.
MH17 was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur on July 17, 2014, when it was shot down by a missile fired from territory held by pro-Moscow rebels amid fighting in eastern Ukraine, killing all 298 aboard. Russia has denied any involvement.
The judges' first order of business will be to verify whether the suspects have appointed lawyers to defend them, and to lay out a timetable for the case to proceed.
A Dutch-led international Joint Investigation (JIT) team spent years collecting evidence before issuing arrest warrants last year for the four suspects: Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin, and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko.
They are presumed innocent until proven guilty. Girkin has said rebels were not responsible for the plane's downing and declined further comment. Others could not be reached for comment.
Countries participating in the investigation - Ukraine, the Netherlands, Australia, Malaysia and Belgium - agreed in 2017 to hold trials in the Netherlands under Dutch law after attempts to set up a U.N.-backed tribunal foundered over Russian opposition.
Prosecutors say the suspects face preliminary charges of the murder of 298 people and of causing the aircraft to crash, resulting in the death of all aboard.
If convicted, the men could face sentences of up to life in prison. However, Russia does not extradite its citizens, and the Kremlin has questioned both the legitimacy of the international investigation and the independence of the court.
It is possible the suspects will participate via video link. Families of victims are expected to attend the hearings.
""We think that Russia still has some answers to give us,"" Sander van Luik, whose brother died in the crash, said at a protest in front of the Russian Embassy in The Hague on Sunday.
The downing of the plane led to sanctions against Russia by the European Union, which repeated its support for the court this weekend.
Two weeks have been scheduled for the initial proceedings."

Nearly 50,000 voting machines and almost 600 computers went up in flames as a result of the fire that broke out on Saturday, said elections council chief Tibisay Lucena.
""There was little that could be rescued,"" Lucena said in a statement broadcast on state television.
""If there are small groups (of people) who think that this will end our constitutionally established electoral processes, they are very wrong.""
She did not elaborate on how many voting machines were still available for use, or how the incident would affect future elections.
Lucena said she had asked state prosecutors to look into the cause of the blaze, which did not cause any injuries.
The South American country's elections have come under heavy criticism since President Nicolas Maduro's 2018 re-election was widely dismissed as rigged in his favor, leading dozens of governments around the world to disavow his government in 2019.
Smartmatic, the company that manufactures the equipment, halted its Venezuelan operations in 2017 after a disputed referendum to create a parliamentary superbody known as the Constituent Assembly. The firm said the results of that vote had been inflated by at least 1 million votes in favor of the government.
Venezuela holds elections this year for parliament, which is currently controlled by the opposition. Maduro's adversaries are demanding that the country instead hold a new presidential election, and have not yet said whether they will participate in the legislative election. A date for that vote has not been set."

GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - Guyana's top court on Sunday upheld an injunction blocking the elections commission from proclaiming a winner in this month's presidential election, delaying the results of a vote that has been marred by accusations of fraud.
A protester was killed and demonstrators took to the streets after diplomats described credible evidence of fraud in the vote, which will decide who leads the former British colony that is at the edge of an oil boom set to transform its economy.
Chief Justice Roxane George said during a court session on Sunday that she would begin hearing the case on Tuesday to determine whether elections officials will need to resume verification of votes in an area known as Region Four.
The opposition says Region Four results were released without verifying the votes at more than half of the polling stations, and that the results were inflated to put President David Granger ahead of opposition challenger Irfaan Ali.
The injunction prevents the elections commission from declaring a winner while the court reviews the case.
The elections commission in a statement on Sunday promised to uphold its constitutional duties.
""While it is unfortunate how things have escalated, it is the intention of the Guyana Elections Commission to abide by all legal and procedural requirements,"" the commission said.
Granger's office did not respond to a request for comment on the court decision.
Prior to the decision, Granger said he could not interfere in the work of the elections commission.
The disputed vote may fuel long-simmering ethnic tensions between two groups, the country's Afro-Guyanese and those of Indian descent, each of which has grown suspicious that the other is seeking control over revenues from oil production.
Guyana, which has a population of less than 800,000, is expected to become a major oil producer in the coming years as a consortium of companies including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) taps into 8 billion barrels of oil and gas off its coast."

Just over a week after the Islamist militant group and the United States signed a deal intended to end an 18-year-old war, many Afghan women are worried about what it will mean for their rights.
""We respect women, we congratulate our women - mothers, sisters, wives and relatives - but not under the name of 8th March, as Women's Day, because it is not in Islam and Sharia,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said.
The Taliban did not allow women to be educated or leave the house without a male relative when it ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, and forced them to cover their faces.
The group says it would now allow women to be educated and work. But many women worry that the deal reached last month with the United States does not include adequate safeguards of women's rights.
They fear a U.S. troop withdrawal, the winding down of international engagement and re-emergence of the Taliban in politics will see progress for women since 2001 snuffed out.
""I think we women do not need the Taliban to congratulate us on Women's Day... women used the day to show the Taliban that women will not go backwards,"" said Fawzia Koofi, a politician and women's rights activist.
The U.S. Embassy tweeted a photo of U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad meeting judges, many of them women. NATO posted a video of its civilian representative, Nicholas Kay, promising to support peace built on full respect for women's rights.
European ambassadors wrote an opinion piece for popular media organization Tolo supporting women's rights. Afghanistan's first lady, Rula Ghani, said ""no decision on peace will be taken without their presence and behind the curtains in the hope of a permanent peace in our beloved country.""
But Lina Rozbih, a Washington-based Afghan journalist, expressed the doubts of other when she tweeted in Dari.
""If (Taliban spokesmen) Suhail Shaheen or Zabihullah Mujahid, today on the occasion of Women's Day, tweeted and congratulated Afghan women, we can keep hope that they are changed ... if not, they are the old Taliban,"" she tweeted."

ATLANTA (Reuters) - With a wide smile and arms outstretched, but quickly dropped into double elbow bumps, James Harper warmly greets fellow congregants at Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic Church on Sunday in Atlanta's Old Fourth Ward neighborhood.
""We're all tight here,"" said Harper, 51, a salesman. ""Normally it's nothing but deep hugs. But it's a different day now.""
Churches across the United States are advising parishioners to avoid direct contact with fellow members as an oft-reiterated warning against spreading the coronavirus, which emerged in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19. 
At least 19 people have died out of about 450 reported cases in the United States. The outbreak has killed more than 3,600 worldwide.
Reverend Jeffery Ott, pastor of Our Lady of Lourdes, said that the biggest change on Sunday was omitting the ceremonial sharing of wine in the common cup, or chalice, during the Holy Communion service, as well as receiving the wafer or bread in the hand only, not the mouth.
""Traditionalist may want the service, but this is not just the flu,"" he said. ""We are all responsible to stop the spread.""
The instructions, now widespread across archdioceses across the nation, involve changes to relatively new ceremonies, such as the exchange of peace, which was introduced in the 1960s, as well as age-old traditions such as Holy Communion that are at the core of Catholic ritual.
Thomas Groome, a professor of theology at Boston College and a former priest, said the new measures show how seriously the church is taking the risks of coronavirus.
""All of these things are traditions that many are sentimental about,"" he said. ""But none of these symbols are essentials to the church.""
Traditionally Catholics embrace or shake hands during the so-called ""exchange of peace"" while repeating the greeting ""peace be with you."" 
But the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta is one of many that have told parishes to discourage physical contact during the ritual, which is designed to remind worshippers they are members of a community. Some dioceses want the ""peace"" ceremony eliminated all together until the coronavirus outbreak abates. 
As an alternative to touching, the Archdiocese of New York is encouraging worshippers to wave at fellow parishioners during the greeting, said Joseph Zwilling, a spokesman for the archdiocese.
Groome said that at his church in Boston, the congregation nods or trades fist-bumps.
""This is the responsible thing to do,"" he said.
In the Archdiocese of Miami, churches have been urged to empty the holy water fonts at the church doors as a precaution. When entering a church, many Catholics dip their fingers in the fonts and make the sign of the cross with the water which a priest had blessed. Experts say it is an obvious conduit for infection.
Keeping people healthy is more important than tradition, Reverend Ott said.

""Some of our older members might not like the changes but we have to be responsible,"" he said.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan urged Greece on Sunday to ""open your gates"" to refugees trying to enter the European Union from Turkey and said he hoped to win more help from the EU at talks on Monday.
Tens of thousands of migrants have been trying to get into Greece, an EU member state, since Turkey said on Feb. 28 it would no longer try to keep them on its territory - as agreed in 2016 with the EU in return for billions of euros in aid.
Turkey hosts about 3.6 million war refugees from Syria, where its troops and allied rebel forces are battling Russian-backed government forces, and says the EU has failed to honor promises made to Ankara. 
""We were hoping to get much more support from the international community when it comes to refugees,"" Erdogan said in a speech in Istanbul. ""I have a meeting with European Union officials tomorrow in Belgium. We will discuss these issues."" 
In response, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said ""negotiating on the backs of the weakest"" would not yield the desired result.
More than 1 million migrants, mostly from the Middle East and Asia, reached the EU in 2015 and 2016, most of them traveling through Turkey and Greece, until the agreement stopped the flow in March 2016. Turkey now fears a new influx of refugees following the latest fighting in Syria. 
""We have fulfilled the obligations of the agreement we have made with the EU. However, the EU did not fulfill its commitments except for minimal contributions ... I hope we will achieve different results this time,"" Erdogan said.
""FAIR SHARING OF THE BURDEN""
Under the 2016 deal, the EU was to provide 6 billion euros ($6.8 billion) to help Turkey finance housing, schools and medical centers for the refugees. Erdogan said Turkey had received only half of this so far.
Turkey says the EU has not carried out promises of visa-free travel for Turkish citizens and an enhanced customs union. Ankara also wants more European support in Syria, where it aims to build settlements for refugees to return to northern Syria.
Erdogan is due to meet Charles Michel, who chairs summits of EU leaders, and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the EU's executive Commission. 
""If there is a shortage of money for providing essential humanitarian aid to refugees, whether in Turkey, Idlib or Jordan and Lebanon, we (the EU) will never refuse to talk,"" Maas told Funke newspapers on Sunday. ""But that depends on Turkey sticking to its side of the bargain.""
EU foreign ministers said last week they were ready to take ""all necessary measures"" to stop illegal crossings into Greece, but Erdogan said the migrants would not stay in Greece once they had crossed.
""Greece, I am calling on you from here, you too should open your gates and let them go,"" he said. ""We are looking for fair sharing of the burden.""

Greece says it has thwarted thousands of attempts by migrants to cross by land from Turkey since last week.

MADRID (Reuters) - Thousands of women across Spain marched on Sunday against gender inequality to mark International Women's Day, despite concerns the gatherings could help the spread of coronavirus.
Bearing flags and banners denouncing gender violence, a crowd of purple-clad women paraded down one of Madrid's main avenues toward the city center, chanting over booming drums.
One protester held a sign that read: ""Machismo kills more than coronavirus.""
""We must be strong and fight for the rights of all of us, to be equal, to be paid as much as men,"" One of the drummers, Marina Martin, told Reuters.
Spain's women's rights movement has emerged as a formidable political force since five men were jailed in 2016 for sexual abuse after gang-raping a young woman at the Pamplona bull-running festival.
Responding to discontent with Spain's sexual violence laws, the leftwing government has approved a bill to qualify all non-consensual sex as rape. Previously a perpetrator had to have used physical violence or intimidation for an assault to be classified as rape.
But the issue remains divisive, with far-right Vox - Spain's third-largest party - resisting the new legislation, which it says discriminates against men.
A number of events have been called off or postponed in Spain to minimize the possibility of the coronavirus spreading but health emergency coordinator Fernando Simon said on Saturday the Health Ministry did not consider the marches a risk.
Health Minister Salvador Illa appealed on Sunday to those with symptoms not to attend the demonstrations.
""I want to emphasize that people with symptoms should not go to the march ... people with symptoms should stay home and self-isolate,"" he said.
According to the latest official figures Spain has 589 confirmed cases of the virus, 202 of them in Madrid."
1361,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 08, 2020 02:30PM ET</span>",Italy locks down millions as its coronavirus deaths jump,"By James Mackenzie and Crispian Balmer
MILAN (Reuters) - Italy ordered a virtual lockdown across much of its wealthy north, including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic new attempt to try to contain a outbreak of coronavirus that saw the number of deaths leap again sharply on Sunday.
The unprecedented restrictions, which aim to limit gatherings and curb movement, will impact some 16 million people and stay in force until April 3. They were signed into law overnight by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte.
The new measures say people should not enter or leave Lombardy, Italy's richest region, as well as 14 provinces in four other regions, including the cities of Venice, Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini.
Only people with proven, work-related reasons, or health problems will be able to move in and out of the exclusion zones. Leave has been canceled for health workers.
""We are facing a national emergency. We chose from the beginning to take the line of truth and transparency and now we're moving with lucidity and courage, with firmness and determination,"" said Conte.
""We have to limit the spread of the virus and prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed,"" he told a news conference called in the early hours of Sunday.
Italy has been hit harder by the crisis than anywhere else in Europe so far and Sunday's latest figures showed that starkly.
The number of coronavirus cases jumped 25% in a 24-hour period to 7,375, while deaths climbed 57% to 366 deaths. It was the largest daily increase for both readings since the contagion came to light on Feb. 21.
Antonio Pesenti, head of the Lombardy regional crisis response unit, told the Corriere della Sera newspaper the health system in Lombardy was ""a step away from collapse"" as intensive care facilities came under growing strain from the new cases.
""We're now being forced to set up intensive care treatment in corridors, in operating theaters, in recovery rooms. We've emptied entire hospital sections to make space for seriously sick people,"" he said. 
The Milan stock exchange, whose all-share index has plunged 17% since the crisis broke, was scheduled to open normally on Monday but one trader said he expected ""a violent sell-off"" as markets digested the lockdown of Italy's economic heartland.
The World Health Organization said it fully supported the actions taken by Italy, which were in line with its guidelines for containing the spread of the virus.
But with the Italian economy already on the edge of recession, some local politicians pushed back against the measures, which leaked out before the regions were consulted. 
The head of Veneto, Luca Zaia, complained he had not been properly consulted and was unhappy that three provinces in his region, including Venice, had been included in the clampdown.
""We do not understand the rationale of a measure that appears scientifically disproportionate to the epidemiological trend,"" he wrote on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
CHURCHES, MUSEUMS, SPORTS EVENTS CLOSED
On Saturday, health officials had expressed alarm at the apparent lack of concern in the general public, as fine weekend weather attracted large crowds to the ski slopes outside Milan. But streets were notably quieter than normal as northern cities woke up to the news on Sunday.
""What is happening in my city is worrying me and it is also saddening, because Milan is a lively city and to see it like this today is almost a defeat for me,"" said resident Lucia Navone. ""I never would have thought this would happen."" 
Public transport services were operating and train stations were still running as people caught away from home when the measures came into force were allowed to return. 
But national carrier Alitalia said it would suspend international and domestic services from Milan's main Malpensa airport from Monday and operate only domestic flights from the smaller Linate airport. 
There was some confusion about what controls there would be from Monday on shops, offices and factories. Assolombarda, a business association that represents employers in Lombardy, said it understood the measures would not stop businesses from working or block deliveries of supplies of goods provided appropriate protective measures were adopted.
However, all museums, gyms, cultural centers, ski resorts and swimming pools in the targeted zones will have to close.
Top flight Serie A soccer matches were played behind closed doors despite a call from the country's sports minister to stop the championship. The Italian Soccer Federation said it would meet on Tuesday to discuss the situation.
Restaurants and bars will be allowed to open from 6:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. (0500-1700 GMT) and only if they can guarantee that customers are at least one meter (yard) apart. 
FIPE, a body representing restaurants and catering businesses, said the sector faced devastation and criticized measures that it called ""incoherent and difficult to apply"".
Church services on Sunday were also canceled in the region.
Pope Francis delivered his Sunday blessing over the internet from inside the Vatican instead of from a window to stop crowds gathering in St Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ) to see him.
On Sunday, the head of Piedmont region said he had tested positive for the virus despite having no symptoms -- the second regional chief to be infected in 24 hours -- while Army Chief of Staff General Salvatore Farina also contracted the illness.
As the alarm spread, Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said Italy should ban all its citizens from traveling to Europe. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said it was only a matter of time until more European countries adopt the kind of aggressive steps that Italy is taking to combat the spread of the virus.

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkish police used tear gas to disperse a few dozen women who were still in central Istanbul after trying to march on Sunday evening to celebrate International Women's Day.
Reuters reporters saw the crowd, which was originally few hundred women, at the edge of Taksim Square (NYSE:SQ) holding banners and waving flags. The police formed a human blockade to stop them from entering Istiklal Street, the district's main pedestrian avenue.
A large part of the crowd dispersed as they were not allowed to march on Istiklal Street.
Istanbul's governor Ali Yerlikaya decided to close down Taksim metro station and parts of nearby Sishane station and said all roads leading to main square would be blocked.
""All roads leading to Taksim Square and Istiklal Street will be closed as these places are not classified as designated areas for assembly and demonstrations according to law,"" the governor's office said in a statement.
The government did allow some activities by non-governmental organizations to celebrate International Women's Day around the city, the statement said. But it said the gathering in Istiklal Street was not granted a permit.

Last year, on International Women's Day, the police had fired tear gas to break up a crowd of women who had gathered for a march.

WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Americans, especially those who are vulnerable, may need to stop attending big gatherings as the coronavirus spreads through U.S. communities, a top health official said on Sunday, as investors braced for another volatile week in financial markets.
Anthony Fauci, the head of the infectious diseases unit at the National Institutes of Health, said on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that after initial missteps distributing tests, there should be 400,000 more tests available by Monday and 4 million by the end of the week.
In the United States, 19 people have died out of about 450 reported cases of coronavirus, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19. The outbreak has killed more than 3,600 globally.
More than half of the 50 U.S. states have reported cases, including the first cases in Virginia and Connecticut on Sunday. As the outbreak spreads, daily life has been increasingly disrupted, with concerts and conferences canceled and universities telling students to stay home and take classes online.
To contain the outbreak in China, the government quarantined millions of people for weeks. Italy has announced similar measures, locking down 16 million people in the north of the country.
As recently as Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump said he would continue to hold his political rallies, which sometimes draw up to 20,000 people. The Democrats competing to challenge him in the Nov. 3 presidential election, U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders and former Vice President Joe Biden, have not canceled any campaign events so far.
Germany, which has nearly 1,000 cases, on Sunday urged the cancellation of all events with more than 1,000 people.
Fauci said authorities in the United States may also need to consider steps to keep people out of crowded places if the virus continued to spread.
Still, he downplayed the likelihood of the type of large-scale quarantines put in place in China and Italy, while saying nothing could be ruled out.
""I don't imagine that the degree of the draconian nature of what the Chinese did would ever be either feasible, applicable, doable or whatever you want to call it in the United States,"" he said in an interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air on Sunday night. ""But the idea of social distancing, I mean, obviously, that's something that will be seriously considered.""
He urged those most at risk to limit travel.
""If you're a person with an underlying condition and you are particularly an elderly person with an underlying condition you need to think twice about getting on a plane, on a long trip, and not only think twice, just don't get on a cruise ship,"" Fauci said on ""Meet the Press.""
U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams told CNN cases would rise, adding that the average age of death for people with the virus was 80, and the average age of those needing medical attention was 60.
""Unfortunately, you are going to see more deaths, but that doesn’t mean that we should panic,” he said. Communities need to “prepare for more cases so we can prevent more deaths,” Adams said.
In financial markets, talk about recessions and bear markets was growing as investors try to assess how badly the outbreak will damage global growth. Many strategists have turned more pessimistic in recent days and are anticipating further market drops and a possible end to the longest economic expansion in U.S. history.
CRUISE SHIP CRISIS
The hardest hit place in the United States has been a nursing home in a suburb of Seattle and Washington state is considering mandatory measures such as banning large gatherings but not necessarily imposing massive quarantines, the governor said.
The cruise ship Grand Princess, barred from returning to San Francisco last week due to a coronavirus outbreak on board, will send its 2,400 passengers to at least four quarantine centers. The crew of 1,100 will be quarantined and treated on board the ship.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said the number of cases in New York is now 105 and he expects that to rise as testing expands.
""What we are really trying to do here is avoid the massive disruption of closing everything down for two weeks the way China did, the way Italy is doing,"" he said.
Cuomo said a lawyer from Westchester County who is believed to be at the center of the outbreak there had attended a number of large gatherings, contributing to the roughly 70 people in Westchester who have tested positive.
""It's these large gatherings where you can expose a number of people in a very short period of time and then it's like dominoes, right, then the tree continues to expand with branches."""

ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Islamists pelted campaigners with stones, shoes and sticks as they marched through Pakistan's capital on Sunday to mark International Women's Day.
Women and men joined the event in Islamabad, the largest such rally in the country, for what is known in Pakistan as the Aurat March, using the Urdu word for women.
Dozens of men and women from the Red Mosque brigade, consisting of several local militant groups, staged a rival rally just across from the women's march venue, District Deputy Commissioner Hamza Shafqaat said.
Police official Mazhar Niazi said the officers blocked the Islamists as they tried to break through a cordon to attack the marchers.
A Reuters witness and Niazi said the Islamists threw stones, bricks, sticks and shoes at the marchers. Niazi said no one was injured.
He said a criminal case would be registered against the Islamists for violating the law and attempting to attack the women march.
There has been an uproar in conservative circles over slogans used at the past two such events, including ""My body, my choice"", ""My body is not your battleground"" and ""Stop being menstrual phobic"".
Following last year's event, organizers said they faced a backlash including murder and rape threats.
Ahead of this year's event, organizers say posters and murals were vandalized, including one by the Islamists from the Red Mosque.
Marches in other parts of the country were held peacefully amid tight security.
A court in the eastern city of Lahore allowed the march there to take place on condition that organizers and participants adhered to ""decency and moral values""."

Last month was the wettest February on record for the United Kingdom, with a succession of storms bringing widespread flooding to many areas.
Johnson was repeatedly criticized by opposition politicians at the height of the flooding for not visiting affected communities.
With waters now having subsided, Johnson on Sunday visited Bewdley in central England to see the recovery operation.
Television footage showed one man shouting ""Traitor!"" at the prime minister. A Reuters photographer heard some people booing Johnson, while others asked why he had waited until now to come.
Some residents said they were happy that he had now visited.
""There is no water here but you can still see the effects,"" local resident Paul Smith, whose home was flooded, told Sky News. ""We are just glad to see him here eventually.""
Speaking to reporters during his visit, Johnson said: ""It is all too easy for a prime minister to come to a place in the middle of an emergency, it is not so easy frankly for the emergency services because ... they are then diverted from their work for hours and hours.""
""What I have been doing since the flooding began is coordinating the national response but also looking at what we can do in the next months and years to ensure that this country really is ready to cope with the impacts of flooding,"" he said.

The finance ministry said on Saturday said it would use Wednesday's budget statement to set out a doubling of spending on flood defenses to 5.2 billion pounds ($6.8 billion) over six years.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban militant group said peace talks with the Afghan government next week were unlikely to take place because rivals for the presidency were both holding swearing-in ceremonies on Monday, and urged them instead to focus on an end to the war.
The United States is trying to push the government toward talks with the Taliban, due to start on begin on Tuesday, under an agreement signed in Doha last month.
But the threat of parallel governments is jeopardizing the nascent process to end a war that has killed tens of thousands of people since the United States launched attacks on Afghanistan just weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.
In February, Afghanistan's Electoral Commission announced incumbent Ashraf Ghani as the winner of September's presidential election, but his bitter rival Abdullah Abdullah said he and his allies had won and insisted that he would form a government.
Both Abdullah and Ghani, have issued invitations to parallel swearing-in ceremonies on Monday.
""We don't think they will make it to getting ready for the intra-Afghan talks on March 10, because of ... the disagreement between the politicians that is even leading to two swearing-in ceremonies,"" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told Reuters.
""Instead of swearing in, we want them to focus on intra-Afghan talks. We call upon them to leave the internal disagreements, stop the swearing in, and work for peace.""
He added another major factor was that no practical steps had been taken to implement a condition as a part of the U.S.-Taliban agreement that the government release 5,000 prisoners, a demand that Ghani has rejected.
Nevertheless, meetings between prison officials from both sides took place in Doha on Saturday and Sunday, Mujahid said, the first known contact between Afghan government officials and the Taliban since the Taliban signed the troop withdrawal agreement with the United States on Feb. 29.
A presidential spokesman declined to comment on whether the meeting took place.
While insisting they were not formal intra-Afghan talks, Mujahid said the meetings covered technical aspects of the prisoner release, such as preparing a list of detainees and their identifying details.
U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad has been holding talks with both Abullah and Ghani's camps over the weekend to try and broker a solution to the impasse, diplomatic and political sources have said."

According to a Somalia state radio report late on Saturday, Bashir Mohamed Mahamoud was the head of al Shabaab's operations and was killed in an American air strike on Feb. 22 in the Sakow district of the Jubba region in Somalia's south.
Mahamoud sometimes used the alias Bashir Qoorgaab.
""AFRICOM forces killed in an air strike Bashir Mohamed (qoorgaab), the operation head as well executive member of al Shabaab,"" the state radio reported, using an acronym for the U.S. military's Africa Command.
The radio report said Mahamoud had been responsible for a series of attacks on Somalia national army military bases among other attacks.
Somalia's information minister Mohamed Abdi Hayir Mareye did not respond to a Reuters' call for comment. Al Shabaab could not be reached for comment.
Since 2008, al Shabaab has been fighting to topple Somalia's central government and establish its own rule based on a strict interpretation of Islam's sharia law.
The group's campaign of bombings and gun attacks has targeted Somali military bases and civilian infrastructure including hotels, bars and schools in both Somalia and other regional countries.
Al Shabaab fighters also target the African Union-mandated peacekeeping force AMISOM, which helps defend the central government.
The United States frequently carries out air strikes in Somalia aimed against al Shaabab, attempting to degrade their capabilities and ultimately defeating them."

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Rows of white chairs were placed in front of Russia's embassy in The Hague on Sunday in a quiet protest by families of those who were shot down with Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, on the eve of the trial - in absentia - of four men accused of murder for their involvement.
MH17 was downed over rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine in July 2014, by what international investigators say was a Russian missile sent to help Moscow-backed rebels fight Ukrainian government forces. All 298 people aboard died, including 196 Dutch citizens.
Russia, which has been held politically responsible by the Netherlands and Australia, denies any involvement.
""This is for me a very beautiful symbol for 298 people who perished. They are gone. My brother never returned,"" said Piet Ploeg, whose older brother Alex died in the crash.
""The idea of the action is to make perfectly clear to the Russian state that they have to cooperate with the investigation"".
Embassy officials did not comment. Last week a spokesman for President Vladimir Putin said the Kremlin would wait for the outcome of the trial, but that it doubted the objectivity of the Dutch-led investigation.
Those present observed two minutes of silence. White roses were placed on some of the chairs, and placards stood in the field. One read ""The truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth"", and was accompanied by a single white rose.
Victims have been incensed by Russia's denials of involvement in the conflict in Ukraine, its vote to block the establishment of a U.N. court for MH17, and its steadfast rejection of any responsibility for the downing of the plane.
""For us it's very important that the trial starts, that all the evidence will be presented, and that, in the end, an independent court will reach its verdict. That the world will know what happened, why it happened, and who was responsible. What was the role of Russia,"" said Ploeg.
The empty chairs, one for each victim, also symbolized the four suspects' absence from the court. They are believed to be in Russia, which will not extradite them, and it is not clear whether any of them will conduct a defense.
Lucy van der Kerk, who lost her aunt, said she was glad the trial was happening, but that even a verdict - likely to be years away - would not take away her family's pain.
""The story will never end for us, because we don’t get our aunt back. Those people, they don’t come back, so it will always hurt."""

CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt is rushing to protect its important tourism sector and reassure travelers it is safe to visit after an outbreak of the coronavirus on a cruise ship on the River Nile.
Officials said on Saturday the coronavirus had been detected in 45 people, including foreign tourists, after the vessel reached the southern city of Luxor. Until then, Egypt had reported only three confirmed cases of the virus.
The ministers of tourism, health and civil aviation toured a temple on Sunday in central Luxor, across the Nile from the Valley of the Kings where pharaohs were buried in tombs carved into rock.
""We are here to respond to rumors saying that there are no tourists and people are afraid of coming. Thank God, people are here,"" Khaled al-Anani, the tourism and antiquities minister, told state television before the camera panned across to show tourists queuing to enter the site.
""No to exaggerated reactions. Our eyes are on everything,"" said Health Minister Hala Zayed.
The tourism industry is an important driver of economic growth and has rebounded after a decline following the 2011 uprising that toppled long-serving leader Hosni Mubarak.
Revenue was a record high of $12.57 billion in the financial year that ended last July, according to central bank figures.
At another top tourism site, the Giza Pyramids outside Cairo, guides and souvenir sellers said business had slowed over the past month because of fears over the coronavirus.
Ali Hamouda Hassan, who gives tours of the pyramids on horseback, said he now had ""one customer every two days.""
The cruise boat struck by the virus has been towed outside Luxor and placed under quarantine, state media reported. Those who tested positive were flown by military plane for quarantine in northern Egypt.
Officials say the newly announced cases and others discovered in people who passed through Egypt originate from a Taiwanese-U.S. national who returned to Taiwan in February after traveling on the cruise ship.
Karim ElMinabaway, president of Emeco Travel Egypt, said there had been few cancellations from travelers abroad through to the end of June but tourism could be badly hit.
""We are receiving 10% of what we had been expecting for the first quarter of next year,"" he said.
The spread of the coronavirus outside Egypt could have other knock-on effects on the economy, including on Egyptians working abroad, an important source of foreign currency remittances.

Concern is growing that the rapid spread of the virus could sever the supply chains and disrupt the trading links on which Europe's largest economy relies.
Merkel's conservatives and the center-left Social Democrats sit down later on Sunday for a regular meeting, with the epidemic, the refugee crisis on the Greek-Turkish border and the slowing economy expected to be key themes.
In an interview with Deutschlandfunk public radio, Norbert Walter-Borjans said that rather than ""sprinkling"" stimulus spending, support should be targeted at affected sectors, including state support to prop up wages for those whose working hours have been cut.
""Companies with supply chains dependent on China, or events or transport companies - they could very quickly face liquidity problems,"" he said. ""We want the possibility of up to two years' wage support.""
He declined to speculate on how much this would cost, though Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has previously said money is available for stimulus spending. Currently, workers on reduced hours can receive wage support for up to six months.
The coronavirus epidemic, which began in the Chinese province of Hubei, with which many German companies have manufacturing ties, has already had a dramatic impact in Germany. The flag carrier Lufthansa has cut half its flights and the carmaker Daimler has said both sales and production are taking a hit.
Merkel's Christian Democrats, in the midst of a succession battle that will determine who stands as the party's candidate to succeed Merkel next year, are likely to be open to some form of extended wage support.
The parties may be further apart on what to do with refugees from Syria's war stranded on the Turkish-Greek border.

Some in the Christian Democrats are sympathetic to calls for Germany to take children and the most vulnerable from Greek reception camps, but others are more focused on sealing the European Union's frontiers.

Italy, Austria's southern neighbor, imposed a virtual lockdown across a swathe of its wealthy north on Sunday including the financial capital Milan, in a drastic new attempt to try to contain a rapidly growing outbreak.
Kurz told broadcaster ORF the situation in Austria -- where health authorities have reported 99 confirmed coronavirus cases so far -- was under control and the measures it has adopted were proper, although probably not the final steps required.
Austria said last week it would introduce ""spot"" health checks at its border with Italy for two weeks.
Austria could ""of course"" close schools, kindergartens and universities or curb large events if needed, Kurz said, adding he was in contact with the leaders of other European countries. 
""It will be important to decide which steps to take when. You can close schools for one or two weeks and this is urgently necessary in Italy. It will happen in other European countries. The decisive question is when to do it,"" Kurz said.
The dilemma is how to head off a peak in infections that could paralyze public health systems without doing too much economic damage, he added.
""You have to consider carefully when to adopt these measures because a national economy cannot handle this over too long a period,"" he added.
He said the virus outbreak would weigh on Austrian economic growth, originally projected at 1.2-1.7% this year, but did not elaborate.
Kurz said the spot checks at the Italian border would not just detect individuals infected with the coronavirus but also reduce cross-border flows of travelers, reducing the risk of infection.

Austria last week said it was temporarily banning flights to northern Italy as well as other virus hot spots Iran and South Korea. Austrian Airlines has halted flights to China until April 24.

The death of Chow Tsz-lok, 22, who fell from the third to the second floor in a parking lot in the eastern Tseung Kwan O district as police cleared crowds in the area, was the catalyst for some of the most intense clashes since the protests escalated in June last year.
Fears over the coronavirus have reduced the scale and frequency of protests this year, but there have been violent demonstrations on some weekends in a sign the pro-democracy movement remains active.
On Sunday evening, protesters, mostly in trademark black clothing and surgical masks, laid down white flowers, origami cranes and messages on colored post-it notes at a makeshift altar where placards read ""Keep the heat; Fight until the end"".
One protester was waving a ""Liberate Hong Kong"" black flag, while a banner that read ""murderer"" was hung up.
There was a heavy riot police presence nearby and at least one arrest was made.
“It’s very touching. When I came here half an hour ago I almost cried, because I didn’t expect so many people would come today,"" said 22-year-old computer programer Sean Chow, who is not related to the student who died.
""(His death) means something that is unresolved and something that needs to be fully investigated and I believe all the people here want an answer. It's an absolute tragedy.""
Earlier on Sunday, Hong Kong police said they arrested 17 people, aged between 21 and 53, during an overnight raid of 22 flats in relation to a series of bomb plots between late January and early February.
Items including three homemade bombs, three electronic circuits and 2,600 kilograms of chemicals were found.
""In recent months Hong Kong has been faced with an ongoing ... violent campaign designed to intimidate, in order to try to achieve political aims,"" Alick McWhirter, senior bomb disposal officer of the Explosive Ordnance Disposal Bureau told reporters.
""It seems a potential tragedy has been averted.""
Police said the bombs were intended to be used in public events and aimed at police officers.
Protesters are angry about what they see as creeping Chinese interference in Hong Kong, which returned to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" formula intended to guarantee freedoms that are not enjoyed on the mainland.
China says it is committed to the arrangement and denies meddling. It has accused foreign governments including the United States and Britain of inciting the unrest."

He did, however, go to the window and wave silently to a mere several hundred people in the huge square, which often draws tens of thousands. Most kept a safe distance from each other as they watched the pope deliver the address on four mega-screens.
""It's a bit strange this Angelus prayer today with the pope caged in the library, but I see you and I am close to you,"" he said.
It was the first time that Francis had skipped giving the blessing and reading an address from the window since his election in 2013, apart from times he was traveling outside Rome.
Francis appeared to have recovered from a cold that forced him to skip a Lenten retreat with senior Vatican officials near Rome last week.
""I am close in prayer to people who are suffering because of the current coronavirus epidemic as well as to all those who are taking care of them,"" he said, speaking while standing in the frescoed room which is used mostly for private audiences.
He encouraged the faithful ""to live this difficult moment with the strength of faith, the certainty of hope and the fervor of charity"". The window was then opened and he waved briefly and silently.

The city government had announced a ""high alert regime"" and imposed extra measures on Thursday to prevent a spread of the illness in the Russian capital.
Those who return from China, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and other states showing possible ""unfavorable"" signs of coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for 14 days, Moscow city hall has said.
The Moscow healthcare department said on Sunday that those disregarding the regulation risked severe punishment including imprisonment of up to five years.
It said authorities would be checking self-isolation through use of closed circuit TV cameras.
In an information sheet, the department said it was OK for residents in self-isolation to walk their dog, but at a time when there are fewest people in the streets, and wearing a face mask.

SEOUL (Reuters) - The mayor of the South Korean city hardest hit by that country's coronavirus outbreak expressed cautious hope on Sunday that the numbers of new cases may be dropping, after the rate of increase slowed to its lowest in 10 days.
The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Sunday 272 new coronavirus cases, for a total of 7,313 in the country. Two further deaths took the toll to 50, it added. 
The increase in cases was lower than the same period a day before, though health officials have warned that numbers could fluctuate as more tests are processed.
In the city of Daegu, which accounts for as much as 75% of all of South Korea's confirmed cases, mayor Kwon Young-jin told reporters the number of new cases has dropped below 300 for the first time since Feb. 29, Yonhap news agency reported.
""The increase in the number of infection cases is showing signs of slowing down,"" he said, according to Yonhap.
Daegu and two neighbouring areas have been declared ""special care zones"" by the government, which has sent extra medical supplies and staff and deployed military troops to disinfect the streets.
KCDC director Jeong Eun-kyeong said the decrease appeared to be due to the fact that authorities were nearing the end of testing more than 200,000 members of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus, which was at the centre of the largest outbreaks.
""We put the Shincheonji church followers in quarantine to prevent the further spread of and tested them, and many of confirmed cases came from them,"" she told reporters during a briefing in Seoul. ""The testing of the church followers is almost finished, so the number of confirmed cases has dropped accordingly.""
South Korea has conducted one of the most ambitious coronavirus testing programmes in the world, with thousands of people being tested every day.
Health officials have tested a total of 181,384 people suspected of having the virus, with 162,008 testing negative.
Facing shortages of face masks, the government will impose a rationing system to limit the number of masks each person can buy each week, starting on Monday.
On Sunday, South Korea's Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun issued a public message, asking citizens to ""actively cooperate"" with the efforts to make sure healthcare workers and sick people have access to enough masks.
""Even if you feel inconvenienced, I ask you to show a mature sense of civil awareness, based on concessions, consideration and cooperation so that people who really need face masks can buy them,"" he said.
The government has imposed export restrictions on masks and urged factories to increase production.
South Korea - which has confirmed the largest number of coronavirus cases outside of China - has also faced an increasing number of travel restrictions, with more than 100 other countries imposing at least some restrictions on arrivals from South Korea.

The issue of travel restrictions rekindled a political and economic feud between South Korea and Japan last week, as South Korea said on Friday it would suspend visas and visa waivers for Japan in response to Tokyo's own travel restrictions on Koreans.

More than 70 people were believed to have been initially trapped in the seven storey building, which collapsed on Saturday evening. 
As of 16:00 Beijing time on Sunday, authorities had retrieved 48 individuals from the site of the collapse, with 38 of them sent to hospitals, the Ministry of Emergency Management said. 
Pictures from the site showed rescue workers clad in hard hats, goggles and face masks carrying injured people away to waiting medical staff in white overalls and surgical masks.
A rescue force of over 1,000 people, including firefighters, police forces, and other emergency responders, arrived at the site on Saturday night, authorities told a media conference organized by the Quanzhou government on Sunday.
Of the 71 people inside the hotel at the time of the collapse, 58 had been under quarantine, they added.
According to state media outlet Xinhua, the owner of the building, a man surnamed Yang, has been summoned by police. 
The building's first floor had been under renovation at the time of the collapse, the news agency said.
News of the collapse comes as the spread of COVID-19 continues to slow in China.
According to data from China's National Health Commission (NHC), cases fell by roughly one half on Saturday from the day prior.
The agency confirmed 44 new cases of the COVID-19 disease caused by the new coronavirus as at the end of March 7, a decline from 99 the previous day.
Chinese cities are gradually relaxing quarantine measures put in place over a month ago, while authorities keep a close watch on the virus' spread overseas.
Of the 44 new confirmed cases, 41 were discovered in Wuhan, the origin of the virus' outbreak and its hotbed.
The remaining three were cases imported from outside mainland China. 
This marks the second consecutive day in which all of China's newly confirmed cases outside of the city of Wuhan originated from overseas. The three cases bring China's total imported case count to 63.
According to the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, two of the cases found in Beijing originated in Italy and Spain.
As the virus slows its spread in Wuhan, authorities have reacted by closing hospitals built specifically to house its patients.

After the first such closure last week, on Sunday, CCTV reported that operations at a second hospital had been suspended, with its 25 remaining patients now discharged and declared cured.

The palace was responding to an editorial in the UK daily Guardian this week that said Malaysia's king, Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah, had overturned a democratic election result by naming Muhyiddin Yassin as prime minister despite the opposite camp claiming a majority.
Muhyiddin was sworn in last Sunday as the head of a government formed with the support of a corruption-tarnished party that was defeated in the last general election in 2018 by a multi-ethnic group.
The palace said it went beyond its ""call of obligation"" by meeting all lawmakers and the leaders of various political parties before the king arrived at his decision that Muhyiddin was the person likely to command a majority in parliament.
""It was only after this rigorous and open process of consultation, fully in accordance with the Federal Constitution, that His Majesty exercised his discretion under the Federal Constitution to appoint a new Prime Minister,"" the palace, Istana Negara, said in a statement.
""Hence, by no means can this process be regarded as a “royal coup” as questionably asserted by the Guardian...""
Muhyiddin is expected to unveil his cabinet early next week.
He has postponed the start of parliamentary proceedings by two months amid opposition efforts, spearheaded by the 94-year-old Mahathir, to challenge his government with a confidence vote.
Mahathir's unexpected resignation as prime minister on Feb. 24, after his coalition collapsed amid a power battle, had plunged the Southeast Asian country into political turmoil."

Thailand's constitutional court dissolved the high-profile Future Forward Party last month, banning its executive members and leaving the rest of its lawmakers to find a new party to join within 60 days or they would lose their status.
The remaining 55 members of parliament of the disbanded party will be officially joining an existing party called Move Forward Party together next week, said Pita Limjaroenrat, who emerged as the group's new leader.
""Our mission is to continue the ideologies and missions of the Future Forward Party,"" Pita told reporters.
""Even though we have a new home, our hearts remain the same. We remain on the side of the people and democracy, stand against the junta staying in power, and drive progressive agendas.""
Little is known about Move Forward Party, which did not have a lawmaker in parliament. The Election Commission said on Friday it just changed its name early last week, possibly to prepare to receive the former Future Forward lawmakers.
The upstart Future Forward Party, hugely popular among young people, came third in last year's messy election and initially captured 81 out of 500 parliamentary seats but lost many lawmakers through defections and political bans along the way.
The party had been a thorn in the pro-military government's side since before the March 2019 general election that saw the junta chief, who seized power in 2014, reinstalled as a civilian prime minister.
Future Forward's charismatic leader, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, had his lawmaker status suspended a day before the opening of parliament in May and then officially disqualified in November for holding shares in a media company.
Thailand's constitutional court dealt the final blow last month by dissolving the party, ruling that it had broken election law by taking a loan from its founder, Thanathorn.
Thanathorn vowed to continue to oppose the government ""on the ground"", alongside his former colleagues in parliament."

KABUL (Reuters) - On a sunny weekend in Kabul, 30-year-old Maryam Mohammdi drives a solar-powered rickshaw around a city suburb, selling burgers to hungry customers as part of a business that is employing dozens of women in a traditionally male-dominated profession.
Mohammdi, who wears a chador, or long flowing black robe with a head and face covering, said that she initially drew pointed remarks when she started her job.
""People were making fun of me and laughing, saying: 'look at her, she is working on the street', but now the situation is getting better and people are encouraging me on a lot,"" she said. ""Even men now cheer me on and say our food is delicious and healthy.""
The business was started in 2018 by 27-year old Farhad Wajdi, who was born in a refugee camp in Pakistan, and now employs 50 women running 25 food carts in Kabul. He hopes to expand to 100 carts this year.
""When I returned to Afghanistan...I saw women were treated really badly, they were not allowed to do businesses, they were not allowed to take financial independence, they were socially excluded from socioeconomic opportunities,"" he said.
""For me it was a triggering point that I started working for Afghan women, because I see Afghan women as a big human resource that should be... equipped with skills and knowledge so they can make an equal contribution in the economic development of Afghanistan.""
Like many, Mohammdi expressed concern about a possible return to power by the hardline Islamist Taliban, who banned women from education, work or leaving the house without a male relative during their 1996-2001 rule. The Taliban, with whom the United States signed a troop withdrawal agreement last week, say they have changed and will allow women to work.
""This job is essential to us...in my opinion, the Taliban should not interfere in the work of women because there is no difference between men and women, and everyone can work to advance life,"" she said.
Twenty-one-year-old Benazir Mosawi, who stopped to order a burger from Mohammdi, agreed with her sentiment.
""When I first saw this lady working and selling burgers, I was so happy...Afghan women need to stand on their own and solve their problems independently."""

As Women's Day events unfold worldwide, the Latin American marches are set against a backdrop of broader social unrest in the region.
In Mexico's capital, a march is expected to bring women into the streets in record numbers as they head to the public square fronting the national palace, fueled especially by anger over femicides, which have more than doubled in number over the last five years.
""I'm going to march for each and every woman in this country, for the dead and the living, for the victims of violence,"" said Carmen Rojas, 52, in Mexico City. ""We have to raise our voices.""

(Reuters) - As coronavirus cases exploded across the world, federal medical workers tasked with screening incoming passengers at U.S. airports grew alarmed: Many were working without the most effective masks to protect them from getting sick themselves.
Screeners with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention asked their supervisors this week to change official protocols and require stronger masks, according to an internal document reviewed by Reuters. On Friday evening, they learned their worst fears were realized: Two screeners, both working at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), had tested positive for the virus.
“Sad news,” a senior quarantine official at the CDC wrote in an email Friday evening to colleagues about the two workers. The email, reviewed by Reuters and not previously reported, said the two screeners will be quarantined until March 17. “Let us keep our colleagues at LAX in our thoughts.”
The news was not surprising to some CDC screeners.
“It was bound to happen,” said a veteran CDC medical official involved with screening who spoke on condition of anonymity. “They are assuring us we are safe. If we were safe, screeners would not be getting sick.”
The struggles within the CDC, an agency that advises the country’s health systems about how to protect people against the virus, underscore the difficulties confronting health workers across the nation and illustrate a challenge for the Trump administration, which has faced criticism over its response to the outbreak.
Trump on Feb. 26 described the risk from coronavirus as ""very low."" Cases, however, have now been reported in more than half of the 50 U.S. states and 19 people have died.
U.S. doctors, nurses, emergency responders and government health workers say they are increasingly concerned at what they see as inadequate protections and preparation for workers in the trenches. Many complain of poor training and communication in the workplace as well as insufficient equipment and staffing.
At the CDC, spokesperson Kristen Nordlund said the airport medical screeners receive the protective gear they need, depending on their roles.
The CDC recommends that so-called “secondary"" screeners, who meet with passengers who have traveled to certain countries, such as China, wear a surgical mask, gloves and eye protection, Nordlund said. Secondary screeners are advised to stand six feet away from passengers they observe and do not wear the sturdier N95 masks, also known as respirators, because they aren’t exposed to symptomatic travelers, she said.
N95 masks are designed to protect screeners from the smaller pathogens such as coronavirus which can penetrate deeper into the lungs. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, surgical masks are not designed to block very small particles, such as those transmitted by coughs and sneezes, and do not provide complete protection because of the loose fit.
Nordlund said that CDC’s guidance calls for screeners who meet with people exhibiting obvious signs of illness to wear N95 respirators and other protective gear.
But people infected with the coronavirus do not necessarily exhibit obvious signs of illness.
“Surgical masks won’t protect us from getting the virus – they just protect us from infecting someone else,” the CDC medical official involved in screening said. “We want to know why we can’t wear N-95 masks. It’s crazy.”
“You might as well have a tissue over your face for all the good it will do,” the official added.
The CDC spokeswoman, Nordlund, referred specific questions about the LAX screeners, including about what kind of facial protection they were wearing on the job, to the Department of Homeland Security, which she said employed the two workers as contractors on behalf of CDC.
DHS could not be immediately reached for comment on the workers’ masks.
In the meantime, dozens of health care screeners and other employees at LAX believed to have come into contact with the stricken screeners have been ordered to self-quarantine until March 17, the CDC medical official told Reuters.
‘A LITTLE BIT OF AN OVERSIGHT’
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to the specific safety concerns raised by the nation’s health care workers. But a department spokeswoman said the administration is working with companies that manufacture the equipment, including N95 masks, “so we can rapidly arrange contracts to buy supplies to protect the American people.”
Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary of Health and Human Services for Preparedness & Response, said at a Senate hearing on Thursday that historically the plan for protecting front-line health care workers has been to focus on routine influenza, which can be prevented by vaccines or treated with antivirals. Coronavirus is not influenza.
Not preparing more respirators for an outbreak like coronavirus was a “little bit of an oversight and has significant implications for today,” Kadlec testified.
He said the government just authorized the purchase of 500 million respirators, which it expects to receive in the next six to 12 months. “So that will ramp up,” he said. Earlier, officials had said they had 13 million on hand.
The shortage of medical gear, including N95 masks, is endangering healthcare workers across the world, the WHO said on March 3, calling on governments to move quickly to boost supplies and stop speculation and hoarding.
The CDC’s airport screeners are part of the healthcare workforce at risk. But a health expert involved in the U.S. government response said the problem was more widespread. State and local first responders - firefighters, emergency medical services personnel and police - are expressing the same alarm.
“We know the level of expertise and training the people we put on the front line need, but we're not even close to having it,"" said the expert, who was not authorized to speak on the record.
PREPARED ON PAPER
On Thursday, the union National Nurses United (NNU) released a nationwide survey of registered nurses finding that fewer than half of respondents said their employer has informed them of how to recognize and respond to possible coronavirus cases. Less than a fifth said their bosses have a policy to address employees with suspected or known exposure, and less than a third reported having enough protective gear on hand at work should cases surge, according to NNU.
“They have all of this stuff written down but then we go and talk to our nurses in these facilities and absolutely none of it is being implemented,” said Jane Thomason, the lead industrial hygienist with the Health and Safety Division of the National Nurses United. “We’re seeing a majority of employers are not prepared.”
NNU has petitioned the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to adopt an emergency temporary standard to require protections for health care workers in an infectious disease epidemic.
‘NOT SUSTAINABLE’
Around the globe, there are now nearly 102,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in 94 countries, with close to 3,500 deaths, most of them still in China, the WHO reports. But already the relatively small number of cases in the United States is testing the limits of the country’s preparations.
In Washington state, with about 70 cases thus far, the rapid surge in suspected cases swamped the protections put in place at hospitals and health centers.
One doctor at a major hospital system wrote in email to professional peers around the country that his staff is quickly burning through supplies of protective gear and struggling to properly fit workers with masks.
“Not sustainable,” he said.
The March 3 email, shared with Reuters by a recipient on condition that the doctor’s name and affiliation be withheld, said the heavy volume of cases scotched plans to furlough workers who had been potentially exposed to the virus.
In one example, the doctor wrote that treating just two patients led to the potential exposure of 350 people. Instead of keeping the staffers at home, the physician said, they were allowing them to work and monitoring them for symptoms.
“This has been a long four days,” he wrote.

Another coronavirus case found in Yamanashi was in serious condition, the local government said on Saturday.
The man in his 20s was found positive for the coronavirus on March 7 and is unconscious with a fever, pneumonia and meningitis, Yamanashi prefecture and public broadcaster NHK said.
It is ""extremely rare"" for the new coronavirus to cause meningitis, the NHK report said, citing doctors at the hospital where the man is being treated.
The number of infections in Japan has risen to 1,159 cases, NHK said.
Japan has come under criticism for insufficient capacity to test for the virus and for not fully mobilizing the capacity it has.
""I expect testing capacity for the coronavirus will increase to over 7,000 per day by the end of this month from around 4,200 as of March 5 and 6,200 now,"" as the national health insurance started to cover coronavirus testing, Health Minister Katsunobu Kato told NHK in an interview that aired on Sunday."

The total number of coronavirus cases now stands at 74 in the country, with state and federal health authorities fretting over the risk of more widespread community transmission.
The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people worldwide, spreading across more than 90 nations outside China, where it originated.
New South Wales Health said in a statement, it was ""continuing to find and respond to cases as they are diagnosed to slow any spread of COVID-19 in the community.""
Federal Minister for Health Greg Hunt said on Sunday the government has secured an additional 54 million face masks to help protect medical workers.
The masks are scheduled to arrive in Australia between now and the end of April, Hunt added.
On Saturday, the government released an extra 260,000 surgical masks from federal stockpile to primary health networks.
""These are for medical services personnel,"" said Hunt.
""As we believe that they are required we'll be distributing them through the primary health network. And if any other mechanisms are required, we'll do that.""
Hunt also called for calm in the community, saying some people have not been their ""best selves"", referring to hoarders who have emptied supermarket shelves in recent days.
New South Wales state premier added her weight too, urging people to be ""rational"".
""We have everything we need. Nobody needs to fear of running out of anything,"" she said.

New South Wales police said two women, aged 23 and 60, were issued court attendance notices for affray ""following an altercation at a supermarket"". They are due to appear at a local court on April 28.
Toilet paper has emerged as the unlikely No.1 stockpiling target for people worried that the spread of the coronavirus epidemic will lead to supply shortages.
The number of coronavirus cases in Australia has topped 70 while a man in his 80s became the third casualty of COVID-19 in the country.
Toilet rolls grabbed headlines on Saturday when police were called to a supermarket in Sydney's south-west after a scuffle broke out among three women over lavatory paper.
A video of the incident that went viral on social media showed the women yelling and fighting over a shopping trolley that was brimming with toilet paper, forcing floor staff to intervene.
One woman yelled, ""I just want one packet."" Another, who was in possession of the toilet paper-filled trolley retorted, ""no, not one packet,"" before floor staff intervened.
The woman, who was allegedly assaulted, was uninjured and no arrests were made."

A video stream posted by the government-backed Beijing News site showed rescue workers in orange overalls clambering over the rubble of the Quanzhou Xinjia Hotel and carrying people toward ambulances.
The hotel collapsed at about 7:30 p.m. (1130 GMT) and 34 people were rescued in the following two hours, the Quanzhou municipality said on its website.
By dawn on Sunday, 47 individuals had been rescued, according to state media outlet People's Daily.
""I was at a gas station and heard a loud noise. I looked up and the whole building collapsed. Dust was everywhere, and glass fragments were flying around,"" a witness said in a video posted on the Miaopai streaming app.
""I was so terrified that my hands and legs were shivering.""
A woman named only by her surname, Chen, told the Beijing News website that relatives including her sister had been under quarantine at the hotel as prescribed by local regulations after returning from Hubei province, where the coronavirus emerged.
She said they had been scheduled to leave soon after completing their 14 days of isolation.
""I can't contact them, they're not answering their phones, she said.
""I'm under quarantine too (at another hotel) and I'm very worried, I don't know what to do. They were healthy, they took their temperatures every day, and the tests showed that everything was normal.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The kidnapping and murder of Vivir Quintana's close friend by a man in northern Mexico was just one more femicide among thousands in the country over the past decade, but it forever transformed the songwriter's life.
The 36-year-old from Coahuila state has written a song that is shaping into an anthem for Mexico's growing outcry over the killings of women, channeling anger along with hope for justice.
""Everything changed in my perception of the world, in seeing that we were possible victims,"" Quintana said, describing how the killing of her friend inspired ""Song Without Fear.""
It demands an end to the murder of women, an issue that has spurred protests across Mexico, where femicides have risen 137% in the last five years and recent cases have drawn outrage for their brutality.
Quintana will perform the song at Mexico City's massive public square on Saturday evening with 40 other women and Chilean singer Mon Laferte, then reprise the tune at Sunday's march for International Women's Day, handing out song lyrics to encourage other voices to join.
At a recent rehearsal, Quintana strummed an acoustic guitar and belted in a deep voice: ""At every minute of every week, they steal friends from us, they kill sisters. They destroy their bodies, they disappear them. Don't forget their names, please, Mister President.""
The call is not only for Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whom critics say is dismissive toward protests over gender violence, but for leaders across Latin America to prioritize the issue, Quintana said.
The commonplace names that punctuate the lyrics - Claudia, Esther, Teresa, Ingrid, Fabiola and Valeria - represent how typical femicide is across Mexico, Quintana said. She chose them by asking friends to suggest favorite female names and then searching for them online. They all showed up as women who disappeared or were murdered.
A video of the song notched more than 12,000 views within hours of being posted online on Saturday, and Quintana hopes protesters will adopt it as their own. She also hopes its popularity will one day fade.
""We want it to be a song that hopefully won't stick around, that won't become popular every March 8,"" she said."

ST. LOUIS/DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidates Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders campaigned in the Midwest on Saturday, as the two prepare for a showdown in Michigan, Missouri and four other nominating contests next week.
Sanders, 78, who until recently was the front-runner in the party's race to face Republican President Donald Trump in November, is now trailing in delegates and desperate to regain momentum after Biden, 77, received a rush of endorsements from party establishment figures following his strong ""Super Tuesday"" showing this week.
Below is a summary of Saturday's events.
BIDEN LAUNCHES BIGGEST AD BUY OF HIS CAMPAIGN
With a rush of momentum, endorsements and campaign contributions flowing in after his strong Super Tuesday showing this week, Biden launched the biggest advertising blitz of his presidential campaign, according to a campaign spokesman who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
Until recently, Biden's campaign was struggling to raise funds. Now, as he looks ahead to Tuesday and more big contests on March 17, Biden is spending $12 million on a six-state ad buy.
The online, digital and TV ads will run in Michigan, Missouri and Mississippi - three states that vote on Tuesday - and Florida, Illinois and Ohio, three of the four states voting on March 17.
Biden's campaign said on Friday it had raised about $22 million in five days. 
BIDEN PREACHES UNITY, AS SANDERS ATTACKS
Biden called for Democratic unity against Trump at a rally in St. Louis, Missouri, shortly after Sanders attacked his record and Biden had warned against a primary ""bloodbath.""
“We’re going to unite this party and unite this country,"" Biden said.
Biden thanked former Democratic White House rivals who recently dropped out of the race and endorsed him, including Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Indiana, mayor, and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.
Biden also unexpectedly thanked supporters of Kamala Harris, fueling speculation that the former Democratic presidential candidate may be about to endorse him. Harris, a U.S. senator from California, has been weighing such an endorsement, according to a person familiar with her thinking.
Sanders attacked Biden at a Michigan rally on Saturday, hours after Biden's warning against a ""bloodbath"" in the primaries involving the U.S. senator from Vermont and self-described democratic socialist.
Speaking to a crowd in the Michigan suburb of Dearborn, Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, lambasted the former vice president for voting in support of the Iraq war and for trade deals he says cost millions of American jobs, including in Michigan and the Midwest.
“Joe Biden voted for those agreements. I wish I didn’t have to tell you what you already know. Those agreements turned out to be an absolute disaster,” Sanders said, referring to trade deals including the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA.
Sanders also decried Biden's acceptance of campaign contributions from some billionaires. 
“At the end of the day people understand that if you are taking lots of money from billionaires, you’re not going to be there standing up for the working class and the middle class of this country,” Sanders said.
Sanders questioned whether Biden could generate enough energy and enthusiasm to prevail against Trump. But he also called Biden a friend, and said both were in agreement that they would support the other against Trump should the other win the nomination. 
On Friday night, Biden told a crowd at a fundraiser in Bethesda, Maryland, he was worried his battle with Sanders for the Democratic nomination could turn ugly.
“What we can’t let happen is let this primary become a negative bloodbath. We can’t tear this party apart and re-elect Trump. We have to keep our eyes on the ball,"" Biden said as he telephoned in to the Bethesda event.
TWO-MAN RACE
The race has become a two-man contest between Biden and Sanders. Tulsi Gabbard, a Hawaii congresswoman, is the only other Democratic candidate still in the nominating contest, but has virtually no chance of winning.
Biden and Sanders will face off on Tuesday in Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, Washington state, North Dakota and Michigan. A big win for Biden in delegate-rich Michigan would deliver a major blow to Sanders' hopes of becoming the nominee.
The two will likely be the only candidates on stage at the next debate in Arizona on March 15, after new qualifying rules essentially eliminated Gabbard from taking part.
BIDEN WINS DOZENS OF ENDORSEMENTS IN MISSOURI
The moderate wing of the Democratic Party has been rapidly coalescing around Biden to stop a Sanders nomination, since Biden's big win in South Carolina on Feb. 29. On Saturday morning the Biden campaign announced another slew of endorsements from Democratic lawmakers in Missouri - over 60.
Missouri is one of six states to vote on Tuesday, where Biden was due to hold two events on Saturday. Jay Nixon, the state's former Democratic governor, swung his support behind Biden, leading a well-choreographed army of Missouri officials - 68 in all - to come out in support. They included current and former state politicians, judges, council members and aldermen.
After his rally in St. Louis Biden was heading to Kansas City, Missouri, where he is scheduled to be joined by U.S. Representative Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, a former Congressional Black Caucus chairman who endorsed Biden in September.
SANDERS FOCUSES ON MICHIGAN
Sanders' appearance in Dearborn began a weekend of campaigning in the crucial battleground state of Michigan, which offers 125 of the 1,991 delegates needed to win the nomination.
Sanders, who won the Michigan primary in 2016 when he ran unsuccessfully for the nomination against Hillary Clinton, was heading to Flint, Michigan, after Dearborn for a town hall focused on racial and economic justice. On Sunday he is set to visit Grand Rapids and Ann Arbor.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Six months after an acid attack in Mexico, Maria Elena Rios is now speaking out in hopes officials will find and punish her aggressor. Talking through a bandage covering the burns on her face, she has a message for other women: Do not live in fear.
Rios, who believes her ex-boyfriend ordered two men to splash her body with acid last September, is one of many women to have suffered abuse by their romantic partners in Mexico, where femicides have risen 137% in the last five years.
""I survived an attempt at femicide,"" said the 27-year-old, a professional saxophonist from the southern state of Oaxaca, where she was attacked at the travel agency in her home where she worked. ""We need an example of punishment so that this doesn't happen again to any other woman.""
As women throughout Mexico prepare to demonstrate against violence on Sunday, International Women's Day, Rios said she would support the cause from home. She must stay indoors to protect her fragile skin from sun and heat.
Even after various medical procedures, she wears a beige-colored body suit covering her legs, arms, chest, neck and face, acting as a compression bandage for puffy scars across her body. Only her hands, red and raw from the corrosive acid, are visible signs of the vicious assault.
Acid attacks are rare in Mexico, but there are signs of an increase. Activist Carmen Sanchez, who survived an acid attack in 2014, has counted 13 cases in Mexico over the past decade - including five in 2018 and three last year.
The prosecutor's office in Oaxaca has offered a reward of about $50,000 to find the man thought to be behind Rios' attack, a businessman and former politician, and Mexico's financial intelligence unit recently blocked his accounts.
Although Rios worries that her one-time partner will threaten her, she said she sees no alternative than to loudly call for justice.
""Should I wait for him to kill me or kill someone else in my family so that I'm put into even more pain? Or what am I waiting for?""
Her body is a daily reminder that her life has permanently changed.
""I can't even rest because I keep repeating the scene in my dreams,"" she said, holding back tears. ""The feeling of acid on my body doesn't go away."""

ROME (Reuters) - Italy is set to lock down its wealthiest and most populous region, which includes the financial capital Milan, as part of tough new measures expected to be approved on Saturday to try to contain the coronavirus outbreak. 
The new rules include telling people not to enter or leave Lombardy, which is home to some 10 million people, as well as 11 provinces in four of Italy's 19 other regions, according to a draft decree seen by Reuters.
All museums, gyms, cultural centers, ski resorts and swimming pools will be shut in the targeted areas, according to the decree, which is due to come into force from Sunday.
The legislation is expected to be approved later on Saturday, the head of the civil protection agency said earlier, after the number of coronavirus infections jumped by more than 1,200 in the past 24 hours.
So far, only a few limited areas of northern Italy, known as ""red zones"", have been quarantined.
Leave will be canceled for all healthcare workers, weddings, funerals and sports events suspended, and home working should be adopted as much as possible, the draft said.
The 11 provinces affected are those around Modena, Parma, Piacenza, Reggio Emilia and Rimini in the region of Emilia-Romagna - Venice, Padua and Treviso in the region of Veneto - Asti and Alessandria in Piedmont - and the province of Pesaro and Urbino in the central region of Marche. 
All schools and universities will be closed in Lombardy and the listed provinces until at least April 3. This week, the government announced schools all over the country would be closed until March 15.
The epidemic is already weighing hard on Italy's struggling economy and Rome has pledged to spend 7.5 billion euros ($8.5 billion) to tackle the outbreak and its consequences.
'WE WILL WIN'
The decree instructs citizens to ""absolutely avoid"" either entering or leaving the areas listed, and even to avoid moving around other than for emergencies or ""essential work reasons"" within the designated areas.
Cafes and restaurants will be allowed to stay open as long as a distance of one meter between customers can be guaranteed.
The number of coronavirus cases in Italy, Europe's worst-hit country, reached 5883 on Saturday, the Civil Protection Agency said, the biggest daily rise since the epidemic began just over two weeks ago.
Deaths due to the highly infectious virus were up 36 to 233, the head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, told a news conference. 
The disease was first confirmed in Italy 15 days ago and remains mainly centered on northern regions, especially Lombardy, but cases have now been confirmed in each of the country's 20 regions, with deaths recorded in eight of them.
On Friday, the government approved a plan to employ up to 20,000 new doctors and nurses to respond to the emergency.
Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and Veneto represent 85% of national cases overall and 92% of recorded deaths.
""We will win this battle if our citizens adopt a responsible attitude and change their way of living,"" Borrelli said
In the worst affected areas, Italy's hospitals are under growing strain. The number of patients in intensive care rose to 567, up 23% from the day before.
Of those originally infected, 589 have fully recovered.
National Health Institute chief Silvio Brusaferro said the average age of patients who have died was over 81. They were prevalently male and more than 80% had more than two underlying health conditions.

The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people worldwide and spread across more than 90 nations outside China.

The two residents at Lynn Valley Care Centre in North Vancouver tested positive after a health worker at the facility was detected with the coronavirus, prompting authorities to conduct extended tests, British Columbia health officer Bonnie Henry told reporters.
""This is one of the scenarios.. we have been most concerned about,"" Henry said. ""We know that the risk for elderly people, having this disease, is very concerning and they are likely to have more severe disease. Particularly older people with underlying chronic illness.""
An outbreak protocol is curtailing movement of people in and out of Lynn Valley as authorities conduct a detailed investigation to detect other potential cases there and people who could have been exposed to the healthcare worker, Henry said.
Virus outbreaks are especially problematic in nursing homes because residents live in close quarters, so infections can spread easily. Older residents also tend to have weaker immune systems and underlying health conditions, making illnesses easier to catch and more dangerous if contracted.
In the United States, an outbreak of the coronavirus at a long-term care facility in Kirkland, Washington, has resulted in at least six deaths.
Lynn Valley has over 200 residents, British Columbia's health minister, Adrian Dix, said.
British Columbia announced another four new coronavirus cases on Saturday, taking total cases in Canada to 51.

On Thursday, the province said it had what could be Canada's first case of community spread of the virus, when a woman with no recent travel history was tested positive.

KABUL (Reuters) - Abdullah Abdullah, the bitter rival of Afghanistan's president-elect Ashraf Ghani, has issued invitations to a parallel swearing-in ceremony due next week, his spokesman said on Saturday.
""We've sent the invitation to all national and international organizations and all necessary preparations have been taken,"" Fraidoon Khwazoon, Abdullah's spokesman said on Saturday, referring to invitations to an inauguration ceremony due to take place in Kabul on Monday morning at a similar time to Ghani's.
A political impasse and threat of parallel governments jeopardize a nascent peace process in the nation, as the United States tries to push the Afghan government toward talks with the Taliban.
In February, Afghanistan's Electoral Commission announced Ghani as the winner of September's presidential election, but Abdullah claimed that he and his allies had won the polls and insisted that he would form a government.
Sediq Sediqqi, a spokesman for Ghani, emphasized that his side was the recognized winner of last year's polls.
""The election season is over and President-elect Ghani was given the winner's certificate by the independent election commission based on the outcome of the election and country's constitution,"" Sediqqi said on Saturday.
Diplomatic sources have said the United States and other international players in Afghanistan are nervous of the prospect of parallel inauguration ceremonies. The United States has previously asked that both parties delay them.
Ghani and Abdullah are old rivals who both held roles in the previous government under a U.S.-brokered power-sharing agreement. A former foreign minister, Abdullah held the specially created post of chief executive in the outgoing government.
Diplomats and experts have said a lack of cohesion among Afghan political leaders will make it difficult for talks with the Taliban, which are due to start on Tuesday, to take place.
""This is a bad omen for the peace process,"" said a diplomat whose country's embassy in Kabul had been told an invitation to Abdullah's ceremony was on the way.
He said diplomats from different countries had been calling and messaging each other to find out about each other's plans.
U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad was holding talks with both camps to try to broker a solution before Monday, the diplomat said.
The U.S. embassy in Kabul did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Khalilzad's involvement."

The move comes just days after other state officials were detained and amid a shakeup at PDVSA after President Nicolas Maduro last month named a committee to restructure the OPEC nation’s oil industry, which is struggling under U.S. sanctions designed to force Maduro’s ouster, as well as years of mismanagement, corruption, and declining cash flow.
On Friday, the president of PDV Marina, Oswaldo Vargas, was escorted without handcuffs from the Caracas headquarters of the country's maritime authority, the INEA, by agents from Venezuela's military intelligence agency DGCIM, six sources confirmed to Reuters.
In addition to Vargas, agents also detained his assistant, six members from the Paraguaná refinery's dispatch service and 30 crew members from PDV Marina's ""Negra Hipólita"" tanker, the minister said during a live broadcast on state television.
Reverol did not say whether the entire group was taken into custody on Friday, nor their current whereabouts.
""This is not simply an act of diverting fuel, it is also an act of treason (...) because people are lining up at service stations for fuel because of U.S. empire's sanctions,"" Reverol added.
He said they learned about the case from oil workers and DGCIM agents.
""We had been denouncing that Oswaldo Vargas used oil tankers for fuel trafficking,"" Eudis Girot, one of the executives of the country's oil workers federation, told Reuters.
According to Reverol's account, the Negra Hipolita ship left Paraguaná on March 5 loaded with 126,000 barrels of fuel bound for the port of La Guaira, near Caracas, but allegedly turned off the radar and GPS system.
The ship allegedly changed course to sail between Venezuela and the Netherlands Antilles, ""where they illegally sold hydrocarbons to unknown individuals through a transfer operation to a vessel with a ""Colombian flag,"" said the state television news anchor, without offering other details.
César Vladimir Romero Salazar assumed the presidency of PDV Marina, according to a March 6 official gazette.
Last week, law enforcement authorities arrested two managers in the PDVSA trade and supply division after being accused of collaborating with Washington. The government also has moved to seize the assets of six private shipping agents over debt owed to PDVSA.
In addition, the head of the lubricants division of PDVSA was arrested on allegations of corruption.
Hundreds of arrests and investigations for corruption and mismanagement in the oil industry have been carried out in recent years under the command of Major General Manuel Quevedo, president of PDVSA and oil minister. The investigations have contributed to the massive departure of personnel that affects the state."

KASTANIES, Greece (Reuters) - Teargas and smoke bombs clouded a border crossing between Greece and Turkey on Saturday as tensions persisted over thousands of migrants massed at the frontier trying to force their way into the European Union.
A Reuters reporter near the crossing at Kastanies said the projectiles were being fired from Turkey toward Greek police. Some teargas was also fired by Greek police during intermittent exchanges during the day.
In early evening, Greek police deployed water cannons to douse fires lit along the border fence.
Thousands of migrants have been trying to get into EU member Greece since Turkey said on Feb. 28 it would no longer try to keep them on its territory as agreed in 2016 with Brussels in return for billions of euros in aid.
Turkey argued it could no longer contain the hundreds of thousands of migrants it hosts, especially with the likelihood of more refugees fleeing intense fighting in northwestern Syria, but Greece is trying to keep the migrants out.
Greek soldiers and riot police have been manning the borderland as thousands of migrants have made a rush for the frontier in recent days. Their Turkish counterparts have been stationed on the other side.
Greek officials say authorities have thwarted thousands of attempts by migrants to cross in the past eight days. Between Feb. 29 and early Saturday evening, Greek authorities registered more than 39,500 attempts to cross and made 280 arrests, a government source said. 
""Greece is doing what every sovereign state has the right to do, to protect its border from any illegal crossings,"" Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis told the CNN network on Friday night. 
""I'm afraid this is a constant and very systematic provocation on Turkey's behalf which has nothing to do with the plight of these people. They are being used by Turkey.""
Turkey on Friday accused the European Union of using migrants as political tools and allowing international law to be ""trampled"" after EU foreign ministers said they would work to stop illegal migration into the bloc. 
Hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers fleeing conflict in 2015 and 2016 reached the European Union going through Turkey and Greece until an agreement between Brussels and Ankara stopped the flow in March 2016. 
However, Turkey still hosts hundreds of thousands of people, and thousands are stuck in limbo in Greece as asylum application reviews crawl forward at a snail's pace.

Greek police also said on Saturday they had arrested 12 people trying to leave for Austria on forged passports. The detainees, who said they were Syrians, arrived at Athens airport dressed in identical sports kits and said they were members of a handball team heading for a game in Vienna.

The Assembly did not name the two legislators who have caught the disease but local media in the eastern region of Alsace have reported that the first of the two lawmakers is Jean-Luc Reitzer, who represents one of the departments most affected by the outbreak and is currently under intensive care.
The second lawmaker is a woman, according to the statement by the parliament. The Assembly said on Friday that a snack bar worker had also contracted the virus.
Sessions in the lower house will be interrupted for two weeks from March 9 and March 22 due to municipal elections that are taking place across France, reducing activity and the number of people present in the building, the assembly said.
France's health ministry said earlier that two more people had died from the coronavirus, bringing the total death toll to 11 people.
France now has 716 confirmed cases of coronavirus, an increase of 103 compared with a day earlier."

MALE (Reuters) - The Maldives on Saturday reported its first two confirmed cases of new coronavirus, and placed two of its island resorts under lockdown, as authorities conducted further tests to try to limit the spread of the disease.
The two infected people are believed to have caught the disease from an Italian tourist who has returned to Italy and tested positive there.
""These two cases which tested positive are from a resort. They are employees of the resort and are now quarantined,"" said Ali Waheed, the tourism minister of the island nation, the economy of which is heavily dependent on foreign tourists.
In a press release earlier on Saturday, the Maldives Health Protection Agency said two French nationals on a second island who showed symptoms of the disease had also been placed in isolation on Saturday.
Health authorities said they had stopped travel to and from the Kuredu Island Resort and the Summer Island resort, while officials conduct contact tracing and take necessary precautions.
It was not immediately clear how many tourists were under lockdown on each of the islands.
Summer Island confirmed in a statement that it had been placed under temporary quarantine while it awaits test results on the two guests and a resort doctor, an Indian national who also began to show symptoms after treating the two guests.
Officials at the Kuredu Island Resort were not immediately reachable for comment.
On Saturday, the Maldives also said passengers originating from or who had transited through or spent any time in Italy in the preceding 14 days would not be permitted entry into the country from Sunday, March 8."

General Delphin Kahimbi's death on Feb. 28 followed media reports that he was being investigated for allegedly seeking to destabilize the country. At the time, his wife said he had suffered a heart attack.
At a weekly cabinet meeting on Friday, Tshisekedi said the United Nations peacekeeping force had asked him to conduct an independent investigation into Kahimbi's death.
He told ministers the available evidence pointed to death by hanging, according to the minutes of the meeting.
The general was appointed by former President Joseph Kabila, and his successor as head of state, Tshisekedi, had been under pressure from the United States to hold Kahimbi to account for alleged human rights abuses.
Kahimbi was under European Union sanctions for alleged abuses committed when he commanded operations against rebels in east Democratic Republic of Congo in the 2000s and during his tenure as military intelligence chief."

KARAAGAC, Turkey (Reuters) - Syrians camped on Turkey's border with Greece believe their hopes of finding sanctuary in the European Union are being undermined by the thousands of other migrants at the frontier who have relatively safe homelands.
Vastly outnumbered by Afghans and Pakistanis at the border, Syrians who have fled their country's protracted civil war say most of their fellow migrants are jumping on the bandwagon for economic reasons, and then pretending to be Syrian refugees.
""It makes me angry when I meet people from Morocco, Pakistan and even Afghanistan,"" said 20-year-old Yehya Rais from Aleppo, the scene of some of the heaviest fighting during the war.
""If only two to three thousand Syrians were here, maybe Greece would open the border. They know we are genuine refugees,"" Rais said.
Thousands of migrants have been trying to get into Greece since Turkey said on Feb. 28 it would no longer try to keep them on its territory, as it had agreed to do with Brussels in 2016 in return for billions of euros in aid.
Turkey said it could no longer contain the hundreds of thousands of migrants it hosts, especially with the likelihood of more refugees fleeing intense fighting in northwestern Syria, but Greece is trying to keep the migrants out.
Rais's animosity toward his fellow migrants is shared by his friend Labib Morghi. 
""There is no war in Morocco, no war in Algeria and no war in Pakistan,"" said 16-year-old Morghi. ""Even in Afghanistan the situation is better than in Syria. We had to leave because our government wants to either kill us or displace us.""
WE'LL BE SYRIAN
Rais and Morghi had left the border camp to charge their phones and breakfast at a shoddy cafe in the village of Karaagac, where old men were playing cards.
At a kiosk next door, North African migrants said they had come to the border without identification documents so they could claim to be Syrians and boost their chances of asylum - should they make it into the European Union.
""Our leaders are corrupt so we have no chance of a decent living,"" said Moroccan Bader Abbasi. ""If inshallah I make it to Europe I'll say I'm from Syria otherwise they'll send me back.""
His friends, sipping Turkish tea, nodded in approval.
Turkish interior minister Suleyman Soylu said on Wednesday that only 20%-25% of the 136,000 migrants who have made it to Europe since it stopped holding them back were Syrian.
Besides their desire for a better future, migrants such as Abbasi have another good reason to pretend to be Syrians.
In Germany, the favored destination in Europe among migrants along with Sweden, almost all Syrians are given some form of protection and are allowed to stay. But more than 20% of Afghan asylum seekers are rejected.
""Everyone here wants a better future,"" said Morghi, who is from the northern Syrian city of Idlib.
""But people who have a country to go back to have a luxury we can only dream of. Syria is finished."""

BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Szilvia Morucz wishes she had found out sooner about a group of Hungarian bikers on a mission to help victims of domestic violence.
Now a member of the ""Easy Riders"" group herself, Morucz told Reuters she had suffered daily verbal abuse, death threats and violence, including a broken finger, at the hands of her former partner during a seven-year relationship.
The mostly male members of the 900-strong group ride to scenes of violence in a show of force and support for the victims, and help them to find ways to move out of their homes or take legal action against abusive partners.
""We act like friends to the abused victims, or perhaps even more like friends because a friend and relative may not be free just when needed,"" Morucz said.
Civil organizations say they lack the resources to help victims effectively, and initiatives such as the bikers group are helping to fill the gap.
""There are only three centers where such victims are helped ... but no one knows about them, and even if they did it would soon turn out that they too have big capacity problems,"" said Vera Mero, a member of a Hungarian civil group helping abused women.
Morucz, who secured a restraining order against her ex-partner last year, said the bikers helped put her ordeal behind her and spurred her to help other women escape domestic violence.
""We are there for her regardless of where she lives, who she is, what she does,"" she said."

BERLIN (Reuters) - Social Democrat state premieres on Saturday called for Germany to take in vulnerable refugees from crowded reception camps in Greece, in the latest sign of discord in the ruling coalition over the prospect of a new refugee wave hitting Europe.
Tens of thousands of migrants have been trying to get into Greece, an EU member state, since Turkey said on Feb. 28 it would no longer try to keep them on its territory as agreed in 2016 with the EU in return for aid.
But since Chancellor Angela Merkel's 2015 decision to let in more than a million migrants, migration has been among Germany's most divisive issues, splitting her conservative party and fuelling a far-right surge.
The Social Democrats, Merkel's national coalition partners, control seven of the 16 states that make up the German Federal Republic, and represent a more urban voter base which is more relaxed about immigration.
""Putting all political calculation aside, now is the time to act and at the very least get at least children and young unaccompanied refugees out of this situation,"" said Michael Mueller, mayor of Berlin.
While immigration is a federal issue, Germany's states have great autonomy and control huge budgets that can be allocated to related areas ranging from refugee integration to healthcare and housing.
In Saturday's statement, the left-wing premieres, including the mayors of the three city-states of Berlin, Hamburg, and Bremen, and the minister-president of Lower Saxony, a major industrial region, demanded a ""pact of humanity"" under which vulnerable refugees could be shared out across the country.
The leaders' intervention comes as Merkel's Christian Democrats squabble over who should succeed the 65-year-old as party leader. She remains personally popular 14 years after taking office, but her potential successors have different positions regarding her signature act from 2015.
While two candidates are seen as close to Merkel on migration, Friedrich Merz, the contender from the party's right, has said the refugees must be sent back to Turkey and be given no hope of entering the EU or Germany. Many observers believe his victory would strain the coalition beyond repair."

Cyprus announced the temporary closure of four checkpoints on the divided island on Feb. 28, the first closure since crossings between the two sides were eased in 2003 after decades of estrangement.
Witnesses said a group of people on the Turkish Cypriot side turned out in support of peace activists on the other side of the barricade calling for the checkpoint, on Nicosia's Ledra Street, to open.
The Ledra Street checkpoint is a narrow pedestrian alley traversing a U.N.-controlled buffer zone. When open, it is used by hundreds of people on a daily basis.
""People were holding olive branches, and at some stage it appears someone started pushing,"" a witness at the gathering on the Turkish Cypriot side told Reuters. ""Greek Cypriot police pushed back and at that moment it appeared they used pepper spray.""
In a statement, Cyprus police said they made limited use of teargas to prevent demonstrators breaking a police cordon. Stones were also thrown at police, the statement said.
The decision to close the checkpoint is politically sensitive because of the territorial split between its Greek and Turkish Cypriot populations since 1974, when Turkish forces invaded after a brief Greek inspired coup.
Authorities insisted there was no other motive other than protection of public health and better use of medical resources at checkpoints remaining open. Cyprus has no reported cases of coronavirus.
UNFICYP, the U.N. peacekeeping force on the island, has said it is concerned at the disruption caused by the checkpoints' closure. The decision whether to keep them shut will be reviewed next week.
There were skirmishes at the checkpoint also on Feb. 29, the day the closure took effect."

GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - A protester was shot dead as demonstrators took to the streets in Guyana on Saturday after opposition leaders and international observers accused the government of David Granger of rigging this week's presidential election.
Diplomats and foreign observers described credible evidence of fraud in the tallying of the results of Monday's vote, which took place as the poor former British colony ramps up oil production in hopes of transforming its economy.
The unrest threatens to inflame decades of racial tensions between black Guyanese, who broadly support Granger's APNU-AFC coalition, and Indo-Guyanese, who largely backed Irfaan Ali of opposition party PPP.
Across the South American country, PPP supporters blocked roads, burned tires and clashed with police.
Police said in a statement early on Saturday that they came under attack in the rural West Coast Berbice region after they cleared barricades set up on a road in an Indo-Guyanese community, adding that officers had killed an unemployed 18-year-old in response to the attack.
""Police ranks whilst performing duty on the Cotton Tree Public Road, West Coast Berbice, came under attack by protesters which resulted in several ranks being hospitalized and their attacker dead,"" the statement said.
Berbice was for decades a sugar-producing region where mills were shut during Granger's government, fueling anger among residents and leading the PPP to promise they would be reopened.
Police surrounded an elections commission office on Friday following accusations that the results of the vote in the country's most-populous electoral district had been altered to favor Granger.
The country's top court was expected on Saturday to rule on whether or not to block the elections commission from declaring Granger a winner.
The PPP filed an injunction on Friday to block a winner from being declared, on the grounds that the results in an area known as Region Four, the most-populous electoral district, had not been properly tabulated.
The elections commission did not respond to requests for comment. Granger's office says he has done nothing illegal and cannot interfere in the process.
Guyana this year begins receiving hundreds of millions of dollars from oil being produced in fields off its coast by companies including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM), creating a huge windfall for a population of less than 800,000.
That has raised the stakes of the country's ethnically divided politics, with Indo-Guyanese and Afro-Guyanese both keen to control oil revenue so they can channel it toward their own constituencies.
Granger's APNU-AFC coalition is largely made up of black Guyanese descended from African slaves while the PPP mostly represents descendants of Indian laborers who arrived in the 19th century to work on sugar plantations."

The Vatican said that on Sunday the pontiff will not address crowds from a window overlooking St. Peter's Square (NYSE:SQ), and will also not hold his general audience from there this Wednesday. 
Both will be held without general public participation from inside the official papal library in the Vatican's Apostolic Palace and will be viewable on the internet or television, the Vatican said in a statement on Saturday.
The participation of the faithful at the pope's morning Mass in his residence has been suspended until March 15.
The 83-year-old pope canceled a Lent retreat for the first time in his papacy, but the Vatican has said he is suffering only from a cold that is ""without symptoms related to other pathologies"".
Tens of thousands of people gather in the square every Sunday and thousands of others attend his weekly general audience, which is held either outdoors in the square or in a large audience hall inside the Vatican, depending on the weather.
A Vatican employee tested positive for coronavirus on Friday, the first case in the tiny city-state that is surrounded by Rome.

The death toll in Italy, the worst-hit European country, stood at 197 on Friday, with more than 4,600 cases of the illness. The north of the country has been the most heavily hit. In Rome province, 49 people have tested positive for coronavirus and one has died.

The fate of flight MH370 became one of the world's greatest aviation mysteries when it disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing on March 8, 2014. Repeated searches for the aircraft were called off in 2018.
Holding star-shaped signs reading ""Never give up"", ""Waiting"", and ""Resume the search"", the relatives of those who were on the flight marked the sixth anniversary of their disappearance by making a fresh appeal for answers.
""The pain is still the same, the fact that the plane is still missing is still the same, and the fact that we don't know what happened to the plane is still the same, "" said Grace Nathan, a lawyer whose mother was on the flight, during the event in Malaysia's administrative capital, Putrajaya.
""There are more questions than there are answers and that shouldn't be the case after six years,"" she told reporters after the event.
A piece of aircraft debris, believed to be from the missing plane, was on display at the gathering.
Malaysia, China and Australia ended a two-year, A$200 million ($132.90 million) underwater search in the southern Indian Ocean in January 2017 after finding no trace of the plane.
In 2018, Malaysia contracted U.S. firm Ocean Infinity to resume the search on a ""no-cure, no-fee""-basis, meaning it would pay the firm up to $70 million if it found the plane. But the 138-day search was also fruitless.
""We depend a lot on the government to take some initiative. We want the government to come forward and say that they are open to companies coming to search,"" Nathan said, calling for the government to engage Ocean Infinity again.
Last month, the Transport Ministry said it had not received any new credible evidence to initiate a new search following a report that a fresh effort to find the plane could be mounted.
Meanwhile, Najib Razak, who was prime minister when MH370 disappeared, said he hoped the new government would restart search efforts.
""We spent a lot of money looking for the plane... But unfortunately, we couldn't locate it,"" Najib told Reuters during an interview on Wednesday,
""There is no finality to what actually happened,"" he said.
Both Najib and former Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai have dismissed claims by former Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott that the tragedy was a murder-suicide by the pilot."

TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's main opposition Kuomintang party, which traditionally favors close ties with China, on Saturday voted in as its new leader a rising star lawmaker, who promptly promised to lead a reform effort following a trouncing in an election in January.
Johnny Chiang, 48, a lawmaker from Taiwan's second-largest city Taichung, won election as new party chairman over one-time Taipei mayor Hau Lung-bin, 67, the son of a former premier and general during Taiwan's authoritarian era.
Driven out of China in 1949 after losing a civil war, the Kuomintang soundly lost both the presidential and parliamentary elections to the Democratic Progressive (NYSE:PGR) Party (DPP), whose promises to stand up to China's threats contrasted with its own platform to be more conciliatory toward Beijing.
Since then, the Kuomintang, which ruled all of China until forced to flee to Taiwan, has being trying to re-invent itself and rethink its unpopular China policy.
Speaking at party headquarters in Taipei, under a large portrait of party founder Sun Yat-sen who overthrew the last Chinese imperial dynasty in 1911, Chiang said he knew party reform would be ""very complicated"".
""I have confidence there can be step-by-step reform of the Kuomintang,"" he said. ""I believe that the Kuomintang after reform will make you feel proud again.""
Chiang, who formally takes up his new position on Monday, did not offer any details as to what reforms he will seek, though he has promised to ""redesign"" the party.
Post-election, the Kuomintang has been riven by disagreement over what its policy toward China should be. 
There have been suggestions that it drop the China reference in its name, which translates literally as Chinese Nationalist Party, though for now that looks unlikely.
China claims Taiwan as its sacred territory, to be taken by force if needed.
President Tsai Ing-wen won re-election by a landslide by positioning Taiwan as an independent country defending its democratic system against autocratic China.
During campaigning the Kuomintang proposed returning to the ""92 consensus"", a vague deal it struck with the Chinese Communist Party in 1992, by which both agreed there is only one China, though each can have its own interpretation of the term.
The DPP used that proposal to drive home a message that the Kuomintang wanted to sell out the island to the Communist Party. While the Kuomintang emphatically denied that, it had trouble shaking the accusation on the campaign trail.

Beijing insists the ""92 consensus"" must be the basis for any talks with Taipei.

The Vindicat fraternity's trip did not violate Dutch health or travel guidelines, but they returned home a day early amid concern from the public and questions by members of parliament.
The students arrived in the northern city of Groningen in a convoy of 14 buses and were given instructions by local health workers but not quarantined.
Guidelines for the students, mostly in their 20s, are to practice ""social distancing"" if they have cold symptoms, and to self-quarantine and contact their regular doctor if they develop flu symptoms.
Jos Rietveld of Groningen's health services said that he was ""satisfied"" with the group's cooperation over the past week. ""The students are taking our instructions very seriously,"" he said.
The Vindicat group spent six days in Sestriere in the Italian Alps, 100 km (60 miles) west of Turin, and even further from the towns east of Milan that have been hardest-hit in the Italian outbreak.
During their stay, the Dutch government changed its travel advice for the region, saying on Tuesday that trips to northern Italy should be avoided unless absolutely necessary.
Concern about the group's trip was ""understandable"", Vindicat leader Floris Hamann told national daily De Telegraaf. ""The dynamic changed on Tuesday night.""
Hamann said authorities had not ordered them to return, but they felt pressure to do so from group members and their families.
""We rode back with a good feeling and we're happy with the information we've been given,"" he said.
The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the Netherlands has been rising steadily and stood at 128 as of Friday, with one death. Most but not all Dutch cases have been linked to the north Italy outbreak.

Special Envoy Martin Griffiths on Saturday called for an immediate end to military action by Yemen's warring parties as renewed violence between the Houthi movement and a Saudi-led coalition threatened peace efforts.
Fierce battles have resumed in al-Jawf province since last month and culminated with the Houthi group taking control of its capital al-Hazem last week, as the Saudi-led coalition resumed air strikes against the region's towns and villages.
The fighting in al-Jawf in northern Yemen has displaced around 70,000 people, or 10,000 families, to neighboring Marib province, the International Committee of the Red Cross said on Saturday.
""Last week I issued a public call for a freeze on military activities. Today, I am reiterating that call for an immediate and unconditional freeze....Yemen simply cannot wait,"" Griffiths told reporters in the central city of Marib.
The recent escalation has shattered more than three months of calm in the five-year-old conflict. This had raised peace prospects after Saudi Arabia significantly reduced its air strikes on Yemen and the Houthis halted missile and drone attacks on the kingdom.
The flare-up in violence led this month to renewed Houthi missile attacks on Saudi Arabia and retaliatory air strikes by Saudi Arabia, illustrating the challenge Riyadh faces in trying to exit a costly and unpopular war.
The coalition, which intervened in the war in 2015 to try to restore the ousted Sanaa government, has carried out thousands of air strikes that have killed thousands of civilians at hospitals, schools and markets, drawing international criticism."

North Korea fired two short-range missiles off the east coast into the sea on Monday after a three-month halt. The launches, which officials have said were routine military drills, were personally overseen by its leader Kim Jong Un.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Millions of women are expected to hit the streets across Latin America on Sunday to mark International Women's Day, against a backdrop of wider social unrest in the region.
This year's event coincides with attempts to pass laws to penalize femicide, legalize abortion, and give women an equal voice in drafting a new constitution. 
On Monday, women around the region are planning to stay home from work, school, and university to illustrate what public life would look like without them.
In Chile, some have called for men to be blocked from the planned marches. The demonstrations are expected to be bolstered nonetheless by participants in broader protests against social inequality that began in October and at their peak included more than one million people. 
A particular focus this year will be justice for women hurt during those protests. According to Chile's Institute for Human Rights, 439 women were injured. It has laid six complaints against police for sexual assault. 
This week, Chilean senators approved a bill aimed at giving women equal representation in drawing up a potential new constitution and Chile's center-right President Sebastian Pinera signed a law strengthening punishment for femicide. 
Javiera Arce, a political scientist at the University of Valparaiso, estimated there could be double the number of participants from last year's march in Santiago, which she put at 500,000. ""I don't know a single woman not going,"" she said. 
Colombian women are expected to mark the day with events hosted around Bogota by the office of new - and first female - mayor Claudia Lopez.
Protests are likely to focus on a Constitutional Court ruling earlier this week, which upheld limits on abortion to cases of sexual assault, fetal deformity or maternal health risks.
In Mexico, there are plans for multiple marches and strikes in protest over what many perceive to be the authorities' inadequate response to a doubling of femicide cases compared to five years ago.
In recent weeks, these include the kidnapping and murder of a seven-year-old girl and the gruesome murder of a 25-year-old woman.
Argentine women will hold a general strike on Monday. The new leftist government of President Alberto Fernandez has announced plans to create a minister for women and support a fresh effort to legalize abortion after previous attempts were defeated in Congress.

Feminism had to be established as ""an indisputable thread"" running through all public policy, said Ofelia Fernandez, a 19-year-old woman newly elected as a lawmaker, in her maiden speech to Argentina's Congress on Thursday.

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's coronavirus cases jumped above 7,000 on Saturday, up by 448 from the previous day, with more than half of the total number linked to a secretive church at the center of the country's outbreak, health authorities said.
The death toll rose by two to 46, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
Since mid-February when a woman tested positive after attending services at a branch of the Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu, the number of infections has exploded in South Korea, giving it the most cases outside China.
There are 7,041 cases in total including a new small cluster of cases reported on Saturday at an apartment complex in Daegu, where some members of the church live, the KCDC said.
While 448 new cases remains a sizeable jump, it marked a third straight day of declines in the number of new cases for South Korea.
""There is a possibility that new cases increase as tests are still underway,"" Kwon Jun-wook, deputy director at the KCDC told a briefing.
Lee Man-hee, the founder of the church, apologized on Monday calling the epidemic a ""great calamity"".
The U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom has voiced concerns over members of the Shincheonji Church being blamed for the spread of the coronavirus.
""We urge the South Korean government to condemn scapegoating and to respect religious freedom as it responds to the outbreak,"" it said on Twitter on Friday.
The large amount of infections in the country has prompted nearly 100 nations to impose curbs on travelers from South Korea.
On Friday, South Korea said it would suspend visas and visa waivers for Japan in response to Tokyo's travel restrictions on Koreans, as fears over the coronavirus reignited a feud between the neighbors dating back to before World War Two.
Dr. Mike Ryan, top emergencies expert at the World Health Organization, told a briefing in Geneva on Friday that Japan and South Korea should focus on managing the epidemic and saving lives and not on ""a political spat over travel restrictions.""

The nation's health ministry has reported three new cases of the infection since Friday, adding to the three Chinese tourists who were diagnosed with the virus in January and the first week of February.
Duterte has agreed to declare a health emergency following the latest development, Bong Go, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and a close aide of the president, told reporters.
All government agencies were asked to ""undertake critical, urgent and appropriate response and measures in a timely manner to curtail and eliminate the COVID-19 threat,"" Go said.
The Philippines' first case of community transmission involves a 62-year-old male Filipino who had not traveled abroad recently. His 59-year-old wife has also been infected, bringing the number of confirmed cases in the country to six, the health ministry said, adding that both are being treated at a government hospital.
The health ministry declared a code red alert which calls on medical professionals to be prepared to report for duty and recommended the declaration of a public health emergency, which would help with the procurement of critical supplies as well as with quarantine measures.
""This is a preemptive call to ensure that national and local governments and public and private healthcare providers can prepare for possible increase in suspected and confirmed cases,"" Health Secretary Francisco Duque told a news conference.

In a draft of revised rules released by the justice ministry on Feb. 27, foreigners in certain professions could be eligible for permanent residence status immediately, regardless of how long they have lived in China.
Foreigners working in China who graduated from top overseas universities, conduct research in important fields, or are internationally recognized for their achievements in areas from sports to culture would also be eligible.
Company employees, grassroots leaders, residents and experts who attended a recent roundtable meeting organized by the justice ministry and National Immigration Administration said they recognized the need to attract foreigners with expertise and capital to boost the country's economic development.
But they are also worried that the qualifications and conditions set in the revised law may not be reasonable, and may lead to large numbers of foreigners crowding out Chinese people in the jobs market and taking up public welfare resources, according to Xinhua.
Other attendees said some regulations are too broad, have loopholes and are not easy to regulate, Xinhua reported.

""We will continue to be a deterrent force to prevent any violation to the ceasefire. None occurred since ceasefire entered into force,"" the Turkish Defence Ministry quoted Akar as saying.
The ceasefire was reached in Moscow on Thursday after talks to contain an escalating conflict.
Nearly a million people have been displaced in a three-month Russian-backed offensive by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces in northwest Syria. Ankara supports rebel fighters, although it has less sway over jihadists who control large parts of Idlib.
Russian news agencies, citing the defense ministry, said there have been three cases of shooting in Idlib in the past 24 hours.
It also said there were seven cases of shootings in Latakia and nine in Aleppo. The defense ministry also reported that 860 refugees have returned to Syria from Jordan and Lebanon for the past day.
Akar also said Turkey would use its right to self-defense if there is any attack targeting its forces or bases in the region.
The deal called for joint patrols of Turkish and Russian forces around the M4 road in Idlib region starting on March 15.
Turkey has started to work on the procedures and principles of the safety corridor around the road, Akar said, adding that a Russian military delegation will visit Ankara next week for discussions.

Russia and Turkey back opposing sides in Syria's nine-year conflict, with Moscow supporting Assad and Turkey backing some rebel groups. Several previous deals to end the fighting in Idlib have collapsed.

HONG KONG (Reuters) - University student 'A', says she used to be a 'typical girl' who liked to shop, drink bubble tea and watch Korean soap operas but all that changed as Hong Kong's anti-government protests gained momentum and she stepped up to take a place in the frontlines.
She is now charged with rioting, an offence which carries a maximum ten year jail sentence, and is on bail awaiting trial.
The protests began last June and at first, the frontlines were predominantly men. That started to gradually change and women began building roadblocks, throwing back tear gas cannisters as well as facing rubber bullets and bean-bag rounds.
The 22-year-old, who did not want to be identified for fear it could affect her trial, said her shift to the frontline came in stages.
""I was at the back, I would just go home after I marched. I started to think I could go further and further forward, till I was at the very front.""
At the frontlines, it can be hard to tell the difference between men and women among the black-clad protesters but 'A' says she felt a sense of female empowerment and gender equality when she came across other women - even if men sometimes tell women to retreat.
In the past nine months, 7,165 people have been arrested, according to the city's Security Bureau. The protests have quietened down due to spread of the coronavirus, but there are signs the movement could again mobilize with at least three protests scheduled for Sunday.
Although Hong Kong's controversial extradition bill, which sparked the protests, has been withdrawn, protesters have been marching for an investigation into police brutality and the downgrading of riot charges for those who have been arrested.
The student says she believes more women could play a greater role in progressing the campaign for more democratic measures to be put in place across the city.
""Women should also come out for this. Men shouldn't be responsible for everything, women should also take some responsibility,"" she said.
""We're no longer weak, or the ones with 'princess syndrome'. So I think now, we are evolving like Pokemon, we're on another level. We're different."""

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A draft interim report from Ethiopian crash investigators circulated to U.S. government agencies concludes the March 2019 crash of a  Boeing Co  (N:BA) 737 MAX was caused by the plane's design, two people briefed on the matter said Friday.
Unlike most interim reports, this one includes a probable cause determination, conclusions and recommendations, which are typically not made until a final report is issued.
The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board has been given a chance to lodge concerns or propose changes, the people said, declining to be identified because the report is not yet public.
NTSB spokesman Eric Weiss confirmed the agency had received the draft interim report, but declined to comment on whether the agency would suggest any changes. Boeing on Friday declined to comment to Reuters about the report.
According to Bloomberg News, which first reported the contents of the interim draft, the conclusions say little or nothing about the performance of Ethiopian Airlines or its flight crew and that has raised concern with some participants in the investigation.
The Ethiopian interim report contrasts with a final report into the Lion Air crash released last October by Indonesia which faulted Boeing's design of cockpit software on the 737 MAX but also cited errors by the airline's workers and crew.
Ethiopian Airlines flight 302 crashed in an open field six minutes after take-off from Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, killing 157 passengers and crew. The Boeing 737 MAX has been grounded worldwide for nearly a year after the two fatal crashes.
Under rules overseen by the United Nations' Montreal-based aviation agency, ICAO, Ethiopia should publish a final report by the first anniversary of the crash on March 10 but now looks set to release an interim report with elements that would normally be included in the final report.
Ethiopian Airlines did not respond to a request for comment. Ethiopia's Transport Ministry could not immediately be reached for comment.
A preliminary accident report by the Ethiopian Civil Aviation Authority released in April last year said faulty sensor readings and multiple automatic commands to push down the nose of a Boeing plane contributed to the fatal crash and left the crew struggling to regain control. 

The U.S. House Transportation Committee on Friday released preliminary investigative findings into the two crashes which faulted the Federal Aviation Administration's approval of the plane and Boeing's design failures, saying the 737 MAX flights were ""doomed"".

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghanistan's health ministry said on Saturday that the number of confirmed case of coronavirus in the country had jumped to four.
""Three positive cases of coronavirus have been registered in western Herat province of Afghanistan,"" Wahidullah Mayar, spokesman for the Ministry of Public Health told Reuters, adding that of the 36 cases tested in Kabul, 33 had come back negative.
Herat borders neighboring Iran, which is one of the countries worst affected by the coronavirus outside of China, with more than 4,000 cases and dozens of deaths.
Mayar expressed concern about the vulnerability of Afghanistan's border with Iran. Millions of Afghans live and work in the neighboring country and many are facing increasing political and economic pressure to return.
Mayar said the cost of testing would be a strain on Afghanistan's resource-strapped health system in an economy damaged by years of conflict. Each test kit - which would test around 50 cases - cost around $1600, he said.
Afghanistan's head of disease surveillance Sayed Attaullah Sayedzai told Reuters earlier in the week that the country had double checked its testing accuracy by sending tests to the Netherlands and had set up isolation centers in health centers around the country. He added there were suspected cases in six provinces in addition to Herat."

Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, King Salman's son and the de facto ruler of the world's top oil exporter and key U.S. ally, has moved to consolidate power since ousting his cousin, Mohammed bin Nayef, as heir to the throne in a palace coup in 2017. He arrested several royals in an anti-corruption campaign later that year. 
One source said the detentions took place on Friday. Reuters could not immediately determine the reasons behind the detentions. 
The Wall Street Journal reported the detentions of the two royals earlier on Friday, and said they related to an alleged coup attempt.
Saudi officials could not be immediately reached for comment early on Saturday. The Saudi government media office did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.
Prince Mohammed has fueled resentment among some prominent branches of the ruling family by tightening his grip on power and some question his ability to lead following the 2018 murder of a prominent journalist by Saudi agents and the largest-ever attack on Saudi oil infrastructure last year, sources have said.
They said royals seeking to change the line of succession view Prince Ahmed, King Salman's only surviving full brother, as a possible choice who would have support of family members, the security apparatus, and some Western powers.
Saudi insiders and Western diplomats say the family is unlikely to oppose the crown prince while the 84-year-old king remains alive, recognizing that the king is unlikely to turn against his favorite son. The monarch has delegated most responsibilities of rule to his son but still presides over weekly cabinet meetings and receives foreign dignitaries.
Prince Ahmed has largely kept a low profile since returning to Riyadh in October 2018 after 2-1/2 months abroad. During the trip, he appeared to criticize the Saudi leadership while responding to protesters outside a London residence chanting for the downfall of the Al Saud dynasty.
He was one of only three people on the Allegiance Council, made up of the ruling Al Saud family's senior members, who opposed Mohammed bin Salman becoming crown prince in 2017, sources have earlier said.
Mohammed bin Nayef's movements have been restricted and monitored since then, sources have previously said.
The latest detentions come at a time of heightened tension with regional rival Iran and as Crown Prince Mohammed implements ambitious social and economic reforms, including an initial public offering by oil giant  Saudi Aramco  (SE:2222) on the domestic bourse last December. Saudi Arabia is also the current chair for the Group of 20 major economies.

Prince Mohammed has been lauded at home for easing social restrictions in the Muslim kingdom and opening up the economy. But he has come under international criticism over a devastating war in Yemen, the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's Istanbul consulate and the detention of women's rights activists seen as part of a crackdown on dissent.

Congress passed the law on Feb. 12 with the support of the ruling party and other conservative lawmakers who argue that foreign-backed NGOs violate national sovereignty.
The law had been questioned by the United States and human rights groups. The U.S. State Department had described the bill as putting ""onerous"" requirements on NGOs in Guatemala, saying such groups play key roles in functioning democracies.
Several civil rights organizations sued to overturn the law, saying it violated human rights. The court sided with the organizations.
The law forced NGOs to register, report their donations and allow their accounts to be inspected. Under certain circumstances, it would also allow NGOs to be dissolved, controlled and monitored.
""We will respect the ruling and call on Guatemalans to unite, to promote a culture of transparency, prosperity and development,"" Guatemala's government said.
Although the court's ruling is provisional if Congress and the government want to re-impose the rules, the legislative process would need to start from scratch, former congressional legislative director Ana Isabel Antillon told Reuters.
Governments around the world, including Turkey and India, in recent years have made regulations more burdensome for civil society groups. In 2019, rights group Amnesty International released a report warning of a ""global assault"" on NGOs.
In Guatemala, civil society has often been at odds with governments, the army and business groups by seeking justice for victims of a 36-year-long civil war, as well as supporting anti-corruption efforts and peasant farmer and land-rights activists."
1456,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 06:58PM ET</span>",'Despicable' - Women seethe over Mexican leader's wobbly response to violence,"By Daina Beth Solomon
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's president sells himself as lifelong champion of the rights of women, who he calls ""more honest"" than men. To stress the point, he made history upon taking office in December 2018 by putting women in half his cabinet posts.
But Andrés Manuel López Obrador's prickly reaction to criticism of the government over brutal murders of women in recent weeks has riled feminists and undermined support for him among female voters, helping to fuel protests and calls for a massive walkout next week.
Support for an unprecedented women's ""strike"" on Monday has swelled, even as Lopez Obrador has tried to paint the event as a cynical attempt by political opponents to discredit him and capitalize on problems he says they created.
Such comments strike many as tone-deaf and lacking empathy, exposing a weak spot for a government already battling to tackle gang violence, impunity and a stagnant economy.
""As a woman and a citizen, I feel outraged,"" said Claudia Calvin, a consultant on gender and technology. ""It's despicable that the head of this country has been unable to understand the importance of women and the impact of violence.""
Allies of the president reject such criticism.
Irma Sandoval, head of the Public Administration Ministry, which monitors federal employees, described Lopez Obrador as ""the most feminist president in modern history.""
Polls suggest women are increasingly skeptical.
Lopez Obrador remains popular. But support for him has never been lower ahead of the strike, in which women will withdraw from work, school and public spaces.
A survey by pollster Consulta Mitofsky showed his approval rating among women fell some 3 percentage points from January to February to 52.7%. Among men, it dipped 0.6 points to 59.2%.
UNCOMFORTABLE
The president's tendency to dismiss criticism and the women's protests has caused unease inside the government.
Saying he would put ""the poor first"", Lopez Obrador took power pledging to tackle chronic inequality and violence.
The row over women has been uncomfortable for him, because Mexico still has more basic problems to address than in advanced economies, where debates over gender equality are more prominent, said an official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Lopez Obrador described himself as a ""humanist"" on Friday when asked at a daily news conference if he was a feminist, and pointed to deeper-rooted problems in Mexico. 
""Because of corruption, we've given rise to monstrous economic and social inequality,"" the 66-year-old said.
Interior Minister Olga Sanchez has tempered assertions that the popular ferment, including a massive march planned on International Women's Day this Sunday, has ulterior motives.
""As far as it being a movement by women, for women, with women and against violence, it is,"" she said last week.
An intervention by Mexico's first lady on the issue also caused embarrassment to the government. First, she came out in support of the strike - then quickly changed her mind.
""What would they do without us?"" Beatriz Gutierrez wrote on Instagram on Feb. 20 next to an image promoting the strike.
Later that day, she backed a counter-demonstration in support of her husband that urged women to be visible on the streets. Lopez Obrador said he did not know why she had reversed course.
Mexico holds mid-term legislative elections next year, and if the president cannot stem the slide in support among women, it could cost him control of Congress.
Murders of women for reasons of gender known as femicides surged to 976 cases last year, more than double the total five years earlier. At a time of increased scrutiny, critics feel Lopez Obrador has often downplayed their concerns.
They bristled at his announcement that tickets for a raffle to recoup money spent by his predecessor on a presidential jet would go on sale on Monday. He later reversed that decision, saying he did not realize it was the day of the women's strike.
Others say Lopez Obrador is waking up to the discontent.
On Thursday, six of his female ministers held a news conference to express support for women and their rights. 

""It's still not quite on his radar,"" said Vivir Quintana, a musician who wrote a song against femicides. ""But I think he can help us a lot, that he's a sensitive person.""

KASTANIES, Greece/PAZARKULE, Turkey (Reuters) - The European Union on Friday pleaded with migrants on the Turkish border to stop trying to cross into Greece but dangled the prospect of more aid for Ankara as a standoff between Greek riot police and refugees entered a second week.
Tens of thousands of migrants have been trying to get into Greece, an EU member state, since Turkey said on Feb. 28 it would no longer try to keep them on its territory as agreed in 2016 with the EU in return for billions of euros in aid.
Greek and Turkish security forces again deployed tear gas on Friday, witnesses said, sending plumes of smoke above the Kastanies-Pazarkule border crossing. Some migrants dabbed stinging eyes with water. Other trekked through fields probing for chinks in the well-guarded frontier.
""The news about the alleged openness (of the Greek-Turkish border) is false and people should not try to move there,"" the EU's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, told reporters during a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Croatia.
The EU could offer more money beyond the 6 billion euros ($6.79 billion) pledged in 2016 to help the refugees but Turkey must first stop using them as a ""bargaining chip"", he said.
Turkey, which hosts nearly 4 million Syrian war refugees, says the EU has failed to honor earlier promises. It also wants more European support in Syria, where its troops are facing off against Russian-backed Syrian government forces. 
In a sign of the EU's hardening stance since the 2015 migration crisis, when more than a million migrants entered Europe from Turkey, the ministers in Zagreb said they were ready to take ""all necessary measures"" to stop illegal crossings into Greece, without elaborating.
Turkey's foreign ministry slammed the statement, saying it showed EU countries were using migrants as political tools, and that they were allowing international law to be ""trampled"". It said EU support for Greece showed the bloc was allowing its own values and laws to be disregarded.
""EU countries, including Greece, must abide by their international responsibilities and accept the applications of refugees,"" the Turkish foreign ministry said in a statement, adding that the comments showed the EU did not understand the burden Turkey had to carry in hosting the migrants.
""Accusing a country that hosts the most number of refugees in the best possible way of using migration for political aims is another indication of the two-faced approach we have been subjected to for years. With this statement, the EU is itself using this issue as a political tool,"" it said.
""AT EUROPE'S MERCY""
Migrants such as 18-year-old Ahmad al-Sadeq, from Syria's war-ravaged Idlib province, are unlikely to heed such warnings. 
""We will stay here for months. We hope that public pressure will grow and force the Greek government to change its mind. The situation requires some heart, not tear gas and fences,"" said Sadeq, who got into Greece on Thursday but was then sent back.
""We left Syria to escape a government that murders women and children ... and now we are here at Europe’s mercy.""
But Fawzi Uzbek, 37, an Afghan national who wants to reach Germany, said he would probably soon head back to Istanbul, where he has been working in a factory for about 18 months.
""The Greeks know that if they open the gates they will get many more people (arriving) on this side of the border,"" said Uzbek, sitting in a makeshift tent he had constructed near the border for himself, his wife and four children.
About a quarter of the migrants at the border are Syrian and most of the rest are Afghans, Pakistanis, Iranians and Africans, according to Turkish estimates.
Greece says it has repulsed around 35,000 migrants trying to cross its border in the past week. Turkey has deployed 1,000 special police to the area to halt the pushback of migrants onto its territory.
Athens plans to extend its border fence by a further 40 km (25 miles), sources with knowledge of the matter said. It has also stepped up naval patrols in the Aegean to deter migrants trying to reach Greek islands such as Lesbos by dinghy.
ALL AT SEA
Turkey's coastguard rescued about 120 migrants, including small children, early on Friday. The migrants said the Greek coastguard had disconnected their boats' motors, leaving them adrift in the Aegean.
On Lesbos, just a few miles (km) from the Turkish coast, fishermen, hoteliers and shopkeepers expressed concern that more migrant arrivals would further harm their island's reputation as a dream holiday destination.
""Most businesses, at least tourism businesses, are going to hell,"" said Vangelis Papastavros, whose wife owns a hotel in Mytilene, the largest town on an island which already houses some 20,000 migrants in camps in mostly squalid conditions.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan discussed the crisis with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Friday, saying migration regulations between Ankara and the EU were not working and needed to be revised, the Turkish presidency said.
The EU's Borrell said a new ceasefire deal brokered by the presidents of Turkey and Russia for Syria's Idlib province could facilitate increased humanitarian help to Syria and for the refugees housed in Turkey. He said the EU would host a donor conference on June 29-30. 
But such news provides scant comfort for the migrants stranded at the Greek-Turkish border. On Friday night, the occasional pop of teargas was permeated by Christian hymns on a loudspeaker from a small chapel on the border, a service common during a period of abstinence observed before Easter in Greece.
Sawsan al-Musawa, who traveled 1,300 km (800 miles) with her four children from a Syrian refugee camp in southeast Turkey to the Greek border, said she had all but given up hope of ever reaching Europe.

""We are left to the dogs,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has created a special envoy for Africa's Sahel region, a State Department spokesman said on Friday, to counter rising violence from groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State which are expanding their foothold.
Envoy Peter Pham, started his new role earlier this week, the spokesman said. He has been serving as U.S. Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa since November 2018.
""Sahel is one of the places where the situation is getting worse in the continent,"" the spokesman said. 
Security has progressively worsened in the Sahel, an arid region of West Africa, just below the Sahara desert, with militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State strengthening their foothold across the region, making large swathes of territory ungovernable and stoking ethnic violence.
Former colonial power France intervened in 2013 to drive back militants who had seized northern Mali the previous year. Fighters have since regrouped and spread. Over the past year, militants have stepped up attacks in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger.
Particularly worrying for Europeans has been possible U.S. troop cuts. The Pentagon is considering withdrawing the personnel as part of a global troop review meant to free up more resources to address challenges from China's military, after nearly two decades of prioritizing counter-terrorism operations around the world.
Such a potential move has alarmed France, which relies on U.S. intelligence and logistics for its 4,500-strong mission in the Sahel. The deaths of 13 French soldiers in a helicopter crash during a combat mission in Mali in November increased France’s determination to secure more support in the zone.
The U.S. currently has around 6,000 military personnel in Africa. Although some experts say a repositioning of forces is overdue, many U.S. officials share French concerns about relieving pressure on militants in Africa.
State Department's latest counter terrorism report, which was published in November 2019, said attacks by militant groups in the region have been on the rise.
""In the Sahel, terrorist groups – including affiliates and adherents of al-Qaeda and ISIS as well as non-aligned groups – have expanded their operations in north and central Mali and the Tri-Border Region of Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger,"" the report said.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in November warned that there was growing concern over Islamic State in West Africa and called on the global coalition against Islamic State to focus on Sahel.

KABUL (Reuters) - Islamic State gunmen opened fire at a ceremony in Kabul on Friday, killing at least 32 people in the first major attack in the city since the United States reached an agreement with the Afghan Taliban on a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops.
A top Afghan political leader, Abdullah Abdullah, was present along with other key political figures and escaped unharmed.
Some 81 people were wounded, a government spokesman said, adding that the death toll could rise.
Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack, the group's Amaq news agency reported on its telegram channel.
The Taliban, who were ousted from power by U.S.-led troops in 2001, denied involvement almost immediately.
The gathering marked the 25th anniversary of the death of Abdul Ali Mazari, an ethnic Hazara leader who was killed in 1995 after being taken prisoner by the Taliban.
Several people were killed in a similar attack on the same commemoration last year, which Islamic State had also said was carried out by its militants.
""The attack started with a boom, apparently a rocket landed in the area, Abdullah and some other politicians ... escaped the attack unhurt,"" Abdullah's spokesman, Fraidoon Kwazoon, who was also present, told Reuters by telephone.
Broadcaster Tolo News showed live footage of people running for cover as gunfire was heard.
Afghan defense forces continued to fight gunmen throughout the day, finally securing the area by killing about three gunmen in the late afternoon, according to ministry of interior spokesman Nasrat Rahimi. 
President Ashraf Ghani tweeted that the attack was ""a crime against humanity and against the national unity of Afghanistan"". 
Abdullah was runner-up in the last three Afghan presidential elections, each of which he disputed. He has served as chief executive of a coalition government since 2014 and is also a former foreign minister.
Ghani said he had telephoned Abdullah, his longtime political rival. Abdullah is contesting an Electoral Commission announcement last month declaring Ghani the winner of September's presidential election. 
Dozens of relatives gathered at the morgue of a hospital not far from the blast, with many breaking down in tears as they waited to identify their loved ones.
Ambulances and stretchers bustled back and forth at the hospital to deliver the wounded for treatment. 
""I was at the ceremony when gunshots started. I rushed toward the door to get out of the area but suddenly my foot was hit by a bullet,"" Mukhtar Jan told Reuters from a stretcher at the hospital.
Ali Attayee, at the hospital to support his wounded brother, said: ""Those who committed this crime want to destroy our people. ... We're sorry for those committing such crimes."" 
Representatives of the United States, European Union and NATO condemned the attack.
""Attacking the innocent and defenseless at a memorial event is a sign of weakness, not a show of strength. ... The Afghan people deserve a future free from terror,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement.
The attack was one of the largest on civilians in Afghanistan in a year.
""Horrific attack in Kabul today ... heartbreaking and unacceptable. We are tired of war and violence,"" said Shahrzad Akbar, head of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission.
Hazaras are mostly Shi'ite Muslims. Minority Shi'ites have been repeatedly attacked by Sunni militants in Afghanistan.

The United States has sought to spearhead efforts towards a lasting peace arrangement. Violence decreased during a seven-day hold-down accord with the Taliban before last Saturday's deal, though the Taliban have since resumed attacks on Afghan forces.

KARAAGAC, Turkey (Reuters) - For members of the Roma minority in the Turkish village of Karaagac on the border with Greece, the arrival of thousands of migrants desperately seeking to cross into the European Union could not have been better news.
Poor and living mainly from cultivating their gardens and collecting cardboard and plastics for recycling, Roma families are now looking to cash in catering to the needs of 4,000 migrants now in a makeshift tent camp at the frontier.
Farmers set up stands selling everything from tomatoes and cucumbers to quince and pomegranate. Others sold mineral water, bread, yoghurt and tinned teapots.
A few turned their horse-drawn carts into taxis to ferry exhausted migrants and their shopping to the border.
Among all the Roma scrambling to make more money on the edge of the village overlooking fields and a dirt road running to the Pazarkule border crossing, teenager Sevgi Katirci stood out.
She was the only woman riding a horse cart and her clients were solely men. Wearing a green jacket and black jeans, she would gracefully whip her horse and race to the border as her passengers held tight.
""The migrants are here today, but they could be gone tomorrow,"" said her father Mehmet, operating his own cart and watching his hard-working daughter with pride. ""So we have to make the best of it.""
Like many children of Roma in Turkey, Sevgi doesn't go to school. Her work helps her family earn about 150 Turkish liras ($25) a day, charging 10-15 liras per passenger.
The Roma and their foreign clients have turned the dirt road to the border into a multicultural market where migrants compare notes on their experiences and discuss what to do next.
Hassan Tunai, who was selling water bottles, fruit juice and yoghurt, said earning money from the migrants left him with a bad feeling.
""I wish it would not be like this,"" he said, wearing sunglasses and hoisting the Turkish flag on his stand. ""When we see them (the migrants), the money that we earned loses its meaning. It does not make us happy."""

ROME (Reuters) - The death toll from an outbreak of coronavirus in Italy has risen by 49 to 197, the Civil Protection Agency said on Friday, the largest daily increase in fatalities since the contagion was uncovered two weeks ago.
Italy is currently reporting more deaths per day from the virus than any other country in the world and the government this week ordered the closure of schools, universities, cinemas and theaters around the country to try to stem the infections.
The cumulative number of cases in the country, which has been the hardest hit in Europe by the epidemic, totaled 4,636 compared with 3,858 on Thursday. 
China, where the outbreak began, had 80,711 confirmed cases and 3,045 cumulative cases, 30 of them reported on Friday by the World Health Organisation.
The Vatican, an independent state that sits in the heart of Rome, registered its first case on Friday.
The national health institute said the average age of those who had died so far was 81, with the vast majority suffering underlying health problems. Just 28% were women.
The fatality rate from the illness in Italy, which has one of the oldest populations in the world, is running at 4.25%, higher than in most other countries. 
In a worrying sign for hard-pressed hospitals, the number of patients in intensive care rose more than 30% on Friday to 462. On a more positive note, some 523 people have fully recovered, authorities said, an increase of 26% on the previous tally.
Analysts say the crisis will push Italy's fragile economy into its fourth recession in 12 years. Credit ratings agency Moody's on Friday cut its growth forecast for the country to -0.5% in 2020, from a previous +0.5% estimate.
Underscoring the economic concerns, the Milan stock exchange fell 3.5% on Friday and is now down 17.4% since news of the first case was announced on Feb. 21.
The tourism sector, which accounts for 13% of national output, has suffered the hardest immediate hit, with visitors shunning the country out of fear of infection.
The Czech Republic said on Friday that anyone returning from trips to Italy would have to go into quarantine for two weeks or face fines, while neighboring Slovakia said it was banning all flights to and from Italy. 
Rome has previously denounced such moves to isolate the country. There is also widespread annoyance with France, Germany and other EU allies who have imposed curbs on the export of protective medical gear to avoid shortages at home.
""So much for the European Union,"" said Matteo Salvini, head of the opposition, far-right League party. 
""When Italy needs help, doors are closed and wallets shut. Once the health emergency is over, it will be necessary to rethink and rebuild everything, starting from Brussels.""
Italy's sporting world is also facing unprecedented turmoil. 
The Alpine skiing World Cup finals in Italy's Cortina d'Ampezzo were cancelled on Friday, while a Formula E race scheduled for Rome on April 4 will not now take place, the all-electric series announced on Friday.
The Milan-Sanremo one-day cycle race set for later this month has also been cancelled as well as two other cycling events in Italy.

Top flight Serie A soccer matches are due to be played this weekend, but behind closed doors.

GUATEMALA CITY (Reuters) - Guatemala's new government is trying to limit the number of foreign migrants the United States sends its way under an agreement that makes the Central American nation a buffer zone to reduce U.S. asylum claims. 
The United States has sent hundreds of Honduran and El Salvadoran asylum seekers to Guatemala under the agreement implemented in November and is now seeking to expand the program. 
However, Guatemala's priority in ongoing talks with U.S. officials is to make sure the number sent back daily does not exceed its ""very limited"" capacity to process new arrivals, deputy foreign minister Eduardo Hernandez told Reuters. 
""We have only one runway"" and one migrant reception center, Hernandez said in an interview last week. The agreement ""cannot exceed our installed capacity.""
As it stands, the deal is one of a series of overlapping measures the Trump administration sees as key to bringing down irregular migration into the United States. U.S. President Donald Trump has made his performance on controlling immigration a plank of his 2020 re-election campaign. 
Known as an Asylum Cooperative Agreement and signed by the previous Guatemalan government, the deal is similar to the safe third country agreement under which asylum seekers who pass through Canada must apply for refuge there rather than in the United States.
Critics of the arrangement, and similar U.S. deals with Honduras and El Salvador, say those countries do not offer adequate conditions for protecting at-risk migrants and that their asylum systems are too rudimentary to cope. 
Under President Alejandro Giammattei, who took office in January, the Guatemalan government has promised to give more information about the deal, which was negotiated behind closed doors and was only partially made public. 
Hernandez said the government was working with U.S. counterparts to produce clear implementation rules governing issues such as how many families with children Guatemala accepts, whether to extend the deal to more nationalities, and how many foreign asylum seekers it would take per day. 
""If it is possible, we want to add an annex, something succinct, simple, direct, clear and that leaves no space for interpretation,” he told Reuters last week.
Under the initial agreement, the United States agreed to only include individual adults, but Hernandez said it was later extended to include families with children. 
Casa de Migrante, a non-governmental shelter that receives the returned foreign migrants, say pregnant women and young children showing signs of chronic stress were among the people U.S. officials had placed in the program. 
Data released by the Guatemalan Immigration Institute, a government agency, show that through March 3 a total of 789 people have been returned, including 311 children. 
The Trump administration on Thursday announced it set aside 10,000 H2-B temporary non-agricultural work visas for Guatemalans, El Salvadorans and Hondurans, as part of a broader expansion of such visas. 
The nationality-specific set-aside is unusual for such programs, and appeared to be in recognition of the asylum deals.

The deal with Honduras could be implemented imminently, acting U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan said on Thursday. Morgan said the United States continued to negotiate to increase the number of asylum seekers taken by Guatemala.

1463,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 02:26PM ET</span>",Americans divided on party lines over risk from coronavirus: Reuters/Ipsos poll,"By Brad Heath
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Americans who now find themselves politically divided over seemingly everything are now forming two very different views of another major issue: the dangers of the new coronavirus.
Democrats are about twice as likely as Republicans to say the coronavirus poses an imminent threat to the United States, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted this week.
And more Democrats than Republicans say they are taking steps to be prepared, including washing their hands more often or limiting their travel plans.
Poll respondents who described themselves as Republicans and did not see the coronavirus as a threat said it still felt remote because cases had not been detected close to home and their friends and neighbors did not seem to be worried, either.
“I haven’t changed a single thing,” Cindi Hogue, who lives outside Little Rock, Arkansas, told Reuters. “It’s not a reality to me yet. It hasn’t become a threat enough yet in my world.”
Many of the U.S. cases that have been reported so far have been in Washington state and California, more than 1,000 miles away from Arkansas.
Politics was not a factor in her view of the seriousness of the virus, Hogue said. Other Republican respondents interviewed echoed that sentiment.
But the political divide is nonetheless significant: About four of every 10 Democrats said they thought the new coronavirus poses an imminent threat, compared to about two of every 10 Republicans.
Part of the explanation, said Robert Talisse, a Vanderbilt University philosophy professor who studies political polarization, is that political divisiveness often works in subtle ways.
Americans increasingly surround themselves with people who share the same political views, so partisan perceptions echo not just through the television channels people watch and websites and social media they consume, but through their friends and neighbors, too.
""This partisan-sort stuff is real; it just doesn’t feel like that’s what’s going on because our partisan selves just feel like ourselves,” Talisse said.
A `FALSE NUMBER'
Americans, who often consume news based on their political preferences, have received two different views of the virus's potential impact.
Amid tumbling stock markets, President Donald Trump has sought to portray himself as on top of the health crisis, but he has been criticized for being overly optimistic about its potential impact and for sometimes incorrect statements on the science of the virus.
Trump has accused the media and his political adversaries of trying to derail his re-election campaign by amping up alarm over the dangers posed by the virus. He has largely sought to cast it as a comparatively minor threat, comparing its risk to the less deadly seasonal flu.
Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh told listeners last week that, “The coronavirus is the common cold” and was merely being “weaponized as yet another element to bring down Donald Trump.”
Trump told Sean Hannity's Fox News show on Wednesday that he thought World Health Organization estimates of the virus' death rate were a ""false number,"" that he had a hunch the rate was much lower, ""a fraction of 1 percent."" The WHO said this week that the coronavirus killed about 3.4% of the people who contracted it worldwide.
House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused Trump on Thursday of spreading misinformation about coronavirus' death rate, saying the ""reality is in the public domain.""
The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations. Eleven people in the United States have died from the coronavirus, the CDC said Friday.
National media and other cable news channels have been filled with accounts of a spreading sickness and the U.S. deaths. Public health authorities have sent increasingly urgent warnings about the need to be ready for quarantines and school closures.
Exactly how big a role these divergent messages have driven Americans’ perception of the danger they face is difficult to measure, but experts said they could only fuel the political divisions that are so vast that they long ago started having an impact on everything from how Americans vote to where they buy coffee.
“Our hyper-polarization is so strong that we don’t even assess a potential health crisis in the same way. And so it impedes our ability to address it,"" said Jennifer McCoy, a Georgia State political science professor who studies polarization.
About half of Democrats said they are washing their hands more often now because of the virus, compared to about four in 10 Republicans, according to the poll. About 8% of Democrats said they had changed their travel plans, compared to about 3% of Republicans.
More than half of Republicans, about 54%, said they had not altered their daily routines because of the virus, compared to about 40% of Democrats.
The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, from March 2-3 in the United States. It gathered responses from 1,115 American adults, including 527 Democrats and 396 Republicans. The poll has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of about 3 percentage points."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Protesters at a rally led by climate activist Greta Thunberg on Friday denounced governments for taking urgent action against the coronavirus outbreak but failing to treat global warming as an emergency.
Several thousand people braved the rain in Brussels with the 17-year-old Swede, marching through the city that is home to the European Union's main institutions.
""It is shameful that for so long the climate and environmental emergency has been ignored. We are still in a crisis that has never once been treated like a crisis,"" Thunberg told the demonstrators in a speech.
Some supporters said they had put aside concerns about being infected with the coronavirus in a crowd to join the march.
""It's pick your evil. Do you want to die from global warming or from coronavirus?"" said Gorkem, 40, wearing a face mask.
""One of them gets much more attention than the other, so we are trying to raise a bit more awareness about what is already affecting all our lives.""
Flo, a filmmaker from the Belgian city of Ghent who attended with her baby daughter, said the rapid spread of the coronavirus had demonstrated that governments can respond to crises.
""You see people all crazy with coronavirus and you see that governments can do things to make everybody aware about a situation, to make things happen ... But they do so little about climate change,"" she said.
Organisers said some 4,000 people attended the event, fewer than expected, probably because of the weather and concerns about the spread of the virus in large crowds.
Andaga, 25, a marine biology student from Ghent, said some of her friends stayed away because of worries about the virus.
""I thought, okay, maybe I should carry hand sanitizer, but it was sold out everywhere ... Yes, it was a concern of mine but not enough to stop me from coming out and marching,"" she said.
While the protest went ahead, some events in the European Union's hub have been canceled as a precaution.
The European Parliament has banned external visitors for the next three weeks, although it waived its own rule on Thursday to allow Thunberg to give a speech.
Other climate events have fallen victim to the virus. The United Nations on Friday postponed a week of climate change events in Kampala, Uganda, which had been scheduled for next month."

ANKARA (Reuters) - Days before he flew to Moscow to strike a ceasefire deal with Russia to halt fighting in Syria's Idlib, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan warned Syrian government forces to pull back or they would not have a ""head left on their shoulders"".
After six hours of talks with Vladimir Putin, a somber Erdogan announced an accord which cements territorial gains by Russian-backed Syrian forces over Turkish-backed rebels.
Returning from Russia, Erdogan said his deal with Putin will lay the ground for stability in Idlib and protect civilians who could otherwise become refugees in Turkey, after months of fighting that has displaced nearly a million people. 
""The ceasefire brings about important gains,"" he said.
The agreement, if it holds, does stem the advances of forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad, easing Ankara's greatest fear - an influx of Syrians fleeing bombardment in Idlib and clamoring to cross its border and join 3.6 million Syrian refugees already in Turkey.
But by freezing the front lines, and agreeing joint Russian-Turkish patrols on a major east-west highway running through Idlib, the deal consolidates Assad's recent battlefield victories and allows Russia to deploy deeper into Idlib than before.
""The Syrian army was stopped, but not repelled. That is perhaps Turkey's biggest loss,"" said Ozgur Unluhisarcikli of the German Marshall Fund.
Assad's progress in weeks of fierce combat includes taking full control of the other main highway running through Idlib, the north-south road linking the capital Damascus to Aleppo and other important Syrian cities.
In Moscow, Thursday's deal was widely seen as a triumph for Putin and Assad at Erdogan's expense.
""The agreement is unexpectedly more favorable to Russia and Damascus...,"" said former pro-Putin lawmaker Sergei Markov. ""Russia is winning on the battlefield and that's why it's winning on the diplomatic front."" 
BRIEF RESPITE?
The region around Idlib and parts of neighboring provinces formed one of four rebel-held areas which Russia, Iran and Turkey designated ""de-escalation zones"" three years ago in an effort to stem the bloodshed.
The agreements were short-lived, however. Since then, Syrian forces and their Russian and Iranian allies have retaken the other three ""de-escalation zones"" from the rebels and Assad has vowed to regain all of Idlib too.
The latest accord risks being as short-lived as other ceasefire deals in Syria, analysts in Turkey and Russia said.
""The agreement between Turkey and Russia is not a final one, it's a temporary ceasefire,"" Unluhisarcikli said. ""Clashes may start again in the coming days.""
Fifteen people were killed in fighting between jihadist insurgents and Syrian government forces in southern Idlib just hours after the ceasefire came into effect, a war monitor said, but elsewhere in the province residents said violence subsided.
Sinan Ulgen, visiting scholar at Carnegie Europe and a former Turkish diplomat, said Erdogan had to make concessions to Putin because the alternative - a return to military conflict - would be ""a lose-lose scenario for Turkey"".
Russia's air control over Idlib, although challenged by Ankara when it carried out waves of drone assaults on Syrian forces and shot down three Syrian warplanes, would have left Turkish troops exposed to lethal firepower.
At least 34 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike in Idlib last week, the deadliest attack suffered by the Turkish military in nearly three decades. 
""Turkey sat at the negotiating table with this military vulnerability,"" Ulgen told Reuters. ""Achieving a ceasefire was important from that aspect, but this ceasefire had a cost.""
Turkey's other vulnerability in Idlib are the dozen military observation posts originally set up to monitor the 2017 ""de-escalation"" agreements. Most of those were surrounded by Syrian troops in recent months, and remain isolated from some 20,000 troops Erdogan has deployed into Idlib in the last month.
Thursday's brief, three-point declaration did not spell out the fate or future role of the observation posts, but Erdogan said they were important and would remain. ""All of these will retain their current status. There is no change at the moment.""
It was not clear, however, what role those posts could play, deep inside areas controlled by Assad's forces. ""With this agreement, that region was given to the (Assad) regime, so those observation posts have no meaning,"" Ulgen said.
Despite the concessions, analysts say Erdogan is likely to be able to sell his deal domestically because it addresses the main concerns of Turkish voters - stopping a flow of migrants toward its borders and preventing attacks on its troops.

""If we look at it from a citizen's perspective, those were the two things that were important,"" Unluhisarcikli said. ""Why would a Turkish citizen care about the internal borders and limits in Syria? That is not their job.""

Tumso Abdurakhmanov, who fled Russia several years ago, said he survived the Feb. 26 attack in the town of Gavle by overpowering an assailant armed with a hammer, according to local prosecutor Therese Stensson.
It was the third attack this month on a critic of Chechnya's Kremlin-backed leader Ramzan Kadyrov, after the murder of blogger Imran Aliyev in France and an assault on journalist Yelena Milashina in the Chechen capital Grozny.
Abdurakhmanov live-streamed the aftermath of the attack, standing over a bloodied man on the ground, asking him in Russian: ""Who sent you? Where are you from?""
The man replies: ""From Moscow ... They have my mother.""
Stensson told Reuters the prosecution was working from the video, which was widely shared on social media but could not be independently verified.
A 29-year-old Russian man has been detained since Sunday on suspicion of attempted murder, the prosecutor said, while Gavle District Court remanded in custody on Friday an alleged accomplice, a 30-year-old woman also from Russia.
In online posts and videos, Abdurakhmanov has been highly critical of Kadyrov for oppressing opponents.
A former executive at an electricity company, he fled Chechnya after a dispute sparked by a road incident when his car accidentally blocked the motorcade of a Kadyrov family member in 2015, the Kommersant newspaper reported.
The blogger could not be reached for comment.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov last week played down the incident and the attacks on critics of the Chechen leader, saying: ""We are not inclined to draw parallels.""
The incident was first reported by a Chechen rights group, though it had given the location as Poland.
Human rights workers have accused Kadyrov of widespread abuses in the region, allegations he denies. Supporters credit him with bringing relative calm to a region dogged for years by a simmering insurgency following two wars between Moscow and separatists after the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union."

Students have protested daily in universities across the country since the Constitutional Court dissolved the Future Forward Party, which came third in last year's general election with more than six million votes.
The court ruled that the party had broken the law by taking a 191 million baht ($6 million) loan from its founder, Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit.
The action against Future Forward took place less than a year after Thailand held the election to end direct military rule, strengthening the position in parliament of a coalition led by Prime Minister Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, the former junta leader who took power in a 2014 coup.
Thanathorn, who was banned from running for political office or becoming a member of a party for 10 years, said he would continue his political struggle by forming the ""Future Forward Movement"" to promote local elections.
""We will campaign in universities, we will campaign in communities, we will campaign in trade unions... We will do it online, offline, we will do on the ground, there are many different battlegrounds,"" Thanathorn said.
He said the movement would work along side his former colleagues in parliament who were not banned by the court. They in turn were planning to form a new party, he said.
The Future Forward Party initially captured 81 out of 500 parliamentary seats in last year's election but has lost many lawmakers through defections and political bans."

Venkata, 54, also was charged with destroying records.
Reuters could not immediately identify attorneys representing the two.
The Justice Department said that from October 2014 to April 2017, Edward and Venkata plotted to steal the software used by the inspector general's office at DHS, along with databases containing highly sensitive personal information about employees at DHS, as well as the U.S. Postal Service.
The goal, the department said, was to use that software as a model so that Edwards' company, Delta Business Solutions, could sell an ""enhanced version"" to the inspector general's office at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The department added that Edwards tried to leverage his relationships with people at the DHS inspector general's office, including Venkata and other employees, after his December 2013 departure."

BETHLEHEM, West Bank (Reuters) - The streets of Bethlehem were near-empty on Friday as Palestinian police wearing masks patrolled the traditional birthplace of Jesus, hit hard by a state of emergency declared over coronavirus.
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced the 30-day measure across the occupied West Bank on Thursday after seven coronavirus cases were found in Bethlehem among hotel workers thought to have caught it from tourists. 
In other parts of the West Bank, Palestinian security forces staffed checkpoints and turned some foreigners away.
The full impact of the order to close schools and colleges and cancel foreign tourist reservations will only be felt after Friday, when most offices were closed for the weekend.
South of Jerusalem, the gate was closed at the main Israeli checkpoint into Bethlehem, where tourist coaches were turned away. While some visitors got in through other entrances they found the heart of the town, the Church of the Nativity, closed.
""It is sad because we really wanted to visit and see the city,"" said Leonardo Cairoli, a tourist from the Netherlands as he stood in a near-deserted Manger Square (NYSE:SQ).
Seeing Cairoli's disappointed family, Father Essa Thalgi came out to talk to them. He said the church was being sanitised and would likely reopen in 14 days.
With 1.5 million tourists and pilgrims visiting Bethlehem annually, many local businesses face huge losses.
""You're talking about a catastrophe economically but we should take care of our health,"" said Nabil Giacaman, a souvenir shop owner. 
Nearby, Alaa Salameh's falafel restaurant was empty.
""All the time we are ready for the political situation like war in Gaza or some clashes on the checkpoints or on the wall, but this,"" Salameh said, ""it's something new for us.""
Religious authorities closed around 30 mosques, conferences were cancelled and national parks shut across the West Bank.
Prime Minister Mohammed Shtayyeh said movement between areas should only be done ""in cases of extreme necessity"". 
The Palestinian Authority exercises limited self-rule in the Israeli-occupied West Bank under interim peace accords with Israel, where around 15 people have been diagnosed with the virus.
There were lower numbers than usual praying at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa mosque on Friday, but observers cited different factors, including heavy rain, checkpoint closures and health fears.
Elsewhere, West Bank towns such as Jericho have seen foreigners turned away at checkpoints and some visitors have reported feeling uncomfortable.
""I don't feel safe. If I go out, people shout 'corona' or some people follow me for five minutes taking pictures,"" said one East Asian student.
No coronavirus cases have been reported in Gaza, which is ruled by the Islamist group Hamas. Nonetheless, the U.N. agency which aids Palestinian refugees said it would close its 274 schools there on Saturday to assess the situation.

Eight Gaza universities and colleges said they would close for a month in accordance with Abbas's emergency decree.

DIKILI, Turkey (Reuters) - Turkey's coastguard rescued around 120 migrants trying to reach a Greek island on three dinghies early on Friday after they said their passage was blocked by Greek coastguard vessels.
Drifting in the darkness in the Aegean Sea and packed into one of the dinghies stranded without a functioning motor, migrants shouted as coastguard vessels approached them off the coast of western Turkey's Izmir province.
The migrants, including people from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran and various African countries, held up small children to be rescued first by the crew of the coastguard vessel.
Last week, Ankara said it would no longer stop hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers on its territory from trying to reach Europe, after an air strike on Idlib in Syria killed 34 Turkish soldiers.
Since then, thousands of migrants have sought to reach European Union country Greece, either across the land border or by sea to various Greek islands.
Several migrants on two of the rescued dinghies said their boats' motors were disconnected by Greek coastguard vessels to prevent them reaching the island of Lesbos, a popular destination for migrants some 25 km (16 miles) from Turkey's coastal town of Dikili.
""They (the Greek coastguard) pulled us toward the Turkish part of the sea and left us there,"" said Ahmed, from the Deir al-Zor region of northeast Syria.
""We waited for three hours. There was no one around, then we called the Turkish coastguard and they came and got us,"" he told Reuters journalists accompanying the Turkish coastguard mission.
""WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY""
Turkey became one of the main launch points for migrants taking the sea route to the EU in 2015, many fleeing conflict and poverty in the Middle East and Africa. The movement was curtailed by a 2016 accord between Ankara and the EU, which Turkey says Europe has not honored.
""We don't have enough (money) to survive in Syria,"" said Yasmin, a three-month pregnant woman, also from Deir al-Zor. ""We left Syria and spent some time in Turkey in order to go to Europe.""
One of those rescued by the coastguard said he was undaunted by his failed effort to reach EU territory.
""I will try. I will try again,' said Afghan migrant Husein Hasanzade."

It was the first major attack on the Afghan capital since the United States reached an agreement with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. troops.

1472,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 10:50AM ET</span>",'Do we really want to close schools?' U.S. authorities resist coronavirus closures,"By Andrew Hay and Brendan O'Brien
(Reuters) - Like many Seattle residents, Andrew Davidoff is demanding schools close to slow the country’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, but as in other U.S. cities school officials are resisting that, saying closures could make things worse.
Davidoff, a  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) employee, has been told to work from home to slow the spread of the virus. He thinks his daughter, and other children in Lake Washington School District (LWSD) should do the same after 11 people died in the state from COVID-19.
""LWSD is doing everything they can to get me sick,"" said Davidoff, 59, among over 20,000 people to sign an online petition demanding school closures.
But in a controversy like ones playing out in New York and Los Angeles, the Seattle school district is staying open.
""School closures can be disruptive and costly for families,"" LWSD said in a statement, recommending schools not shut unless there were COVID-19 exposure risks.
The dilemma over whether to close schools has rolled into the United States as U.S. coronavirus cases top 200. The outbreak has had an unprecedented impact on schools worldwide, the education of over 290 million students affected in 13 countries, according to the United Nations.
Closures have long been a U.S. response to influenza, a dangerous and highly contagious disease for students. But health authorities are rethinking their approach for coronavirus, shown to have limited effects on children.
""Do we really want to close schools or do we want to keep schools open so faculty can continue to come in and serve children?"" said Jeffrey Duchin, health officer for Seattle and King County. 
Not all of Seattle's schools are staying open.
Northshore School District closed on Thursday, citing possible exposure of staff to COVID-19 and a student absentee rate of 20 percent. It said children's education would continue online.
Davidoff said other districts should follow suit.
""Kids will have mild exposure but they will be spreading it to vulnerable parents,"" said the Redmond software engineer.
VIRUS CARRIERS
Having a large portion of the more than 56 million school children in the United States stay home for weeks or even months could have unwelcome societal and economic impacts. 
Schools offer much more than education, providing meals to over 30 million students, according to the Food Research & Action Center. They give free child care to working families, with around a quarter of the U.S. workforce having no paid sick leave if forced to stay home with kids. 
School closures could have a paradoxical effect on coronavirus spread.
If children are carrying the infection but not showing symptoms, they could be an invisible reservoir for community spread, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. 
Duchin said sending students home to grandparents or older caregivers could expose them to the virus. And students sent home often gather together at places like malls, risking community spread.
""If kids are not getting infected and they’re not getting sick, then the last thing you want to do is shut down a school,"" said Osterholm, citing data that only 2.1 percent of China coronavirus cases were among those 19 or younger.
Closure proponent Satya Ananthu expected children to spread COVID-19 to their families if schools did not shut. 
""Having kids in school will make them carriers of the virus to older people,"" said Ananthu, a tech worker who started an online petition for a shutdown in Everett, Washington.
Parents like Alicia Aguirre, in Los Angeles are taking matters into their own hands, keeping children home.
""I am going to go by the week and the numbers,"" said Aguirre, 27. 
Others such as Jamilah Mabruk, 36, are conflicted.
She lives 10 minutes from the Kirkland area of Seattle where nearly all the state's deaths have been reported among nursing home residents. 
Her 15-year-old daughter is opposed to missing school, conscious of grades, but suffers from asthma and could be vulnerable.
""My anxiety is out the roof. I am very concerned because every day there is something new ... a new death,"" said Mabruk, who sends her daughter off with a pack of Clorox travel wipes.

1474,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 10:10AM ET</span>","For special-needs kids, New Jersey rabbi offers chance of a 'LifeTown'","By Peter Szekely and Roselle Chen
LIVINGSTON, N.J. (Reuters) - Looking out of his office window, Rabbi Zalman Grossbaum finds it hard to get work done as he watches kids enjoying the miniature town he built for them.
The village of storefronts inside his enclosed ""LifeTown"" complex in Livingston, New Jersey, lets children with special needs - ""special abilities,"" Grossbaum insists - hone their social skills, and he always wants to join them. 
""I feel this magnetic pull to come out here and to be with the kids and experience life with the kids, because there's something absolutely magical for what happens here,"" Grossbaum said standing in the miniature town, known as LifeTown Shoppes.
If there is any lingering frustration over the seven years it took to convert the 53,000 square-foot (4,924 square-meter) building into his dream, including a year of construction that stretched into three, Grossbaum does not show it.
The 48-year-old rabbi with an early salt-and-pepper beard smiles from beneath his silver-frame glasses as he explains the interactive features of the complex that welcomes children of all faiths, most of whom have physical or intellectual disabilities.
And always, he has a story, like when some New York Jets players came in November to help inaugurate LifeTown's football field and he saw ""their whole demeanor changes"" as they threw balls and ran plays with kids with autism. 
""It was equally an opportunity for these players to have that experience as it was for these kids to be playing with NFL players,"" he said. 
Autism is one of the most common conditions for children who visit LifeTown on school trips or with their parents, Grossbaum said. 
In fact, New Jersey has the country's highest rate of autism spectrum disorder, with one child in 34 diagnosed with the condition, compared with the national rate of one in 59, according to nonprofit support agency Autism New Jersey.
LEARNING TO USE MONEY
At the Shoppes, LifeTown's 11,000 square-foot (1,022 square-meter) centerpiece, children begin their 90-minute visit with a $12 withdrawal from a Regal Bank branch and then decide how to spend it at stores including a bike-rental stand, a Shop-Rite supermarket, a nail salon and movie theater.
""They're learning to use money, to count out how much money to give me, and are using 'please' and 'thank you,' and 'you're welcome,'"" said Sheldon Kirsch, 72, a retired chemist who volunteers as a Shop-Rite clerk.
Educators said the low-key setting of the Shoppes, with its enclosed storefronts and ""Main Street,"" works well for autistic children, whose senses may be overloaded by the smells, sounds and sights of real-life commercial areas.
""This is great for working on social skills in a small setting,"" said speech pathologist Annie Peterson, 32, who accompanied two classrooms of elementary school children with autism from Parsippany-Troy Hills, New Jersey, on a recent visit to LifeTown.
One of the visiting students, nine-year-old Alexander Nahullier, said his favorite store was the pet shop, ""because I saw guinea pigs, and they're my favorite rodent and they're extremely adorable.""
Since LifeTown opened in September, school districts from as far away as Long Island, New York, and Maryland have sent or expressed interest in bringing their students, for whom the fee is $35 each, Grossbaum said. 
Schools usually send therapists along with visiting students, he said, but LifeTown has 45 part-time therapists for children who come with their relatives.
For Grossbaum, however, it is LifeTown's volunteers -- 300 adults and 850 teenagers -- who are its heart and soul.

""LifeTown is not about therapy, LifeTown is about life,"" he said.

1475,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 10:01AM ET</span>",From island paradise to 'war zone': Lesbos weighs cost of migrant crisis,"By Angeliki Koutantou
LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Once better known for its ouzo, cheese, idyllic beaches and being the birthplace of the ancient Greek poet Sappho, Lesbos has been transformed under the weight of a humanitarian crisis not of its own making.
Now Lesbos, just a few miles (km) from the Turkish coast, is experiencing a fresh wave of migrant arrivals that its fishermen, hoteliers and shopkeepers fear will further harm the island's image as a holiday destination and ruin them.
The island of 86,000 people already houses 20,000 migrants, mostly crammed into facilities meant for fewer than 3,000, but Turkey's decision last week to open its border has prompted an upsurge in the number of migrants attempting the short - though sometimes perilous - journey across the Aegean Sea by dinghy.
""Most businesses, at least tourism businesses, are going to hell,"" said Vangelis Papastavros, whose wife owns a hotel in Mytilene, the largest town on the island.
Clustered around a natural harbor, the town boasts graceful architecture and the dome of a local Greek Orthodox church dominates the skyline.
But Papastavros said the migrant crisis had brought ""bad publicity"" which threatened the islanders' livelihoods.
Lesbos initially welcomed migrants when they first started arriving in large numbers in 2015-16, mostly fleeing wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan.
Many migrants carried on to the Greek mainland en route for western Europe, but after countries shut their borders, more were left stranded in Greece. Under EU law, the member state they first enter is responsible for processing their asylum claims - a process which has moved at a snail's pace.
Now the decision by Turkey - which itself hosts 3.6 million refugees from the Syrian conflict and says it can't take in any more - has raised the specter of many more arrivals on Lesbos and other Greek islands - and the locals are horrified.
HARDSHIP
Shopkeeper Thodoros said he might close his business if the crisis persists.
""I am already having a hard time making ends meet... You think you are in a war zone here,"" he said.
Tensions on the island are running high, with frequent altercations between frustrated migrants and a badly stretched police force.
Greece has stepped up naval patrols in the area while accusing Turkey, its historic foe, of actively encouraging migrants to cross onto its territory.
The situation brings risks to the island's fishermen, too.
""We go out at night and I can't recall how many times we ran into them, almost getting ourselves killed,"" said Yiorgos Mavrapidis, 67, referring to the risk of collision with dinghies carrying the migrants to Greece.
On a pebble beach a few meters away are strewn plastic bottles, unopened pots of baby food and discarded red and gray lifejackets, left by around 100 newly-arrived Afghan migrants who camped there this week before being moved to Mytilene.
The fishermen also fret over the economic impact of the crisis.
""If, God willing, we catch five kilos of fish we don't know what to do with them any more,"" said Nikos Katakouzinos, 47.
""As outlying islands we had a bit of tourism, well, now, that's all but gone.""
""Our lives have changed... We can't deal with our own problems and now we are having now to deal with this too."""

Russian investigators opened the case against Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation last August after he called on people to attend rallies that grew into Moscow's biggest sustained protest movement in years before fizzling out.
On Tuesday, Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition politician, said his bank accounts and those of his close family had been emptied and frozen, which he linked to the investigation.
""I have repeatedly faced persecution by the Russian authorities for my political activities,"" Navalny said in comments to the European Human Rights Advocacy Centre that is representing him and his allies in the case.
The complaint was submitted by Navalny and several of his allies on Friday, Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said.
""The endless searches, seizures of equipment and freezing of bank accounts greatly interferes with our activities,"" Navalny said.
In September, law enforcement authorities carried out mass raids on the homes and offices of Navalny's supporters over the case. In December, authorities raided his Moscow headquarters, dragging Navalny out by force and confiscating equipment. [nL5N2631EZ] [nL8N2900LR]
Russia's Justice Ministry in October formally labeled Navalny's anti-corruption group a ""foreign agent"", meaning it can be subjected to spot checks and face bureaucratic scrutiny.

NAZARETH, Israel (Reuters) - A female Muslim lawmaker from Israel's Arab minority is set to become the first in parliament to wear a hijab, or head scarf, after Arab parties won their largest ever showing in this week's election.
Iman Yassin Khatib, 55, won a place on the Joint List coalition's slate of 15 seats in the 120-member Knesset.
The party draws most of its votes from Israel's 21% Arab minority - who are Palestinian by heritage but Israeli by citizenship.
The mother of four served as the manager of a community center in the Galilee village of Yafat an-Nasreh on the outskirts of Nazareth, the city where Jesus grew up, before entering national politics.
""There is no way (the hijab) won't capture people's attention. But what's more important is what is inside: the ability and potential to advance our community,"" said Khatib as she accepted congratulations and posed for selfies on a street in Nazareth.
Khatib said she felt her hijab had sometimes stirred anti-Islam sentiment in Israel, whose nine million population is mostly Jewish.
""Every challenge I faced in my life was made harder because I wear a hijab,"" she said. But she urged people to ""look beyond the veil"".
Israel's Arab minority is mostly descended from the Palestinians who lived under Ottoman and then British colonial rule before staying in Israel after the country's 1948 creation.
It is predominantly Muslim, but also includes members of the Christian and Druze faiths.
Many Arabs complain of discrimination in areas such as health, education and housing, and their leaders accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of incitement against them during recent elections.
Netanyahu's Likud party counters that its 15 billion shekel ($4.34 billion) investment plan for the Arab sector is the largest ever by an Israeli government.
Arab voter turnout surged to 64.7% in Monday's election, its highest in 20 years. That gave the Joint List coalition two more seats in parliament than in last September's ballot.
It is the third-largest party in the Knesset after Netanyahu's Likud and the centrist Blue and White Party. But its influence will likely be limited since no Arab party has ever joined an Israeli government.
Analysts cited anger toward Netanyahu and his U.S. ally President Donald Trump as one reason for the surge in Arab voters in this election, the third in a year.
Khatib is one of four women lawmakers among the Joint List's Knesset members. She belongs to its Islamist faction, Ra'am, which campaigns for more services and rights for Arabs in Israel, and supports the creation of a Palestinian state.
""There is a growing awareness amongst Arab women that we can be active participants in our future,"" said Khatib.
""My message to young women: there is a possibility. There is a way. Don't limit your hopes and dreams."""
1479,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 08:26AM ET</span>","EU, Turkey in stand-off over funds to tackle new migrant crisis","By Francesco Guarascio and Tuvan Gumrukcu
BRUSSELS/ANKARA (Reuters) - The European Union is scrambling for a new agreement with Turkey to prevent migrants from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and beyond flooding into the EU. But there is little sign so far that Ankara is ready to accept the terms Brussels is offering.
Since Turkey announced on Feb. 28 that it would no longer abide by a 2016 deal to keep refugees on its territory, accusing the EU of falling short on commitments of financial support, some 35,000 migrants have massed on the border with Greece where they have been thrust back by Greek forces.
EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Friday in Zagreb, where its foreign ministers met to weigh the crisis, that member states were willing to offer more money to Turkey beyond the 6 billion euros ($6.79 billion) pledged in 2016. 
But Turkey, which hosts almost 4 million refugees and migrants, first had to stop using migrants as a bargaining chip. ""Turkey has a big burden...and we have to understand that,"" Borrell said. But at the same time, we cannot accept that migrants are being used as a source of pressure.""
Even if the EU does decide to offer more money, it's not clear it will be sufficient to assuage Turkey or be the kind of support that Ankara, which is simultaneously involved in conflicts in Syria and Libya, really wants.
So far, the EU has retained oversight over the use of the funds it disburses. But an EU diplomat involved in discussions in Zagreb said the Turks wanted funds paid directly to them, something EU member states are very unlikely to agree to.
Instead, officials have raised the possibility of topping up an existing fund to support refugees' education with around 500 million euros, which would keep the program running until the end of 2021. It remains unclear whether that will happen.
Keen to avoid a new refugee influx into Turkey from the war in Syria's north, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan reached a deal with President Vladimir Putin on Thursday to halt fighting between Russian-backed Syrian forces and Turkish troops.
On his flight back from Moscow, Erdogan appeared unimpressed by what the EU was offering so far, saying the Union was always offering help but then falling short or not stepping up.
""The West unfortunately has many faces,"" he told reporters. ""From the EU... they made us some promises as well. I don't know if there will be a result from there or not.""
GEOPOLITICAL CALCULATIONS
Underpinning Turkish pressure on the EU over migrants are geopolitical considerations. 
To keep Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces pushed well back and shore up Turkish interests in northern Syria, where Ankara backs anti-Assad rebels, Erdogan wants more support from fellow NATO members and the imposition of a no-fly zone.
Asked whether that was what Ankara was demanding beyond extra funds to deal with refugees, Borrell did not dismiss the question, but said it was not for the EU to decide.
""The European Union cannot create a safe zone, we are not that powerful,"" he told reporters. ""We can try to influence the United Nations and NATO, it's a good idea.""
Another potential EU lever is Patriot air defense missiles. Since Turkey purchased Russia's S-400 anti-aircraft system, a move NATO condemned, the United States has said it is not prepared to provide Turkey with Patriots.
But Spain has a Patriot battery deployed in Turkey - one that was scheduled to be withdrawn in mid-2020. Diplomats suggested it was possible Spain could extend the deployment, giving Turkey an extra level of defense assurance.
While pressure for more NATO support or a no-fly zone may diminished if the Turkish-Russian truce deal sticks, it remains unclear whether the EU is offering enough to prompt Turkey to put the lid back on migration toward Greece.
In an apparent bid to help bridge the gap, Borrell announced on Friday the EU would host a Syria donor conference on June 29-30 to raise funds for victims of Syria's nine-year war and surrounding countries, naming Turkey and Russia in particular.
Borrell also said the new ceasefire deal could facilitate increased EU humanitarian help to Syria and for refugees housed in Turkey, without elaborating.
Under the 2016 agreement, the EU said it would provide Turkey with up to 6 billion euros in health, education, food and infrastructure assistance to manage the refugee situation. 
While some 4.7 billion of that has been earmarked for use, and 3.2 billion of it paid out, the original deal foresaw all 6 billion being allocated by the end of 2018. Turkey says it has spent $40 billion coping with its refugee burden. 
In meetings with senior EU envoys in Ankara on Wednesday, Turkish officials voiced frustration at the pace of payments, saying the EU was not keeping up its end of the bargain.

""It is a double standard that the EU can mobilize hundreds of millions of euros for Greece (to cope with migrants) within days, but uses bureaucracy as an excuse when it comes to Turkey,"" Turkish presidential spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said.

TUNIS (Reuters) - Two militants on a motorbike blew themselves up outside the U.S. Embassy in Tunisia on Friday, killing a policeman and injuring several others in the country's most serious attack in months.
The explosion took place near the embassy's main gate, where a Reuters journalist saw a scorched, damaged motorbike and a damaged police vehicle lying amid debris as police gathered around and a helicopter whirled overhead.
The Interior Ministry said two militants were killed carrying out the attack and five police officers were injured, while a civilian suffered minor injuries. State news agency TAP reported that one policeman was killed. 
""We heard a very powerful explosion ... we saw the remains of the terrorist lying on the ground after he went on the motorbike toward the police,"" said Amira, a shopkeeper.
Sirens could be heard on the major highway linking the Lac district, where the embassy is located, with Tunis and suburbs in the north. The U.S. Embassy in a tweet urged people to avoid the area.
Roads around security installations were closed in some parts of the capital and some international institutions were put on lockdown or evacuated. 
Photographs of the blast site posted on social media showed debris strewn around the area of a security checkpoint that controls access to the embassy, and damaged vehicles. 
Last summer, Islamic State said it was behind militant blasts that struck the capital over the course of a week, including one near the French Embassy that killed a policeman. 
Tunisia's critical tourism sector is highly vulnerable to militant incidents and was devastated after two major attacks in 2015 which killed scores of visitors at a beach resort and a popular museum. 

Diplomats who have worked with Tunisia on its security capacity say it has grown more effective in preventing and responding to militant attacks in recent years.

There had been days of confusion as officials gave different explanations of regulations that could further damage tourism, which accounts for about 12% of Thailand’s economy. 
South Korea, China, Macao, Hong Kong, Italy and Iran were designated on Thursday as ""dangerous communicable disease areas"".
Health Ministry spokesman Rungrueng Kiphati told Reuters on Thursday that arrivals from these places would be fined 20,000 baht ($630) if they did not self-quarantine for 14 days at home or in a hotel room, ""where they have to report themselves to the authorities every day or officials will come to check on them"".
On Friday, however, other health officials took a slightly softer line.
""For now, we are recommending people to exercise home quarantine. But if you don't follow that, then we will use the law to take you to government quarantine centers,"" said Sukhum Kanchanapimai, the health ministry's permanent secretary.
Nevertheless, the government information department's verified Twitter account on Friday repeated the threat of a 20,000 baht fine for those who failed to self-quarantine.
Tanarak Plipat, deputy director-general of the Department of Disease Control, told reporters the health ministry would issue regulations requiring all arrivals from the six areas to report their health condition daily.
""If people don't follow the rules or falsely report their condition, like they have a cough but said they do not, then they would be breaching an official order and that will be punishable,"" Tanarak said, adding that the daily health report could be done by phone, mobile phone app, or other channels that the ministry will create.
The ministry also said that the measures could become stricter depending on the circumstances.
On Tuesday, health minister Anutin Charnvirakul had posted on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page that all arrivals from Japan, Germany, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, France, Singapore, Italy or Iran ""must be quarantined for 14 days"" - before deleting the post a few hours later.
Other ministries have issued different regulations on home quarantine.
The education ministry recommended to schools that children who had traveled from France, Germany, Japan, Singapore or Taiwan stay home under quarantine, according to an email sent to parents on Friday from the International School of Bangkok, even though the health ministry did not recommend this.
Thailand has recorded a total of 48 coronavirus cases since January, including a case reported on Friday of a 43-year-old British man who had traveled from London via Hong Kong and had been admitted to hospital on Tuesday.
There has been one death so far.
The government expects foreign tourist arrival numbers to fall 5 million this year from 39.8 million last year, due to the outbreak."

EDIRNE, Turkey (Reuters) - When Sawsan al-Musawa heard last week that President Tayyip Erdogan had opened Turkey's borders for migrants to cross into Europe, the Syrian mother of four left a refugee camp in eastern Turkey and headed west to the Greek border.
Six days later, Musawa and her children, including two sons with cerebral palsy, were camping at a bus station in the border city of Edirne, tired, frustrated, and angry as their dream of a new life in Europe came to an abrupt end at the EU frontier.
""Why did he (Erdogan) do this to us if he knew Greece won't let us cross?"" she asked, sitting on a rug near a pile of bags full of clothes and diapers for her sons, aged 13 and 7, who lay on the ground making jittery movements and looking scared.
Thousand of migrants from Syria, Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Africa are camped out along a stretch of the border between Turkey and Greece, two NATO allies whose relations - never easy - have been further strained by the migrant crisis.
Now, many migrants are confused and unsure what to do.
Some like Musawa said they had spent their paltry savings on the 1,300-kilometer (800-mile) journey from a refugee camp outside the southeastern Turkish city of Gaziantep to Edirne in the country's northwest, near to Greece and Bulgaria.
Others started boarding buses to head back to places across Turkey where they had built temporary lives, doing menial jobs.
Men, women and children still holding out hope sat on the banks of the Maritsa river, feeding on biscuits, potato snacks and soft drinks handed out by aid groups and local charities.
Families started bonfires as the sound of crying babies blended with the muezzin's call to prayer blasting from a towering white mosque.
""ERDOGAN IS USING US""
Turkish police have closed the main bridge in Edirne toward the Greek border to migrants and journalists, allowing only local residents to pass.
The crisis started last week after Turkey, host to 3.6 million Syrian refugees, said it would no longer abide by a 2016 deal to halt migration flows to the European Union in return for billions of euros in aid.
""Erdogan is using us to press the EU for money,"" said Tamam Srmini, a 21-year-old from the Syrian city of Aleppo. ""But we have to try. We have no choice. We have no future in Turkey.""
He and six other Syrians were trekking through fields, helped by maps on their mobile phones, hoping to find a spot shared by friends where they might be able to cross the border. 
Under a metal railway bridge, vans picked up African migrants and shuttled them on dirt roads toward the border. Villagers cast their fishing rods nearby undisturbed.
""They are smugglers,"" said Mohammed Shmbati from Sudan. ""They take 50 (Turkish) liras per head, as if it's not enough that the Turkish government is using us like pawns. Women and children can't walk there, so they take advantage.""
Turkey says it has not asked any Syrian refugees to leave.
""If they choose to stay, they can. If they choose to leave, they can,"" the presidency's communications director Fahrettin Altun said.
Back at the bus station, Musawa asks her cousin Taher, who helped her to reach the border, to chase away street dogs trying to open biscuit bags.

""We are left to the dogs,"" she said.

AMMAN/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Deadly clashes erupted in southern Idlib on Friday, hours into a ceasefire deal between Russia and Turkey aimed at ending the fighting in the last rebel-held enclave in Syria.
A war monitor and a rebel source said the fighting broke out in the Jabal al-Zawiya region between Syrian government forces and jihadist insurgents of the Turkistan Islamic Party. Fifteen people were killed, the Syrian Observatory said. 
Residents and opposition forces said the violence had abated elsewhere.
But the clashes underlined the fragility of Thursday's deal between Russia, which backs President Bashar al-Assad's forces, and Turkey. Ankara supports rebel fighters but has less sway over hardline jihadists who control large parts of Idlib.
The ceasefire aims to contain a conflict that has displaced nearly a million people in three months in northwest Syria. 
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan had vowed to reverse recent advances by Assad's forces in Idlib. However, Thursday's deal froze the conflict along existing front lines, cementing significant gains by Syrian government forces. 
""There may be criticism but our priority was for a ceasefire and we achieved it. Some goals were not reached but that goes for both sides,"" a senior Turkish official said.
Several previous deals to end the fighting in Idlib have collapsed. Analysts and residents said they feared the latest ceasefire would also fizzle out as it did not address the humanitarian crisis or air protection in any detail.
""Any ceasefire arrangement in Idlib, unless it has a no-fly zone dimension, is bound to fail. Deals in the past never de-escalated. They merely froze the crisis until the next escalation,"" said Galip Dalay, IPC-Mercator fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs.
Arriving for a meeting of European Union foreign ministers in Zagreb, Dutch minister Stef Blok said the ceasefire deal should be cemented with a no-fly zone to stop any further bombing of hospitals.
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
The recent fighting sparked what the United Nations says may be the worst humanitarian crisis yet in a war that has driven millions from their homes and killed hundreds of thousands.
Russia had repeatedly played down any talk of a refugee crisis and accused Turkey of violating international law by pouring troops and equipment into Idlib since early last month. About 60 Turkish troops have been killed in that time. 
Turkey, which has the second largest army in the transatlantic NATO alliance, has tried to resist the Syrian government advance and prevent a wave of refugees over its southern border. It already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees.
The ceasefire deal establishes a security corridor stretching 6 km (3.7 miles) to the north and south of Idlib's east-west M4 highway, where joint Russian-Turkish patrols will begin on March 15 - effectively advancing Russia's presence further north into Idlib.
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he hoped the deal ""will serve as a good basis for a cessation of military activity in the Idlib de-escalation zone"". 
Erdogan said the sides would work together to supply aid to Syrians in need, but that Turkey retained the right to ""respond to all (Syrian) regime attacks in the field."" 
""VERY TENSE CALM""
Residents and fighters in the region said the front lines, which have seen heavy air strikes by Russian and Syrian jets and intense Turkish artillery and drone strikes on Assad's forces, were quiet in much of the region after the midnight ceasefire came into effect.
""There is a ceasefire but there are violations,"" said Abdul Ghani al Sheikh, a rebel fighter from the Turkey-backed Failaq Sham rebel group. He said government forces were shelling Jabal al Zawya and Atareb, to the south and east of Idlib.
""But the situation overall is better. Everyone thinks this is all temporary and Turkish reinforcements are still coming.""
The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported that the first eight hours of the ceasefire had passed with ""relative calm"", and the skies had been free of Syrian government and Russian warplanes. 
A Syrian state reporter, broadcasting from the town of Saraqeb recaptured by Syrian forces last week, said they were reinforcing positions at the frontlines.
The ceasefire deal did not detail a ""safe zone"" or describe how displaced people could return to the homes they have fled to escape the Russian-backed offensive. 

""No one has mentioned a safe zone or areas of withdrawal. There is no pullout, and where will the displaced go (who) would never accept going to (Assad) regime areas? What we have heard is not comforting,"" said Ahmad Rahhal, a former general in the Syrian government forces who defected to the opposition.

Several military attachés were on board the helicopter bound for the commercial capital of Yangon when it crashed shortly after taking off from Lwe Khan village in northern Shan state, spokesman Zaw Min Tun told Reuters, declining to elaborate.
They had attended a press briefing in the area, where authorities recently seized $37 million worth of narcotics, chemicals and equipment, he said.

That works out at 2,304 toilet paper rolls for Haidee Janetzki and her family at a time when panic buying due to the coronavirus outbreak has caused major grocers in Australia to restrict supplies to a pack a person.
Janetzki thought she had placed her regular order from online retailer Who Gives a Crap last month and failed to notice the massive credit card bill until the pallets were delivered to her home in southern Queensland state.
How did she feel about the accidental purchase?
""Gobsmacked, confused and like a bit of an idiot,"" Janetzki said.
Janetzki's husband Chris went on social media to detail both the ""exciting day"" the toilet paper arrived, and Janetzki sitting on a 'throne' made from the boxes and decorated with different rolls on Wednesday, holding a staff in one hand and with a crown on her head, both made with toilet paper rolls.
""I'm relieved my friends and family don't have to worry about it,"" said Janetzki, when asked how she felt about the toilet paper demand Australia was facing.
Chris said they had worked out that it would take their family 12 years to get through the huge order. Instead, they have decided to sell some boxes in a fundraiser, at the same price at which they bought them.
""We are flying high, we are sitting pretty, we are loaded with toilet paper,"" Chris said in the Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) post on Wednesday that has since gone viral."
1487,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 05:40AM ET</span>",Meet the women who scavenge for gold at the top of the world,"By Nacho Doce and Mitra Taj
LA RINCONADA, Peru (Reuters) - Eva Chura is one of the magpies of the mountain. Living with their families in shacks in a gold shantytown in the Andes, these women make a living gleaning gold from rubble. 
They are called ""pallaqueras"" which roughly translates as 'gold-pickers.'
Chura came 12 years ago from her hometown of Chupa in the Puno region to La Rinconada, a settlement of around 50,000 which is believed to be the highest in the world. Five of her eight children live with her in her corrugated zinc home.
The eldest is 13-year-old Natalie. Chura is still breastfeeding the youngest, a boy called Alizon, and takes the baby with her when she goes scavenging.
It takes Chura an hour to reach the site where the women work. When they get there, they always sit down and chew coca leaves, light two cigarettes 'for the saints' and drink a little anise for luck. ""Sometimes there's gold, other times no. At the moment it's very low,"" she said.
The men of La Rinconada bar all women from the mines dug beneath the rock. The men say the female spirit of the mine, which is located below a glacier called La Bella Durmiente, or The Sleeping Beauty, would be jealous and angry if women were to try to steal her riches. 
So instead, the women take turns to scramble up onto piles of black scree that the men have dumped.
Teetering high above the ground, they stoop and flip over the rocks, their keen eyes scanning the lumps for a glimmer of gold. Anything promising they pocket, and take back to process and sell to black-market dealers whose stalls line La Rinconada's main street.
""In a week sometimes I can get 1 gram or 2 grams of gold,"" Chura said. Black market prices vary but on the London market that would fetch $50 or $100. ""If I'm lucky it can sometimes be 20 grams, but that's down to luck.""
The quantities each woman collects are tiny, but thousands of them are looking - some estimates say there are more than 15,000 pallaqueras in Peru.
No-one collects garbage in La Rinconada. Women and men alike risk their lives and subsist in squalor in the mountain's thin frigid air.
Life is hard, Chura says, but she is better off gold-picking.
""I don't count my husband, because he is no help as a father or a husband,"" she said. ""I'm the papa and the mama. ... We don't want for anything. We have everything.""
She does get troubled – especially by the fact she has no support if ever anyone in the family falls sick. 
""It is very sad to live with garbage and dirt, washing in the cold, with water from the mountain. But you tell yourself to get over it. The children give you strength and courage to work."" 
She says those of her children who were born in La Rinconada aren't bothered by the conditions, but when other people visit, they don't like the smell and the garbage. ""It used to be worse. The smell was stronger. Now we have grounds to play football or volleyball.""
To extract gold from the rocks the men and women use mercury, a toxin which they rinse with melted ice from the glacier. The water flows down the mountain into pools, puddles and rivers. 
""The water used in mining is just dumped and all the communities downstream ...  which are strictly farming areas, receive polluted water to support their livestock and crops,"" said Federico Chavarry, environmental crimes prosecutor for the region. ""These same waters carry heavy metals directly to Lake Titicaca.""
Titicaca is the largest lake in South America, a vital source of drinking water and fish for the surrounding population. Waste from gold-processing adds to pollution by run-off from surrounding cities and untreated sewage. In 2012 a German non-profit, the Global Nature Fund, named it the world's most threatened lake of the year.
The fragments of gold these people produce have, at least in the past, made their way into supply chains of firms including phone makers and jewelers. In 2018 a Swiss refinery that had been taking the metal for years stopped after Peruvian prosecutors alleged the company that collected it was a front for organized crime.        
Now, Chura and others in La Rinconada say the gold supply is running out in this area. ""It's not like it used to be. That's why so many ugly things happen,"" she said.
Miners have been shot dead in the tunnels; young women are trafficked into brothels; fights are common.
When police or other authorities come to town to try to enforce the law or restrict mining, they have been threatened by miners with the dynamite used to blast open the tunnels. The women join the protests too - some say the men force them to. 
Now there is less gold in the mountain, the men drink a lot more, she said. ""They spend more time in the bars than working.""

Chura's daughter Natalie helps her. ""She's like a son,"" she says. ""But I'm afraid of the things that might happen to her.""

SYDNEY/TOKYO (Reuters) - In Australia, major grocers have restricted supplies to one pack per person. In Japan, rolls are chained to the wall in public toilets. In Hong Kong, armed robbers carried out a heist as supplies were delivered to a supermarket.
Toilet paper has emerged as the unlikely No.1 stockpiling target for people across Asia who are worried that the spread of the coronavirus epidemic will lead to supply shortages. 
While other household products - including disinfectants, tissues and staples like rice and pasta - have also proved popular, it is the humble toilet roll that has inspired showdowns in supermarket aisles and countless social media memes.
The demand has caught many shoppers and sellers short, but psychologists say hoarding is a natural human reaction in times of high anxiety - and a desire to ensure sufficient supplies for lavatory visits in particular is not too much of a surprise.
""When we're buying stuff, things close to the body are very comforting, whether that be food, body care or in this case toilet paper,"" Adam Ferrier, a Melbourne-based psychologist who specializes in consumer behavior, told Reuters.
""The size of toilet paper makes it feel like a substantial, big purchase. It makes it feel like you're doing something. It taps back into that need for control. If you're buying a hefty big pack of toilet paper, you kind of feel like you're 'stocking up'. You signify to yourself that you're in control.""
Photos posted on social media showed plenty of shoppers in Asia seeking control this week as they pushed precariously overloaded carts to checkout counters after stripping shelves bare. 
In Australia, police were called out to settle grocery aisle disputes, a delivery truck catching fire due to a mechanical fault made national headlines, and outback newspaper The NT News published an eight-page liftout of blank paper saying the move was to give the nation what it wanted.
""It's been a wild week. Everyone's been on the edge of their seat looking at what's happening,"" said Simon Griffiths, co-founder of Who Gives A Crap, a social enterprise that sells recycled toilet paper and gives half its profit to sanitation-related charity.
The company had to suspend store sales and new subscriptions on Wednesday when sales volumes jumped 1100% the day before.
SOCIAL MEDIA ROLE
In Japan, the economy ministry has launched a publicity campaign to urge calm, posting daily photos on its Twitter account of delivery trucks carrying toilet rolls arriving full at their destinations and of replenished store aisles.
""We wanted to send a message for consumers to understand that inventory was arriving,"" ministry spokesman Yasushi Nozawa told Reuters, adding that while there was no shortage of supply of toilet rolls, distribution networks were struggling to keep up. 
""Inventory has piled up at warehouses,"" he said. ""We have requested a doubling of daily delivery capacity from 20 million rolls to 40 million.""
It's not the first time Japan has succumbed to toilet paper fever. During the global oil crisis of 1973, there were violent scenes in some stores as people rushed to buy bathroom tissue, fearing disruption to production. 
Singapore-based academics Roland Bouffanais and Lim Sun Sun said this time around, social media played a major role in making the worries of a toilet paper crunch ""propagate like a wildfire.""
""Collective behaviours among humans are remarkably similar to processes in the animal kingdom such as schooling among fish and flocking among birds,"" they wrote in an editorial about toilet roll hoarding in the Straits Times newspaper.
STACKING UP
The situation has also led to some unusually frank comments by Asian politicians. 
Singapore Trade Minister Chan Chun Sing was reported by local media as calling the panic buying idiotic in a meeting with business leaders, quipping: ""Why stock toilet paper? If you eat all the rice and instant noodles you confirm diarrhea.""
In Taiwan, during a brief toilet paper panic last month, Premier Su Tseng-chang called for calm on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page, saying people ""only have one butt-hole,"" to widespread amusement across the island. 
After a week of panic buying, Japan's biggest supermarket chain Aeon Co resorted to stacking up 12-roll packs in prominent displays at some of its stores to reassure customers there was plenty to go round.

""Our goal is to eliminate people's fears,"" said Aeon spokesman Daisuke Yokota. ""So we're piling them into these huge towers, to send the message: boom, there’s plenty.""

1490,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 04:43AM ET</span>","Virus diplomacy: As outbreak goes global, China seeks to reframe narrative","By Keith Zhai and Huizhong Wu
SINGAPORE/BEIJING (Reuters) - As new coronavirus cases track downward in China, it is looking to burnish its credentials as a responsible power by sharing expertise and equipment with countries seeing a surge in cases and to repair an international image dented by the disease.
China's diplomats have fanned out to deliver a message that it can control the outbreak and to call on countries to ease travel bans on Chinese people. They have given more than 400 media interviews and published more than 300 articles, according to the foreign ministry.
That outreach, which has included donations of medical gear, is part of an effort to change the narrative after China was criticized for an initially secretive response that exacerbated the early spread of the virus.
Beijing is even disputing the widely held belief that the disease originated in China.
More recently, China has won plaudits for the success of its drastic containment measures, including the virtual lockdown of Hubei province, home to 60 million people, dramatically slowing the increase in new cases even as the epidemic spread globally.
""China is carefully reshaping its image damaged by the outbreak, but the fact that the Chinese government delayed a timely response and led to an international crisis will make the mission almost impossible,"" said Alfred Wu, associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore.
Part of the effort to repair damage is the challenge to the assumption that the virus originated in the central city of Wuhan, in Hubei province, where it has been traced to a market that was illegally selling wildlife.
China is not to blame, it argues.
""Confirmed cases of #COVID19 were first found in China, but its origin is not necessarily in China,"" foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said on Twitter on Thursday.
""We are still tracing the origin.""
David Ho, a prominent Columbia University AIDS researcher, said the coronavirus almost certainly started in China.
""Given what we know of SARS, and this one, and what we know of all the coronaviruses that are found in other animal species, I have very little doubt that the origin is China,"" he said in a recent interview with Voice of America.
Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) was also caused by a coronavirus. It emerged in China to kill 774 people in 2002/03.
More than 98,000 people have been infected by the new coronavirus globally and more than 3,300 people have died, most in China.
DIPLOMATIC PIVOT
China has been increasingly assertive on the global stage under President Xi Jinping, but its hesitant early handling of the coronavirus has threatened to undermine trust in Beijing. With the virus spreading far more quickly outside China than inside, its messaging is now evolving.
While repeatedly accusing the United States of spreading panic about the virus, China has also been describing a challenge facing humanity and offering help to hard-hit countries such as Iran, Italy and South Korea.
Last week, China sent a medical team to Iran along with 250,000 masks and 5,000 test kits packed in boxes bearing a centuries-old verse by the Persian poet Saadi Shirazi: ""The children of Adam are the limbs of one body, that share an origin in their creation.""
This week, the Chinese government's top diplomat, Wang Yi, said the outbreak showed the need for a global ""Silk Road of Healthcare"", referring to Xi's signature Belt and Road Initiative, an infrastructure-building program viewed with suspicion in Washington and other western capitals.
""China is trying to showcase to the world its goodwill and friendship by taking a similar approach to its famous 'panda diplomacy',"" said Wang Huiyao, president of the Centre for China and Globalisation and an adviser to China's Cabinet, referring to China's history of gifting pandas as a grand gesture.
""This medical diplomacy is also trying to improve its negative international image over the past few years,"" he said, referring in particular to opposition to the Belt and Road plan.
A global shortage of medical supplies as the virus spikes far from China's shores gives it an opportunity to show both benevolence and its industrial might.
The city of Shanghai sent half a million face masks to the city of Daegu, the center of South Korea's coronavirus outbreak. A trade association in Zhejiang province donated 2,600 pairs of protective goggles to the Italian city of Turin.
Natasha Kassam, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute in Australia, said the fact that other political systems were struggling with the virus presented China with an opportunity.
""It does lend itself to very effective propaganda to be able to say China is now able to help other countries that are perhaps considered more developed,"" she said."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - -The U.S. Department of Justice has delayed the return to Malaysia of another $240 million of recovered money allegedly stolen from the 1MDB sovereign fund, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, with one citing political uncertainty.
Malaysia was plunged into turmoil when 94-year-old prime minister Mahathir Mohamad quit on Feb. 24.
He was replaced on Sunday by Muhyiddin Yassin, whose coalition includes the former ruling party that was voted out in 2018 amid accusations of corruption over 1MDB.
The U.S. Department of Justice says over $4.5 billion was looted from the fund under United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) prime minister Najib Razak, who is now on trial for corruption.
Since 2016, the department has filed civil lawsuits seeking to seize about $1.7 billion in assets allegedly bought with stolen 1MDB funds.
Last May, the United States began returning some of the recovered funds. The first installment was nearly $200 million.
The DOJ had initially been scheduled to return the next payment of recovered funds to Malaysia on Feb. 19, but there were technical reasons the transfer did not happen, the two sources said.
The total amount was around 1 billion ringgit ($240 million), one source said.
But once Mahathir resigned, it was decided to hold the payment due to uncertainty over what would happen next, one source said. The sources did not want to identified as they were not authorized to speak to media.
A DOJ spokesman declined to comment.
Malaysia's finance ministry redirected questions to the attorney general's chambers, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The sources said they were not aware of DOJ's next steps.
The funds returned go into a special fund at Malaysia's finance ministry and are meant to be used to pay 1MDB's bondholders.
American and Malaysian investigators have said Najib received about $1 billion of the stolen funds 1MDB funds. He has pleaded not guilty and says he was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials.
It was only after Najib's unexpected defeat in the 2018 elections that the 1MDB investigation was reopened in Malaysia and trials began.
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) and some of its executives are among the many charged for their role as underwriter and arranger of three bond sales that raised $6.5 billion for 1MDB. Three units of Goldman have pleaded not guilty to charges.
Najib told Reuters this week that he expected an atmosphere more conducive to a fair hearing now that Mahathir has gone.
Muhyiddin has not talked about the 1MDB cases but has vowed to fight graft.
Two senior officials in the Mahathir administration fighting graft - the attorney general and the chief of the anti-corruption commission - quit in the last week after Mahathir's resignation."

AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Four fugitive suspects go on trial in the Netherlands on Monday charged with the murder of 298 passengers and crew aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 which was shot down with a Russian-made missile over eastern Ukraine in July 2014.
Wreckage of the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 777 fell to the ground in fields surrounding the Ukrainian village of Hrabove in territory held by pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian government forces.
The jet was flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur when it was hit by a surface-to-air missile. There were no survivors.
Arrest warrants were issued last year for three Russians and a Ukrainian who were identified by a Dutch-led Joint Investigation Team (JIT) which spent several years collecting evidence to identify those behind the attack.
The four, Russians Sergey Dubinsky, Oleg Pulatov and Igor Girkin, and Ukrainian Leonid Kharchenko, had senior positions in the pro-Russian militias in eastern Ukraine in 2014. The JIT said they had not pulled the trigger, but colluded to carry out the attack.
Girkin, a vocal and battle-hardened Russian nationalist, was minister of defense in the self-declared Donetsk People’s Republic (DNR) in Ukraine. Dubinsky, Pulatov and Kharchenko were members of the separatists’ military intelligence unit.
The defendants are at large and are not expected to show up for the hearings at a high-security courtroom near Amsterdam's Schiphol airport where they will be prosecuted under Dutch law.
If they don't appear, or fail to send lawyers, the judges could rule that the trial be held in absentia.
In addition to charges for the deaths, they also face preliminary allegations of obtaining a missile launcher with the intent to bring down an aircraft.
Russia has consistently denied any involvement or providing financial or military support to pro-Russian rebels in Ukraine.
President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said the Kremlin would wait to see how the trial panned out before commenting, but added that Russia had always had doubts about the objectivity of the Dutch-led investigation.
The JIT includes judicial authorities from Australia, Malaysia, Belgium and Ukraine, in addition to Dutch police and prosecutors.
The aircraft's downing led to sanctions against Moscow by the European Union. It also heightened political tension between Russia and Western powers who blame it for the disaster, which killed 193 Dutch, 43 Malaysian and 27 Australian nationals, among others.
The largest criminal investigation in Dutch history painstakingly reconstructed the events leading up to and on July 17, 2014. Police and prosecutors examined tens of thousands of pieces of evidence, including videos, communication taps, satellite imagery, photos and social media posts.
Among the evidence are images plotting the missile launcher's journey as it crossed into Ukraine ahead of the disaster. A reconstruction presented by prosecutors showed it returning to Russia a day later with one fewer missiles.
Intercepts released in November by the JIT showed that two of the suspects had been in contact with Vladislav Surkov, a senior Putin aide, and Sergey Aksyonov, a Russian-appointed leader in Russian-annexed Crimea., it said.
The communications between the DNR militant leaders and Russian government officials ""raise questions about their possible involvement in the deployment of the (missile), which brought down flight MH17"", the JIT said.
Two weeks have been scheduled for the first proceedings, which could be largely procedural. The trial is expected to run through 2020 and may be longer in the event of delays.
The JIT concluded in May 2018 that the missile launcher ""that took down flight MH17 belonged to the 53rd Anti-Aircraft Missile Brigade of the Russian Federation"". It was based at the Kursk military base, just across the Ukrainian border, it said.
The Russian Defence Ministry said at the time that “not a single air defence missile launcher of the Russian Armed Forces has ever crossed the Russian-Ukrainian border”."

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Bhutan said on Friday it had banned the entry of tourists for two weeks after it confirmed its first case of the coronavirus, in a tourist who arrived form neighboring India.
The tiny Himalayan kingdom, which is heavily reliant on high-end tourism for foreign exchange, said a 79-year-old American who entered by air from India on March 2 had tested positive for the virus.
""The government will impose two weeks restriction on all incoming tourists with immediate effect,"" the health ministry said in a statement.
""This is to enable rigorous monitoring, source assessment of infection and mitigate the situation.""
The government also announced the closure of several schools and the postponement of international conferences and seminars for two weeks.
The ministry said the patient, who had entered India on Feb. 21, had been put in quarantine in hospital in the capital, Thimpu.
India's total number of confirmed cases rose to 31, after a person from New Delhi with a history of travel from Thailand and Malaysia tested positive, its health ministry said.
The coronavirus, which can cause respiratory illness that can lead to pneumonia, is believed to have emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.

Globally, there have been more than 98,000 cases and more than 3,300 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Most of the cases and deaths have been in China but the virus is now spreading in numerous countries.

1494,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 06, 2020 12:43AM ET</span>","Out of school, Japanese children are isolated together by coronavirus policy","By Akira Tomoshige and Chang-Ran Kim
TOKYO (Reuters) - At Stella Kids daycare in central Tokyo, school children spend the day sitting at separate individual tables, spaced far apart, and facing away from their peers.
They sit there for hours playing, studying and eating in the same seat from as early as 8 a.m. until their parents come to pick them up after work in the afternoon or evening.
The extreme measures are a result of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's request that all schools in Japan be closed starting this week to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
The policy has been roundly criticized as counterintuitive, disruptive and risky given it has pushed tens of thousands of pupils into daycare centers instead.
That's left many private and publicly subsidized after-school care facilities, called ""gakudo"", improvising measures to try to stop children contracting the illness.
""We have the children spend all day at the same seat, eating their snacks and lunches there too,"" Ikuyo Kamimura, Stella Kids manager, told Reuters. ""They face the same direction so they don't get infected by droplets,"" she said.
About 1.3 million children across Japan are registered to use ""gakudo"", according to the government, and it is unclear how each center is handling the situation.
In big cities, where real estate prices are high, dozens of children can share a single room playing with communal toys, and not allowed outdoors due to a shortage of staff to supervise them. And children are now potentially in those small, shared spaces for several hours longer than usual.
Parents, caretakers, medical experts and politicians were left gobsmacked when Abe announced the nationwide school closure on Feb. 27. Some municipalities have chosen not to comply, but the majority of schools across the country have agreed to the request to stay closed until the new academic year starts in early April.
""The classrooms are empty but the children are packing into after-school care facilities. What's the point?"" Tetsuro Fukuyama, secretary general of the opposition Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan, asked Abe in parliament this week.
Abe repeated the government's stance that it took the drastic step to contain the virus over the critical one to two-week period.
DADDY DAYCARE
Japan has recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus cases - the majority from a cruise ship quarantined last month and a handful of children - and six deaths excluding those from the ship.
Abe has been criticized for Japan's seemingly slow response to contain the outbreak, including a failure to administer tests to detect the virus fast enough. A state visit from Chinese President Xi Jinping due next month has been postponed and Tokyo has announced tighter travel restrictions on visitors from China and South Korea. However, Abe has insisted the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo will go ahead as planned.
On television, social media and around town, parents worried about children falling behind in school, or infecting the more vulnerable elderly tasked with babysitting their grandchildren for a month.
""There was no consultation as to whether (school closures) would be effective,"" Nobuhiko Okabe, an epidemiologist and head of Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health who is on a council set up to advise the government on coronavirus issues. ""It was a political decision.""
Meanwhile, parents who were able to work from home had their own worries.
""It's good my company is letting me work from home, but I was befuddled at first because I wasn't sure how to look after my son all day,"" Koji Ishii told Reuters between housework, looking after his 6-year-old son and working on his laptop in a city east of Tokyo. ""I'm concerned about the constraint on my son's daily life."""

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - In May 2018, Malaysia's Mahathir Mohamad was in the grand ballroom of a Sheraton hotel near Kuala Lumpur, jubilantly announcing his return as prime minister after defeating an alliance that had run the country for 60 years.
Less than two years later, the coalition assembled by the 94-year-old crumbled in the same hotel, as members of his party held meetings with their former opponents that eventually led to his downfall.
Mahathir has shaped Malaysia like no other politician since the Southeast Asian nation became independent, with a 22-year stint as prime minister that started in 1981 and then a second term after his historic return two years ago.
It's not clear, given his age, if he can pull off another comeback.
The political machinations that led to Mahathir's resignation were started several months ago with his knowledge, the aim being to block his former deputy and rival-turned-ally Anwar Ibrahim from taking power, more than a dozen sources told Reuters.
The timing went awry, said the sources, who had direct knowledge of the events but declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the subject.
In the ensuing turmoil, Mahathir was outplayed by colleagues and close allies, including Muhyiddin Yassin, who took the premiership, the sources said. He was also rebuffed by Malaysia's powerful sultans, from whom the king is chosen by rotation.
Spokesmen for Mahathir, Anwar and Muhyiddin did not respond to requests for comment on this story.
Anwar was deputy prime minister under Mahathir in the 1990s and was seen as his successor-in-waiting in a government led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO).
In 1998, they disagreed on how to tackle the Asian financial crisis and fell out. Anwar was sacked, and he launched a 'Reformasi' (reform) movement to end UMNO's race-based governance that favored the country's Malay majority.
In an astonishing U-turn two years ago, the two came together to form the reformist Pakatan Harapan, or Pact of Hope, alliance to oust Najib Razak's UMNO government.
Under a pre-election agreement, Anwar was to take over as prime minister from Mahathir. It was not specified when.
However, in recent months, Mahathir was not convinced his former deputy would be able to command a majority, sources said. He was also facing pressure from aides who said the alliance's fortunes were slipping because of Malay anger against the presence of the Chinese-dominated Democratic Action Party (DAP) in its fold.
""STOP ANWAR""
Initially, ""the main goal of everyone was to stop Anwar,"" said one source close to Muhyiddin. That would help dismantle the multi-ethnic Pakatan alliance and fashion a government more aligned with the Muslim Malays.
Muhyiddin and Mohamed Azmin Ali, then a member of Anwar's party, reached out last year to UMNO and Islamist party PAS, both in the opposition, to explore chances for a realignment, sources close to Mahathir and Muhyiddin said. Mahathir was aware of the talks and did not object, they said.
Mahathir however refused to work with all UMNO leaders, especially former prime minister Najib, who is on trial for corruption.
Azmin did not respond to requests for comment.
Najib told Reuters on Wednesday discussions for a new coalition had been going on for months.
The original plan had been to make a move after the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Malaysia in November - and put the question of Anwar's premiership to parliament in the expectation it would be voted down, sources said.
But things came to a head on Feb. 21 when Anwar's supporters challenged Mahathir at a meeting to set a date to hand over. One source with knowledge of the matter described the tone of the demand as ""uncouth"", leaving Mahathir furious.
In response, Mahathir's allies moved up their plan and summoned their potential new partners to a dinner at the Sheraton hotel on Feb. 23. In the so-called ""Sheraton Move"", members of Mahathir's Bersatu party and UMNO joined in a very public show of the changes afoot.
UMNO leaders told reporters the Pakatan coalition had fallen and they backed Mahathir for prime minister. Anwar said in a Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) broadcast that he was betrayed.
But Mahathir had not been at the Sheraton and was adamantly against the plan since it involved all of UMNO, including Najib.
What nobody expected was that he would simply resign as prime minister the next day, Feb. 24.
In tears, Mahathir told Anwar and other Pakatan coalition partners that he no longer had his own party's support and was not behind the moves to partner with UMNO, sources familiar with the discussions said.
FROM THE SHADOWS
In a counter-move, Mahathir offered to lead a unity government with whoever would join. He wanted no party affiliations, a move his detractors thought would give unilateral control.
The reactions were swift. UMNO and PAS called for early elections. Anwar said he was now the Pakatan coalition's candidate for prime minister.
When it became clear that Mahathir's national unity plan was not gaining support, a new candidate for prime minister emerged from his Bersatu party: Muhyiddin.
""He says politics is more important than principles,"" Mahathir said of Muhyiddin later, referring to his willingness to partner with all of UMNO.
Muhyiddin had long been overshadowed by his contemporaries Anwar and Najib. He had been fired by Najib as deputy premier in 2015 for criticizing alleged corruption.
Amid the turmoil, King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah began consultations with all 222 lawmakers to find a candidate for prime minister.
By now, momentum was building behind Muhyiddin and people close to Mahathir began switching sides.
The main message from Muhyiddin, sources close to him said, was the importance of building an alliance that did not include Anwar and the Chinese-dominated DAP, long the bogeyman for Malays.
Mahathir went back to his old alliance with Anwar that agreed to support him for premier but it was too late.
Later that day, the king, after consulting with the council of Sultans, announced Muhyiddin was the man likely to be able to command a majority in parliament.
Mahathir cried foul and complained that he could show that he had majority support. The palace said nothing.
In a sign of where some royal sentiment lay, the crown prince of the powerful sultanate of Johor posted a picture of himself on Instagram, saying ""Who's your daddy now?"" Mahathir had taunted the prince last year as ""a little boy.""
Mahathir kept trying to contact the king, who would not take his calls, one source close to Mahathir said.
Less than an hour before Muhyiddin was sworn in, Mahathir conceded that he would have to leave the prime minister's office, at least for now.
""The king has made a decision not to see me anymore,"" he said. ""I cannot communicate with the palace."""
1496,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 11:31PM ET</span>","Dubai's ruler abducted daughters and threatened former wife, UK judge rules","By Michael Holden
LONDON (Reuters) - Dubai's ruler ordered the abduction of two daughters and orchestrated a campaign of intimidation against his former wife, a British judge has ruled, in what is likely to be a major blow to his reputation as a Middle East reformer.
Judge Andrew McFarlane said he accepted as proved a series of allegations made by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum's former wife, Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, during a custody battle over their two children at London's High Court.
Haya, the half-sister of Jordan's King Abdullah, fled to London on April 15 last year with the children, Jalila, 12, and Zayed, 8, fearing for her safety amid suspicions that she had had an affair with one of her British bodyguards.
Her lawyers argued that Mohammed's treatment of two older daughters by another marriage showed her children were at risk of being abducted too.
As part of the custody case, Andrew McFarlane, President of the Family Court division in England and Wales, made a series of ""findings of fact"" about allegations raised by Haya, 45, during hearings over the last nine months.
McFarlane said he accepted her claim that Mohammed arranged for his daughter Shamsa, then aged 18, to be kidnapped off the streets of Cambridge in central England in 2000, and had her flown back to Dubai.
He also ruled it was proved that the sheikh had arranged for Shamsa's younger sister Latifa to be snatched from a boat in international waters off India by Indian forces in 2018 and returned to the emirate in what was her second failed escape attempt.
Both remained there ""deprived of their liberty"", McFarlane said.
After the ruling became public on Thursday, Mohammed said it only represented ""one side of the story"".
""As a Head of Government, I was not able to participate in the court's fact-finding process, this has resulted in the release of a 'fact-finding' judgment which inevitably tells only one side of the story,"" he said in a statement issued by his lawyers.
He said a decision to allow the judgments to be made public did not protect his children ""from media attention in the way that other children in family proceedings in the UK are protected"".
INTIMIDATION
In the judgments, McFarlane accepted that the sheikh subjected Haya to a campaign of intimidation which made her fear for her life.
He said the sheikh, who married Haya in 2004, had divorced her on the 20th anniversary of the death of her father King Hussein of Jordan, timing she said was deliberate.
""I have ... concluded that, save for some limited exceptions, the mother has proved her case with respect to the factual allegations she has made,"" McFarlane said.
The sheikh, 70, vice-president and prime minister of the United Arab Emirates, did not appear himself during the court case and instructed his lawyers not to put forward a challenge to the claims, which his lawyers said he rejected.
The judgment does not amount to a determination of criminal guilt but it is likely to deal a reputational blow to the sheikh, regarded globally as the visionary force behind Dubai's leap on to the international stage.
Asked how the findings might impact on the United Kingdom's business relations with Dubai, British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told Reuters in Riyadh: ""We'll look at it very carefully before jumping to any conclusions.""
Haya's lawyers suggested that the British Foreign Office had intervened to stifle a police probe into Shamsa's disappearance, and McFarlane said the detective in charge had been refused permission to interview potential witnesses in Dubai.
However, the judge added it was ""not possible to find on the balance of probability"" that there had been direct intervention by the Foreign Office triggered by Mohammed or Dubai.
RESTRICTIONS LIFTED
The judge's conclusions were made in December but could only be reported after restrictions were lifted after the UK Supreme Court earlier rejected Mohammed's request for permission to appeal against their publication.
McFarlane said the allegations made by Haya about the abduction and torture of Shamsa and Latifa and the threats made against her were proved, with the exception of her claim that an arranged marriage was being sought between Jalila and Saudi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.
Last July, the judge had issued a temporary forced marriage protection order in respect of Jalila over Haya's fears but said these were only based on hearsay evidence.
""The allegations that the father ordered and orchestrated the kidnap and rendition to Dubai of his daughters Shamsa and Latifa are of a very high order of seriousness,"" said McFarlane.
""They may well involve findings, albeit on the civil standard, of behavior which is contrary to the criminal law of England and Wales, international law, international maritime law, and internationally accepted human rights norms."" 
McFarlane said the sheikh had denied all the allegations, but said of his account relating to Shamsa and Latifa that ""he has not been open and honest with the court"".
""I have found that he continues to maintain a regime whereby both of these two young women are deprived of their liberty, albeit within family accommodation in Dubai,"" he said.
The sheikh married Haya, believed to be his sixth wife, in 2004. McFarlane said in his judgment that at some stage in 2017 or 2018, she had an affair with one her bodyguards and her relationship with her husband had deteriorated by early 2019 when she left Dubai.
Mohammed's lawyer told the court Haya had closed the children's bank accounts and withdrawn about $32 million before arriving in Britain.
FRIENDS OF UK ROYALS
Haya and Mohammed are both on friendly terms with members of the British royal family and in the past the sheikh, one of the founders of the Godolphin horse racing stable, has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth at Britain’s Royal Ascot horse races.
    Haya, who shares his love of horses and competed in equestrian jumping in the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, was schooled in Britain and is now living with their children in the couple's luxury mansion near Kensington Palace in west London.
McFarlane said the case had been unique.
Outside the austere wood-pannelled courtroom of the Royal Courts of Justice, four or five bodyguards wearing earpieces patrolled, with only lawyers and a small number of journalists, including Reuters, allowed to be present.
The lawyers' benches were filled with some of Britain's most senior legal operators including David Pannick, who successfully represented anti-Brexit campaigners in two high-profile court victories over the government and was drafted in by Mohammed to lead his team during the case.
Haya herself attended all the hearings, accompanied by her legal team which included Fiona Shackleton who represented British heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles in his divorce from his late first wife Princess Diana.
Giving evidence in person last November, she told McFarlane she feared the sheikh would abduct her two children, take them back to the Gulf Arab state and she would never see them again.

""I have seen what has happened to their sisters and I can't face the fact that the same might happen to them,"" she said.

MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia's highest court will hear a final bid on March 11 by former Vatican treasurer George Pell to overturn his conviction for sexually assaulting two teenaged choir boys in the 1990s when he was archbishop of Melbourne.
Pell, 78, is in jail serving a six-year sentence which began a year ago after he was convicted by a jury on one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16 and four charges of an indecent act with a child under 16.
The highest ranked Catholic worldwide to be jailed for child sex offences is appealing to the High Court of Australia after Victoria's Court of Appeal upheld his conviction last August by a 2-1 majority.
His conviction has been the most high profile case of sexual abuse by priests to rock the Roman Catholic Church across the globe, from Australia to Argentina, mostly stemming from alleged assaults that took place decades ago.
Pell was appointed by Pope Francis in 2014 to overhaul the Vatican's finances. He lost his role last year after being jailed, however he remains a cardinal despite pressure on the church from victims of sexual abuse and their advocates to dismiss him.
To be dismissed from the priesthood, the Vatican's Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith would have to find him guilty following a separate canonical trial or a shortened procedure, known as an ""administrative process"".
The Pope has declined to comment on Pell's case until he exhausts all avenues of appeal.
The High Court has set two days for a hearing, starting on March 11, before five or seven judges. Pell will not be at the court.
The judges could refuse to take on the case after initial arguments, in which case Pell would have no further avenue of appeal and would remain in jail.

Or, the court could go ahead and hear all the arguments on whether the Court of Appeal majority was right in ruling that it was not unreasonable that the trial jury found Pell guilty.

QUANG TRI, Vietnam (Reuters) - Two petite women in protective gear walk slowly down an empty field in Vietnam, carrying a large metal detector that clicks and whirrs, searching for unexploded ordnance.
Medic and safety officer Nguyen Thi Ha Lan supervises her teammates, the ""landmine girls"" as they are known, preparing to detonate a cluster bomb left behind from the war with the United States that ended in 1975.
It is one of many underneath the soil in Quang Tri province, north-central Vietnam.
Once the team is ready to detonate, Lan warns people to clear the area. A siren goes off and then an earthshattering boom.
Lan is part of an all-woman explosive disposal team working under project RENEW (Restoring the Environment and Neutralising the Effect of War) -- to help rehabilitate more than 60,000 hectares (150,000 acres) of agricultural land.
The area was one of the most heavily bombed of the war and the U.S. Department of Defence estimates that 10 percent of the 80 million tons of munitions used by the U.S army in Vietnam failed to detonate on impact.
For Lan, being part of the 16-member team has a special meaning.
At the age of 12, her mother Hoa lost both legs and an arm due to unexploded ordnance (UXO), while playing in her front yard.
She has spent most of her life in a wheelchair, but still raised two children. Lan's younger brother works as a deminer in another RENEW team.
""When I look at the kids playing in my front yard, it reminds me of my mother and I used to cry silently inside,"" Lan says.
""My job now enables me to have a stable life and the kids are able to play around me on Quang Tri soil and all over Vietnam too.""
In Quang Tri alone, there have been over 8,500 casualties from accidents involving UXO.
Nearly a third of the victims are children who mistake the round, tennis-ball sized cluster bombs for something to play with.
EOD teams such as Lan's have helped clear over 5,600 hectares (14,000 acres).
Demining work is grueling and dangerous. Working under the scorching sun and temperatures that can reach 42 degrees Celsius (108 Fahrenheit) means that skins tan no matter how much sunscreen they use.
""It is an honour to wear the uniform of the project everyday, so even if we aren't able to wear make up or a beautiful dress like everyone else, we all feel proud from the bottom of our hearts,"" says Lan. 
Lan also appreciates the camaraderie that the landmine girls share, working in such dangerous conditions.
There are still many explosives to be cleared. In August 2018, more than 1,400 items were found in an underground cache. But Quang Tri had no accidents last year. The plan is to clear the province of unexploded ordnance by 2025."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea issued a strongly worded protest on Friday against Japan's decision to quarantine South Korean visitors for two weeks, as coronavirus containment measures ignited a fresh diplomatic row between the Asian nations.
Japan joined the list of almost 100 countries that have imposed restrictions on South Korean travelers, barring arrivals from highly affected areas starting on Saturday and ordering a two-week quarantine for those from other regions.
The South Korean foreign ministry said Japan's ambassador would be summoned to explain Tokyo's decision and receive a formal complaint. Seoul has previously summoned ambassadors from Vietnam and Singapore over similar travel restrictions.
""It is extremely regrettable Japan took this unreasonable and excessive step without sufficient prior consultation with us, and we strongly urge immediate reconsideration,"" it said.
Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said Seoul would respond with countermeasures, although he gave no details on what actions could be taken.
The presidential Blue House discussed the issue at a meeting of its National Security Council, an official said.
The row came as the number of new cases in South Korea, the country with the biggest outbreak of the flu-like virus outside China, fell to 196 from 760 the previous day, for a total of 6,284 infections. The death toll rose by seven to 42, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said.
Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said fewer new cases were being counted as authorities had almost completed testing more than 200,000 followers of a church in the southeastern city of Daegu at the center of South Korea's outbreak.
""It is difficult to predict future developments because there are secondary and tertiary infections happening around the country involving them,"" Kim told reporters.
Officials are scheduled to provide updated numbers later on Friday.
Japan's chief government spokesman, Yoshihide Suga, defended the travel restrictions, which also apply to visitors from China.
""The decision was the result of a comprehensive review of the information available about the situation in other countries and the effects of other measures,"" he said.
""I think the timing is appropriate.""
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has come under intense criticism for the government's handling of the virus outbreak as Japan prepares to host the Tokyo Olympics in July.
The number of South Koreans visiting Japan fell nearly 26% last year from 2018 to 5.6 million, the first drop since 2011 when Japan was hit by an earthquake and nuclear disaster, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.
Japan and South Korea have had difficult relations since Japan's 1910-45 occupation of the Korean peninsula. Last year Tokyo slapped trade curbs on South Korea and South Koreans responded with a boycott on Japanese goods and services."

""The decision was the result of a comprehensive review of the information available about the situation in other countries and the effects of other measures,"" chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga said at a news conference on Friday. ""I think the timing is appropriate.""
The new measures, announced by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Thursday, came after weeks of criticism he was failing to tackle the outbreak head-on and coincided with the country's biggest one-day increase in new infections.
The Japanese government has been insistent in recent days that Tokyo will host the Olympics on schedule from July 24, even as other sporting events in the run-up to the competition - including the Tokyo marathon and an Olympic rugby test event - have been scaled down or canceled.
The number of coronavirus cases in Japan stood at 1,057 as of Friday morning, with new infections reported from Yamaguchi prefecture in the southwest to Hokkaido in the north, according to national broadcaster NHK. Twelve people have died from the disease.
Starting Monday, people arriving from China and South Korea will be quarantined for two weeks at designated sites. Japanese nationals will also be subject to the measures, Suga said.
South Korea's foreign ministry said it will summon the Japanese ambassador on Friday to explain the decision and receive a formal complaint.
""It is extremely regrettable Japan took this unreasonable and excessive step without sufficient prior consultation with us, and we strongly urge immediate reconsideration,"" the ministry said in a statement. 
Relations between South Korea and former colonial ruler Japan are already under strain by a dispute over wartime labor that has spilled into trade.
Japan's economy minister acknowledged the restrictions could hurt inbound tourism, although he said the priority needs to be on preventing the spread of the virus.
""The quarantine steps could have a negative impact on tourism in the short-term, but the number of tourists from China has already significantly dropped,"" Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters on Friday. ""I will closely monitor the impact of the steps and how much we can curb infection.""

Chinese visitors in particular have been a lynchpin of Prime Minister Abe's program for economic revitalization.

(Reuters) - An Alabama man was put to death by lethal injection on Thursday for his role in the 2004 killing of three police officers at his Birmingham apartment during a drug bust, state corrections officials said. 
Nathaniel Woods, 43, was pronounced dead at 9:01 p.m. central standard time at the Holman Correctional Facility in Atmore, Alabama, said Samantha Rose of the state's department of corrections. The condemned man did not make a final statement, she said.
Woods and his friend Kerry Spencer were convicted for the 2004 murders of Birmingham police officers Carlos Owen, Harley Chisholm and Charles Bennett.
On the morning of July 17, 2004, Woods and Spencer got into a ""hostile, profanity-laced"" argument with Owen and police officer Michael Collins and threatened them, court documents showed. 
Later that day, the officers went to Woods' apartment along with Chisholm and Bennett to serve him a warrant and arrest him for dealing drugs and were met by a spray of gunfire. Owen, Chisholm and Bennett were killed and Collins was wounded, according to court documents. 
Prosecutors said it was Spencer who had opened fire, but accused Woods of being an accomplice to the murders. In December 2005, both men were convicted of capital murder and attempted murder and sentenced to death. Spencer remains on death row.
The case has garnered the attention of Martin Luther King III, the son of the late civil rights leader, who wrote a letter to Alabama Governor Kay Ivey, asking her to intervene. 
""Killing this African American man, whose case appears to have been strongly mishandled by the courts, could produce an irreversible injustice,"" he wrote in the letter he posted on Twitter on Wednesday.

The office of the governor did not comment.

TOKYO (Reuters) - The restaurants at the Exitmelsa shopping center in Tokyo's upscale Ginza district are usually packed with Chinese tourists. But on a recent weekday, many lunchtime tables were empty, a sign of the toll that the coronavirus is taking on tourism.
For Japanese who have grown dependent on Chinese tourists for business, like waiter Kiyotake Watanabe, it marks a disconcerting trend.
""People on group tours would gather together at noon, and 10 or 20 of them would come in all at once,"" Watanabe, who works at a Chinese restaurant in the shopping center, told Reuters. Those customers evaporated after China in January banned overseas group tours.
Just months ahead of the 2020 Olympics, the jolt to tourism may presage a broader economic impact from the coronavirus for both Japan and the global economy. Japan could be at particular risk because of its increased reliance on Chinese tourism under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's ""Abenomics"" policies.
Nomura Securities had forecast a 240 billion yen ($2.3 billion) bump from event-related tourism in 2020, which it said would evaporate if the Olympics were canceled, although organizers have said delaying or moving the games is not an option. Last year, Japan hosted 31.9 million foreign visitors, who spent 4.81 trillion yen.
The flu-like virus SARS-CoV-2 has spread to about 80 countries after emerging in central China late last year and has hurt global tourism, air travel and events. About 98,000 people have been infected and 3,300 killed worldwide.
Although most cases are in China, more new infections are appearing outside that country.
There are no official tourism figures from February yet, but some analysts - and anecdotal evidence from people in the tourism industry - suggest that arrivals from Asia alone are likely to be down by at least half.
""You've got that negativity that is going to percolate through the system,"" said Jesper Koll, a senior adviser at WisdomTree Investments.
The hit to economic growth from slowing inbound tourism could be a quarter of a percentage point or more, he said.
'EXPLOSIVE SHOPPING'
For Japan, which has seen more than 1,000 confirmed infections, 2020 was supposed to be a record year for foreign arrivals and a boon for an economy already on the brink of recession.
About 9.5 million of Japan's foreign visitors last year were Chinese, a number that has risen more than six-fold over the past seven years.
And Chinese visitors spend more than others, accounting for 30% of tourists but 37% of tourist spending last year, according to Japan Tourism Agency data.
At a shop near Watanabe's restaurant, the shelves were lined with rice cookers, sake cups and beauty products such as lipstick usually popular with Chinese tourists, who are known for their ""bakugai"" or ""explosive shopping"" sprees.
But there were few customers. Shop workers chatted with each other in the nearly empty store.
On Wednesday, Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the outbreak has hurt consumption through a decline in Chinese tourists.
The pain could worsen after Abe on Thursday said the government would suspend existing visas for visitors from China and South Korea and quarantine them for two weeks.
HOTELS SQUEEZED
In the central prefecture of Shizuoka, home to Mt Fuji, Chinese account for as much as 70% of foreign tourists. Some 90,000 people, mostly Chinese, have canceled hotel and ryokan inn bookings for the first three months of this year, according to the local tourism association.
That represents about a third of the total bookings by Chinese tourists during the period.
In response, the prefecture has made it easier for tourism-dependent businesses to get loans, said Mitsuhiro Sasamatsu of the local government's tourism policy division.
But some hotels that are dependent on Chinese tourists are temporarily shutting down. ""For them, it is better cost-wise to shut down completely than to have the business open for few guests,"" Sasamatsu said.
About 80,000 new rooms are expected to open in nine major cities between 2019 and 2021, according to a June report from CBRE, a property research firm.
Even before the coronavirus, the supply of rooms in all nine was forecast to outstrip demand, according to CBRE.
This week, H.I.S. Co (T:9603), Japan's largest listed travel agent by revenue, said it expected a full-year loss, rather than a profit, citing the coronavirus impact.
Yoshio Adachi, who guides tourists around Yokohama's bay area in a custom tuk tuk imported from Thailand, reckons the number of Chinese tourists has fallen by as much 60% since the outbreak.
He is hoping that a bid to host a casino resort in the city, Japan's second largest, will pan out and lead to more tourists.
""The Olympics will be a one off, so the economy will need to come back after that,"" he said."

Former Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who unexpectedly resigned last month after his coalition collapsed, has accused the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) of orchestrating a return to power so that its officials escape conviction in the alleged theft of billions of dollars from state fund 1Malaysia Development Bhd (1MDB).
The party denies the charges.
Latheefa Koya of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission said there was no pressure on her to resign and that new Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin, who is backed by UMNO, understood her decision to put in her papers. She said she wanted to return to her practice as a human rights advocate.
""I also briefed the prime minister about our ongoing actions and efforts for the recovery of the stolen 1MDB monies from abroad,"" Latheefa said in a statement. ""He was fully supportive of these actions.""
In January, Latheefa revealed audio clips at a news conference that she called proof of a high-level criminal conspiracy to cover up wrongdoing in the 1MDB case for which former Prime Minister Najib Razak is facing trial.
Najib denies the charges.
In an interview on Wednesday, Najib said the fall of the government that ousted him meant he now expected an atmosphere more conducive to a fair hearing.
Malaysia's attorney general Tommy Thomas, who had brought the corruption charges against Najib and other members of the former UMNO administration, quit last week."

SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia ordered its first school closure on Friday after a 16-year-old pupil tested positive for the coronavirus, as the country's prime minister warned the public bill for treating infected patients could top A$1 billion ($661 million).
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he has written to Australia's state governments to create a A$1 billion fund to treat coronavirus patients, though he cautioned more money may be needed.
Australia has recorded 60 cases of the coronavirus while two elderly people have died from the virus as authorities struggle to contain the outbreak.
Morrison in late February said a global pandemic of the coronavirus was likely, and on Friday he detailed the healthcare costs for the first time.
""We are estimating based on the advice that we have at the moment that this could be as much as about A$1 billion,"" he said.
""I hope it is not that much. It could be more.""
While the majority of those infected in Australia contracted the virus overseas before returning home, the outbreak is now spreading locally.
A 16-year boy in Sydney, Australia's largest city, became the latest to be diagnosed.
Desperate to ensure the coronavirus doesn't spread, the New South Wales government ordered the closure of Epping Boys High School in the city's north for at least one day, the country's first school closure as a result of the outbreak.
Health officials said the nearly 1,200 pupils and staff will need to quarantine themselves.
""Students at the school are advised to stay at home and self-isolate over the weekend,"" the NSW state government said in an emailed statement.
""Staff are also asked to stay at home and self-isolate. The school will provide a further update over the weekend about next steps.""
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the teenager is believed to have contracted the virus through contact with another coronavirus patient, making his a case another local transmission.
The spread of the coronavirus is expected to have a significant economic toll with the government on Thursday warning the crisis would subtract at least half a percentage point from first quarter growth.
Australia's government is poised to announce a stimulus package to cushion the economic hit of the virus.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the multi-billion dollar package would target sectors most affected by the coronavirus.
Local media on Friday reported the government was considering subsidizing wages for small- and medium-sized businesses amid fears of widespread job losses that could lead to a recession.
Australia's A$2 trillion economy has already hit turbulence after 29 years of recession-free growth, with many economists predicting a contraction in the current quarter.
Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy said it was too early to determine the long-term economic toll of the epidemic, but it was clear it would have immediate and significant effects.
The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) has already cut interest rates four times in less than a year to a record low 0.50%, in response to a range of growing economic challenges.
Deputy Governor Guy Debelle said late on Wednesday the central bank has the capacity to reduce its cash rate one more time to 0.25% before deploying quantitative easing."

Health authorities said the man in his 30s, who is the partner of a woman who was confirmed to have COVID-19 this week, attended the Tool concert at Spark Arena in Auckland on Feb. 28.
The rock concert in New Zealand's largest city was packed to capacity for two days last week.
""He was in the general admission standing area in the front left-hand quadrant,"" Ministry of Health director-general of health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said at a news conference. ""We encourage people who were in the general admission standing area to be aware of symptoms of COVID-19.""
Bloomfield said the risk is low for all others who attended this concert. The man has been isolated at home since Wednesday.
The man and his partner had recently arrived back in the country from northern Italy.
New Zealand so far has four confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2, a much smaller number than Australia, where 60 cases have been recorded and two elderly people have died of complications from the virus.
New Zealand has extended its travel restrictions for people arriving from China and Iran, in an effort to contain the outbreak of the virus.
The virus emerged in China late last year and has now spread to more than 80 countries, leading to travel and other restrictions. It has killed more than 3,300 people and infected over 96,500 people."
1507,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 07:37PM ET</span>","For Australia's Muslims, Indonesian seafaring history gives a sense of belonging","GOVE PENINSULA, Australia (Reuters) - Centuries before Captain James Cook claimed Australia for Britain in 1770, Muslim Makassan sailors from Indonesia regularly traveled thousands of kilometers across open sea to trade with Aboriginal people in Australia's far north.
Now, a voyage in a specially constructed replica boat has rekindled ties between the Makassans from Sulawesi island and the Yolngu clan in northeast Arnhem Land, providing a powerful message about belonging for young Australian Muslims.
The project is the brainchild of the Abu Hanifa Institute, an organization promoting education, identity and inclusiveness for Muslims in Sydney.
""We ran a workshop with young people and we asked them what it meant to be an Australian and many people really could not identify with that concept,"" Abu Hanifa's Sheikh Wesam Charkawi told Reuters.
""They felt that the discourse that they hear on a daily basis - 'Go back to where you came from', 'You don't belong here', 'Love it or leave it' - that it alienated them.""
Muslims make up less than 3% of Australia's population and many report experiencing prejudice or hostility regarding their faith.
The story of the Australia's ""First Nations'"" 60,000 year-plus history on the land and their long and deep relationship with the Makassans resonated with many Muslim youth. The two peoples traded sea cucumbers, exchanged ideas and language, inter-married and lived among each other from the 1500s or possibly earlier, according to historians.
The story helped young Muslims ""understand that your religious ancestors had a connection with the First Nations people in Australia from well before 1770,"" Charkawi said.
The 15 meter (50 foot) vessel was built by Makassan craftsmen on a beach in Sulawesi using traditional methods and local timber.
Launching the boat was just one of many challenges the project had to overcome.
""On the day, we didn't realize how we were going to get it (into the sea) then all of a sudden, hundreds of people turned up and they began pushing this thing, digging the sand with their own hands - not with shovels, but their own hands - to try and push this vessel into the sea,"" Charkawi said. ""Eventually, they made it happen.""
With no engine to rely on, the vessel and its 12 Makassan crew sailed for 25 days to make the near-2,000km (1,200 mile) journey to Darwin.
From there, it sailed to the Gove Peninsula, in northeast Arnhem Land, where it was met by hundreds of Yolngu and other Indigenous people from around the area, performing songs and ceremonies of welcome.
Muslim and Aboriginal leaders both wanted to share the history more widely, including getting the story of the Yolngu and Makassan relationship into school curriculums.
""This is a unique and very important thing,"" said Timmy 'Djawa' Burarrwanga, an Aboriginal leader who shared the Makassan story with visiting young Muslims and helped spark the project.
""They are family, they are people that gave something to us. A special gift,"" he said at the welcome ceremony.
Charkawi, whose institute is producing a documentary about the project to air later this year, said the arrival was an emotional experience.
""The atmosphere was amazing, it was breathtaking,"" he said. ""They'd come out with their children, they'd come out with their elderly, with people who couldn't walk, who were in wheelchairs, so the whole community had rallied behind this event."""

Before the new cases, Gansu had reported a total of 91 infections, with two deaths, it added.
Last month, it became the first province to lower its emergency response measures from level I to level III, reflecting the lack of new infections.
As the number of new cases dwindles in China, attention has turned to potential infections arriving from overseas.
Iran has confirmed a total of 3,513 infections by March 5, with 107 deaths, its health ministry said on Thursday.
Authorities in Beijing, Shanghai and the province of Guangdong have all promised to quarantine travelers from countries hit the hardest by the coronavirus, which Beijing identified as South Korea, Japan, Iran and Italy.
Shanghai has also been tracing people who came into contact with a traveler from Iran who was found to be carrying the virus."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government has spent at least 4.4 billion pounds ($5.6 billion) of taxpayers' money on preparations to leave the European Union, the public spending watchdog said on Friday, in the first detailed estimate of the cost of Brexit.
The National Audit Office (NAO) said in a report that most of the money was spent on staff costs, building new infrastructure and paying for external advice.
Although some ministries had to supplement their spending from existing budgets, the government overall only spent about 70% of the 6.3 billion pounds allocated to cover the cost of preparations, the report said.
In an indication of the upheaval that Brexit caused within government, the report said no fewer than 22,000 government officials were working on Brexit at the peak when Britain was on the verge of leaving the EU without a divorce deal last October.
""This report provides, for the first time, a clear picture of how much government has spent and what that money has been spent on,"" said NAO head Gareth Davies.
Britain left the European Union at the end of January, its biggest geopolitical upheaval in decades in which it turned its back on 47 years of membership of the world's largest trading bloc.
Officials had to increase training for customs officials, hire more staff to negotiate trade deals and improve infrastructure around ports.
More than half of the money was spent by three departments: Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Home Office, along with HM Revenue and Customs.
The NAO said their estimate only focused on the cost of government preparations and excluded future costs such as the 39 billion pound divorce bill agreed with the EU.
It also said the report does not come to a value-for-money conclusion, while there were limitations in the information provided by departments and the estimate is only the minimum level of spending by the government.
Lawmaker Meg Hillier, who chairs parliament's public accounts committee, said the data was limited and that the finance ministry seemed unconcerned by the lack of transparency.
Overall, 1.9 billion pounds was spent on paying government employees, 1.5 billion went on new infrastructure and 288 million pounds was spent on external advice."

GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - Guyana opposition leader Bharrat Jagdeo on Thursday accused the nation's elections commission of fraud in tallying the results of Monday's presidential vote, saying the group inflated the vote count to favor the incumbent, President David Granger.
The South American nation this week held an election to choose who will oversee an oil boom set to transform the former British colony, which faces a test of whether it can sustainably manage a sudden influx of natural resource wealth.
Jagdeo said the Guyana Elections Commission altered the vote count in a populous area known as Region Four.
""This is thievery, this is totally fake,"" Jagdeo told reporters. ""We cannot take this sitting down. This is not a banana republic.""
The commission released a tally sheet for Region Four that showed Granger's APNU-AFC coalition beating Irfaan Ali of the opposition PPP party by a wide margin. 
Jagdeo said the results for that region were inconsistent with the statements of a poll released at individual voting centers there.
The commission has not yet proclaimed a winner. 
Representatives of the electoral commission did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters was unable to obtain comment from Granger's office.
The Commonwealth Observer Group, which is mostly made up of representatives of former British colonies, on Thursday said Guyana must ensure that the tally of votes ""properly follows legal steps.""
Tabulation of final results ""has not yet been completed and verified according to the established procedures,"" the group said in a statement signed by its chairman, former Barbados Prime Minister Owen Arthur.
The discovery of more than 8 billion barrels of oil and gas off Guyana's coast by a consortium of companies including  Exxon Mobil  Corp (NYSE:XOM) is expected to transform the country, a poor nation with a population of less than 800,000 people. The country's politics has remained divided along ethnic lines since Guyana's 1966 independence from Britain.
Granger's APNU-AFC coalition is largely made up of black Guyanese descended from African slaves while the PPP mostly represents descendants of Indian laborers who arrived in the 19th century to work on sugar plantations. 
The APNU-AFC has promised to use oil wealth to finance cash transfers to citizens, in addition to investing in infrastructure and diversification of the economy.

The PPP has criticized Granger for not insisting that Exxon give a greater percentage of oil revenue to the state, but says it plans to maintain the contract intact.

The appearance by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as Queen Elizabeth's grandson and Meghan are officially known, at an awards ceremony for wounded service personnel will also be one of their last before they quit as working members of the royal family.
The couple stop their royal duties at the end of the month as they seek to carve out ""a progressive new role"", mainly based in North America, which they aim to finance themselves.
While Harry remains a prince, they have agreed not to use the HRH titles - His or Her Royal Highness - and will not use ""royal"" in their branding, even though they said there was no jurisdiction by the monarchy or the government to stop them using the word overseas.
The couple have spent most of their time in Canada since January's shock announcement.
Meghan's last official engagement was to visit Canada House in London days before that announcement. The prince returned to royal duties at the end of last month, when the host at the event said people should just ""call him Harry"".
On Thursday, they attended the annual Endeavour Fund Awards at Mansion House which acknowledges the achievements of wounded or sick servicemen and women who have taken part in remarkable sporting and adventure challenges.
There was one loud boo from the crowd outside as the smiling couple arrived clutching an umbrella amid rainfall and a blaze of camera flashes from massed photographers.
Harry, sixth in line to the throne, will carry out a solo engagement on Friday when he opens a new museum dedicated to British motor racing where he will be joined by Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton.
Next week, Harry, 35 and Meghan, 38, will carry out what is expected to be their last official appearance alongside other senior royals including the 93-year-old queen, Harry's father and heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles, and his brother Prince William at the annual Commonwealth Service at London's Westminster Abbey.
British newspapers have reported that the queen has been saddened that she has seen so little of Harry and Meghan's son Archie, her eighth great-grandchild who has remained in Canada.
Harry and the queen had a meeting to discuss his future at her Windsor Castle home last weekend, a royal source confirmed, with the Sun tabloid reporting it had been a ""heart to heart"" talk at which she said he would always be welcome to rejoin the royal fold."

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Turkey and Russia agreed a ceasefire deal on Thursday in Syria's Idlib region, their two leaders said after talks in Moscow to contain a conflict which has displaced nearly a million people in three months.
Russian President Vladimir Putin, standing next to his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan, said he hoped their agreement would lead to a halt of military action in Syria's last major rebel stronghold in the northwest of the country. 
""I express hope that these agreements will serve as a good basis for a cessation of military activity in the Idlib de-escalation zone (and) stop the suffering of the peaceful population and the growing humanitarian crisis,"" Putin said.
Erdogan told reporters the truce would come into effect at midnight on Thursday. ""We will work together to supply aid for the Syrians in need,"" he said, adding that Turkey retained the right ""to respond to all (Syrian) regime attacks in the field.""
Russia and Turkey back opposing sides in Syria's nine-year conflict, with Moscow supporting President Bashar al-Assad and Turkey backing some rebel groups. Several previous deals to end the fighting in Idlib have collapsed. 
The latest offensive in Idlib by Assad's forces, backed by Russian air strikes, sparked what the United Nations says may be the worst humanitarian crisis yet in a war that has driven millions from their homes and killed hundreds of thousands.
The Russian military has, however, repeatedly played down any talk of a refugee crisis and accused Turkey of violating international law by pouring enough troops into Idlib to make up a mechanised division. 
Turkey, which has the second largest army in the transatlantic NATO alliance, has funneled troops and equipment into the region in recent weeks to resist the Syrian government advance and prevent a wave of refugees over its southern border.
Russia also raced to reinforce its troops in Syria by sea and air before the Putin-Erdogan talks.
Assad himself has vowed to recapture ""every inch"" of Syrian territory, but his depleted military depends heavily on Moscow's power and Iranian-backed militias on the ground. Iran was not a party to Thursday's deal. 
Apart from Idlib, a large stretch of northern Syria remains outside Assad's control, held by Turkey and its rebel partners, and by U.S.-backed Kurdish forces.
MORE DEATHS
The Kremlin said the two leaders had spoken for three hours on their own before being joined by their officials.
They agreed to establish a secure corridor near the M4 highway, which runs east to west through Idlib, and hold joint patrols along the road from March 15.
In a joint statement, they said the corridor would stretch 6 km to the north and 6 km to the south of the M4 - effectively advancing Russia's presence further north into Idlib.
The Russian and Turkish defense ministers would agree on the parameters of the corridor within seven days.
The deal did not spell out - as Erdogan has repeatedly demanded - that Syrian forces withdraw to the edge of the Idlib ""de-escalation zone"", around which Turkey has stationed a dozen military observation posts, most of them now surrounded by Russian-backed Syrian government forces. 
The fighting, which raised the prospect of a direct clash between Russia and Turkey, has killed around 60 Turkish troops in the region since last month. Two hours after the joint announcement Turkey's defense ministry said two soldiers were killed after Syrian government forces opened fire in Idlib. 
Putin expressed his regret to Erdogan about the recent killing of 34 Turkish troops in an air strike, saying the Syrian military had not known of their location.
Ahead of the talks, at least 16 civilians were killed when Russian air strikes hit a gathering of displaced people near the town of Maarat Misrin in Idlib, according to civil defense workers helping clear the rubble and search for survivors. 
Russia denies targeting civilians.
Turkey hosts some 3.6 million Syrian refugees and says it cannot handle more. Seeking to extract more funding and support from Europe over Idlib, Ankara said last week it would no longer abide by a 2016 deal in which it stopped migrants crossing into the European Union in return for billions of euros in aid.

The Treasury Department said in a statement it blacklisted Nicaragua's police over its role in significant acts of violence, including ""using live ammunition against peaceful protesters and participating in death squads, as well as carrying out extrajudicial killings, disappearances, and kidnappings.""
Three national police commissioners were also blacklisted: Juan Valle Valle, Luis Alberto Perez Olivas and Juan Pastor Urbina.
""The Ortega regime has utilized the Nicaraguan National Police as a tool in its campaign of violent repression against the Nicaraguan people,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in the statement.
The sanctions freeze any U.S. assets held by Nicaragua's National Police and the three targeted commissioners and prohibit Americans from doing business with them.
The Treasury Department has previously imposed sanctions on two officials of Nicaragua's National Police for human rights abuses.
Demonstrations began in Nicaragua in 2018 over planned cuts to welfare benefits and later spread into broader protests against what critics see as Ortega's increasingly authoritarian-style rule. The protests left more than 300 people dead, according to rights groups.
""The United States urges the Ortega regime to immediately stop repressing the Nicaraguan people, respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and allow the conditions for free and fair elections and the restoration of democracy in Nicaragua,"" U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement on Thursday. 

The Nicaraguan government has called previous U.S. sanctions on officials, including Ortega's wife, Rosario Murillo, who is also the country's vice president, a continuation of ""imperial"" designs on the small Central American country.

Representatives for both sides were expected to finalize the plans in a meeting at the presidential palace in Brasilia on Thursday, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the talks have not been made public.
A U.S. official confirmed to Reuters on Thursday that the two presidents were likely to meet. Brazil's Ministry of Foreign Relations declined to comment.
One of the people familiar with the matter told Reuters that Bolsonaro said he was ""called"" by Trump.
Last week, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said a meeting between the two leaders ""was a given,"" although the Brazilian government has kept the possible encounter confidential.
Asked about a meeting between the leaders at a Thursday briefing, Brazil's presidential spokesman Otavio Rego Barros said, ""There is a possibility.""
Two of the people familiar with the matter said the meeting would be closed to the press, without any public statements.
A preliminary schedule for Bolsonaro's U.S. visit, which does not list a meeting with Trump, shows the Brazilian president in Florida from Saturday to Tuesday.

BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's right-wing government has begun to pull its diplomats out of the embassy and consulate in Caracas as it moves to downgrade relations with Venezuela's leftist government.
Instructions published on Thursday in the official gazette removed five diplomats and 11 members of consular staff in Caracas, including Consul General Elza de Castro and two minister counselors at the embassy.
Brazil's far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, has not broken off relations with Venezuela as other governments in the hemisphere have, including Canada, because Brazilian diplomats and military officers have wanted to keep a door open.
There are roughly 10,000 Brazilians living in Venezuela, and Brazilian authorities say more than half a million Venezuelans have fled the country's economic and political crisis into Brazil, with many of them continuing to other South American nations.
The Brazilian government is also refusing to renew the credentials of the envoys in Brasilia of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose legitimacy is not recognized by Brazil and more than 50 other nations.
Bolsonaro's government sees opposition leader Juan Guaidó as the legitimate head of a transition to democratic rule in Venezuela, and formally recognizes his envoy, Maria Tereza Belandria, as Venezuela's ambassador in Brasilia.
Belandria, however, lives and works out of a Brasilia hotel because the Venezuelan Embassy is still controlled by Maduro representatives, most notably the military attaché Major General Manuel Barroso who de facto runs the embassy, which has not had an ambassador since 2016."

LONDON (Reuters) - Three years ago, in secluded corners of a sprawling mall in Dubai, Sheikha Latifa, the daughter of the emirate's ruler, plotted with close friend Tiina Jauhiainen to escape her father's clutches.
Their eventual plan was like a plot from a movie: Latifa disguised her appearance as the pair fled Dubai by car to the coast, took a dinghy and rode jet skis to a waiting boat which was to take the princess and her companion to freedom.
But it failed. They were captured off the coast of India after an operation by special forces and taken back to Dubai.
""The last time (I saw her), she was kicking and screaming and she was dragged off the boat. Her pleas for asylum were ignored,"" Jauhiainen told Reuters in an interview in London in late January.
In a judgment published on Thursday, a British judge ruled that Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum had abducted Latifa - just as he had her elder sister Shamsa from England almost two decades earlier - and subjected her to inhuman treatment.
Jauhiainen gave a witness statement as part of the case and briefly appeared in court in London to confirm it was true.
""In making an overall assessment of the evidence relating to Latifa, I regard the evidence of Tiina Jauhiainen as being of singular importance,"" the judge, Andrew McFarlane, said in his ruling, which described her as a ""wholly impressive individual.""
The fitness instructor first met Latifa in late 2010 when she started giving her lessons in capoeira, a martial art, about five times a week.
They became close friends but she said Latifa was quiet and private. It was years before Latifa confided in her, revealing she had tried to escape Dubai in 2002 when she was a teenager and that she had subsequently spent three-and-a-half years in prison.
Reuters was not able independently to confirm Jauhiainen's version of events, which she has recounted to media before.
""It was only around 2016 when she started telling me about her sister Shamsa and her escape and her own imprisonment,"" said Jauhiainen, a Finnish national.
""I think she was very scared. She could have been imprisoned again.""
The government's Dubai Media Office did not respond to a Reuters request for comment for this story.
FORMER FRENCH SPY (NYSE:SPY)
In the summer of 2017, Latifa, who told Jauhiainen that she had not been allowed to leave Dubai since 2000 and had no passport, asked Jauhiainen for help in trying to leave her homeland again.
Latifa had read the book ""Escape from Dubai"" by former French naval officer and spy Herve Jaubert some years before and wanted to contact him.
Jauhiainen went to the Philippines to meet Jaubert and the three of them began plotting the escape. For the two women, that meant clandestine discussions in the glitzy Dubai Mall, one of the world's largest shopping centers.
""We would find a corner, we would switch off our mobile phones. So we were taking all the precautions,"" said Jauhiainen, adding that Latifa would regularly change her email address to avoid detection.
""It was a bit scary so we didn't want anyone to overhear the conversations or follow us or anything like that.""
Jaubert told Reuters that he planned the escape with Latifa and subsequently asked Jauhiainen to meet him in the Philippines on six or seven occasions to train her.
After six months, they were ready to put their plan into action. On Feb. 24, 2018, Latifa was dropped off by her driver at a cafe in downtown Dubai where she and Jauhiainen had been meeting regularly for breakfast.
Inside, she went to the bathroom to change her clothes, dumped her mobile phone and the pair set off on a six-hour drive from Dubai through Oman to its coastal capital Muscat.
""I didn't sleep for two nights before the day of the escape,"" Jauhiainen said. ""Latifa was sitting next to me in the front seat - she had never sat in the front seat of a car, she was excited, happy.""
At Muscat, they met a friend of Jauhiainen, got in a dinghy, clinging to the sides in stormy conditions, to reach international waters where they got onto jet skis and boarded the U.S.-flagged boat Nostromo.
COMMANDO OPERATION
They were heading for Goa on India's west coast where Latifa hoped to journey on to the United States to seek asylum.
But on March 4 they were intercepted by commando units from India and the United Arab Emirates, Jauhiainen said.
""We had Indian coastguard boats surrounding us, there were helicopters, aeroplanes, the whole boat was filled with smoke,"" she said. ""They looted the boat, they beat the crew. Latifa was kidnapped kicking and screaming and the rest of us were kidnapped as well and taken to UAE.""
Jaubert said he captained the vessel and witnessed the raid. He said Indian navy commandos attacked and Latifa was taken off the boat by an Emirati officer. He added that he was beaten for 45 minutes, but did not specify by whom.
Reuters could not independently confirm his account.
Raveesh Kumar, a spokesman for India's foreign ministry, did not respond to a request for comment on India's alleged role in the operation.
Jauhiainen did not see Latifa again. In Dubai, she said she was threatened, held in solitary confinement and interrogated. She did not specify where or by whom.
""I was told I had stabbed the ruler of Dubai in the back by helping (his) daughter escape,"" she said.
Two weeks before the attempted escape, Latifa made a 45-minute video recording in Jauhiainen's apartment which she passed to supporters outside Dubai in case she failed to get away.
That video, in which Latifa launched an excoriating attack on her father, was made public after it went to UK-based campaign group Detained in Dubai and was posted on YouTube.
Three weeks after being taken back to Dubai, Jauhiainen was released and left.
Despite having lived in Dubai for 17 years, those who knew her no longer stay in contact, Jauhiainen said.
Jauhiainen said that most visitors to Dubai lived in a bubble of sun, sea and shopping malls, and did not know the truth about the country.
""If the daughters of rulers get locked up for just wanting to be free, what about the rest of the people there?""

RIYADH (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, criticized by some at home for British arms sales to Saudi Arabia, said on Thursday he was hopeful for a de-escalation this year in Yemen's five-year-old civil war, in which London backs the Saudi-led coalition.
The United Nations has been trying to re-launch political negotiations and Saudi Arabia began informal talks with the Iran-backed Houthi movement last September. Riyadh had significantly reduced its air strikes while the Houthis halted missile and drone attacks on the kingdom, but a spike in violence since January shattered the calm.
Asked about the chances of getting back on track, Raab said: ""I certainly hope so. I think that should be the aim and I think with political will galvanized on all sides, 2020 could be a year of change for Yemen.""
He spoke to Reuters in the Saudi capital Riyadh after meeting Yemen's president at the end of a Middle East tour that also included Turkey and Oman.
In meetings with the Saudi king, foreign minister and deputy defense minister, Raab also discussed trade, Saudi Arabia's presidency of the G20 and Britain's hosting of the COP26 climate summit.
He said he had raised human rights issues, including the detention of women's rights activists and the 2018 killing of prominent journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul.
The killing by Saudi agents has strained Saudi Arabia's ties with the West and battered the image abroad of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom some Western governments believe ordered the hit. Prince Mohammed has denied that but said he ultimately bears responsibility for the killing.
Britain has said Saudi Arabia needed to hold to account those responsible for the murder and take action to build confidence that such an event would not recur.
In December, a Saudi court sentenced five people to death and three to jail over the murder, but a U.N. investigator accused Riyadh of making a ""mockery"" of justice by exonerating senior figures who may have ordered the killing.
""We had exactly the reassurances you described – this will never happen and never be repeated again,"" Raab said.
""And the sense that I get is of genuine will to improve the position in Saudi Arabia and of course to free us up to talk about all the positives in the relationship that we have."""

UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Britain, Germany, France, Estonia and Belgium raised North Korea's latest missile launches behind closed-doors in the United Nations Security Council on Thursday, condemning the tests as a provocative action in violation of U.N. resolutions.
North Korea fired two short-range missiles off the east coast into the sea on Monday, resuming testing after a three-month pause, South Korea's military said. The launch was the first since North Korea fired what it called ""super-large multiple rocket launchers"" on Nov. 28.
In a statement after the 15-member Security Council met, the European members and Britain urged North Korea to engage in good faith negotiations with the United States aimed at Pyongyang's denuclearisation and take concrete steps toward abandoning nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs.
""Continued provocations risk undermining the prospects for a successful negotiations. It is vital that the Security Council ensures full implementation of its resolutions and that sanctions remain in place,"" they said in a joint statement.
""We call on the international community to comply with the obligation to strictly enforce these sanctions,"" they said.
Russia and China have raised concerns that sanctions were harming North Korean civilians, and have expressed hope that easing some restrictions could help break a deadlock in nuclear talks between Washington and Pyongyang.
Russia and China proposed a draft U.N. Security Council resolution in December that would lift sanctions on industries that earned North Korea hundreds of millions of dollars. Those sanctions were imposed in 2016 and 2017 to cut off funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and missile programs.
Pyongyang has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its missile and nuclear programs, which the Security Council has unanimously strengthened over the years. Though some diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, have warned that unity would be broken if Russia and China put their new plan to a vote.
""That text of the draft resolution remains on the table and we are open for views on that,"" China's U.N. Ambassador Zhang Jun told reporters on Monday. ""We believe that it's a very important step in creating a more favorable environment for the further improvement of the situation in the Korean Peninsula."""

LONDON (Reuters) - Victorian Britain took Florence Nightingale into its heart as the ""Lady with the Lamp"" who tended wounded soldiers, but a new exhibition shows her as a tough pioneer whose principles on hygiene underpin nursing today as the world battles coronavirus.
The show at the Florence Nightingale Museum within London's St Thomas' Hospital marks the bicentenary of Nightingale's birth into a wealthy family, and tells the story of how she fought her family's opposition and social constraints to become the world's most famous nurse.
""Florence Nightingale's legacy is really, really important. Obviously, she was a forceful leader. And we need clear, visible, strong leadership today and certainly in modern nursing,"" said Fiona Hibberts, from the Nightingale Academy, a nursing institution at the hospital.
The exhibition ""Nightingale in 200 Objects, People & Places"" will run for a year.
St Thomas' is one of a handful of hospitals in Britain with a specialist ward for the treatment of coronavirus patients.
""The emphasis on sanitation, good hygiene, fresh air exercise, good food... no matter how much we advance, those fundamental foundational principles of Florence are still very much the basis of modern nursing,"" said Hibberts.
""It's the same old message. Wash your hands.""
Nightingale became famous after she and a small team of nurses traveled to modern-day Istanbul to treat British soldiers wounded in the Crimean War, in which British, French and Ottoman forces fought the Russian Empire.
In a filthy hospital set up in a barracks on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus, she saws thousands of soldiers die from infectious diseases rather than their wounds, prompting her to try and improve conditions.
The lamp she used to tour the wards at night is on show at the exhibition, as is the nurses' uniform she created.
""If Florence Nightingale herself was here, she would be supporting all that's being said at the moment. She was absolutely into infection control, hand washing, being very observant,"" said Yvonne Moores, Chair of the Florence Nightingale Foundation and Britain's former national Chief Nursing Officer.
""She would also, bearing in mind her very, very long career, be encouraging people that have retired ... to think about the role that they might be able to play in coming back.""
Many retired doctors and nurses have reacted with alarm to a suggestion by the British government that it would call on them to help battle coronavirus if necessary.
Nightingale died at the age of 90 in 1910, continuing to work and to write late into her life.
The exhibition also recreates her London bedroom, allows visitors to smell her perfume and hear a recording of her voice."

A document posted on the Moscow mayor's website said that Russians who return from China, South Korea, Iran, France, Germany, Italy and Spain and other states who display possible ""unfavorable"" signs of coronavirus should self-isolate themselves at home for 14 days.
This will mean not going to work or to studies, it said.
Moscow, a city of more than 12 million people, will also step up checks of those arriving from countries with coronavirus contagion, and its emergency center dealing with the issue will now work around the clock.
Russia has not reported any confirmed cases of people contracting coronavirus on its territory, although six people who picked up the virus elsewhere have received or are receiving treatment.
Authorities are now trying to prevent any spread of the virus by cancelling some international flights and recommending people against traveling abroad.
On Thursday, Russia canceled its flagship annual St Petersburg International Economic Forum, usually chaired by President Vladimir Putin and scheduled for early June, as a precaution against the coronavirus.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said on his blog that Moscow could hardly avoid the coronavirus completely and could not readily limit business activity including services sector companies and retailers.
""Millions of people work there. It would have a harmful impact on the economy and on citizens' prosperity (to shut them down),"" Sobyanin said.
Global alarm over the coronavirus's rapid spread has sent the rouble tumbling because of a steep drop in oil prices. But senior officials have played down the possibility of a major impact on the Russian economy.

SANTIAGO (Reuters) - As the long southern hemisphere summer holiday draws to an end this month, students in Chile are returning to college - but not always to classes. Many are getting ready to head out into the streets and breathe new life into the protests that rocked the country last year. 
Organizers of marches to mark International Women's Day on Sunday are hoping to attract large crowds. Last year, an estimated 200,000 to 300,000 attended the one in Santiago.
One of the loudest and most influential voices pressing for change is Emilia Schneider, a transgender, feminist and militant leftist who is the leader of the Student Federation of the University of Chile (Fech), the country's oldest student union.
The Fech is known for its role in demonstrations for free education between 2011 and 2013 that brought Chile and its student leaders global attention. But it was caught on the backfoot in October last year when civil disobedience over public transport fare hikes spiraled into weeks of widespread violence and demonstrations over inequality and elitism.
The protests were Chile's most profound unrest since the end of Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship in 1990. They cost the economy millions of dollars, at least 31 people died, more than 3,000 were injured, and 30,000 were arrested.
Now, the Fech is joining in, and has endorsed the protesters' demands for deep societal changes.
""We are the sons and daughters of neo-liberal Chile and the shortcomings that came with it,"" Schneider, a 23-year-old law student, told Reuters this week in an interview at the headquarters of the Fech. 
""We had seen years of protests in this country but the demands had not been heeded,"" she said, citing the highly privatized provision of services such as health, education and pensions that had sparked a ""sense of discomfort that built up over years.""
Schneider said she has benefited from a Gender Identity Law that allows people to legally change their name and sex and took effect in December last year. The passing of the law caused shockwaves in the historically conservative and predominantly Catholic country, where divorce was legalized just 16 years ago and abortion is allowed only in extreme situations.
She argues that her gender change was only made possible by her privileged position as a student leader and the support of her liberal family. Many like her still face job insecurity, discrimination, and patchy access to health services, she said.
Schneider has a potent link to the country's dark past: her great-grandfather was General Rene Schneider, a well-known figure in Chile who opposed plans for a military coup in 1970 and was killed by a far-right group.
Older Chileans lived through the chilling effect of the 1973-1990 dictatorship but younger people protesting had less ""fear of participating in politics,"" she said. 
President Sebastian Pinera has sought to address protesters' grievances by sacking his most unpopular ministers and introducing new laws to improve salaries, pensions and healthcare. He also backed a growing clamor for a new constitution to replace the incumbent drafted during the Pinochet regime.
But many remain dubious about his ability to push the laws through a divided Congress and, if he does, how much change they will really bring. 
Schneider has turned her organization's focus to lobbying for influence over the new constitution and specifically the participation of more women in the drafting of the new text if it is approved in a referendum on April 26. 
""We want a feminist constitution,"" she said, ""one that guarantees sexual and reproductive rights, gender equality and greater participation by women and those who do not conform to traditional genders.""

Chile may be changing, she said - but not fast enough. ""We have to keep seeking new policies to generate fresh changes,"" she said. ""Protests alone will not get us there.""

Some 60 others were injured in the fire, of whom 14 were in critical condition, according to the Palestinian health ministry. 
Witnesses said they heard an explosion come from a bakery in the Nusseirat camp in central Gaza before a blaze engulfed the bakery and quickly spread to nearby stores, factories and cars parked along the street. 
Gaza's interior ministry, which is run by the enclave's Islamist rulers Hamas, said the fire resulted from a gas leak inside one of the bakeries that caused several cooking gas bottles to explode.
Crowds of civilians rushed to help firefighters put out the flames. Smoke rising over the refugee camp could be seen from miles away. 
""People started to run towards the sound but then a huge fire broke out...it was horrifying,"" said Ishaq Kuhail, 24, who owns a nearby cellphone shop. ""I have never seen anything like it.""
The fire was eventually put out after over three hours of efforts by firefighters and civilians, said Mohammad Mahmoud, 38. 
Gaza authorities said they would offer cash assistance to the injured and families of the dead.

Gaza, a Palestinian enclave that covers 140 square miles (365 square km) along the Mediterranean Sea, is home to some two million people. Israel maintains a blockade of the Strip, citing security concerns from Hamas, with which it has fought several wars.

KABUL (Reuters) - Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's main political rival supports a Taliban demand for the release of thousands of their prisoners before they will take part in peace talks with the government, his spokesman said on Thursday.
A dispute over the prisoner release threatens a U.S-led effort to bring peace to Afghanistan, days after the militants and the United States signed an agreement on the withdrawal of U.S. forces.
The adoption by Abdullah Abdullah, Ghani's main rival in the past two, disputed presidential elections, of a position on the prisoner dispute at odds with that of Ghani's will increase suspicion between them when they should be focusing on a united front for the proposed talks with the Taliban.
The pact that the United States and the Taliban signed in Doha on Saturday calls for a phased withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces in return for a Taliban commitment to prevent militants from using Afghan soil to threaten the security of the United States and others.
The accord – to which Ghani's government was not a party - also provides for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners in exchange for up to 1,000 Afghan government captives, by March 10.
But Ghani has rejected that, saying the release of prisoners should be negotiated.
The Taliban are demanding their prisoners be freed before any peace talks begin and Abdullah agreed with that, his spokesman said.
""We believe that all the issues on the draft of the agreement are confirmed and agreed, by both sides, after long and careful discussions, so the things on the peace agreement should be implemented without any delay,"" said the spokesman, Fraidoon Khwazoon.
""Trust-building is very important to take the peace talks forward and releasing the 5,000 Taliban and 1,000 ANDSF members is a must,"" he added, referring to Afghan government forces.
A spokesman for Ghani did not immediately respond to a request for comment but a senior government official reiterated that it was not practical, and nor a prerequisite for the so-called intra-Afghan talks, that the prisoners be released.
""Over the years, we've released hundreds of insurgents as a gesture of good faith but it didn't help with peace,"" said the official, who declined to be identified.
""The government has to be sure the release guarantees peace negotiations with the Taliban,"" the official said.
Ghani and Abdullah are old rivals who both held roles in the previous government under a U.S.-brokered power-sharing agreement. A former foreign minister, Abdullah held the specially created post of chief executive in the outgoing government.
Their dispute over the outcome of a Sept. 28 presidential election raises the prospect of chaos as the United States prepares to withdraw its forces after more than 18 years of war.
The Election Commission last month announced that Ghani won September's election but Abdullah has also proclaimed himself winner and is planning a parallel inauguration on March 9.
U.S. special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, who has led the negotiations with the Taliban, had asked both sides to delay their inaugurations, Khwazoon said, but the senior government official said there was no plans to delay Ghani's.
Khwazoon also said Abdullah's team was speaking to other political groups about a delegation for the talks with the Taliban."

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is moving into the second of four phases in its battle plan to tackle the spread of coronavirus, England's Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said on Thursday, after confirmed cases jumped across the country.
Britain has so far registered 90 cases of coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, which started in China, but has held off from introducing measures to restrict movement or to cancel large gatherings for fear of hurting the economy.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he is optimistic that Britain is well prepared to cope with the spread of the virus, but early on Thursday regional airline Flybe became one of the first big corporate casualties of the outbreak.
Health minister Matt Hancock said the coming weeks would be tough. But with calm heads and clear determination, together we can see it through"".
The government set out its action plan earlier this week based on four stages - containing the virus, delaying its transmission, researching its origins and mitigating its impact.
Whitty, questioned by lawmakers, said Britain had mainly moved into the second stage and was now considering measures to try to delay the peak of an epidemic which officials are anticipating in the coming weeks.
""The original plan ... was very much predicated on the idea of 'if it could be controlled in China and contained everywhere else, this virus might go away'. I think the chances of that happening are now very slim. Slim to zero,"" Whitty said.
""As time goes by, we then may start to move into the more socially determined actions ... We've moved from a situation where we were mainly in contain ... to now we're basically mainly delay.""
Johnson told  ITV  (LON:ITV) television that Britain's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies was meeting to consider options to try to delay the spread of the outbreak ranging from ""quite draconian stuff to more targeted interventions"".
Asked whether Britain was close to taking measures such as stopping large public gatherings, Johnson said: ""We’ll see what the scientists advise.""
A spokesman for Johnson said the government would announce publicly when Britain had moved to the second phase of its plan.
The government has said it could encourage home-working, cancel large-scale gatherings and possibly close schools to slow the spread of the disease and delay the peak of the outbreak until summer, when the health service is under less pressure.
Whitty also said that with older people more vulnerable to the virus, there may be measures announced to encourage them to stay away from public places, such as the upper house of parliament, the House of Lords. 

Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the lower house of parliament, told lawmakers there were no plans to close the House of Commons.

THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court will investigate whether war crimes were committed in Afghanistan by the Taliban, Afghan military and U.S. forces after an appeals panel said on Thursday the ""truth-seeking"" inquiry should go ahead.
The ICC decision, which came days after the United States agreed to pull its troops from the long-running conflict, opens the way for prosecutors to launch a full investigation, despite U.S. government opposition.
""The appeals chamber considers it appropriate to...authorize the investigation,"" presiding Judge Piotr Hofmanski said at the court in The Hague. He said prosecutors' preliminary examination in 2017 had found reasonable grounds to believe war crimes were committed in Afghanistan and that the ICC has jurisdiction.
U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo quickly condemned the decision as ""a truly breathtaking action by an unaccountable political institution, masquerading as a legal body.
""It is all the more reckless for this ruling to come just days after the United States signed a historic peace deal on Afghanistan – the best chance for peace in a generation.""
""The United States...will take all necessary measures to protect our citizens from this renegade, so-called court.""
Afghanistan is a member of the ICC though Kabul has argued that any war crimes should be prosecuted locally. 
The U.S. government has never been a member of the court, which was established in 2002. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration imposed travel restrictions and other sanctions against ICC employees a year ago.
Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda wants to investigate possible crimes committed between 2003 and 2014, including alleged mass killings of civilians by the Taliban, as well as the alleged torture of prisoners by Afghan authorities and to a lesser extent by U.S. forces and the CIA.
UNCERTAIN CHANCES
A pretrial panel last year had rejected her request to open an investigation. It argued that the odds of success were low, given the passage of time and the lack of cooperation from Kabul and Washington, and said that an investigation would not ""serve the interests of justice.""
ICC prosecutors' initial examination concluded there was a ""reasonable basis to believe"" U.S. forces had committed ""crimes of torture, outrages upon personal dignity and rape and other forms of sexual violence."" The examination cited cases in Afghanistan as well as at secret Central Intelligence Agency facilities in Poland, Romania and Lithuania.
Human rights groups welcomed Thursday's ruling.
""Too many ICC states have cooperated with the U.S. to set up the global torture program, we now call on these same states to cooperate with the ICC prosecutor's investigation,"" said Katherine Gallagher of the Center for Constitutional Rights. 
U.S. forces and other foreign troops entered Afghanistan in 2001 after the Sept. 11 al Qaeda attacks on the United States and overthrew the Taliban government, which had been protecting al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. 
In what has become the United States' longest war, about 13,000 U.S. troops remain in Afghanistan.
The United States and the Taliban signed an agreement on Saturday to withdraw thousands of U.S. troops still in the country, but Washington carried out an air strike on Taliban fighters on Wednesday.

The ICC was set up to prosecute war crimes, genocide and crimes against humanity. It has jurisdiction only if a member state is unable or unwilling to prosecute atrocities itself.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday said the recent upsurge in violence in Afghanistan was unacceptable and it must immediately cease for the peace process to move forward, urging both the Taliban and the Afghan government to stop posturing.
Speaking at a news conference at the State Department, Pompeo said President Donald Trump specifically discussed the rise in violence in his phone call on Tuesday with chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Baradar Akhund, the first known conversation between a U.S. leader and a top Taliban official.
""We know that the road ahead will be difficult. We expected it; we were right,"" Pompeo said. ""The upsurge in violence in parts of Afghanistan over the last couple of days is unacceptable. In no uncertain terms, violence must be reduced immediately for the peace process to move forward.""
The United States signed a deal with Taliban insurgents on Saturday that calls for a phased withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces if the Taliban keeps its commitments and for the start of talks on March 10 between the insurgents and an Afghan delegation on a political settlement to end decades of conflict.
Since the signing, the Taliban decided on Monday to resume normal operations against Afghan forces, though sources have said they will continue to hold back on attacks on foreign units.
Washington in response conducted an air strike on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan on Wednesday. A U.S. forces spokesman said the Taliban fighters were actively attacking an Afghan checkpoint and the strike was a defensive one.
""We still have confidence that the Taliban leadership is still working to deliver on its commitment,"" Pompeo said, adding that U.S. Special Representative Zalmay Khalilzad, who was a key American negotiator, was in Kabul on Thursday to help lay the groundwork for wider talks, including the problematic prisoner exchange issue.
That issue quickly emerged as an obstacle for the process to move forward, with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani refusing to implement a part of the accord – to which his government was not a party - providing for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners.
Ghani said the issue should be negotiated, but the Taliban demanded about 5,000 prisoners go free before peace talks begin.
""All the parties understand that it is time for prisoner exchanges to take place,"" he said. ""A number of the prisoners being held served their full sentences. We need to move that process forward. It will be political both sides, if they have leverage."" 

The weekend agreement envisages a full withdrawal of all U.S. and coalition forces within 14 months, dependent on security guarantees by the Taliban, but faces a number of hurdles as the United States tries to shepherd the Taliban and Afghan government toward talks.

KASTANIES, Greece/EDIRNE, Turkey (Reuters) - Greece has repulsed nearly 35,000 migrants trying to cross onto its territory illegally since Turkey opened its border nearly a week ago, government sources said on Thursday, as it prepares to deport hundreds of others who made it through.
Thousands of migrants have made for Greece since Ankara said on Feb. 28 that it would let migrants cross its borders into Europe, reneging on a commitment to hold them on its territory under a 2016 deal with the European Union.
Ankara has accused Greek forces of shooting dead four migrants, a charge rejected by Athens, which says Turkish forces are helping the migrants to cross the border. Both sides used tear gas at the Kastanies border post on Wednesday.
Turkey's interior minister, Suleyman Soylu, visited Edirne province bordering Greece on Thursday and announced the deployment of 1,000 special police to the area to halt the pushback of migrants toward its territory. 
Soylu, who said on Wednesday that Turkey was preparing a case at the European Court of Human Rights over Greece's treatment of migrants, accused Greek forces of wounding 164 people and pushing back nearly 5,000 into Turkey.
Greece on Thursday banned most vessels from sailing around the Aegean islands of Chios, Lesbos and Samos. They are all close to the Turkish coast and a regular target for dinghies packed with migrants trying to enter the EU.
Choppy seas discouraged dinghies from making the crossing on Thursday, though in the evening a boat carrying 42 mostly Afghan migrants reached Lesbos. The UN refugee agency handed out snacks and blankets to the group, which included about 10 children. 
Lesbos already hosts more than 20,000 asylum seekers, many of them living in filthy conditions in overcrowded camps.
The situation at the Kastanies land border crossing in northern Greece was calm on Thursday.
Migrants, who include Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis and Africans, huddled in tents and makeshift camps on the Turkish side of the border. Others stood in line to receive food packages from aid agencies.
HUMAN RIGHTS CONCERNS
Greek border guards rebuffed nearly 7,000 attempts in the last 24 hours alone, taking the total since Feb. 29 to 34,778 and the number of arrests of those who got through to 244, the Greek government sources said.
Migrants who arrived in Greece illegally after March 1 will be transferred to the northern city of Serres and deported back to their own countries, Greek Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said late on Wednesday.
""Our aim is to return them to their countries,"" he told the Athens News Agency. 
Mitarachi said migrants who entered Greece prior to Jan. 1, 2019 and are living on its Aegean islands would be transferred to the mainland in the coming days.
Athens announced on March 1 that it would not accept any new asylum applications for a month following the build-up of migrants at the border. This has triggered criticism from human rights agencies.
""It's very sad that we have seen again human beings treated as political weapons... This is unacceptable,"" said Francesco Rocca, head of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), on a visit to the border.
The U.N. migration agency, the IOM, also urged all countries to respect the migrants' human rights.
""... international legal obligations must be upheld, in particular with respect to those who may be in need of international protection,"" it said in a statement. 
Greece and the EU accuse Turkey of deliberately goading the migrants to cross the border as a way of pressuring Brussels into offering more money or supporting Ankara's geopolitical aims in the Syrian conflict.
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees and faces another influx amid increased fighting in northwest Syria, says it cannot take in any more people.

President Tayyip Erdogan discussed the migrant issue with senior EU officials in Ankara on Wednesday but his spokesman said the Europeans had made ""no concrete proposition"" on how to resolve the crisis.

""Where the Chinese Communist Party has imposed increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment and intimidation on our independent and world-class journalists, we will respond to achieve reciprocity,"" Pompeo said.
Pompeo was referring to an announcement on Monday that the United States was slashing the number of Chinese nationals permitted to work at the U.S. offices of major Chinese state-owned media outlets in retaliation for Beijing's ""long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.""
Citing a ""deepening crackdown"" on all forms of independent reporting inside China, Trump administration officials said Beijing's attacks on free speech were worse than they were a decade ago, comparing them to those of the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War.
Describing the U.S. move as political oppression against the Chinese media, Beijing on Tuesday signaled it would respond to the measures that it charged seriously harmed bilateral relations.
In February, China ordered the expulsion of three Wall Street Journal journalists after the newspaper declined to apologize for a coronavirus-related op-ed column with a headline calling China the ""real sick man of Asia.""

Tensions between the two superpowers have escalated since U.S. President Donald Trump took office three years ago over issues ranging from trade tariffs to alleged Chinese spying in the United States and U.S. support for Taiwan.

1541,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 10:41AM ET</span>",Coronavirus and protests wreck Iraq's pilgrimage industry,"By Ulf Laessing
NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraqi hotel manager Badr al-Jilawi needs to think for a moment to remember when the last guest checked in to visit the holy Shi'ite Muslim city of Najaf, once a prime destination for millions of pilgrims.
With the coronavirus spreading, authorities have banned foreign pilgrims, paralyzing an industry already crippled by anti-government protests and an economic crisis in Shi'ite Iran, usually the source of five million pilgrims annually.
Hotels stand empty in Najaf, home to the Iman Ali shrine, and neighboring Kerbela, site of the Imam Hussein shrine - two of the holiest of the Shi'ite world. Souvenir shops and restaurants are also counting their losses.
""Business has stopped. We haven't had one single visitor since around six months, maybe some five Iraqis came but no foreigner,"" he said. ""Unemployment has jumped (in Najaf).""
He has laid off all but three of his 40 staff to hold the fort with him in the sparsely lit reception.
In total about 4,000 people working in the hospitality sector have lost their jobs in Najaf as the occupancy rate at the 350 hotels and their 40,000 beds is practically ""zero"", said Saib Radhi Abu Ghanem, head of the local hotel and restaurant association.
His last guest came in October when anti-government protests broke out and roads were blocked. News that 500 protesters had been killed scared off many pilgrims from Iran, the Gulf, Pakistan, Lebanon and other countries home to Shi'ites.
More unemployment could fuel the protests, which are driven by complaints by many Iraqis about corruption, mismanagement and the lack of basic services despite Iraq's oil wealth.
Iraqi pilgrims still come but often only for day trips, benefiting the economy little. Many shops in the narrow streets clustered around the shrine have closed and those still open have little to do.
""Najaf has always been a harbor for pilgrims but now I have very little work,"" said Emar Saadoun, a tailor selling religious garments.
He has been running his one-room shop for 40 years but business has been rarely as bad as now, not even under Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein, toppled by the 2003 U.S.-led invasion, who used to suppress Shi'ites.
CRISIS
Tourism is a key industry not just in Najaf but also in Kerbela, Baghdad and Samarra, home to other Shi'ite places of worshipping.
More than ten millions arrived annually alone in Najaf, half of them Iranians, and hotels were usually booked at this time of the year when some Gulf countries have schools breaks, said Abu Ghanem.
Pilgrimage tourism has been in trouble for years due to an economic crisis in Iran, where the currency crashed in 2018 due to U.S. sanctions.
The crisis is worsened by a political void in Iraq. Caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi, who quit in November over the unrest, walked away on Monday, a day after his designated successor, Mohammed Allawi, also left amid political infighting.
""This is a second coronavirus, that there is no state, no prime minister,"" said Jilawi. ""I have monthly costs of $10,000 for electricity, taxes, water. We should get waivers.""
One hotel still has business, the five-star Qasr Aldur where some 120 of its 420 rooms are occupied by Kuwaiti pilgrims, who stay here until their embassy has figured out how to bring them back. A doctor keeps checking on them.
""There are no flights anymore so we don't now when we can go home,"" said Mohamed Jasser, a Kuwaiti pilgrim.
Once they are gone the hotel owner, Nuri Nur, also thinks of closing up and send his 60 mask-wearing staff home.
""I might close in a week or so,"" said Nur.
Authorities check on health of non-resident travelers at road blocks to Najaf and Kerbala, and the latter has canceled Friday prayers for the first time since 2003.
Many pilgrims were still undeterred, with few wearing masks and many kissing the Imam Ali shrine, a Shi'ite tradition.

""I have been here more than a thousands times,"" said 67-year old pilgrim Said al-Mussawi, head of a group from the southern city of Basra. ""God is protecting us so why should I be afraid?""

At least 44 people were killed and hundreds injured in the worst communal riots in the Indian capital in decades, triggered by clashes between supporters of a new citizenship law and those against it.
""The hearts of Muslims all over the world are grieving over the massacre of Muslims in India,"" Khamenei said in a tweet in English, just days after New Delhi rebuked Iran's foreign minister for commenting on the same issue.
""Iran condemns the wave of organized violence against Indian Muslims,"" Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Monday, in response to which New Delhi summoned the Islamic Republic's ambassador and lodged a protest.

The citizenship law provides non-Muslims from Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Pakistan a fast track to Indian citizenship.

Critics argue the law discriminates against Muslims and violates the spirit of India's secular constitution.

LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The U.S. death toll from coronavirus infections rose to 11 on Wednesday as new cases emerged around New York City and Los Angeles, while Seattle-area health officials discouraged social gatherings amid the nation's largest outbreak.
The first California death from the virus was an elderly person in Placer County, near Sacramento, health officials said. The person had underlying health problems and likely had been exposed on a cruise ship voyage between San Francisco and Mexico last month.
It was the first coronavirus fatality in the United States outside of Washington state, where 10 people have died in a cluster of at least 39 infections that have emerged through community transmission of the virus in two Seattle-area counties.
Although the Placer County patient who died was not believed to have contracted the virus locally, that case and a previous one from the San Francisco Bay Area linked to the same ocean liner have led health authorities to seek other cruise passengers who may have had close contact with those two individuals.
Hours after the person's death was announced, California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a statewide emergency in response to the coronavirus, which he said has resulted in 53 cases across the nation's most populous state.
""The State of California is deploying every level of government to help identify cases and slow the spread of this coronavirus,"" Newsom said in a statement.
Newsom said the cruise ship, named the Grand Princess, had later sailed on to Hawaii and was returning to San Francisco, but would not be allowed into port until passengers had been tested for the virus. 
""We are holding that ship off the coast,"" Newsom said.
Six new coronavirus patients were confirmed in Los Angeles County, public health officials said on Wednesday. One was a federal contractor who may have been exposed while conducting medical screenings at Los Angeles International Airport, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported.
Three others likely were infected while traveling recently to northern Italy, one of the areas hardest hit in the global outbreak. Of the six in Los Angeles County, only one has been hospitalized. The other five are recovering in home isolation.
The greater Seattle region represents the biggest concentration of cases detected in the United States from a virus that has killed more than 3,000 people worldwide, mostly in China, where the epidemic originated in December.
With most of the Seattle-area cases not linked to travel or exposure to people who might have been infected abroad, that means the virus has gone from being an imported phenomenon to taking up residence in Washington state, health officials say.
At least 18 cases, including six deaths, were connected to a long-term nursing facility for the elderly, called LifeCare Center of Kirkland, in a Seattle suburb. 
'DISTANCING MEASURES'
Seattle health authorities urged a number of measures for curbing further spread of the disease, including recommendations for anyone aged 60 and older and individuals with underlying chronic health problems or compromised immunity to stay home and away from large gatherings and public places.
They also urged companies to allow their employees to work from home as much as possible, stagger shifts to ease commuter congestion on public transportation and avoid large work-related gatherings.
""The distancing measures that we're recommending are essential because we need to slow the spread of the disease to the point where we are able to continue to handle the load,"" said Patty Hayes, the public health director for Seattle and King County.
A growing number of U.S. companies are adopting such steps. On Wednesday  Microsoft Corp  (NASDAQ:MSFT) asked its employees in the Seattle region near its headquarters and in the San Francisco Bay Area to work from home if possible until March 25. 
In New York state, the number of cases rose to 10 on Wednesday. Three family members and a neighbor of a lawyer who was previously identified as infected tested positive. The neighbor's wife and three of his children have also contracted the virus, Governor Andrew Cuomo said.
About 1,000 people in suburban Westchester County, where the two families live, were under self-quarantine orders because of possible exposure, Cuomo said.
""We are, if anything, being overcautious,"" he said.
AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobby, said Wednesday that people in a group from New York that attended its 18,000-person policy conference in Washington, D.C., this week potentially had been in contact with an individual who contacted the coronavirus before the conference.
Dozens of Congress members attended the conference, as well as Vice President Mike Pence. 
EMERGENCY FUNDS
U.S. lawmakers reached bipartisan agreement on an $8.3 billion emergency bill to help fund efforts to contain the virus. The bill garnered enough votes to pass in the House of Representatives.
More than $3 billion would be devoted to research and development of coronavirus vaccines, test kits and therapeutics. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the fast-spreading illness.
The administration is working to allow laboratories to develop their own coronavirus tests without seeking regulatory approval first, U.S. Health Secretary Alex Azar said.
The latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed 129 confirmed and presumed cases in the United States, up from the previous 108. They were 80 reported by public health authorities in 13 states plus 49 among people repatriated from abroad, according to the CDC website.
Those figures do not necessarily reflect Wednesday's updates from three states.

VELIKA KLADUSA, Bosnia (Reuters) - Hisham and Said seemed close to reaching Italy, their dream destination, when Croatian authorities caught them and deported them this week back across the border to Bosnia, which is outside the European Union.
In shoes caked with mud and seeking medical aid at a migrant camp, the two men are among the first migrants to have reached the northern Balkans since Turkey said last week it would no longer try to keep migrants on its soil in return for EU aid.
Hisham, a 24-year-old student, and Said, a 26-year-old construction worker, told of how they flew from Morocco to Turkey, then managed to evade increased Greek border security and cross into EU territory.
""We crossed the river from Turkey into Greece when there were no Turkish border guards,"" Hisham told Reuters at Bosnia's Miral migrant camp in Velika Kladusa, near the Croatian border.
They followed the 'Balkan route' toward the EU taken by more than a million people during the 2015-16 migrant crisis, which strained Europe's security and welfare systems and boosted support for anti-immigrant and eurosceptic parties. 
""We walked, took trains and buses all the way to Zagreb,"" he said, adding he had wanted first to reach Slovenia, a member of the EU's passport-free Schengen zone, and then Italy.
Hisham said he was beaten by Croatian police and fears he has a broken arm. Croatia has routinely denied accusations by migrants and rights groups of mistreating migrants. 
His tale underlines how difficult it will be to keep determined migrants out of the EU despite tighter border security and a more hostile political climate in Europe.
PRESSURE
Greece said on Thursday it had repulsed nearly 35,000 migrants trying to cross from Turkey in the past week and plans to deport hundreds who made it through.
Croatia said this week it was considering deploying troops along its hilly, heavily forested border with Bosnia, which is one of the EU's longest external frontiers.
The United Nations' migration agency IOM said up to 10,000 migrants daily could start arriving in Bosnia en route for the EU if migrants move en masse from Greece, a number the impoverished country would struggle to handle.
Bosnia currently houses some 5,000 migrants in eight overcrowded camps run by the IOM. Some 2,000 others are believed to be staying in rented rooms or abandoned houses.
Aid workers expressed concern about increased pressure on food and medical supplies in Bosnia's camps, where men, women and children sleep in rickety bunk beds in cramped, often windowless rooms. 
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million refugees from the Syrian civil war and says it cannot take in any more, opened its border with EU members Greece and Bulgaria last week after a renewed upsurge of fighting in Syria's Idlib province.
""There's no option to go back to Syria,"" said Syrian art student Waiel Devi, 38, a resident over the Miral camp for over a year. ""I'm looking for a country that can protect me.""
The Moroccans have also not given up hope of reaching the EU.

""As soon as I recover, I will try again,"" said Hisham.

A new date for the referendum has not yet been decided, the sources said.
Italy has been the country worst hit by coronavirus in Europe, with some 107 deaths and 3,089 cases registered in the past two weeks, forcing the government to introduce increasingly stringent measures to try to slow the contagion.
The law, championed by the ruling 5-Star Movement, was approved by parliament in October by an overwhelming majority.
However, many parliamentarians quickly set to work to try to block the reform, which would reduce the number of deputies to 400 from 630 and cut the senators to 200 from 315.

MILAN (Reuters) - A day after their government ordered a limit on public gatherings and recommended that people avoid shaking hands to limit the spread of the coronavirus, normally sociable Italians have been grappling with new habits.
At Iginio Massari, a well-known cafe in central Milan, customers no longer take their morning cappuccino at the counter but have to wait to be served at a table, while keeping a distance of at least a meter from other customers and staff.
Yet further along the street, there are plenty of people drinking coffee and eating cornettos at the bar.
""I know there's an order and they could fine me 1,500 euros ($1,680) but I'm still serving coffee at the bar,"" said one barista who did not want to give his name. ""We have so few customers anyway that they're usually on their own.
""Normally we get through 7-8 kilos of coffee in a morning and now if we get to three we're happy. If it keeps up like this, we'll have to close.""
It is a small sign of how people are still coming to grips with the crisis in Italy, so far Europe's worst affected country where more than 100 deaths have been attributed to the virus since it first emerged in a town near Milan two weeks ago.
Already the virus has spread from the north, with cases appearing in the capital Rome and as far south as Sicily.
""We are all worried but without alarmism or hysteria. Clearly we're trying to understand the situation and we're trying to read between the lines,"" said Rome resident Fiamma Volpini.
Late on Wednesday, the government announced a series of measures aimed at limiting contact between people in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.
As well as closing schools and universities, suspending large public events and ordering sports events to be held behind closed doors, the decree recommends that people do not shake hands or hug each other and that they maintain a distance of at least one meter.
In churches, worshippers are discouraged from the traditional handshake as a sign of peace at mass and kissing on the cheek, an everyday exchange for people of every generation in Italy, has become a delicate question of contagion etiquette.
""I've just met one of my neighbors and I kissed him but yesterday I went to greet one of my friends with a kiss on the cheek and she stopped me saying, 'are you mad?'"" said one woman in Milan who did not want to give her name.
The change has been especially striking in Milan, Italy's financial capital, which until two weeks ago was basking in its image as the dynamic exception to the country's decades-long economic malaise.
Now trams and underground trains are much emptier than normal, museums are empty and shopkeepers sit waiting for customers.
Although the city's famed cathedral has re-opened to visitors, it is admitting only 10 at a time.
""But that is not really the problem, as there is no one inside anyway,"" a security guard at the doors said."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe is experiencing delays in supplies of medicines and face masks because of coronavirus disruptions, according to EU and industry officials, compounding already acute shortages of drugs on the continent.
Many countries around the world rely on China, the source of the outbreak, for drug ingredients in an age of global supply chains, and are grappling with how to avoid shortages of vital medicines.
The European Union is assessing the delays in drug shipments from Asia, a senior official from the EU Commission said, as France warned it was over-dependent on China with about 40% of the country's drug ingredients imported from there.
The European concerns come as India, which is the world's main supplier of generic medicines and also relies on Chinese ingredients, decided to restrict some drug exports.
""Many active pharmaceutical ingredients are produced in China and the virus outbreak is affecting the manufacturing capacity and stability of the supply of these ingredients,"" the European Medicines Agency, an EU body, told Reuters.
""This could potentially lead to shortages of medicines worldwide.""
The Commission, the EU's executive arm, said it had not yet seen shortages in the bloc caused by the virus. But any hit to supplies due to the outbreak could worsen existing shortfalls.
NEEDED: FACE MASKS
A survey of 24 EU countries at the end of last year found all had experienced shortages of medicines in 2019, while the number of drugs in short supply grew in most states, according to the Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union (PGEU), a trade body.
Respiratory medications were not sufficiently available in nearly all surveyed states, the report found , raising worries about the EU's preparedness for a large outbreak of coronavirus, which can cause pneumonia and other breathing illnesses.
Jan De Belie of the PGEU said that, as well as China, Europe could face supply problems from northern Italy, a region where many drug producers operate and which has suffered the worst outbreak of the new coronavirus outside Asia.
EU officials also warn the bloc is running short of face masks and other personal protective gear because of soaring demand, particularly in Italy.
Last week, the Commission launched a joint procurement effort on behalf of 20 EU states. But officials said that even if they could secure supplies, they were unlikely to be delivered before April.
""There is a shortage in the market for these products,"" a Commission official told EU lawmakers in a hearing on Thursday. ""We will have difficulty in meeting all the anticipated needs of member states."""
1552,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 08:37AM ET</span>",Ireland's Fianna Fail says it's decision time on government talks,"DUBLIN (Reuters) - The leader of Ireland's Fianna Fail told its fellow center-right rival Fine Gael on Thursday to decide whether or not to enter formal government negotiations after nearly a month of sluggish exploratory talks.
Fianna Fail's Micheal Martin is seeking to form a governing coalition but has ruled out one with Sinn Fein, the left-wing, pro-Irish unity party - and former political wing of the Irish Republican Army - which surged at a Feb. 8 election and has an equal number of seats in the fractured parliament.
Acting Prime Minister Leo Varadkar's Fine Gael, which has 35 seats in the 160-seat house to Fianna Fail's 37, favors going into opposition but has said it would be willing to help form a government if all other options are exhausted.
With no other option appearing viable, the two parties met for a one-day ""policy exchange"" on Wednesday but Fine Gael has so far been reluctant to negotiate an actual coalition deal.
The lack of progress has left Ireland represented by a caretaker government in the initial stages of post-Brexit trade talks - crucial for parts of the economy - and as the health ministry reported its sixth case of coronavirus on Wednesday.
""I've made decisions, the party has made decisions, it's now up to others to come to the table in a decisive manner and negotiate a program for government,"" Martin told Irish national broadcaster RTE. ""It's decision time.""
He said there was no pathway to opposition for Fine Gael and that ""realpolitik will have to break through at some stage.""
Martin said his team did not hear anything at the initial policy meeting that would pose an insurmountable challenge to a first-ever coalition between the two historic rivals that emerged from opposing sides of Ireland's 1920s civil war.
Fianna Fail facilitated the last Fine Gael-led minority government from opposition but the Fianna Fail leader said on Thursday that he favored a full coalition this time.
Martin's long-standing opposition to Sinn Fein primarily relates to its past IRA links. The militant group fought British rule in Northern Ireland for decades in a conflict in which some 3,600 people were killed before a 1998 peace deal.
If Fianna Fail and Fine Gael cannot agree to lead the next government and maintain their steadfast opposition to Sinn Fein, a second election would be the only way to break the deadlock.
An opinion poll last week showed Sinn Fein's popularity had surged further and that it had almost as much support as its two main rivals combined.
""The people would not forgive us if there's another election,"" Martin said."

Police and emergency services rushed to the scene of the accident, which happened at 0745 (0845 (GMT) near Ingenheim in the Bas-Rhin area, the local prefecture said.
""The initial assessment is that there is one injured person who is an extremely urgent case and has been evacuated by a Dragon 67 helicopter to Strasbourg-Hautepierre hospital, and 21 people who are being treated as relatively urgent cases,"" its statement said.
State rail company SNCF said on Twitter that the train driver was seriously injured and evacuated by helicopter, and that a major land slip had caused the accident.
The Strasbourg public prosecutor opened an investigation.
There were 348 passengers on board.
""We are all a bit shaken,"" passenger Alexandre Sergeant told BFM television. ""There are people crying, some have back pains.""
Other trains were being re-routed and there were delays but no cancellations. SNCF was using buses to evacuate the passengers onboard the stranded TGV. 
In 2015, a TGV derailed on the Paris-Strasbourg line during a test run prior to the line's entry into service, killing 11 people.

That crash dealt a setback to the rollout of high-speed rail lines that are a symbol of French pride and intended to help support economic growth beyond the capital.

The trip by the youngsters, mostly in their early 20s, to the region at the heart of Europe's worst coronavirus outbreak has stoked fears of a wider spread of the virus in the Netherlands, where the number of confirmed corona cases on Thursday stood at 38. 
""We are working very hard to prepare for all different scenarios"", local health authorities spokeswoman Hanneke Mensink told Reuters.
These scenarios might include plans to monitor or test all students involved after their return. Mensink said it was too early to say how local healthcare teams would deal specifically with the risk of so many returning from the region at once.
The students, all members of the same Vindicat fraternity in the northern Dutch city of Groningen, are expected to return home on Sunday, after having spent a week in Sestriere in the Italian Alps, some 100 kilometers west of Turin.
During their stay, the Dutch government on Tuesday changed its travel advice for the region, saying any trip to northern Italy should be canceled unless it was absolutely necessary to go. 
The local health authorities in Groningen, however, had already warned against the trip before the group left on Saturday, Mensink said.
""We told them our worries, but they decided to go anyway. That is their responsibility.""
Vindicat could not be reached for comment.
Mensink said her organization was in daily contact with the group and that so far none of the travelers had reported any sign of contagion with the coronavirus.

The National Health Institute on Tuesday advised members of the group to closely monitor their health in the coming weeks and to distance themselves from others if they develop any possible symptoms of contagion with the coronavirus.

The International Atomic Energy Agency, which is policing Iran's troubled nuclear deal with major powers, sounded an alarm on Tuesday over a lack of Iranian cooperation in clearing up what the IAEA suspects are undeclared activities and materials dating back to the early 2000s. Iran has denied it access to two sites.
Diplomats who follow the IAEA say the decision to inspect those sites to take environmental samples was based at least in part on a trove of documents Israel says its intelligence agents seized in Iran. Israel calls it an ""archive"" of past activities.
""The Islamic Republic of Iran does not want to set a bad precedence by giving legitimacy to such alleged information,"" Iran's mission to the IAEA in Vienna said in a statement.
The U.N. nuclear watchdog says it does not take information handed to it at face value and vets it thoroughly before deciding whether to act upon it. Iran granted the IAEA access last year to another site Israel has pointed to, a place Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu called a ""secret atomic warehouse"" in Tehran.
IAEA inspectors found uranium traces at that site, which Iran has described as a carpet-cleaning facility. The Islamic Republic has yet to give a satisfactory explanation for how those traces got there.
As for the sites to which Tehran has denied nuclear inspectors access, Iran says the agency's case for going there was too flimsy, even though the IAEA says it has the authority to carry out snap inspections anywhere it needs to. Those so-called ""complementary accesses"" are often at short notice.
""Copies of papers presented to Iran by the agency as the basis for its requests are neither authentic nor related to the open-source, but rather claimed by the Israeli regime to have been acquired through a so-called secret operation,"" the statement said.
""The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that merely forwarding some papers based on the intelligence services' fabricated information is not consistent with the agency's Statute, Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, and the Additional Protocol,"" it said, referring to texts governing the IAEA's mission and activities.
""Therefore, it does not entitle the agency (to) such requests, nor creates any obligation for Iran to consider such requests."""

Italy shut all schools and universities on Thursday until at least March 15 and encouraged online teaching as it tried to slow the rate of contamination in Europe's worst hit country.
""The global scale and speed of the current educational disruption is unparalleled and, if prolonged, could threaten the right to education,"" said Audrey Azoulay, director-general of Paris-based UNESCO.
In a sign of how quickly the virus has spread, China, where the coronavirus outbreak originated, was two weeks ago the only country where school closures were mandated.

1559,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 07:03AM ET</span>",New coronavirus infections may drop to zero by end-March in Wuhan: Chinese government expert,"BEIJING (Reuters) - Wuhan, the epicenter of China's coronavirus epidemic, will likely see new infections drop to zero by the end of this month, an expert with the country's top panel on battling the illness said on Thursday, even as the city reported a quicker rise in new confirmed cases. 
Mainland China had 139 new confirmed cases as of Wednesday, the National Health Commission (NHC) said, bringing the total accumulated number of cases to 80,409. Authorities reported 119 new cases the previous day and 125 the day before that.
The increase reversed three straight days of declines, and was driven by a rise in new infections in Wuhan, the city where the virus is believed to have emerged in a seafood market late last year.
Zhang Boli said almost all regions outside Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital, had managed to halt new infections by end of last month, according to an interview with the official People's Daily. 
He estimated other cities in Hubei will hit such a target by mid-March, based on data on how the outbreak has evolved, but did not give details. 
New infections in Wuhan climbed to 131 from 114 a day earlier. There was no immediate elaboration.
After what some critics said was an initially hesitant response to the new virus, China imposed sweeping restrictions to try to stop it, including transport suspensions, lockdowns of cities and extending a Lunar New Year holiday across the country.
World Health Organization (WHO) officials have said other countries have much to learn from the way China has handled the outbreak. Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu said many countries had asked for help and China was responding.
The number of new confirmed cases in Hubei, excluding Wuhan, has remained in single digits for seven consecutive days, with three new infections recorded on Wednesday.
In the rest of mainland China, outside Hubei, there were only five new confirmed cases, the health commission said.
The death toll from the outbreak in mainland China had reached 3,012 as of the end of Wednesday, up by 31 from the previous day. Hubei accounted for all of the new deaths, including 23 in Wuhan.
Chinese authorities have turned their attention to stopping the virus being brought in from new coronavirus hot spots abroad.
FOCUS ON INFECTIONS FROM ABROAD
The number of new infections overseas now exceeds the tally of new cases in China, with Italy, South Korea and Iran in particular seeing worrying spreads of the virus.
Authorities have asked overseas Chinese hoping to return home to reconsider their travel plans, while cities across the country have set up quarantine rules for those entering from high-risk places.
An infected person is known to have arrived in China from Iran last week.
The cities of Shanghai and Guangdong have ordered people who have been in countries with severe outbreaks within the previous two weeks to stay in quarantine for 14 days.
The city of Chengdu in central Sichuan province said it was also ordering quarantine for such people.
The NHC has said authorities are transitioning from ""overall containment to targeted containment"" measures, with a focus on containment within communities, and medical treatment.
Ma told a briefing China would make donations to South Korea, Iraq, Cambodia and Sri Lanka, on top of what it has already given to Pakistan, Japan and Iran.

He said China was also considering responding to a WHO call for donations, he said.

1560,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 06:50AM ET</span>","Special Report: Before coronavirus, China bungled swine epidemic with secrecy","By Dominique Patton
(Reuters) - When the deadly virus was first discovered in China, authorities told the people in the know to keep quiet or else. Fearing reprisal from Beijing, local officials failed to order tests to confirm outbreaks and didn’t properly warn the public as the pathogen spread death around the country.
All this happened long before China’s coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed more than 3,000 lives worldwide in less than three months. For the past 19 months, secrecy has hobbled the nation’s response to African swine fever, an epidemic that has killed millions of pigs. A Reuters examination has found that swine fever’s swift spread was made possible by China’s systemic under-reporting of outbreaks. And even today, bureaucratic secrecy and perverse policy incentives continue undermining Chinese efforts to defeat one of the worst livestock epidemics in modern history.
Beijing’s secretive early handling of the coronavirus epidemic has troubling similarities to its missteps in containing African swine fever, but with the far higher stakes of a human infection. After the coronavirus was found in December 2019 in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, local and national officials were slow to sound the alarm and take actions disease experts say are needed to contain deadly outbreaks. Beijing continues to gag negative news and online postings about the disease, along with criticism of the government’s response.
With swine fever, Beijing set a tone of furtiveness across government and industry by denying or downplaying the severity of a disease that the meat industry estimates has shrunk China’s 440-million-hog herd by more than half. The epidemic has taken a quarter of the world’s hogs off the market, hurt livelihoods, caused meat prices to spike globally and pushed food inflation to an eight-year high.
(For a graphic on soaring China pork prices, click https://graphics.reuters.com/SWINEFEVER-CHINA-EPIDEMIC/0100B5HN3X1/index.html)
Cover-ups across China - coupled with underfinancing of relief for devastated pig farmers and weak enforcement of restrictions on pork transport and slaughter - have enabled the spread of the livestock virus to the point where it now threatens pig farmers worldwide, according to veterinarians, industry analysts and hog producers. Since the China outbreak, African swine fever has broken out in 10 countries in Asia.
The vacuum of credible information has made it impossible for farmers, industry and government to tell how and why the disease spread so quickly, making preventive measures difficult, said Wayne Johnson, a Beijing-based veterinarian who runs Enable Ag-Tech Consulting.
""To get it under control, you have to know where it is,"" Johnson said.
China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs said in a statement to Reuters that it has repeatedly communicated to all regions the importance of timely and accurate reporting of African swine fever outbreaks and had zero tolerance for hiding and delaying the reporting of cases.
Interviews with farmers, industry analysts and major suppliers to China’s pork sector indicate otherwise. More than a dozen Chinese farmers told Reuters they reported disease outbreaks to local authorities that never made it into Beijing’s official statistics. Those infections are going unreported to central authorities in part because counties lack the cash to follow a separate requirement from Beijing to compensate farmers for pigs killed to control the disease.
Local officials have also avoided reporting outbreaks out of fear of the political consequences. And they have routinely refused to test pigs for the virus when mass deaths are reported, according to interviews with farmers and executives at corporate producers.
A farmer surnamed Zhao, who raises a herd in Henan province, said local officials told him as much when they resisted recording the outbreak he reported on his farm, which wiped out his herd.
“‘We haven’t had a single case of African swine fever. If I report it, we have a case,’” Zhao recalled an official telling him. The local officials could not be reached for comment and a fax seeking comment went unanswered.
When the coronavirus hit, Chinese authorities reacted with a push to reassure the public that all was well. The first reported death from the virus, also known as SARS-CoV-2, came on Jan. 9 - a 61-year-old man in Wuhan. In the following days, Chinese authorities said that the virus was under control and not widely transmissible.
The assurances came despite a lack of reliable data and testing capacity in Wuhan. Testing kits for the disease were not distributed to some of Wuhan's hospitals until about Jan. 20, an official at the Hubei Provincial Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (Hubei CDC) told Reuters. Before then, samples had to be sent to a laboratory in Beijing for testing, a process that took three to five days to get results, according to Wuhan health authorities.
During that gap, city hospitals reduced the number of people under medical observation from 739 to 82, according to data from Wuhan health authorities compiled by Reuters, and no new cases were reported inside China.
China’s top leadership has dramatically ramped up the public-health response since its early missteps. Beijing built new hospitals in days to treat the sick and launched an unprecedented blockade of the disease epicenter on Jan. 23, first quarantining Wuhan’s 11 million residents at home, then suspending transport in all major cities of Hubei province, home to about 60 million people.
Still, the initial attempts to tightly control information left many people unaware of the risks and unable to take precautions that might have prevented infection - and the suppressing of news and commentary continues today. Wuhan authorities reprimanded eight people they accused of spreading ""illegal and false"" information about the disease. One of them, 34-year-old doctor Li Wenliang, later died from coronavirus, triggering an angry backlash on social media.
Some critical posts were allowed during a brief and unusual period of online openness in late January. But Beijing’s censors - the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) - have since cracked down on posts about Li and other information that authorities deem negative, according to CAC censorship orders sent to online news outlets and seen by Reuters. One CAC notice ordered online outlets to guard against “harmful information.” Another ordered them not to “push any negative story.”
The CAC did not respond to a request for comment sent by fax.
UNREPORTED OUTBREAKS
Beijing had years to prepare for African swine fever. Veterinarians have frequently warned Chinese authorities of the risks since the disease started spreading through the Caucasus region in 2007.
Pigs infected by the virus initially suffer high fever, loss of appetite and diarrhea. Then their skin turns red as internal hemorrhaging starts and their organs swell, leading to death in as little as a week.
With no vaccine or cure available for the disease, experts recommend that infected pigs and others housed in the same barn are culled, with the carcasses either burned or buried to prevent further infection. Farms, equipment and vehicles that could be contaminated need to be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected.
The first case in China was discovered on Aug. 1, 2018, on a farm near Shenyang, in the northeastern province of Liaoning. Just two weeks later, the virus was found more than 1,000 kilometers to the south in pigs bought by the country's top pork processor, WH Group, from another northeastern province, Heilongjiang. It took Beijing another two weeks to block pig exports from the whole region, and that and other transport restrictions were poorly enforced, said Johnson and other industry experts. WH Group declined to comment.
One factor behind the epidemic: Chinese consumers prefer fresh pork - straight from the slaughterhouse, rather than chilled. This means hundreds of thousands of live pigs are moved long distances every day to supply processors in major cities. That mass movement spread the disease relentlessly.
Over the first four months of the outbreak, Beijing reported swine-fever cases almost daily as the virus spread from the northeast down through central China, west into Sichuan, and to the huge province of Guangdong by year-end. Veterinarians believe the virus spread quickly because it can survive for weeks on dirty farm equipment or livestock trucks.
And yet gaps in counting and tracking the pig disease have been routine across China. Reuters found a striking absence of reported outbreaks in some of the nation’s most productive pork regions.
For instance, almost none of the reported outbreaks have come from the major hog-raising provinces of Hebei, Shandong and Henan. The three contiguous northern provinces were the source of some 20% of the 700 million pigs China slaughtered in 2017. Many came from backyard farms, which make up a large part of China's industry and have proven fertile breeding grounds for the disease. Yet each of the three provinces has reported just a single case of African swine fever, despite widespread anecdotal reports of outbreaks there that industry sources believe killed millions of pigs.
Neither Shandong nor Henan authorities responded to requests for comment. Hebei’s department of agriculture said it had “strictly reported and verified the epidemic” and that the disease situation was currently “stable.”
Six Henan farmers told Reuters they reported outbreaks during late 2018 and the first half of 2019. In some cases, local authorities helped deal with dead pigs, they said, but never tested for the virus.
That’s what happened when Wang Shuxi, a farmer in Henan’s Gushi County, lost more than 400 pigs in March 2019. Wang said he had no doubt that his pigs had African swine fever, even though authorities never tested them - and he couldn’t test them himself, because Beijing did not permit the commercial sale of disease test kits at the time.
His pigs showed telltale symptoms of the disease.
""The whole body went red,” he said. He injected the animals with an anti-fever medication to no avail. “At the start, they didn't eat, and even after injections, it kept returning,” he said. “If you can't cure it, you know it's swine fever.""
Provincial and county governments had strong incentives to avoid verifying and reporting outbreaks because of Beijing’s rules on compensating farmers, said Huang Yanzhong, specialist in health governance with the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
Under an African swine fever contingency plan drawn up in 2015, Beijing ordered the culling of all pigs on farms where the disease is found and on every farm within a three-kilometer radius. The central government raised compensation from 800 yuan ($115) to 1,200 yuan for every pig culled in 2018. Beijing typically promised to provide between 40% and 80% of the money, depending on the province. Localities would fund the rest.
In April 2019, the national agriculture ministry said the central government had allocated 630 million yuan to cull 1.01 million pigs to contain the disease. But that money either wasn’t sufficient or regularly did not get paid out, farmers told Reuters. None of about a dozen farmers who told Reuters they tried to report outbreaks said they had received the promised 1,200 yuan for each pig.
Many got nothing. Wang, the Gushi County farmer, said that almost a year after his pigs died, he has received no recompense. Gushi County officials could not be reached for comment.
Many farmers, eager to salvage value from their herds, have resorted to sending their pigs to slaughter at the first sign of illness - thereby thrusting the virus into the human food supply. The swine fever virus does not threaten people. But its presence in meat - where it can survive for weeks - creates a cycle of infection because many backyard farmers feed pigs with restaurant scraps that include pork.
Garbage feeding caused 23 outbreaks in 2018, Huang Baoxu, deputy director of the China Animal Health and Epidemiology Center, told reporters at a briefing in November that year. His remarks were a rare instance where the central government revealed findings about the spread of the hog virus. The center declined to comment for this story.
Farmers visiting slaughterhouses dealing in sick pigs also likely picked up the virus on their trucks or equipment, spreading it back to their farms, Johnson said.
In the southern province of Guangxi, the disease raged through the spring of 2019 and early summer, several farmers told Reuters last year. Bobai County was hit hard.
A Bobai farmer surnamed Huang said she lost almost 500 pigs during April and May. She said she tried to report the diseased pigs to the local government but was ignored. The official she spoke to by phone never came to her farm. He told Huang that her pigs could not be saved - but that they didn’t have African swine fever. His advice, she said: “hurry and sell the pigs while they could be sold.”
Huang said she sold more than 30 pigs that she believed had the virus. They looked healthy when she sold them, she said. Others sold obviously sick pigs at very low prices. “Traders took all the pigs, including the sick ones - as long as they could walk to the trucks,” she said.
Huang buried her dead pigs daily for weeks on a relative’s land. Others simply dumped their dead pigs on the roadside or in the mountains, she said. The government provided no help.
Eventually, in late May, Bobai County reported one pig dead from the disease, official statistics show.
Authorities in Guangxi did not respond to a request for comment, and officials in Bobai county’s agriculture bureau could not be reached.
Beijing’s agriculture ministry said in a statement that it had issued an August 2019 order requiring punishments in situations where localities failed to report outbreaks. The ministry said it meted out unspecified discipline to more than 600 local personnel for what it called failures to manage the disease that were uncovered in its investigations of problem areas.
The practice of processing infected hogs has persisted despite new rules from Beijing in July that required slaughterhouses to test all batches of pigs for the virus. The agriculture ministry said in January that 5% of the more than 2,000 samples taken from slaughterhouses in November tested positive for the disease.
An Australian study in September found 48% of meat products confiscated from Asian travelers arriving at its ports and airports contained the virus.
""It showed there's an awful lot of unrevealed infection not being reported to the authorities,"" said Trevor Drew, director of the Australian Animal Health Laboratory.
One such information gap is at the top of the industry - China’s large corporate pig producers. They have also been hit hard by the disease, despite taking more extensive measures than backyard farms to disinfect trucks and require workers to change clothes and shower before and after shifts.
None of China’s top publicly traded producers have publicly announced any swine fever outbreak, but executives of major hog producers acknowledged in interviews with Reuters that their herds were hit by the disease.
Thai conglomerate C.P. Pokphand , one of China's leading pig producers, has had swine-fever outbreaks on farms in Liaoning, Shandong, Henan and Jiangsu provinces, Bai Shanlin, chief executive of China operations, told Reuters in a rare admission by a listed firm. Executives at three other listed companies, also among China’s top pig producers, acknowledged outbreaks at several farms but declined to be identified.
None of the outbreaks that these large companies have confirmed to Reuters were reported by Beijing, according to a Reuters review of the agriculture ministry’s data on outbreaks.
By August 2019, a year after the first case was found in China, pork prices had passed a record set back in 2016. And they were still climbing rapidly. With a crucial national celebration approaching in October - the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic - China’s top leaders took note. Pork is a staple of Chinese cuisine, and rising meat production has been among the many signature achievements in the Communist Party’s decades-long drive to bring prosperity to China.
In a video conference that month with officials from all 34 provinces and regions, Vice Premier Hu Chunhua issued a warning: Sufficient pork was vital to people's lives and the country's stability. He called for the urgent recovery of the herd as a key “political task.”
A raft of new production policies and incentives emerged from Beijing. And as the provinces rallied to replenish the nation’s herd, reports of African swine fever grew even more rare. Disease outbreaks reported by the agriculture ministry have tailed off since August. In January, Agriculture Minister Han Changfu said the situation has stabilized.
The government’s statistics are rife with contradictions, however. The ministry has reported 163 outbreaks of African swine fever since August 2018 and said 1.19 million pigs have been culled, a fraction of 1% of China’s total herd. Separate ministry data tracking the herd monthly show that, by September 2019, the herd had shrunk by 41% from the prior year.
(For a graphic on the decline in China's pig herd, click https://graphics.reuters.com/SWINEFEVER-CHINA-EPIDEMIC/0100B5HM3WZ/index.html)
These official estimates of the decline are far too low, three major industry suppliers told Reuters.
“It’s at least 60%,” said Johan de Schepper, managing director of Dutch feed ingredients firm Agrifirm International. His assessment, based on sales to about 100 large pig producers, echoed those of others in the industry.
The virus is still killing pigs nationwide and the herd may still be shrinking, say farmers and industry suppliers. “Half of the herd was gone before this winter, and I think half of the rest will be gone by the end of the season,” said Johnson, the veterinarian, citing conversations with clients from across China.
The problem: Some areas were hit with a second wave of the disease.
Henan province is among them, farmers told Reuters. Last year, about 60% of Henan’s herd was wiped out, mainly in the densely farmed areas in the south and west of the province, analysts at Guotai Junan Securities wrote in an internal memo seen by Reuters. Recently, the memo noted, the virus has moved through east Henan, taking out another 20%.
The vicious disease ruined Zhao, the farmer in central China's Henan province. The virus struck in October, causing high fever, internal bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea in his pigs. Just two survived. The other 196 died in a week.
When Zhao tried to report the outbreak to the county veterinary authority, he said, officials strongly encouraged him to keep quiet. A local official reminded him of the national mandate to cull all pigs within three kilometers of an infected farm. That could spell disaster for his neighbors if Zhao spoke up.
""If it's found to be African swine fever, people nearby will have to stop raising pigs,"" Zhao recalled a local official telling him. Zhao decided against filing a report to protect his neighbors, he told Reuters on a recent visit to his farm.
Further up the political hierarchy, the deputy governor of Henan province was quoted by the provincial agriculture bureau as saying in December that Henan had been free of the disease for 14 months, after a single reported case in September 2018. The provincial government did not respond to requests for comment.
The disinformation game continues. Zhao says that when county officials came by his farm in January, they recorded that he still had 180 pigs. In fact, he said, he had just the two hogs that survived the October outbreak.

SINGAPORE/SEOUL (Reuters) - Chinese authorities have told people to stay away from the border with North Korea, which has banned people from China to keep out the coronavirus, or risk being shot by North Korean guards, residents of the area said.
Residents said the warning came in a printed notice that Chinese authorities in the area issued this week, the latest indication of how seriously North Korea takes the threat of the virus.
Close allies China and North Korea share a 1,400-km (880-mile) frontier that is especially porous in winter, when rivers separating the countries freeze, allowing people to cross.
Residents of the Chinese cities of Jian and Baishan were warned that people who get too close to the border might be shot, according to three people who received the notice, which was reviewed by Reuters.
""We're told that we may get killed if we get too close to the border area,"" said one restaurant owner in Jian, which is separated from North Korea by the Yalu River, declining to be identified given the sensitivity of the matter.
Residents are prohibited from fishing, grazing livestock or throwing rubbish near the river, according to the notice issued this week.
North Korea asked China to tighten border controls to avoid its citizens getting shot and killed as North Korea had raised its coronavirus threat assessment to its highest level, it said.
""The public security organs will monitor the border 24 hours a day and anyone found will face administrative detention"" by Chinese police, authorities said in the notice, which was seen by Reuters.
""Violators will be shot,"" it said, meaning by North Korean guards.
A Jian propaganda official, who declined to be identified, confirmed by telephone that the city's border control office issued a similar warning in a text message.
""During the epidemic prevention period, any activities including fishing on the Yalu River or shouting to North Koreans across the river are strictly prohibited,"" the office said in the message, although it stopped short of warning of shots.
The official said the wording on such messages may have gone too far in some areas. Reuters could not reach city officials in Baishan. It was not clear if other cities issued such warnings.
China's foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
ENTRY BANS
Isolated and impoverished North Korea has imposed strict entry bans during past global epidemics, including a 2014 ebola outbreak.
North Korea has not reported any coronavirus cases, but experts say its measures in recent weeks go beyond those it took previously.
North Korea moved quickly to restrict travel and trade from China, where the coronavirus emerged late last year.
The coronavirus has infected more than 80,000 and killed more than 3,000 in China and is rapidly spreading around the world.
Most flights and trains in and out of North Korea have been restricted, foreign diplomats in Pyongyang were quarantined for a month, and authorities have cracked down on cross-border smuggling.
South Korea, separated from the North by the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), has reported nearly 6,000 cases.
In January, North Korea told travel agencies that it was closing its borders to travelers from China, Reuters reported, cutting off one of its few sources of external revenue.
It is unclear how much trade continues, but sources who work near the border have said much of the official and unofficial trade was affected. Activists who work with North Korean refugees trying to leave through China said the border lockdown has made an already dangerous journey nearly impossible.
""At the border crossings, personnel in charge of inspection and quarantine are discharging their duty in a responsible manner to completely keep the virus from spreading to the country,"" the North's state-run Korean Central News Agency reported last month."

1567,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 05, 2020 05:19AM ET</span>",Tibetan language learning eroded under China's 'bilingual education': rights group,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China is eroding access to Tibetan language learning and resources in the Tibet Autonomous Region while carrying out so-called ""bilingual education"", according to a new report from Human Rights Watch.
China, while ensuring its minority Tibetan community gets education in their native tongue, has sidelined Tibetan-language classes by making Mandarin Chinese the primary language of instruction, said the report released on Thursday.
In 2002, the Tibet Autonomous Region's government issued decrees that bilingual education meant Chinese and Tibetan were to be given ""equal weight,"" but that wording has now disappeared from official messaging.
China has started pushing bilingual education in recent years, while remaining vague in its public-facing comments on what bilingual education actually means, the report said.
By 2017, the entire Tibet Autonomous Region was carrying out ""bilingual education.""
In practice, this policy means Chinese is the main medium of instruction, with only one class dedicated to Tibetan, the rights group said, adding that the next generations' fluency in Tibetan was at risk.
""The promotion of Putonghua (Mandarin Chinese) among Tibetan communities is really problematic and has had a really profound impact on their identity, their language practices, and their ability to practice their culture,"" said Gerald Roche, a senior research fellow at La Trobe University in Australia, unaffiliated with the group.
Switching to Chinese-medium instruction in western Qinghai province, where ethnic Tibetans also live in large numbers, has led to sporadic protests against the government. In 2018, China sentenced a Tibetan-language advocate from Qinghai to five years prison on charges of ""inciting separatism.""
The Tibetan Autonomous Regional government and China's Ministry of Education did not immediately reply to faxed requests for comment.
Still, many Tibetans see Chinese as a valuable skill for the next generation, as it provides economic and education opportunity to a population that lives in remote and underdeveloped areas.
""Many of the Tibetans we talk to tell us they are indeed keen to ensure that their children speak Chinese... but not at the cost of Tibetan-language education,"" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch.
""The idea of truly bilingual education is great and desirable. But that's not what's really on offer."""

MUMBAI (Reuters) - India has ramped up the screening of travelers to keep the coronavirus at bay but a flurry of new cases has experts warning that it may be hard to contain a spread in densely populated South Asia with its generally poor medical infrastructure.
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh are home to some 1.7 billion people, or more than a fifth of the world's population, but their over-stretched health systems could struggle to handle the type of intensive care required for coronavirus patients.
On top of that, a prevalence of existing health problems such as diabetes could spell trouble while the sort of sweeping restrictions China has imposed to stifle the virus would be hugely difficult in South Asia's more unruly cities.
""The way Indian society is structured, the kind of lockdown that many countries including China and Japan have instituted, is pretty much impossible even under good circumstances,"" said Vivekanand Jha, executive director of the George Institute for Public Health, in New Delhi.
India's total confirmed coronavirus rose to 29 on Wednesday, from six early this week.
The coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, has infected more than 95,000 people globally, and killed more than 3,200, most of them in China.
Some health experts fear that even with the recent spike in cases, India's actual tally could be much bigger.
""There is a strong possibility that the number of cases in India is much higher than what has been detected,"" Arunkumar G., director of the Manipal Institute of Virology, said, citing a virus incubation of up to two weeks.
Fears were fanned this week when India's health minister disclosed that 16 foreign tourists who have tested positive had been touring since mid-February.
Last week, U.S. intelligence sources told Reuters that India's available countermeasures and the potential for the virus to spread its dense population was a focus of serious concern.
'ALL INITIATIVES'
India's government says it has screened more than one million travelers, boosted its testing capabilities and set up isolation wards in all major cities with international airports.
But 450 million of India's 1.3 billion people are estimated to be migrants, with vast numbers packing its rail and road systems daily meaning controlling any spread would be a huge challenge.
India's high number of diabetics - 77 million - and high rates of problems like kidney disease could lead to higher morbidity, or protracted treatment, experts said. 
""One particular risk of India is the co-existence of other non-communicable disease epidemics,"" Dr Rajib Dasgupta, who is a professor of community health at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. 
Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says it is confident of its ability to arrest the spread of the virus.
""Coronavirus is a challenge, but the government of India has taken all initiatives to ensure that it is stopped,"" said D.V. Sadananda Gowda, minister of chemicals, who oversees the pharmaceuticals sector.
Neighboring Pakistan has found five coronavirus cases. A top health official was gloomy about the prospects of tackling a major outbreak.
""We don't have human resources, we don't have the required inventory, we don't have a capacity to cope with a big emergency with the given resources,"" Shahid Malik, secretary general of the Pakistan Medical Association, told Reuters. 
Bangladesh has not confirmed any cases of the coronavirus but five Bangladeshi workers have tested positive in Singapore.
Bangladesh's health ministry said more than 300,000 people have been screened at airports and other border entry points.
But one passenger was not impressed by what he considered lax screening upon arrival in the capital, Dhaka.

""Many of us could skip the screening. Just imagine what would happen if someone infected with the virus enters. It'll be a total disaster,"" Farid Yamin, a Bangladeshi working in Singapore, told Reuters.

Russia's Justice Ministry formally labeled the group a foreign agent in October after Navalny called on people to attend rallies that grew into Moscow's biggest sustained protest movement in years before fizzling out.
Civil society groups designated as foreign agents, a term that carries a negative Soviet-era connotation, can be subjected to spot checks and face intense bureaucratic scrutiny.
MBK media, an outlet financed by Kremlin critic and former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, reported that Navalny's group had been fined by the court for not identifying itself as a foreign agent on Instagram.
Kira Yarmysh, Navalny's spokeswoman, confirmed the report.
Navalny has tried unsuccessfully to contest the foreign agent designation in court, something he has cast as part of a coordinated government campaign aimed at stifling his activities.
Navalny was barred from running for president in 2018 because of a past conviction on charges he has called trumped up. Putin won that election by a landslide.
On Tuesday, Navalny accused authorities of emptying and blocking his bank accounts and those of his close family, a move he said was unfair and aimed at strangling him and his supporters financially.
He said authorities were seeking to sideline him at a sensitive political time when Putin is pushing for major constitutional changes and may be thinking of calling snap parliamentary elections this autumn."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea declared a ""special care zone"" on Thursday around a second city hit hard by the coronavirus and the U.S. military confirmed two new cases among relatives of its troops in the country, which is battling the biggest outbreak outside China.
Australia became the latest country to impose travel restrictions on South Koreans, with almost 100 nations now limiting arrivals from the East Asian country, which reported 760 new coronavirus cases on Thursday for a total of 6,088.
The government declared a ""special care zone"" around Gyeongsan, a city of about 275,000 people 250 km (150 miles) southeast of Seoul, promising extra resources such as face masks.
Gyeongsan has seen a spike in cases in recent days, many of them linked to a fringe Christian group at the center of South Korea's outbreak. Similar zones have been declared around neighboring Daegu city and Cheongdo County. 
About 75% of all cases in South Korea are in and around Daegu, its fourth-largest city, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).
""Every day is sad and tough like a war. But our Daegu citizens are showing surprise wisdom and courage,"" Daegu Mayor Kwon Young-jin told reporters on Thursday.
About 2,120 patients were waiting for hospital beds in Daegu, city officials said. Dozens of newly commissioned military nurses were due to begin work in the city on Thursday, the health ministry said.
The KCDC reported five more deaths from the virus, bringing the total to 37. The flu-like virus that emerged from China late last year has infected more than 95,300 people and killed almost 3,300 around the world, mostly in China, according to a Reuters tally. 
South Korea also said it was banning the export of face masks, stepping up their production and would ration them to limit individual purchases to two a week, in a bid to ease shortages and curb hoarding.
People have flocked to supermarkets, pharmacies and online distributors to buy masks and other supplies, with hundreds lining up at some stores every morning.
KCDC Deputy Director Kwon Jun-wook advised all South Koreans to stay home and avoid ""any gatherings, especially those that take place in enclosed places with many people such as religious events"". 
He also advised employers in Asia's fourth-largest economy, home to tech giants like Samsung Electronics (KS:005930) Co Ltd, to allow staff to work from home.
'DEEPLY REGRETTABLE' 
U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) reported two new cases, for a total of six among soldiers, employees or people related to the roughly 28,500 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.
Despite the new cases, USFK had resumed sending troops to bases in Daegu and surrounding areas, according to the military newspaper Stars and Stripes.
Commanders believed the bases were protected from the outside population, and troop rotations were needed to maintain readiness in the face of threats from nuclear-armed North Korea, the newspaper reported.
Australia's ban on the arrival of foreigners from South Korea is a blow to Seoul's efforts to prevent the United States from imposing such restrictions.
""It is a deeply regrettable step, and we will closely consult Australian authorities for a swift revocation of the measure and to minimise inconvenience for our citizens,"" foreign ministry spokesman Kim In-chul told reporters. 
South Korean officials met the U.S. ambassador in Seoul on Wednesday to urge the United States not to limit travel. Similar talks would be held on Friday with diplomats from other nations, the foreign ministry said. 
According to the U.S. State Department, anyone with a fever of 100.4 Fahrenheit (38 Celsius) is already banned from boarding direct flights from South Korea to the United States.
Korean Air Lines said it would screen all departing passengers for high temperatures and reject those deemed a risk.

South Korea sent three ""rapid response"" teams to Vietnam on Thursday to help more than 270 citizens quarantined there over coronavirus concerns, the foreign ministry said.

LIMA (Reuters) - Former U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, a Peruvian diplomat who played a crucial role in ending the Iran-Iraq war of 1980 to 1988, died on Wednesday at his home in Lima aged 100. 
Perez de Cuellar was a two-time head of the United Nations, which he led from 1982 to 1991 as some of the iciest years of the Cold War gave way to the end of the Soviet Union and greater efforts at international cooperation. 
Perez de Cuellar was the fifth head of the world body and its only leader from Latin America to date. 
U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres hailed Perez de Cuellar's crucial role in securing the release of American hostages held in Lebanon as well as peace accords in Cambodia and El Salvador during his time in office.
""He was an accomplished statesman, a committed diplomat and a personal inspiration who left a profound impact on the United Nations and our world,"" Guterres said.
Perez de Cuellar once said his proudest achievements were his role in security independence for Namibia and the peace accord that ended the Iran-Iraq conflict. However, his diplomatic efforts were unable to halt the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1990.
After leaving the world body, Perez de Cuellar made an unsuccessful bid for the Peruvian presidency in 1995, losing to incumbent Alberto Fujimori. 
He served as prime minister in a national unity government for roughly eight months after Fujimori's administration collapsed amid a corruption scandal in late 2000.

Peruvian President Martin Vizcarra expressed in a statement on Wednesday his profound regret for Perez de Cuellar's death, saying the diplomat had ""dedicated his entire life to the task of glorifying our country"".

SHANGHAI (Reuters) - At last year's session of China's national parliament, delegates from Guangdong province warned that laws designed to contain outbreaks of infectious diseases were flawed and could leave regions exposed when crises hit.
The warnings, led by Cai Weiping, a physician and expert in HIV transmission at the Guangzhou 8th People's Hospital, have been borne out by the experience of Hubei province in central China, the epicenter of a coronavirus outbreak that has killed thousands and spread to more than 50 countries.
Cai's proposal to parliament called for amendments to China's infectious disease law that would tighten quarantine rules, guarantee transparency and spell out more clearly what local authorities should do in an outbreak. They would also force regional authorities to hire more staff and set aside emergency funds.
""The ability of local governments to provide financial guarantees to tackle severe epidemics is definitely insufficient,"" Cai told Reuters.
Early last month, Chinese President Xi Jinping acknowledged that the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was a ""test of China's governance system"" and that the country needed to ""address ""the weaknesses and shortcomings exposed by the virus"".
But it has been the governments of Hubei and its capital, Wuhan, that have taken much of the public blame in China for their early handling of the outbreak.
Experts said the crisis points to systemic failures, with local authorities lacking funds as well as the political authority to tackle the outbreak. Hubei was already 2 trillion yuan ($288 billion) in debt before the virus hit and had cut its health care spending by nearly 2% last year.
Cai, a member of the National People's Congress, told Reuters that local governments have starved their disease control centers of cash and manpower.
""Local governments have been a bit relaxed in recent years,"" he said. ""In some provinces, disease control departments have reduced their manpower and financial guarantees, and even merged with other departments.""
The tight control Beijing exerts over local governments worsened the situation, experts say.
""The authoritarian nature of the Chinese government ... means that for officials at all levels, they will always care more about the opinions of their superiors rather than the welfare of ordinary citizens,"" said Victor Shih, a specialist in Chinese politics at the School of Global Policy & Strategy at the University of California, San Diego.
HARD-PRESSED HUBEI
The fiscal health of Hubei, which at about 60 million people has roughly the same population as Britain, is worse than average.
According to the latest data, Hubei's total revenue reached 296.6 billion yuan ($42.55 billion) in the first 10 months of 2019, up 2.9% from a year earlier, with another 246 billion earned via land sales.
But it has had to clean up the Yangtze river and financed the World Military Games in October, which required an estimated 200 billion yuan worth of infrastructure.
Though total spending surged 7% to 609.6 billion yuan, Hubei's outlay on healthcare was cut 1.7% to 53.2 billion yuan.
Hubei's total debt is close to 2 trillion yuan, or 34,000 yuan per resident, well above a national average of 27,000 yuan.
The financial strain manifested itself early in the outbreak, with residents saying Wuhan's hospitals were ill-equipped to deal with large numbers of patients.
""Fiscally, Hubei is among the most highly indebted provinces in China relative to its GDP and relative to its fiscal income,"" said Shih of UC San Diego. ""Local governments don't have a lot of discretionary spending power and when a big pandemic happens, all this costs a lot of money.""
Since 1994, when China overhauled the tax system, the share of tax revenue going to 31 provincial-level authorities has been cut from about three quarters to a half, though their spending commitments have not fallen.
National campaigns against debt have made it harder for local governments to raise money that way.
China's government last year pledged to reexamine the way it allocated funds.
NOT JUST MONEY
Beijing has allocated more than 100 billion yuan in extra funds to tackle the crisis, and promised to cover 60% of medical fees for patients. But money wasn't the only problem, especially at the early stages of the epidemic.
""Overoptimism led to lax control measures,"" Cai said, in rare public criticism from a legislator. ""The early control of the source of infection is the most effective way to curb the epidemic, but it was not done well.""
Cai said the public's right to know what is happening should be enshrined in future legislation, and local authorities should have the power to issue epidemic warnings and take action.
Transparency has been a major issue. Doctors who first identified the new virus were reprimanded and told to stop spreading rumors. One, Li Wenliang, later died of the disease.
Early in the outbreak, China's tightly censored social media was alight with criticism of local authorities - but not Xi or other central officials.
Top Communist Party officials in the province have been sacked, and citizens have been urged to report bureaucrats who shirk their duties.
Zeng Guang, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said local officials were dealing with more than just stopping the virus.
""They need to consider political issues, they need to consider stability issues, they need to consider economic issues,"" he told the Global Times, a tabloid run by the ruling Communist Party's official People's Daily, last month."

PORT-AU-PRINCE (Reuters) - Haitian Prime Minister Joseph Jouthe said on Wednesday during his first public appearance since his appointment by presidential decree that he would focus on fighting insecurity and inequality while boosting the economy.
Jouthe, a trained civil engineer, who was appointed this week by President Jovenel Moise, is considered an experienced policymaker. He was environment minister and interim finance minister, and also worked for the humanitarian agencies.
""We're living today in a very precarious socio-economic situation which could lead at any time to a humanitarian disaster, our country is in agony,"" he said.
""My government reiterates its commitment to continue working to improve public finances in order to increase gross domestic product (GDP), reduce inflation, increase public revenues and, above all, fight corruption.""
Jouthe called on Haitians, the divided political class and international organizations to stand by him at a time of economic crisis.
The U.S. Embassy in Haiti said in a statement it would work with Moise and Jouthe but urged them to improve security and economic growth, and organize ""free, fair and credible legislative elections as soon as technically feasible"".
Economic repercussions of a three-month countrywide lockdown are still unfolding in what was already the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation, where around two-thirds of adults are estimated to be unemployed or underemployed.
Moise has been ruling Haiti by decree since January because the mandates of lower house deputies and most senators formally expired when no elections were held.
Jouthe replaces Jean Michel Lapin, who was acting prime minister since Moise appointed him in March last year until his resignation in July. Despite several attempts, his appointment was never approved."

Taiwan says the World Health Organization's (WHO) inclusion of the island as part of China's virus area has mislead countries into believing the island's virus situation is as serious as China's.
Taiwan, which says it is an independent country and not part of China, has reported 42 cases and one death, compared with more than 80,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths in China.
Sarawak, on the island of Borneo, has separate immigration controls from the rest of Malaysia. This week it had included Taiwan as part of a ban on visitors from China, then removed it after Taiwan complained, according to Taiwan's foreign ministry.
""After talks, #Sarawak in #Malaysia recognized #Taiwan isn't #China & lifted its #Coronavirus travel ban,"" Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu tweeted.
""Guess what? China forced Sarawak into banning Taiwan again! China takes joy in shoving Taiwan around & then expects gratitude for its #Wuhan sacrifice. That's sickening.""
China's Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China has expressed displeasure with countries that ban Chinese travelers.
Sarawak immigration authorities also did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The virus crisis has worsened already-poor ties between China and Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory.
Malaysia and Taiwan have closed economic and cultural links, despite the absence of formal diplomatic ties.
This is not the first time Taiwan has faced travel exclusions because of what Taiwan says is a mistaken link to China.
Both Vietnam and the Philippines both lifted flight bans on Taiwan after Taipei complained. Taiwan has been less successful in the case of Italy, whose ban on Chinese flights includes Taiwan.
Taiwan is separately ruled from China and China has no say in the island's health policy."

China says Taiwan is a Chinese province and that only Beijing has the right to represent Taiwan's 23 million people in international bodies like the World Health Organization (WHO), unless the island accepts it is part of China.
Tsai, re-elected by a landslide in January on promises she would stand up to China, says Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.
James Moriarty, the U.S-based chairman of the American Institute in Taiwan, which handles Washington's relations with Taipei in the absence of official ties, told Tsai in the presidential office that the two have shared values.
""During President Tsai's second term, we will redouble our efforts to expand Taiwan's participation on the global stage, a need exemplified by the on-going spread of coronavirus,"" Moriarty said.
Taiwan has been infuriated by China's efforts to block its access to the WHO during the outbreak, something the United States, Japan and some European countries have urged the WHO to reconsider.
Moriarty praised Taiwan's approach to containing the virus. Taiwan has reported 42 cases and one death, compared with more than 80,000 cases and over 3,000 deaths in China.
""Taiwan's measured, transparent and evidence-based approach to containing this disease is a testament to the strength of its democratic system,"" he said.
""It also underscores for the whole world to see the value that Taiwan can bring to international organizations. Countries around the world stand to benefit from Taiwan's knowledge, experience and generosity,"" Moriarty said.
The institute's director, Brent Christensen, is based in Taipei and acts as the de facto U.S. ambassador to the island.
The United States is Taiwan's most important international backer and arms supplier. China calls Taiwan the most important and sensitive issue in its relationship with the United States.
China has ratcheted up pressure on Taiwan in the last month, with its air force flying close to the island at least three times, forcing Taiwan at least twice to scramble fighters to intercept.
Taiwan has urged China to focus its efforts on fighting the new coronavirus rather than menacing the island."

The 28-year-old Honduran woman and her family were stranded in Chiapas, Mexico's southernmost state, where they were taken in a Mexican government busing program under what they say were false pretenses.
Yesenia, who asked for her full name not to be published over safety fears, applied for U.S. asylum last year but was sent back across the border to wait for her case to advance under the Trump administration's controversial ""Remain in Mexico"" program, formally known as Migrant Protection Protocols. 
Terrified in one of the world's most dangerous cities, Nuevo Laredo, she said that she and her family took the government offer of a bus out of town after seeing other families kidnapped. They hoped to get off a few hours' south, she said. But the driver refused to let them off at a city enroute and the family eventually ended up three days' drive away from the border.
More than 9,000 migrants have been taken to Chiapas from the border cities of Matamoros and Nuevo Laredo under the busing program, Mexican government documents seen by Reuters show. 
Many migrants board the buses desperate to leave Mexico's northern border, where they risk falling prey to gangs that target and kidnap migrants. But once in Chiapas, some have been unable to reach the United States for their hearings, advocates consulted by Reuters said.
The busing program started last summer and was ongoing at the time of publication. It is one of a series of policies, including a major deployment of Mexican National Guard on border duties, adopted by Mexico to reduce the number of migrants - mostly Central Americans - reaching the U.S. border. 
U.S. President Donald Trump says these policies, along with his administration's own clampdown on asylum, are behind a sharp drop in border apprehensions in recent months. Border security is a major plank of his 2020 re-election campaign. 
Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security did not respond to requests for comment.
INM has said that the busing is for migrants' wellbeing and is intended to help them return to their countries voluntarily. Migrants who Reuters spoke to said that many of those bused to Chiapas abandoned their U.S. asylum claims and headed home.
Chiapas human rights group Fray Matias de Cordova has documented at least 50 cases of people who wanted to pursue their asylum claims but were detained by Mexican officials while trying to head north again to attend their hearings.
Some made their court appearances. Others did not, said Enrique Vidal, a coordinator for the group. Like Yesenia, many say they were never informed they would be taken so far away, he added. 
""They run the risk of losing access to the asylum system,"" Vidal said.
A spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees said many of the migrants it interviewed who had taken the buses to Chiapas ""lacked information about their situation.""
The busing program does not interview participants to make sure they understand the decision they are making, according to two migrants who participated and an advocate.
Mexican authorities have detained some of the migrants who were bused to Chiapas because paperwork they were given by immigration officials at the northern border upon their return to Mexico was not recognized by officials in the south, or had expired, Vidal said, an account echoed by migrants. 
Yesenia said she and her husband asked Mexican immigration officials repeatedly where the bus was headed but were only told it would take them away from Nuevo Laredo. 
They did not realize they were bound for Chiapas until they asked the driver to make a stop in the northern city of Monterrey. The driver refused, telling them the trip was ""practically a deportation.""
Last month, they tried to travel north for their hearing in Laredo, Texas, but were forced off the bus after Mexican officials saw their paperwork had expired.
Yesenia's lawyer managed to reschedule her family's hearing to April, buying them more time to renew their paperwork.
Yesenia says that if she had known where the bus was headed, she would have sought shelter in Nuevo Laredo.
""We feel deceived, disappointed,"" she said.

KABUL (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday carried out its first air strike on Taliban fighters in Afghanistan since the two sides signed a troop withdrawal agreement on Saturday.
A U.S. forces spokesman confirmed the incident in southern Helmand province, hours after President Donald Trump spoke by phone with chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Baradar Akhund on Tuesday, the first known conversation between a U.S. leader and a top Taliban official.
The Taliban fighters ""were actively attacking an (Afghan National Security Forces) checkpoint. This was a defensive strike to disrupt the attack,"" Colonel Sonny Leggett, a spokesman for U.S. Forces, Afghanistan, said in a tweet. 
He said Washington was committed to peace but would defend Afghan forces if needed.
""Taliban leadership promised the (international) community they would reduce violence and not increase attacks. We call on the Taliban to stop needless attacks and uphold their commitments,"" he said.
In Washington, U.S. officials appeared to play down the Taliban attacks.
""There is no attacks on 34 provincial capitals, there is no attacks in Kabul, there's no high profile attacks, there's no suicide bombers, there's no vehicle borne suicide, no attack against the U.S. forces, no attack against coalition,"" Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley said during a hearing.
""Yes, there were significant numbers of attacks, small attacks. They were all beaten back,"" Milley said.
The air strike was the first by the United States against the Taliban in 11 days, when a reduction in violence agreement had begun between the sides in the lead up to Saturday's pact.
Since the signing, the Taliban had decided on Monday to resume normal operations against Afghan forces, though sources have said they will continue to hold back on attacks on foreign forces.
The Taliban has declined to confirm or deny responsibility for any of the attacks.
Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen said in a Tweet that ""according to the plan (the Taliban) is implementing all parts of the agreement one after another in order to keep the fighting reduced.""
A Taliban senior commander in Helmand who declined to be named said that a drone had targeted their position. 
""As far as I know we didn't suffer any human losses but we are working on it and sent our team to the area,"" he told Reuters, adding that the group's senior leadership in Afghanistan had called an emergency meeting to discuss what he described as a ""major violation"" of the agreement. 
""THINGS COULD SPIRAL""
Experts said the public agreement was vague on details around ongoing violence in the country, but that the air strike and comments from U.S. officials suggested the United States had a plan to ensure reduced violence against Afghan forces and civilians. 
""It is significant. I don't think it signals the collapse of the whole U.S.-Taliban agreement...(but) you can easily see how things could spiral,"" said Andrew Watkins, a senior analyst covering Afghanistan at International Crisis Group.
A spokesman for Helmand's provincial governor said the Taliban had attacked a security checkpoint in Washer district - a different district to the one in which the U.S. carried out its air strike - on Tuesday evening, killing two police officers.
An interior ministry spokesman, Nasrat Rahimi, said on Wednesday the Taliban had conducted 30 attacks in 15 provinces in the previous 24 hours, killing four civilians and 11 security and defense force members. Seventeen Taliban members had been killed, he said.
The weekend agreement envisages a full withdrawal of all U.S. and coalition forces within 14 months, dependent on security guarantees by the Taliban, but faces a number of hurdles as the United States tries to shepherd the Taliban and Afghan government towards talks.
In Washington, a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives said secret annexes of the accord contained conditions for the U.S. withdrawal and questioned why they were classified.

""The administration is telling a terrorist group the conditions (such as they are) of our withdrawal from Afghanistan, but not telling the American people,"" Tom Malinowski, formerly the State Department's top official for human rights, wrote on Twitter. ""This is wrong. And serves no national security purpose.""

ROME (Reuters) - Italy closed all schools and universities and took other emergency measures on Wednesday to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus in Europe's worst-hit country as the death toll and number of cases jumped.
The total number of dead in Italy rose to 107 after 28 people died of the highly contagious virus over the past 24 hours, the Civil Protection Agency said.
Education Minister Lucia Azzolina said schools and universities all over the country would be closed from Thursday until at least March 15. Only those in the northern regions most heavily affected by the epidemic have been closed so far.
The number of cases since the outbreak surfaced 13 days ago rose to 3,089 from 2,502 on Tuesday. Of those who contracted the disease, about 3.5% had died, the head of the agency, Angelo Borrelli, said.
The government adopted a decree to try to slow infections which have been rising by about 500 per day.
""Our hospitals, despite their efficiency, risk being overwhelmed, we have a problem with intensive-care units,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said.
The decree orders ""the suspension of events of any nature ... that entail the concentration of people and do not allow for a safety distance of at least one metre (yard) to be respected.""
It calls for the closure of cinemas and theatres and tells Italians not to shake hands or hug each other, and to avoid ""direct physical contact with all people.""
It also orders all major sporting events, including top flight Serie A soccer matches, to be played in empty stadiums.
The school closures caused jubilation among some children and mixed reactions from parents.
""I hoped for this decree because I feared an outbreak at school,"" said Massimiliano Del Ninno, father of a Rome primary school student. ""Even if we are dealing with an age group that doesn't seem to be at risk, they could have been carriers."" 
Clarissa Mazzei, a 30-year-old mother of three, called it ""tragic ... for the students, and also for the parents.""
Deputy Economy Minister Laura Castelli said the government was aware of the problems it would cause families and was preparing a directive to allow a parent to stay home from work to look after children. 
VIRUS SPREADS SOUTH
The virus outbreak remains centred on the wealthy and populous region of Lombardy, around Milan, and the neighbouring regions of Veneto and Emilia Romagna, but cases are spreading around the whole of the Italian peninsula and Sicily.
Rome's Spallanzani infectious diseases hospital said it had 20 coronavirus patients, while others were being treated at home in and around Italy's capital and largest city.
Emilia Romagna's regional government said on Wednesday two of its members had tested positive and Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli is in self-imposed isolation after coming into contact with a patient, though he himself had tested negative.
The outbreak has already heavily disrupted life in the north, with cinemas and museums closed in some regions and many events cancelled including fashion shows and trade fairs.
On Wednesday, the government instructed public sector managers to reorganise offices to help staff work from home.
Italy's chronically weak economic growth looks sure to suffer, with the tourist sector taking a huge hit from a wave of cancellations.
Industry lobby Confindustria said the country was in recession, forecasting a fall in gross domestic product in both the first and second quarters of this year. 
Confturismo, the tourist industry's confederation, said the sector was ""on its knees.""
It forecast a drop of some 32 million in the number of Italian and foreign tourists in March-to-May, with a loss to the industry of about 7.4 billion euros ($8.23 billion).

Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri has promised tax breaks and other measures for the affected sectors worth 3.6 billion euros. A government source told Reuters on Wednesday this may be raised to 4.5 billion, or 0.25% of GDP.

(Reuters) - A day after a series of fierce tornadoes killed 24 people in Tennessee, rescue teams on Wednesday were searching through flattened homes and piles of debris in the north-central part of the state for possible survivors.
The statewide death toll now stands at 24, including five children and 13 adults in Putnam County, about 80 miles (130 km)
east of Nashville, the state capital. An additional 22 people are reported missing in the county, where a string of twisters left a trail of destruction early on Tuesday, officials said during a morning news briefing.
""We have to be concerned because there could be those folks that are still in the area. We could still have some people trapped,"" County Mayor Randy Porter said. ""But we're hoping those people are safe and just haven't let us know that they are.""
Six-member teams of volunteers and rescue personnel were conducting searches using a grid method to work through a county where houses were reduced to splitters and debris covered roadways, Putnam County Sheriff Eddie Farris said.
Local media footage showed personnel wearing yellow vests and gloves picking through rumble with their hands and despondent residents reacting to the sight of widespread devastation as they looked for personal belongings.
In Nashville, where two people were killed, a similar scene unfolded as residents searched through piles of debris as broken power lines littered streets.
No one was missing in Nashville and about 90 people spent the night in shelters, Mayor John Cooper said during a morning briefing.
Governor Bill Lee said on Twitter that flags at the state capitol would be flown at half-staff until Friday.
""Our hearts are with the families across TN facing devastation and heartbreak after deadly tornadoes struck our communities,"" he said.
About 40,000 households and businesses were without power on Wednesday, the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency said in an alert.
The White House said President Donald Trump would visit the devastated areas on Friday.
The National Weather Service received 11 reports of tornadoes early on Tuesday. NWS teams were surveying the area on Wednesday and found that at least one tornado with winds of up to 160 miles per hour (258 kph) touched down in the area. It was not yet clear yet how many twisters actually touched down, the service said."
1583,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 04:03PM ET</span>",'I'd never felt so vulnerable': Mexican survivors recount attempted femicides,"By Lizbeth Diaz
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Five years ago, a Mexican woman woke up in a hospital one morning connected to an endotracheal tube and a catheter. She was in so much pain that she barely remembered being brutally beaten by her boyfriend.
The woman has assumed the name of Becky Bios because after the attack she wanted to leave behind her old identity, she said. She withheld her legal name.
Bios said she spent two weeks in a coma in a clinic in central Mexico after the beating, which left her with a ruptured gallbladder and in respiratory arrest.
""Waking up from the coma, I didn't remember anything. I looked at my body, I was extremely thin. I wanted to talk but felt the tube in my throat,"" said the woman, now 36, a psychologist. ""I'd never felt so vulnerable.""
Bios considers the attack an attempted femicide, a crime described under Mexican law as murder of a woman for reasons of gender. Her account offers rare testimony from a survivor of attacks against women that have long been a problem in Mexico.
Femicides are frequently carried out by domestic partners and often involve grotesque or degrading violence. 
Last year, recorded femicides surged to 976 cases, over double the number of five years ago. Overall, 12 percent of murders in Mexico - including those not classified as femicides - are of women.
In recent weeks, the kidnapping and murder of a seven-year-old girl and the skinning and disemboweling of a 25-year-old woman have fueled anger among women about what many view as authorities' inadequate response to the brutality.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador blamed ""neo-liberalism"" for the violence against women in the aftermath of the girl's murder, sparking a torrent of criticism.
Plans are taking shape for a nationwide strike on Monday, in which women will withdraw from public life for a day.
Prosecutions for femicide remain few and far between. Relatives of victims blame the country's weak justice system. 
Irinea Buendia said her daughter Mariana Lima was murdered by her husband, a police officer from the state of Mexico. The husband has maintained that his wife committed suicide.
He was initially acquitted but Mexico's Supreme Court has ordered the case be reopened, arguing that enough evidence existed to rule out suicide. The accused remains in prison awaiting the outcome of the trial. 
Lima's case became emblematic because it was the first case of alleged femicide to be escalated to the Mexican Supreme Court. Relatives of victims say authorities do not always take cases seriously. 
""My husband died two years ago waiting for justice,"" Buendia said.
Bios said it took her years to find the courage to talk about her case without feeling ashamed - and to convince others, including her family and authorities, of the seriousness of the attack.
She said her partner attacked her when she told him she would leave him after several episodes of sexual violence.
""Little by little, he would corner me and make me think I'm worthless and, worse, I believed him,"" she said.
When her partner, now on the run from authorities, entered her hospital room one day, she said she was so enraged she wanted to attack him with the fork she was holding.
She reported the attack after leaving hospital. But the prosecutor's office merely advised her to return if it happened again, she said. The prosecutor's office did not respond to a request for comment. 
Nearly five years later, she said she still suffers with hearing problems and memory loss.

""I asked for help but nobody believed me,"" she said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A Russian businessman dubbed ""Putin's cook"" for his close ties to Russia's president sought in a court filing on Wednesday to distance himself and his company from accusations by American prosecutors of meddling in the 2016 U.S. election.
The filing by Evgeny Prigozhin marked the first time any corporate representative for St. Petersburg-based Concord Management and Consulting LLC had responded directly to accusations by the U.S. prosecutors that it had unlawfully defied subpoenas in a criminal case against it.
Prigozhin and Concord were charged in 2018 with conspiracy to defraud the United States for their alleged role in election meddling aimed at sowing discord in the United States, helping Donald Trump win the presidency and harming his opponent Hillary Clinton. Concord pleaded not guilty.
In a sworn affidavit filed in federal court in Washington, Prigozhin said he was not in charge of the company at the time that U.S. prosecutors have said it funded a so-called troll farm engaged in a propaganda campaign during the 2016 race. Prigozhin also said he did not possess or had no way of searching for corporate records subpoenaed by prosecutors.
""As is common practice for many Russian organizations, Concord does not as a rule keep electronic copies of business documents,"" Prigozhin said in the affidavit.
U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich had set a deadline for Wednesday for Prigozhin's company to respond or face being held in civil contempt.
Prigozhin is a Russian catering tycoon nicknamed ""Putin's cook"" by Russian media because of banquets he has organized for Russian President Vladimir Putin. U.S. prosecutors have described him as having with ties with Putin. The charges stem from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation that documented Moscow's election interference.
Concord is the only one of the three Russian entities charged in the case to have hired legal counsel in the United States to respond to the charges. It is not expected to have any corporate representatives present when the scheduled trial begins in April.
Prosecutors accused Concord of defying subpoenas for corporate records and internet IP addresses. Prigozhin, in his affidavit, said he could not find anything pertaining to IP addresses.
""I reviewed the contracts between Concord and internet service providers with which it contracted between January 1, 2014 and February 1, 2018. These contracts do not specify a particular IP address provided to Concord during that period, and no other records have been kept, because having a particular IP address has never been relevant to Concord's business,"" Prigozhin wrote. 

Prigozhin also said Concord ""has gone to great lengths to participate in this case"" and would participate in the trial through its American attorney.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government said on Wednesday it had charged a Defense Department linguist with transmitting classified intelligence to a foreign national linked to the Lebanese Islamist group Hezbollah, saying she revealed the names of key American assets and put their lives at risk.
Mariam Taha Thompson, 61, formerly of Rochester, Minnesota, was arrested by FBI agents at an overseas military base in Irbil, Iraq, on Feb. 27. She was due to make an initial appearance on Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
Reuters could not immediately determine who is representing Thompson in the case.
""While in a war zone, the defendant allegedly gave sensitive national defense information, including the names of individuals helping the United States, to a Lebanese national located overseas,"" John Demers, the Justice Department's assistant attorney general for national security, said in a statement.
""If true, this conduct is a disgrace, especially for someone serving as a contractor with the United States military. This betrayal of country and colleagues will be punished.""
The Justice Department said that during its investigation, it discovered audit logs showing a ""notable shift"" in Thompson's network activity on the Defense Department's classified systems.
The discovery came on Dec. 30, 2019, a day after the United States launched air strikes against Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and the same day that protesters there stormed the U.S. Embassy in response.
The information Thompson was looking up involved dozens of files on human intelligence sources she had no need to access, including their names, photographs and other personally-identifiable information, the department said .
In February, FBI agents searched her living quarters on the base and discovered a handwritten note written in Arabic under her mattress, according to a sworn statement from an FBI agent contained in a court filing. 
The note had the names of U.S. intelligence informants. The note said these sources were collecting information for the United States, and suggested that their phones be monitored and their target should be warned, according to the sworn statement.
In subsequent interviews with the FBI, Thompson she waived her Miranda rights and told the agents she had passed along the information from the note to a Lebanese foreign national, according to the statement.
Court documents identify the person only as a co-conspirator whom Thompson had a romantic interest in. She told the FBI she did not know if he was with Hezbollah, which was first designated as a terrorist group by the United States in 1997, according to the court filing.
To share the intelligence, Thompson claimed she had memorized the classified information, wrote it down and conveyed it to the co-conspirator through a secure messaging application on her phone, according to the filing. She apparently later amended her statement, saying she was 70% sure she had not transmitted the note. 
However, investigators said in the court filing they had developed solid evidence to suggest Thompson was sending the person details about the human intelligence sources, including information she wrote on a second Arabic note.

RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro sent out a trumpet-playing, banana-throwing impersonator to work a crowd in Brasilia on Wednesday, before joining him for a standup routine in one of the most surreal moments of his unorthodox presidency.
Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who has vowed to kick-start Brazil's economy and end years of crime and graft, dodged questions on weak economic data during the bizarre scene, which was broadcast live on his Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) page. 
The impersonator, who donned a sash with the yellow and green of Brazil and mimicked Bolsonaro's trademark drawl, was named by local media as comedian Marvio Lucio dos Santos Lourenco. Reuters was unable to confirm his identity. 
As the impersonator greeted well-wishers and journalists gathered outside the president's residence, he struck up a tune on a trumpet and threw bananas into the crowd, an apparent reference to a rude local gesture Bolsonaro has recently used.
When Bolsonaro appeared, journalists attempted to ask about data released on Wednesday showing that Brazil's economy grew at its slowest pace in three years in the fourth quarter. The president seemed to direct the question to the impersonator, who was part of his official entourage.
The impersonator responded by repeatedly saying the name and nickname of Economy Minister Paulo Guedes - a Chicago-trained economist who has pledged to steady the economy and lower unemployment for the president. 
Bolsonaro then proceeded to pat Lourenco on the back before taking selfies with the crowd along the barrier outside his residence. The two then shook hands and parted ways.

The oddball episode was one of the stranger moments of Bolsonaro's time in office. With his folksy, avuncular style, and willingness to circumvent traditional media in favor of direct communication with his supporters via social media, some have even labeled him the ""Trump of the Tropics.""

The Andean country signed a peace deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in 2016 to end the guerrilla group's role in a more than 50-year conflict that left 260,000 dead. 
But armed groups including FARC dissidents and the National Liberation Army remain active, as do criminal gangs involved in drug trafficking and illegal mining. 
""The humanitarian situation has deteriorated for civilians. Over the last year, our teams noted 987 violations of international humanitarian law and other humanitarian rules,"" said Christoph Harnisch, head of the ICRC delegation in Colombia.
""The majority were serious incidents such as threats, murders, acts of sexual violence and recruitment of children. Civilians are still suffering from the worst consequences of armed conflict and violence. In many cases, victims say nothing about what is happening because they are afraid of reprisals,"" he added. ""Life without fear is overdue in Colombia.""
Demobilized FARC fighters abandoned large areas in the country's mountainous and jungle regions after the peace agreement, when some 13,000 members of the group took initial steps to reintegrate into society. 
However, other illegal armed groups occupied these zones to put them to use for drug trafficking and illegal mining activities, human rights groups say.
According to ICRC, last year landmines and other explosives left 352 victims - including 42 dead - representing a 59% rise on 2018 levels. Furthermore, 25,000 people were forcibly displaced, while over 27,000 were subject to forced confinement by illegal armed groups.
The organization reported 93 forced disappearances in 2019 and 218 cases of aggression against healthcare staff and infrastructure, more than double the level a year earlier.

""There is much left to do, what has been completed is not sufficient and there needs to be greater efforts from society and government institutions,"" Harnisch said, referring to the challenges facing Colombia to improve humanitarian conditions for civilians in its most remote areas.

GENEVA (Reuters) - A Singaporean beat a Chinese candidate in the race to lead the world patent office, heading off Beijing's bid for a fifth U.N. leadership role, much to the satisfaction of the United States. 
Daren Tang defeated fellow legal expert Wang Binying in a closed-door vote by dozens of countries to become director general of the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), which shapes global rules for intellectual property.
Intellectual property has been at the heart of a trade war between Washington and Beijing. The United States, along with many other Western countries, had backed Tang for the job and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last month that Washington was following the patent office vote ""very, very closely"".
Tang was chosen in a vote of WIPO's coordinating committee, a group of 83 countries chaired by France which said the breakdown was 55 for Tang and 28 for the Chinese candidate.
""We are very pleased with the election outcome,"" said Andrew Bremberg, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
""We believe that today's overwhelming vote was a clear demonstration of the importance of protecting intellectual property and the entire independence of WIPO in the international community,"" he added.
Chinese ambassador Chen Xu told Reuters: ""We express our gratitude for all who supported us, and congratulate who was elected. We are ready to continue our participation, involvement and contributions to this important international agency."" 
The 193-member U.N. agency, based in Geneva, oversees a patent system in which China and its companies have a growing stake.
Under the leadership of outgoing Australian head Francis Gurry, WIPO has overseen an explosion in patent filings and has begun preliminary talks on whether artificial intelligence, or machines, can be inventors.
WIPO, in contrast to many other U.N. agencies which are underfunded, expects revenues of 880 million Swiss francs ($921 million) in 2020-2021, mostly due to patent filing fees.
China already has its nationals heading four U.N. agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization, the International Civil Aviation Organization, the Industrial Development Organization and the International Telecommunications Union.
That is more than any other member state and Richard Gowan, U.N. director at the International Crisis Group think-tank, said it was part of Beijing's drive to win more influence within the United Nations, especially in economic and development fields.

Seyran Ohanyan, who was the ex-Soviet republic's defense minister from 2008 to 2016, was under investigation for alleged squandering of state property and has been banned from leaving the country while awaiting trial, Marina Ohanjanyan told Reuters.
Ohanyan is also being investigated on suspicion of acting unlawfully during the events of March 2008, when 10 people were killed in clashes between police and protesters following a disputed presidential election.
Ohanyan and his representatives were not reachable by Reuters for comment on the charges and the ongoing investigations.
Dozens of former Armenian officials, including former president Robert Kocharyan, have previously been arrested on different charges and are awaiting trial. Kocharyan denies wrongdoing.
Kocharyan's successor, Serzh Sarksyan, is also under investigation on suspicion of exceeding his authority and embezzling of around $1 million in state funds.
Sarksyan stepped down in April 2018 following protests over him going back on a promise not to become prime minister of the South Caucasus country of around 3 million after two terms as the president.
Critics have accused Sarksyan and his former allies of cracking down on democracy, corruption and mismanagement during their time in power Armenia, a country that depends heavily on Russian aid and investment. They deny those allegations."

MOSCOW/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Russia is racing to reinforce its troops in Syria by sea and air before talks between the Russian and Turkish leaders in Moscow on Thursday, flight data and shipping movements show.
The two presidents, Vladimir Putin and Tayyip Erdogan, agreed to meet after a surge in tensions between their countries over fighting in Syria's Idlib province between Russian-backed Syrian government forces and rebels allied to Turkey.
The fighting has raised the prospect of a direct clash between their armies, which operate in close proximity on opposing sides, and Erdogan hopes the talks will yield a ceasefire in Idlib.
A Reuters analysis of flight data and correspondents' monitoring of shipping in the Bosphorus Strait in northwestern Turkey show Russia began to step up naval and airborne deliveries to Syria on Feb. 28, the day after 34 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike in Syria.
That incident prompted concern in Moscow that Turkey might close the Bosphorus to Russian warships and bar Russian military transport planes from using Turkish air space.
The Russian Defence Ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Turkish official, who asked not to be identified, said there was no plan to close the strait, which would force Russia to take longer routes to Syria.
But Russia appears to be reinforcing Syria at its fastest rate since October, when U.S. forces withdrew from some parts of Syria and Moscow scrambled to fill the vacuum.
Reuters' monitoring of the Bosphorus since Feb. 28 shows Russia has sent five warships toward Syria within six days. That exceeds a usual pattern of one or two warships ships per week.
The Russian military announced the departure of the Admiral Grigorovich and Admiral Makarov frigates for Syria, but three other warships have followed unannounced.
One is the Orsk, a landing ship capable of carrying 20 tanks, 50 trucks or 45 armored personnel carries and up to 400 troops. The others - the Novocherkassk and the Caesar Kunikov - are landing ships that can carry over 300 troops, tanks and armor.
Turkey has responded by beefing up its escort protocol for Russian warships using the Bosphorus. Three Turkish patrol boats and a helicopter escorted the Russian frigates - such ships are usually accompanied by a single coast guard vessel.
""SHOW OF MUSCLES""
Since Feb. 28, at least five passenger and cargo planes operated by the Russian military have also flown to Syria, including three in a single day, the flight data showed.
That followed a further 12 military planes in the previous 18 days and represents the most intense level of Russian military air activity with Syria since October.
Publicly available tracking data gives only a snapshot of Russian military flights to Syria because not all such planes can be tracked.
One person who has worked closely with Russian forces in Syria said Moscow’s reinforcement effort was meant to send Ankara a message and was ""a show of muscles"".
The same person said the swift build-up was an insurance policy in case the Putin-Erdogan meeting flopped and Ankara applied restrictions on the Bosphorus or in its airspace.
Turkey shows sign s of having noticed Russia is also concentrating its forces near its main air base in Syria, Hmeymim, in Latakia province.
""Russia is conducting a serious build-up near Hmeymim,"" said a Turkish security official, who added that Moscow had also stepped up its logistical support for the Syrian army.
""These are steps that may damage the positive atmosphere that could be found before tomorrow’s meeting,"" said the official though hoping for ""positive results""."

QUSRA, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinians have launched protests in the occupied West Bank after Israeli bulldozers began clearing land in what villagers fear is an attempt to confiscate it for future Jewish settlements.
Scuffles intensified this week as Israeli voters voted in an election, with Palestininans saying settlers had been emboldened by U.S. President Donald Trump's Middle East plan and Israeli election rhetoric about annexing settlements. 
Villagers from nearby Qusra challenged troops guarding Israeli bulldozers as they worked in a field close to Migdalim settlement in the northern West Bank. 
In another nearby village, Beita, residents protested over several days, planting a Palestinian flag and erecting a tent on the hilltop of al-Arma to defend it against settlers from Itamar settlement, near the city of Nablus. Some demonstrators hurled rocks at Israeli troops.
""I came here because this is my land, and I want to die on my land but they are not letting me come near it,"" said Joudat Odeh, from Qusra.
""They are happy at the victory of Netanyahu,"" said Odeh, 70. ""They are coming to control this land and we are helpless."" 
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing Likud Party leads the vote count after Monday's election, but with 99% of votes counted on Wednesday he was still short of securing enough seats for a governing coalition.
Victory would pave the way for Netanyahu to make good on his pledge to annex settlements in the West Bank under Trump's peace plan. 
Palestinians have rejected the proposal, saying it would kill their dream of establishing a viable state in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, territory Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
More than 400,000 Israeli settlers now live among about 3 million Palestinians in the West Bank, with a further 200,000 settlers in East Jerusalem. Palestinians and much of the world view the settlements as illegal under international law, a position Israel and the United States dispute.
An Israeli military statement said that on March 1 Israelis were carrying out ""agricultural work"" near Migdalim when around 30 Palestinians ""came to the area, hurled rocks and came into physical confrontation with the Israelis. Military forces came to the area and dispersed the crowd.""
Soon afterwards, the statement said, 120 Palestinians gathered nearby in what it termed a ""riot."" It said its troops were confronted with burning tyres and ""large amounts of rocks"" and ""responded with riot dispersal means.""
Qusra protesters said Israel had stopped Palestinians using or farming the lands in question since the 1990s, and now they feared settlers would seize them for their own use.
""I am afraid that in a few days Netanyahu may come to lay the cornerstone of a new settlement,"" said Mohammad Shokri, 80, from Qusra.

""He gave them a promise he would increase settlement. They want to take over all the mountains and to leave nothing for the Arabs"".

1595,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 12:11PM ET</span>",U.S. Supreme Court justices divided in abortion case; Roberts may hold key,"By Lawrence Hurley and Andrew Chung
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court appeared divided on Wednesday as the justices weighed a major abortion rights case - a challenge to a Louisiana law that imposes restrictions on doctors that could make it harder for women to obtain the procedure, with Chief Justice John Roberts representing the potential decisive vote.
The court, with a 5-4 conservative majority, heard about an hour of arguments in an appeal by Shreveport-based abortion provider Hope Medical Group for Women seeking to invalidate the 2014 law. Two of Louisiana's three clinics that perform abortions would be forced to close if the law is allowed to take effect, according to lawyers for the clinic.
The Louisiana law requires that doctors who perform abortions have a sometimes difficult-to-obtain arrangement called ""admitting privileges"" at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. 
Some conservative justices signaled sympathy toward Louisiana's law. Roberts, a conservative who is considered the court's ideological center, asked questions that seemed to focus on whether he felt bound by the court's 2016 ruling when it struck down similar restrictions in Texas.
Roberts cast the deciding vote when the justices last year on a 5-4 vote blocked Louisiana's law from taking effect while the litigation over its legality continued.
That vote brings him into conflict with his position in the Texas case when Roberts was among the three dissenting justices who concluded that an admitting privileges requirement did not represent an undue burden. 
During Wednesday's arguments, his questions indicated that the chief justice may feel that he is bound by the 2016 court's finding that admitting privileges laws provide no health benefit.
Two of the court's conservatives, Justice Neil Gorsuch and Justice Clarence Thomas, said nothing during the argument.
The liberal justices, including the three women on the court, appeared skeptical toward the admitting privileges provision.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor said it was a ""mystery to me"" why a 30-mile limit was imposed if the intent of the law was to show that doctors were properly credentialed.
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg made a similar point, noting that medical complications for women who undergo abortions generally occur at home, meaning that the fact the doctor has a relationship with a nearby hospital is irrelevant.
""That's what I don't understand,"" Ginsburg said.
A federal appeals court upheld the law. President Donald Trump's administration supports Louisiana in the case.
The Supreme Court struck down a similar Texas admitting privileges requirement in 2016 when conservative Justice Anthony Kennedy, who retired in 2018, joined the four liberal justices to defend abortion rights. Trump has tightened the conservative grip on the court with his 2018 appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who replaced Kennedy, and his 2017 appointment of Justice Neil Gorsuch.
Neither Kavanaugh nor Kennedy ruled directly on abortion rights during their prior service as federal appellate judges. Trump promised during the 2016 presidential race to appoint justices who would overturn the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and legalized it nationwide. The Supreme Court in 1992 reaffirmed Roe v. Wade in a ruling that prohibited laws that placed an ""undue burden"" on a woman's ability to obtain an abortion. 
The Louisiana case will test the willingness of the court to uphold Republican-backed abortion restrictions being pursued in numerous conservative states. 
DIVISIVE SOCIAL ISSUE
Baton Rouge-based U.S. District Judge John deGravelles cited the undue burden precedent when he struck down Louisiana's law in 2016, prompting the state to appeal to the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The 5th Circuit upheld the law despite the 2016 precedent, concluding there was no evidence any Louisiana clinic would close due to the admitting privileges requirement.
Abortion remains one of the most divisive social issues in the United States, with Christian conservatives - an important constituency for Trump - among those most opposed to it. A Supreme Court ruling in favor of Louisiana's law could prompt other states to pass similar statutes.
Abortion rights advocates have argued that restrictions such as admitting privileges are meant to limit access to abortion not protect women's health as proponents say.
Activists who oppose abortion are hoping the Supreme Court, with Gorsuch and Kavanaugh and perhaps additional Trump appointees on the bench if he wins re-election on Nov. 3, will scale back or even overturn Roe v. Wade.
Hundreds of demonstrators appeared outside the court on a cool and sunny day in the U.S. capital, with supporters of abortion rights outnumbering opponents. Some carried signs saying ""Protect Safe, Legal Abortion"" and ""My Right, My Decision."" 
""I remember a time when abortion wasn't legal. It was illegal when I was a teenager. And we aren't going back. We're just not going back,"" said demonstrator Bambi Nelms, 62, of Maryland. ""My mother had an illegal abortion before I was born - coat hanger variety - and it darned near killed her. She had me after that.""
Some anti-abortion demonstrators held flags emblazoned with Bible quotes and the image of a bald eagle - a symbol of America - carrying a Christian cross. Others stood silently with red tape over their mouths with the word ""LIFE"" in black letters.
Demonstrator Dennis McKirahan, 75, of Ohio said supporters of abortion rights were ""distorting what God intended.""
""When that baby is a seed in the womb, scientifically, it's going to be a baby. And you can't stop that or you're killing that baby,"" McKirahan said. ""God didn't intend us to stop our creation.""

1596,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 11:55AM ET</span>","A month after far-right scandal, German state elects far-left leader","BERLIN (Reuters) - Lawmakers in Germany's eastern state of Thuringia voted a former hard-left state premier back into office on Wednesday, replacing a liberal whose election a month ago with far-right backing sent shock waves through the political establishment.
Liberal Thomas Kemmerich became the first state premier elected with the support of the Alternative for Germany (AfD), with whom Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU) sided to the disgust of her national coalition partners.
The Feb. 5 result shattered the post-war consensus among established parties of shunning the far right, and led CDU leader Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer to abandon her ambition of succeeding Merkel as Germany's next chancellor.
Kemmerich, of the liberal Free Democrats (FDP), said a day after his election that his position was untenable and subsequently quit, paving the way for a new election.
Wednesday's vote saw Bodo Ramelow of the far-left Linke, backed by the center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and ecologist Greens, reinstalled as premier after a third round of voting in secret ballots at the regional assembly.
Ramelow failed to secure a majority in the first two rounds when he faced a dual with the AfD's candidate, far-right firebrand Bjoern Hoecke, who a court ruled last year could legally be called a fascist.
In the third round, Hoecke withdrew his candidacy and Ramelow ran alone, winning 42 of 85 votes cast - the same level of support he garnered in the first two rounds, suggesting his victory came without the support of the AfD or the CDU.
In the third round, the candidate with the most votes wins. 
After Ramelow's victory, Kemmerich presented him with a bouquet of flowers. Hoecke offered Ramelow his hand to shake but he did not take it, and the two had quite a lengthy exchange.

""When I can clearly hear that democracy is a priority, then I am willing to give Mr Hoecke my hand but only when you defend democracy and don't trample on it,"" Ramelow said in his acceptance speech, to applause from his supporters.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Mohammed Anees fled his home in northeastern New Delhi last week as Hindu-Muslim clashes erupted in his area, escaping with his family of four to a relative's home. He had only a few hundred rupees in his wallet, leaving everything else behind.
Now the 37-year-old Muslim mechanic is among more than 1,000 people sheltering in a large open-air mosque that has been turned into a relief camp in the Mustafabad area of the Indian capital and opened on Monday.
""I don't have any money left now,"" Anees said, showing pictures of his ransacked home that he visited on the weekend on his cracked mobile phone. 
With jewelry and savings looted and afraid of more violence, he moved to the camp with his wife and three children, victims of the worst communal riots in New Delhi for decades. More than 40 people were killed and hundreds injured.
Anees lived in Shiv Vihar, where two large mosques and dozens of Muslim houses surrounding it were torched. Houses with Hindu symbols were largely left untouched.
In total, some 2,000 people are believed to have been displaced, local politician Amanatullah Khan said. Hundreds of those are taking shelter on the floors of private homes.
""The police brought us and left us here,"" said Mohammed Uddin, 70, outside a cramped house where dozens of people packed into an entrance foyer. ""They didn't even check if we were hurt.""
Many of those displaced, who are overwhelmingly Muslim, have moved to the Mustafabad camp, where a kitchen provides free meals and volunteer doctors are treating victims.
Rashid Ali, a local resident helping organize the camp, said they had received some help from the Delhi government, run by a regional party.
On a long desk outside the mosque premises, a small group of lawyers helped the victims of riots file for compensation ranging from 25,000 rupees ($341.34) to 100,000 rupees.
Seema Joshi from Delhi's ruling Aam Aadmi Party, who was helping the legal team, said around 500 applications had been made, though many people showed up without any paperwork since they fled in a hurry without documents or had belongings burnt.
In the narrow streets surrounding the mosque, women jostled for food supplies as children rummaged through piles of second-hand clothes donated to victims.
On a loudspeaker, an announcer asked for volunteers to clean an overflowing toilet attached to the relief camp. 
""A lot of people are facing depression,"" said Wasim Qamar, a doctor at the camp. ""People saw terrible things. Some of them can't eat or sleep. They are very fearful.""
Describing the violence as ""one-sided and well-planned"" against Muslims, the Delhi Minorities Commission - a government-appointed body that focuses on minority groups - said the Delhi government's compensation package was inadequate after surveying riot-hit areas on Tuesday.
Saurabh Bharadwaj, a lawmaker from Aam Aadmi, said the party was trying to improve its response to the emergency.
Some leaders from Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party have accused opposition groups of fanning the violence, saying that Muslims targeted Hindus during the clashes.
Shabira, 55, and her family were rescued by police early last Wednesday from Shiv Vihar, leaving their home with nothing but what they were wearing.
At the relief camp, she said she was getting basic amenities - food, shelter and diapers for her infant grandchild.
""I want my house back,"" she said, in tears. ""I just want to go back.""

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist government withdrew the special rights of Jammu and Kashmir - then India's only Muslim majority state - and split it into two federally administered territories last August, arguing the move was necessary to spur development.
At the same time, New Delhi flooded the heavily-militarized region - which is also claimed in full by arch-rival Pakistan - with additional troops, detained scores of people, and imposed harsh movement and communications restrictions.
Most of those restrictions were gradually eased but curbs on communications remained, with social media websites including Facebook (O:FB), WhatsApp and Instagram blocked and internet speeds throttled, particularly on mobile phones.
On Monday, in a government order reviewed by Reuters, authorities said only speed restrictions on mobile internet access would remain in place until mid-March.
Riyaz Mir, managing director of CNS Infotec, a private internet provider in Kashmir's main city of Srinagar, said he had restored access to social media and all other websites on his networks.

Authorities had earlier said that the months-long ban was required to quell unrest over the withdrawal of the region's autonomy, although many residents were using virtual private network (VPN) apps to circumvent the restrictions.

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union countries offered more money on Wednesday to Greece for border policing and for humanitarian aid to Syria's Idlib in an effort to avert a mass influx of migrants, but were at odds over what to do about Turkey.
EU interior ministers meet in Brussels on Wednesday for emergency talks, to be followed by foreign ministers on Thursday and Friday, as some 25,000 refugees and migrants gather on the Greek border, seeking to cross into Europe.
That came after Turkey - citing the latest fighting in Syria - backed away from a 2016 deal with the EU to keep refugees and migrants away from Europe.
""Turkey is not an enemy, but people are not weapons either,"" the EU's top migration official, Margaritis Schinas, said in explaining that 700 million euros' worth of extra funding for Greece would fortify the EU's external border there.
Greek riot police used water cannon and tear gas on Wednesday against migrants at the border, while a top EU official met Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to sound out his demands in exchange for Ankara's reverting to keeping refugees in Turkey.
The EU was also preparing to offer 60 million euros in new humanitarian aid to Idlib, diplomats said. The city has been the latest flashpoint in the nine-year-old war in Syria, where Russia-backed Syrian forces are fighting rebels supported by Turkey.
Humanitarian efforts to support nearly 1 million people who fled the fighting have been overwhelmed, Mark Lowcock, the U.N. aid chief, has said.
TURKEY
EU member states are at odds over Turkey, however. Greece and Cyprus are demanding a tough line, focusing on border tensions and condemning what the bloc sees as Erdogan's migration ""blackmail"".
Others are willing to offer further aid to support the more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees stranded in Turkey, on top of the 6 billion euros already granted in 2016.
The EU is desperate to avoid any repeat of 2015 and 2016, when more than a million refugees arrived on its soil, overwhelming security and welfare systems and fuelling support for euro-sceptic and nationalist groups across the bloc.
But EU's ties with Turkey, a NATO ally, are strained over human rights and security issues, as well as Ankara's hydrocabons drilling in east Mediterranean.
At the same time, EU countries have been at loggerheads since 2015 over how to share out migrants arriving in the bloc, leaving themselves at the mercy of Turkey.
Human rights groups decried Athens' hard-nosed action on the border and its decision to suspend accepting asylum claims, but the EU expressed solidarity with Greece.

LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's 19th-century parliamentary palace and its hundreds of grand offices and wood-panelled meeting rooms are ill-equipped to deal with the global outbreak of coronavirus, according to some worried lawmakers working inside the building.
The government is hoping to contain the spread of the virus, but expects the number of infections to rise from 85 currently. On Tuesday it published an action plan setting out how to cope if it becomes widespread in the country.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson's current advice to citizens is to wash their hands more often.
However, several lawmakers expressed concern that the risks inside parliament were greater and that its aging facilities made following even this basic advice more difficult.
""Parliament seems hopelessly ill prepared,"" lawmaker Chris Bryant told Reuters. 
""There are toilets where the towels ran out days ago, toilets with no soap or sanitiser, one men’s toilet where one of the two sinks has not worked for a decade.""
The grandeur of parliament's ornate debating chamber, lined with lush green leather benches, masks a wider estate struggling to cope with the demands of the thousands of employees who work there every day - from lawmakers and researchers to journalists, cooks and cleaners.
While the estate awaits a multi-billion pound renovation, toilets are frequently out of order, heating in offices can be temperamental and many doors in the oldest part of the building can only be opened by pressing a button or twisting a metal door knob.
Reuters saw a member of staff wearing rubber gloves cleaning door handles on Wednesday.
CONTAINMENT PHASE
Johnson, was asked by a lawmaker in parliament on Wednesday whether parliament was considering introducing conference calls and electronic voting if the situation worsened.
""We are still at the containment stage ... when we come to the 'delay' phase she will be hearing a lot more detail about what we propose to do with large gatherings and places such as parliament,"" he replied.
A parliament spokeswoman said they would continue to follow guidance from Public Health England and were monitoring the situation closely.
While some hand-sanitiser points have been installed, lawmaker Geraint Davies said he was concerned that there were insufficient places where the gel could be obtained.
""There's lots of people walking through the corridors all the time, touching the same doors and shaking hands - there should be hand-sanitisers all along those corridors,"" he said. 
""The nature of parliamentarians is that we arrive every week, converging from every corner of the country, we all mix together with lots of other people and then we disperse back to our constituencies and meet lots of other people.

KIEV (Reuters) - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy's party is set to promote some experienced hands in a sweeping reshuffle on Wednesday, as it ditches a cabinet run by the country's youngest ever prime minister six months into its term.
The 35-year-old Oleksiy Honcharuk is expected to be replaced by deputy prime minister Denys Shmygal, who used to work for DTEK, Ukraine's largest energy group, owned by the country's richest man Rinat Akhmetov. Finance Minister Oksana Markarova could be axed for Ihor Umansky, who was acting finance minister a decade ago under Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko.
Health Minister Zoriana Skaletska, who grabbed headlines last month by joining coronavirus evacuees from China in quarantine in an act of solidarity, could be swapped for a former health minister under President Viktor Yanukovich. 
The reshuffle, which could also see the departure of the foreign minister, defense minister and prosecutor general, signals a switch of direction for Zelenskiy who came to power promising to clean up corruption and a new type of politics. 
It also throws into focus Ukraine's commitment to reforms at a time when it is trying to finalize a new loan program from the International Monetary Fund that is seen as crucial to economic stability and investor confidence. 
Hlib Vyshlinsky, Executive Director at the Centre for Economic Strategy think tank, suggested the reshuffle would delay talks with the IMF.
Vyshlinsky also pointed to comments made by Umansky last year about the need to change the leadership of the central bank because it was not lowering interest rates fast enough, saying such remarks were likely to play badly with the IMF. 
An actor with no political experience who played a fictional president in a comedy series, Zelenskiy swept to power in a landslide presidential election win last year, pitching himself as an everyman outsider who would bring new faces into politics. 
But his administration's popularity has sagged after patchy progress on a commitment to end the war against Russian-backed separatists in the eastern Donbass region and to fight high-level graft.
Lawmakers from Zelenskiy's party told Reuters that cooperation with the IMF would continue.
""There was a requirement for new politicians not only to be new, but also to be professionals,"" lawmaker Iryna Vereshchuk said. ""If there is no such connection, if it has not worked, then we should rely on more experienced ones.""
Honcharuk's position has been under scrutiny since the leak in January of a recording that suggested he had made unflattering comments about Zelenskiy.

The prime minister's government has also tussled with Ihor Kolomoisky, one of Ukraine's wealthiest tycoons, who has been fighting to reverse the 2016 nationalization of his former bank PrivatBank, the country's largest lender. Zelenskiy, whose TV show became a hit on a station owned by Kolomoisky, denies that his business ties with the tycoon influence policy decisions.

Chatting to them at a reception organized by the British ambassador at Dublin's Guinness brewery on Tuesday evening, William also joked that he and his wife Kate were spreading coronavirus.
""I bet everyone's like: 'I've got coronavirus, I'm dying', and you're like 'no, you've just got a cough,'"" William said to the emergency workers.
""Does it seem quite dramatic about coronavirus at the moment? Is it being a little bit hyped up do you think in the media?""
There have been 51 cases of coronavirus so far in Britain, and the government issued a action plan on Tuesday which included a warning that more than a fifth of employees could be off work at the peak of the outbreak. Ireland has two confirmed cases.
""By the way, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are spreading coronavirus! Sorry!"" William also joked at the event. ""We're keeping an eye on that, so do tell us if we need to stop!""
During the reception at the brewery, where William's grandmother Queen Elizabeth was filmed pouring a pint during a 2011 visit, he quipped that ""it is not often that I find myself following the queen to the pub.""
He also thanked the crowd for contributing to the ""very special relationship between our two countries.""

Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 27, was charged with an immigration offense and was due to appear later at Basildon Magistrates’ Court, east of London.
Detectives also said they wanted to speak to any other Vietnamese nationals who had entered Britain illegally via a similar route through the port of Purfleet.
""We believe that a number of other people traveled into the UK in a similar way to the 39 deceased throughout the month of October and we hope that these people would be able to help us,"" Essex Police's Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said.
""We understand that they may be concerned about coming forward and sharing their experiences, but we can assure you that your information and details will be treated in confidence.""
The victims, who included two 15-year-old boys, were discovered in October in the truck container on an industrial estate in Grays in Essex, about 20 miles (32 km) east of London.
Autopsies concluded that the provisional cause of death was a combination of hypoxia - oxygen deprivation - and hyperthermia - overheating - in an enclosed space.
Maurice Robinson, the driver of the truck who comes from Northern Ireland, admitted last November plotting to assist unlawful immigration and acquiring criminal property, while detectives have also charged him and another man with manslaughter and human trafficking.

They are also seeking a number of other suspects.

KASTANIES/LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - Greek security forces used tear gas and water cannon on Wednesday against hundreds of migrants trying to cross the border from Turkey, as Athens and Ankara accused each other of lying about what was happening.
More than 10,000 migrants have been trying to breach the border since Turkey said last Thursday it would no longer abide by a 2016 deal with the European Union to halt illegal migration flows to Europe in return for billions of euros in aid.
Turkish officials said Greek forces had killed a migrant on the border on Wednesday, a claim denied by Greece.
Plumes of black smoke drifted above the Kastanies border crossing as Greek soldiers fired warning shots in the air. 
A Reuters witness saw teargas canisters being thrown from the Turkish side of the border toward Greek police over a high razor wire. The Greek government later released a video it said showed Turkish border guards were firing the canisters.
Greece and the EU accuse Turkey of deliberately encouraging the migrants to attempt to cross the border as a way of pressuring Brussels into offering more money or supporting Ankara's geopolitical aims in the Syrian conflict.
Turkey, which already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees and faces another influx from an upsurge in fighting in northwest Syria, says the EU is not providing anything like enough help to deal with the scale of the migrant crisis.
Turkish officials said Greek forces had killed a migrant and wounded five others on Wednesday at the border, prompting Greek government spokesman Stelios Petsas to say: ""Turkey is disseminating fake news... I dismiss this categorically.""
Greece similarly denied a Turkish claim on Tuesday that its forces had killed three migrants at the border.
Video footage on Wednesday showed migrants carrying an injured comrade away from the border. It was unclear how he had been hurt.
HUMAN RIGHTS
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan told lawmakers of his ruling AK Party in Ankara on Wednesday that Greece, and the EU generally, must ""act in line with the Human Rights Declaration and respect the migrants arriving on their land"".
EU leaders on Tuesday pledged 700 million euros to help Greece handle the migrant crisis and urged Turkey to hold up its end of the 2016 accord.
They fear a repeat of the 2015-16 migrant crisis, when more than a million migrants came to western Europe via Turkey and the Balkans, straining European security and welfare services and boosting support for far-right parties.
Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, known for his tough anti-immigrant stance, said 130,000 migrants had already passed the Greek border from Turkey and that they must be stopped as far south as possible. It was unclear how he arrived at that figure, which is much higher than any previously mentioned.
Prime Minister Boyko Borissov of Bulgaria, which also shares a land border with Turkey, called after talks with EU officials on Wednesday for renewed dialogue with Ankara on how to handle the migrants and shore up regional stability.
An unknown number of migrants have also arrived on Lesbos and other Greek islands from the nearby Turkish coast in the past week, though choppy seas discouraged sailings for a second consecutive day on Wednesday.
A navy ship docked at Lesbos port will take in 508 migrants who have arrived since March 2 once they have been identified, a Greek coastguard official said. He did not say where the ship would take them.
Hussein, in a group of about 100 migrants which arrived in Lesbos four days ago and has been camping on the shore, said he left Afghanistan with his 17-year-old brother a month ago and crossed Iran and Turkey before reaching the island by dinghy.

""Our future is going to be bright because I am an educated person so I don't need much help. I want to complete my education and then I will need a job,"" he told Reuters.

VIENNA (Reuters) - When OPEC ministers descend on Vienna to decide oil production policy, their meetings are usually accompanied by displays of brotherhood between the men in charge of a third of global crude supplies.
This time, as the world battles a coronavirus outbreak, they have been given strict instructions: no handshakes, don't hug and wash your hands frequently.
""Avoid close contact,"" reads a poster that greets ministers and delegates as they enter the headquarters of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in the Austrian capital.
""Avoid handshakes and hugs,"" it adds and, to prevent any misunderstanding, it also shows an image of two stickmen embracing with a large, red cross next to it.
As an additional safeguard, the number of delegates attending the OPEC meeting has been restricted and journalists have been barred from the OPEC building.
Outside the headquarters, the usual crowd of reporters clustering around ministers as they come and go from hotels have been noticeably smaller.
Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak and several OPEC ministers and delegates had their temperature checked before entering the OPEC headquarters on Wednesday.
""If someone arriving to OPEC has a temperature above 37.5 Celsius, an alert will be raised,"" a source, who was speaking from inside the OPEC headquarters, told Reuters.
OPEC member Iran, some of whose officials have gone down with the virus as the country grapples to contain one of the worst outbreaks outside of China, South Korea and Italy, sent its minister, Bijan Zanganeh, to this week's meeting.
A waitress at the Palais Kempinski where he and ministers from the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Venezuela stay said she was following advice to keep her hands clean with regular washing or sanitizer. ""That's all you can do,"" she said.
A spokeswoman said her hotel was following the recommendations from the health authorities, adding: ""We do not want to spread panic.""
Austria's airport authorities began mandatory temperature checks on Tuesday for passengers on direct flights from Iran, which has two such flights a week, and South Korea, which has three, according to a Vienna Airport spokesman.
Health authorities in Lower Austria, the province where the airport is located, said temperatures of all passengers from Iran were checked on Wednesday and no cases were found.
Not all officials followed the guidance on keeping a distance. OPEC Secretary General Mohammad Barkindo was shown in photos issued on Wednesday in a handshake for the camera with the Russian minister and Nigeria's Timipre Sylva.
But others were more cautious. ""I told people I won’t be shaking hands with them,"" said one OPEC delegate."

More than 4,000 such voters cast ballots on Monday at special polling booths that were sequestered and sterile, and where they were required to wear surgical masks and gloves as Central Elections Committee delegates watched through a nylon partition.
The committee said its senior directors had volunteered to count the votes, to spare staff vacillation over health risks.
Taking care to avoid paper-cuts, the monitors - some in protective suits, others making do with masks and gloves - sorted through piles of ballots in a guarded pavilion.
The committee had set a target tally pace of 1,000 votes per hour, reflecting public pressure for resolution in what was, amid political deadlock, Israel's third election in a year. 
How Israel executes the most basic of democratic functions under the shadow of the coronavirus could offer lessons to other countries - such as the United States, which holds a presidential election in November. 
Israel has reported 15 coronavirus cases and quarantined thousands of people on suspicion of exposure.
The latter include the general in charge of Israel's military operations, hundreds of children from at least two schools and hundreds of soccer fans who are believed to have sat close to an infected person at a Tel Aviv match last month.

1613,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 07:31AM ET</span>","Netanyahu election lead shrinks, raising prospect of another Israel vote","JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel appeared headed into another political stalemate on Wednesday after nearly-complete results indicated Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had failed to secure a clear majority for a right-wing bloc in parliament, despite his claim of victory. 
With 99% of votes counted, Netanyahu's conservative Likud party was seen taking 35 of parliament's 120 seats, down from 36 initially projected after Monday's election. His centrist challenger, Benny Gantz, was seen holding steady at 32 seats for his Blue and White party.
Israeli premiers generally need a coalition commanding 61 seats for their governments to survive. Wednesday's tally suggested that, with like-minded parties, a Netanyahu coalition could now expect to garner only 58.
The four-term leader has been hamstrung by corruption cases in which he denies wrongdoing. Gantz has cited Netanyahu's unprecedented indictment in refusing to join him in a coalition.
Yet Gantz, a former general who leads the centrist Blue and White party, seemed no closer to clinching a coalition, given ideological differences in a camp of Netanyahu-naysayers which includes ultranationalist ex-defense minister Avigdor Lieberman and Arab-Israeli parties.
That could spell further deadlock and another snap election to follow Monday's vote, which was Israel's third in a year. 
Netanyahu had claimed victory on Tuesday. Some Israeli commentators ridiculed that, on Wednesday, as ""fake news"".
""Most of Israel's citizens said unequivocally: Just not Bibi,"" tweeted Attila Somfalvi, anchor for Ynet TV, using Netanyahu's nickname. ""That raises the danger that Netanyahu will again try to drag the countries to elections.""
Netanyahu has faced calls, including from within Likud, to step aside so he can defend himself in a corruption trial that begins on March 17. He refuses, and is under no legal obligation to go.
Israeli media said Blue and White might table legislation that would bar a prime minister under indictment from forming the next government. Asked about the reports, a Blue and White spokeswoman said: ""All options are currently on the table.""
The Joint List, a party representing Israel's 21% Arab minority and which surged in Monday's election with a projected 15 seats, said it was cooperating with Blue and White - an apparent confirmation that the disqualification initiative was under way.
Defence Minister Naftali Bennett, one of Netanyahu's religious-nationalist coalition partners, described the reported initiative as ""a radical, anti-democratic move"".

""The right absolutely opposes this move and we will fight it with all our might,"" Bennett said on Twitter.

Christophe Lannelongue, head of the eastern France health agency, said on Wednesday that he expected more confirmed cases of coronavirus infection to appear in the region following the discovery of the 10 cases in two families, all linked to a Lent church service in which some 2,000 people took part.
""The chain of contamination clearly started at the meeting of the Lent week of the 'Porte Ouverte Chretienne' ... we can expect new cases in coming hours,"" Lannelongue said.
Health officials are trying to track all the people wo attended the service, but local prefect Laurent Touvet said this will be difficult as the event was open to the public and there had been no registration of the participants.
Lannelongue called on people who took part to isolate themselves and to report to medical authorities if they show symptoms of coronavirus infection.
The prefecture has also closed two schools attended by children of the infected families, as well as a school that is close to the evangelical church where the infection originated.
In South Korea, doctors are testing more than 200,000 members of a fringe Christian group in the city of Daegu - at the center of the worst outbreak outside China - to which most of South Korea's cases have been traced.
In France, more than 200 people have been infected with the virus and four people have died, but the virus has appeared separately in several regions and under different circumstances."
1615,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 06:58AM ET</span>","In Brexit Britain, there may no longer be too many cooks in the kitchen","By Andrew MacAskill
PETERBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - Before dinnertime at Damian Wawrzyniak's restaurant, he is busy preparing an elaborate array of dishes - slow cooked lamb with fermented broccoli inspired by his time cooking at the world-famous Noma restaurant and Polish sausages from his homeland.
Wawrzyniak came to Britain 16 years ago before gaining renown working as the head chef at the London Olympics and cooking for members of the royal family.
But these days he spends his time worrying about finding enough trained staff for his restaurant and another business he wants to open this year.
The 40-year-old said he will have to raise prices in his restaurant by about 20% if he has to pay his waiters and junior chefs the minimum salary set by the government to bring European Union nationals to Britain to work from next year.
Wawrzyniak said about 70% of his staff come from the EU and he has yet to receive a single application for a chef position he advertised last month. ""I can't find enough staff at the moment and if these costs have to be passed on then prices will rise dramatically,"" Wawrzyniak said. ""The biggest problem will be finding the people to work here. Without people, this business doesn’t exist.""
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government recently outlined plans to close the borders to unskilled workers, ending the era of cheap labor from the EU in restaurants, hotels and factories.Under new post-Brexit rules starting next year, migrants will have to meet a number of criteria to qualify for a work visa, including specific skills. Applicants will be required to receive a job offer with a salary of at least 25,600 pounds ($32,680) and an ability to speak English.
Business owners say this will make it harder to recruit staff at a time when economists say the country is near full employment. They say fewer immigrants will lead to higher prices, lower profits, and force businesses to close.
EU citizens make up about a quarter of the 3 million workers in Britain’s hospitality industry, the country's fourth-biggest employer, according to a KPMG report. In London, about 75% of waiting staff and 25% of chefs are from the EU. 
Concern over the impact of high levels of immigration from the European Union was one of the key drivers behind Britain's 2016 vote to leave the bloc. 
Since the Brexit vote, annual immigration from within continental Europe has fallen by more than half. 
Supporters of tougher immigration rules say the large pool of EU workers, particularly after the accession of several former communist states in central and eastern Europe in 2004, meant British workers' earnings have stagnated. 
A spokeswoman for the Home Office said the government was responding to voters’ demands for stricter immigration rules and companies will need to ensure British workers have the relevant skills for the job market.
""Employers will need to join our mission to level-up skills and economic growth across the whole UK so that we deliver a high-skill, high-wage and highly productive economy,"" she said.
Business owners who rely on low-skilled labor, however, say the real trouble is too few immigrants, not too many. 
Wawrzyniak said staff shortages mean he can only open his restaurant for five days, rather than seven, and during the evenings on weekdays. 
He complains each morning he has to be at work at 6:00 GMT to make fresh bread because he is unable to find a qualified baker to do the work. ""I can't find chefs. I am here all the time,"" he said. 
CLOSING RESTAURANTS
Kate Nicholls, chief executive of the UKHospitality trade association, said the biggest changes to Britain's immigration rules in decades would make it harder to employ people for lower-skilled jobs such as waitresses and kitchen workers.
""You will not see new sites or restaurants opening, and more will reduce their hours or not open for breakfast or in the evening,"" she said. 
Mark Jones, the chief executive of Carluccio's which runs a chain of Italian restaurants, said he is ""hugely disappointed"" by the proposed immigration changes. However, he said the plans are manageable over time. 
Jones said more than two-thirds of his employees currently come from the EU, with the rest mainly from Britain. He predicts within a decade that ratio will have flipped.
He says his business will have to work harder to retain his existing staff and is skeptical there are enough Britons to fill the gap created by fewer EU employees.
Jones predicts one in 10 restaurants in Britain may have to close because of the changes, which will increase costs at a time when restaurants are already being challenged by online food delivery groups. 
""I have given a lot of thought and I am still struggling to find the silver bullet to hiring more British people,"" he said.
But he said the most disappointing thing was that he will no longer have such a large multinational workforce, which is popular with many customers. 

""It will be sad for me that if I can't employ Italian people to work in a Italian restaurant,"" he said.

Fed misfire? Others resist pressure to act
Central bankers from Tokyo to Frankfurt are under growing market pressure to follow the U.S. Federal Reserve's 0.5 percentage point rate cut - even if the surprise move on Tuesday fell way short of its aim of shoring up confidence in the economy.
Sources close to the European Central Bank say policymakers want to hold out until its scheduled meeting on March 12 and in the meantime are focusing on what bankers should do if panic-stricken euro zone citizens start to stockpile cash.
The Bank of England is on a similar line. Its chief Mark Carney has insisted there would not be a one-size-fits-all approach and that fiscal measures - read tax cuts - would have to be part of the response in some places.
The British budget is due on March 11.

There are now over 93,000 cases globally according to a Reuters tally, with 13% or almost 12,700 cases in countries outside China.
Countries and regions outside the Chinese mainland have reported a total of 223 deaths, including 43 in the past day with new fatalities in Italy, Iran, France, Spain and the United States. With China, there are a total of 3,204 fatalities.
Italy's health authorities are looking to set up a new quarantine red zone after a new tally showed 27 people died of the illness there in the preceding 24 hours, bringing the number of dead to 79. One of the fatalities was aged 55, the youngest patient so far to have succumbed in Italy.
In the United States, the number of people diagnosed with the coronavirus in the greater Seattle area rose to 27 on Tuesday, including nine deaths, up from 18 cases and six deaths tallied on Monday. Online retailer Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) confirmed a first case among its U.S. workforce.
The Trump administration meanwhile is weighing up a move to cut off overseas travel from the United States to areas abroad with high rates of coronavirus. Separately, a multi-billion dollar funding bill is moving slowly through Congress after Democrats raised questions about the availability of testing for the new virus.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Makers of soju, South Korea's national drink and one of the world's best selling spirits, are jumping into the fight on the largest outbreak of coronavirus outside China by sharing their stockpiles of alcohol with makers of sanitizers.
Disinfectants, such as hand sanitizers, are flying off the shelves, along with medical-grade masks, as infections in South Korea have surged past 5,000 in just over a month since its first patient was diagnosed.
South Korean soju makers have responded to soaring ethanol demand for sanitizers by donating the alcohol that goes into the drink, a distilled spirit with 17% to 20% alcohol by volume traditionally based on rice, but now often wheat or potatoes.
""Ethanol demand for disinfection has grown while supply is limited...we have decided to provide it,"" an official of Daesun Distilling, based in the southeastern city of Busan, told Reuters.
To banish the virus, the company has pledged to donate 32 tonnes of ethanol for use in disinfecting buildings and public places in Busan and southeastern Daegu, the city at the center of South Korea's outbreak.
""We plan to keep donating until the coronavirus outbreak is stabilized and to donate 50 tonnes more,"" added the official, who sought anonymity as he was not authorized to speak to media.
South Koreans drink an average of about 12 shots of soju each week, media say, citing industry figures. Ethanol for alcoholic drinks can be produced by fermentation or distillation, typically from grains and plants.
The chemical can also be made from petrochemical feedstock.
Whether used for liquor or disinfection, both have the same chemical structure and can break apart the virus particle, said Lee Duckhwan, a chemistry professor at Sogang University in Seoul, the capital.
""If there's any difference, that is the liquor tax imposed on ethanol produced by liquor makers,"" Lee said.
The virus fears boosted February sales of soaps and hand sanitizers, including those with an alcohol base, to four times the level a year ago, data from a major retailer Lotte Mart shows. Shares of ethanol producers also jumped.
Following Daesun Distilling, Hallasan Soju, based on the resort island of Jeju, also provided 5 tonnes of ethanol to authorities on Tuesday, a company official said."

SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea reported hundreds of new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as many sick people waited for hospital beds in Daegu, the city at the center of the worst outbreak outside China.
The new cases bring South Korea's total to 5,621, with at least 32 deaths, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) said. 
Most cases were in and around Daegu, the country's fourth-largest city, where the flu-like virus has spread rapidly through members of a fringe Christian group.
Health officials expect the number of new cases to be high for the near future as they complete the testing of more than 200,000 members of the sect, as well as thousands of other suspected cases from smaller clusters.
""We need special measures in times of emergency,"" South Korean Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun told a cabinet meeting, referring to extra medical resources for hotspots and economic measures including a $9.8 billion stimulus.
""In order to overcome COVID-19 as quickly as possible and minimize the impact on the economy, it is necessary to proactively inject all available resources.""
COVID-19 is the illness caused by the new coronavirus which emerged from China late last year to spread around the world.
Hospitals in South Korea's hardest hit areas were scrambling to accommodate the surge in new patients.
In Daegu, 2,300 people were waiting to be admitted to hospitals and temporary medical facilities, Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said. A 100-bed military hospital that had been handling many of the most serious cases was due to have 200 additional beds available by Thursday, he added.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday declared ""war"" on the virus, apologized for shortages of face masks and promised support for virus-hit small businesses in Asia's fourth-biggest economy.
TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS
Moon's office on Wednesday said he had canceled a planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, Egypt and Turkey in mid-March due to the crisis.
At least 92 countries have imposed some form of entry restrictions on arrivals from South Korea, according to a tally by Yonhap news agency.
Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young met the U.S. ambassador on Wednesday as part of Seoul's efforts to prevent the United States from imposing restrictions.
In the meeting, Cho outlined South Korea's efforts to control the outbreak and urged the United States not to take steps that would affect exchanges between the two countries, the foreign ministry said.
U.S. President Donald Trump said this week his administration was watching Italy, South Korea and Japan - all with severe outbreaks - and would make a decision about travel restrictions ""at the right time"".
""We remain confident in the South Korean government’s robust and comprehensive response efforts to limit the spread of the virus,"" U.S. ambassador Harry Harris tweeted after meeting Cho. 
Up to 10,000 people are being tested each day in South Korea, and daily totals have decreased slightly since a peak of 909 new cases on Saturday, the KCDC said.

Experts caution that the results of those tests could take some time to be processed, leading to future spikes in confirmed cases.

Nearly six years after pulling out of the dialogue, the Barisan Revolusi Nasional (BRN) resumed talks with the government in January, when the first meeting was also held in the Malaysian capital.
""The overall atmosphere of the meeting was constructive,"" Thailand's Peace Dialogue Panel said in a statement.
""The meeting also began discussing topics of substantive issues including the reduction of violence.""
The BRN has not respond to Reuters request for comment.
Some 7,000 people have been killed during past 15 years as a result of the insurgency in the Malay-speaking, largely Muslim region of predominantly Buddhist Thailand.
The conflict has flared on and off for decades as insurgent groups like the BRN continued a guerrilla war to demand independence for Yala, Pattani and Narathiwat provinces.
The area was part of an independent Malay sultanate before they were annexed by the Thais in 1909.
BRN was among several insurgent groups that had joined formal peace talks, only to pull out after the government was toppled in a military coup in 2014.
The military junta resumed talks with other insurgent groups two years later but the BRN did not join that process, which stalled in 2018."

Ashmawy, a former Egyptian special forces officer, led the Sinai-based Ansar Bayt al-Maqdis, Egypt's most active militant group, before it pledged allegiance to Islamic State in 2014.
He then moved with a group of followers to Egypt's Western Desert, later crossing the border to Libya to join the al Qaeda-linked Ansar al-Sharia, according to Egyptian officials.
He was captured in the east Libyan city of Derna in late 2018 and transferred to Egypt in May 2019.
Ashmawy was convicted on several charges including plotting a 2014 attack that killed 22 military guards, and the attempted assassination of a former interior minister in 2013.
Military and civilian courts had sentenced him to death before and after his extradition.
Egypt's military spokesman posted a picture of Ashmawy with a thick beard dressed in orange prison overalls on Twitter. ""This morning the death penalty was carried out on the terrorist Hisham al-Ashmawy,"" he wrote.
Local media including the state newspaper al-Ahram as well as security sources had said last week that Ashmawy had been executed, though the news websites later took down their reports."

SEOUL (Reuters) - Relieved foreign diplomats in North Korea were finally getting out of their compounds this week after the end of a month-long quarantine over the coronavirus outbreak.
""I have never been happier standing on Kim Il Sung Square (NYSE:SQ),"" Sweden's ambassador Joachim Bergstrom tweeted next to a photo of himself at the plaza in the capital Pyongyang.
Russia's embassy confirmed diplomats and their families were allowed out from March 2 to visit a handful of approved locations, including several stores, after authorities had ordered them to stay in their buildings for a month.
They also had to obtain certificates from doctors to prove they were free of the coronavirus, the embassy said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
Authoritarian North Korea has not confirmed any cases of the flu-like disease, which originated in neighboring China, but imposed a month of quarantine for anyone showing symptoms plus for many foreigners in the country.
""Thank God!"" an Indonesian embassy employee wrote on Instagram next to a photo of his medical certificate.
North Korea's state media says ""high-intensity"" measures are in place to prevent coronavirus infections, including reinforced border checks, and the suspension of most air and rail travel within and out of the country.
Earlier this week, Chinese state television said North Korea would soon charter a flight from Pyongyang to Russia's Vladivostok for any foreigners wanting to leave."

A document dated Feb. 27 addressed to all agencies and state-owned firms signed by Duterte's Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea said the suspension on loan and grant negotiations was being lifted.
The document did not provide an explanation nor did Medialdea immediately respond to a request for comment.
The U.N. Human Rights Council approved a resolution in July backed by 18 countries to compile a report on Duterte's drugs crackdown, launched after he was elected in 2016 on a platform of crushing crime.
The government says at least 5,600 people have been killed in what police say were shootouts with dealers resisting arrest while activists say the toll is far higher.
Duterte ordered a halt on loans from the 18 countries on Aug. 27, ""pending the assessment of our relations with these countries"".
It was not clear which loans were involved, nor their size, though the government said then that none covered infrastructure projects so the suspension would not have a significant impact on the economy. It also said loans already being implemented would not be affected.
Countries on the 47-member human rights council that voted in favor of the investigation resolution include Australia, Denmark, Iceland, Spain, Ukraine and the United Kingdom.
Duterte has more than once taken a stand against the international community over perceived criticism of his anti-narcotics campaign.
He once threatened to pull the Philippines out of the United Nations and he unilaterally withdrew the country from the International Criminal Court after it said it was conducting a preliminary examination into alleged crimes against humanity."

KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - On trial for corruption that includes the multi-billion dollar 1MDB fraud, former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak said on Wednesday that the fall of the government that ousted him meant he now expected an atmosphere more conducive to a fair hearing.
Najib was voted out in 2018 amid anger over corruption in the Southeast Asian country, but the alliance that toppled him fell apart at the weekend amid turmoil following the resignation of 94-year-old Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
Najib, 66, denies the charges against him and says they were politically motivated. 
Mahathir has accused Najib's United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) of engineering a return to power so that its officials escape conviction in the 1MDB scandal.
When he took power for a second time two years ago, Mahathir accused https://www.reuters.com/article/us-malaysia-politics-mahathir/exclusive-malaysia-seeks-to-lay-multiple-charges-against-ex-premier-najib-over-1mdb-mahathir-idUSKBN1JF100 Najib of playing a central role in the 1MDB scandal.
""I would expect that the atmosphere would be more conducive towards a fair trial,"" Najib told Reuters in an interview at his mansion in an affluent neighborhood of Kuala Lumpur before heading to his latest court appearance.
""I'm not alluding to anything, because there's no conclusion to the trial... But hopefully, you know, I will get a fair trial,"" he said. 
New Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's office did not respond to a request for comment.
Najib is facing five trials over the 1MDB scandal that stretched from Malaysia to the Middle East to Hollywood.
BILLIONS MISSING
The U.S. Department of Justice estimates $4.5 billion was misappropriated from the 1MDB sovereign fund between 2009 and 2014. U.S. and Malaysian authorities say over $1 billion stolen from 1MDB flowed into Najib's personal accounts.
Najib says he was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials, and that he will clear his name in court.
""I don't want any undue manipulation or pressure put on the judge or judges for political reasons. And on the strength of the evidence, I'm more than happy to go through the court process,"" he said, speaking in his spacious living room decked with gilt and crystal ornaments and giant arrangements of brightly colored artificial flowers as well as family photos.
Malaysia has also accused Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) of misleading investors over bond sales totaling $6.5 billion that the bank helped raise for 1MDB. Three units of the bank have pleaded not guilty.
Najib criticized the investment bank, saying Goldman had been part of a system meant to safeguard Malaysian interests.
Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
Najib, an UMNO member of parliament, said he had not been directly involved in the deal between his party and some of Mahathir's allies that led to Mahathir's fall, but he had been consulted about terms of the agreement.
STRAINED RELATIONS
Mahathir was replaced by his former ally Muhyiddin, who was himself sacked by Najib in 2015 after criticizing his handling of 1MDB.
Najib said he had not spoken to Muhyiddin since he took office but he hoped to rebuild their relationship.
""I hope it's water under the bridge,"" he said, citing the example of the alliance between Mahathir and his old rival Anwar Ibrahim, which won the 2018 election.
""Quite apart from jailing Anwar Ibrahim, his disparaging remarks about Anwar's character over the years didn't stop them from getting together,"" Najib said of Mahathir.
Najib, looking relaxed in a light beige suit and open white shirt, said he was not seeking a government post for now. He said the trial had strained his family, including his wife Rosmah Mansor, also on trial for corruption.
Away from court, Najib said he was meeting people around Malaysia and developing a more down-to-earth profile than was possible when he held the office that his father also once held.
He was also busy on social media, where he has the biggest following of any Malaysian politician.

""You know, last week my Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) attracted 20 million engagements. Normally I get about 9.5 million a week,"" Najib said. ""And in terms of likes, I'm about 6,000 away from reaching 4 million. So, I mean, those are the figures, but I don't shout about them.""

1627,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 04, 2020 04:03AM ET</span>",Russia says rebel positions in Syria's Idlib have merged with Turkish army posts,"MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia's Ministry of Defence said on Wednesday that fortified rebel positions in Syria's Idlib province had merged with Turkish observation posts, and that artillery attacks on nearby civilian areas and Russia's air base in Syria had become daily.
The allegations, made by Major-General Igor Konashenkov, are likely to increase tensions ahead of a planned meeting on Syria in Moscow on Thursday between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Tayyip Erdogan. 
Ties between Moscow and Ankara have come under severe strain in recent days since 34 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike in Idlib, the deadliest attack on the Turkish army in nearly 30 years. 
Turkey has responded by stepping up its attacks on Syrian government forces, while Russian military police have helped to secure a strategic town that Syrian government forces recaptured from rebels they are trying to oust from Idlib. 
Moscow has long backed President Bashar al-Assad in his nine-year-old war against rebels. 
Konashenkov, in his statement, accused Turkey of failing to meet its obligations under agreements on Idlib with Moscow, and of helping anti-Assad rebel forces instead.
He said Turkey had poured enough troops into Idlib to make up a mechanized division, said Konashenkov, violating international law.

There was no immediate response from Turkey, which has traded blame with Moscow over the upsurge in violence in Idlib.

Escalating military action in Syria's northern Idlib region, where Russia is backing an offensive by President Bashar al-Assad's army and Turkey is supporting rebels, risks direct confrontation between the two major foreign powers.
German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told RTL/n-tv private television that Germany had broad commercial ties with Russia and had already used sanctions in the Ukrainian conflict to show that Russia cannot get away with everything.
""And this is the question now which also needs to be raised regarding Syria,"" she said, noting that Germany must show Russia that ""we are pretty much aware of what it is doing in Syria.""
Russia's support for Syria's armed forces has been instrumental in turning the war in favor of Assad.
Kramp-Karrenbauer repeated her proposal to set up safety zones in north Syria to protect civilians, adding that German Chancellor Angela Merkel was trying to convince Putin to support that. One million people have fled recent fighting in Idlib.
If all relevant players in the region backed the creation of such safety zones, German and other European forces could be asked to protect those areas, the German minister added.
But the most realistic scenario was a safety zone in which the United Nations and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) would be in charge, she said.
Turkey's President Tayyip Erdogan and Russia's Putin were due to meet on Thursday to seek ways to stop the fighting.
Germany, Europe's largest economy, accounts for about 10% of Russia's imports and is also an important export market, mainly for Russia's natural gas and oil."

TOKYO (Reuters) - Decommissioning work at Japan's crippled Fukushima nuclear power station, halted during a G7 summit in Japan in 2016, will not stop during this summer's Tokyo Olympics, the plant operator said.
There are about a third fewer workers now - 4,000 compared with 6,000 in 2016 - which makes the decision to keep working easier, said Akira Ono, Tokyo Electric Power Co's (Tepco) chief decommissioning officer.
""When I was the plant manager, I suspended operations at the time of the Ise-Shima summit. But the situation is totally different now,"" Ono told Reuters in an interview.
Although the coronavirus outbreak - which has sickened more than 1,000 Japanese - has disrupted supply chains, there has been no shortage of protective gear at the plant, he added. Workers must wear special clothing to protect them from residual radiation in some parts of the facility.
""There was a time when coverall supply became quite tight ... But after talking with various sources, we are now sure that we can procure what we need,"" Ono said in the interview conducted on Tuesday but embargoed till Wednesday.
A powerful earthquake and tsunami hit eastern Japan in March 2011 and knocked out cooling systems at Tepco's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, triggering the worst nuclear accident since Chernobyl in 1986.
Since then, the operator has been working to clean up the damage and contain any spread of radiation.
For the last nine years, Tepco has been pouring water over melted reactor cores to keep them cool. Nearly 1.2 million tonnes of tainted water, enough to fill 480 Olympic-sized swimming pools, is stored at the plant. The company treats the water to remove most radioactive material.
A government panel reviewing potential disposal methods has recommended releasing the water into the sea after dilution. Local residents, fishermen in particular, strongly oppose the ocean discharge.
Ono said that the plant will likely run out of tank space by summer 2022.
""The time is getting near,"" Ono said, referring to a decision on the disposal method. ""We are cutting it very close.""
Japanese trade and industry minister Hiroshi Kajiyama said last month the government would decide after hearing opinions from people in local communities and others, without committing to a deadline."

A lone gunman used a semi-automatic gun to kill worshippers gathered for Friday prayers at two mosques in the city of Christchurch on March 15 last year in New Zealand's worst peace-time shooting.
The attack prompted the government to tighten gun laws and raised questions about the country's image as a peaceful, law-abiding society.
Police said they had increased patrols around the Al Noor and Linwood mosques, the two places targeted in the attack, and would be maintaining a visible presence in the community.
The patrols come after a new threat against the Al Noor mosque emerged this week, media reported.
A picture of a man standing outside the mosque wearing a balaclava with a threat against worshippers was flagged by the community this week, media said.
Police confirmed they had been notified of the image and said it had been referred to the chief censor for consideration as to whether it should be classified as objectionable material.
""Police are aware that a number of people have been sharing an image featuring Al Noor mosque, originally published on social media,"" Canterbury District Commander John Price said in a statement.
""The further sharing of this image is causing significant distress and anxiety for members of our community. This type of imagery has no place in Aotearoa New Zealand,"" he said.
Price said police had searched a Christchurch property and were speaking to a 19-year-old man in relation to the reported threat against the mosque.
Australian Brenton Tarrant, a suspected white supremacist, has been charged with last year's attack and faces trial in June. He has pleaded not guilty to 92 charges.

Events to mark the anniversary have been planned for March 15 in Christchurch with senior government leaders and community members expected to attend.

Muhyiddin was sworn in on Sunday after a week of political turmoil triggered by the abrupt resignation of 94-year-old Mahathir Mohamad.
King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah appointed Muhyiddin as the prime minister, saying he believed Muhyiddin possibly had the support of a majority in parliament.
But Mahathir's coalition has said they have the majority and vowed to bring a confidence vote in parliament when it reconvened on March 9. 
Speaker Mohamad Ariff Md. Yusof said in a statement that he has received a letter from Muhyiddin stating the session will instead start on May 18. 
Muhyiddin, a former interior minister in Mahathir's cabinet, joined hands with the UMNO party - which lost federal power in the 2018 election - and Islamist party PAS to form a new coalition.
His move came after the resignation of Mahathir, who then tried out to form a national unity government that would have given him greater powers but got little support from politicians. 

Mahathir went back to partner with his old rival Anwar Ibrahim to stop Muhyiddin but the king's decision to appoint the latter put an end to the efforts.

YANGON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - From a boat on the Salween River in southeastern Myanmar, Than Zaw Oo pointed to a brown stretch of water he said was once full of lush paddy fields.
""This used to be my land,"" said the 51-year-old farmer, frowning at the murky waves. 
All but six of the 24 acres where he used to grow rice and vegetables have slipped into the water in recent years, he said. Another farmer, Than Tun, said he had lost 15 acres of his land to erosion. While official records were not available, other villagers backed their accounts.
Farmers and politicians in Chaungzon township, just outside the southern town of Moulmein, worry that erosion in the area is being exacerbated by the ships that dredge its bed for sand each night. The sand is mainly bound for Singapore, the world's biggest importer, for use in reclamation and construction projects.
Both the Myanmar government and the company whose ships do the dredging in Chaungzon deny the dredging is causing the erosion. But the dispute highlights the fractious issue of sand-mining in Southeast Asia as Singapore is forced to look farther afield to slake its thirst for the mineral following bans on the trade in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia over environmental concerns.
Sand mining has been blamed by scientists for damaging sensitive ecosystems around the world, accelerating coastal and riverine erosion, and exacerbating the frequency and severity of floods and droughts, according to a 2019 report by the U.N Environment Programme.
Malaysia, formerly the biggest source of sand for Singapore, in 2018 introduced an outright ban on the export of sea sand, used for land reclamation, and imposed tighter controls on river sand, used mostly in construction.
Cambodia made a similar move in 2017, while Indonesia banned exports to Singapore in 2007, causing a ""sand crisis"" that brought building activity almost to a halt. Singapore, an island state that has grown 25 percent since its independence in 1965 thanks largely to aggressive land reclamation, has since bolstered its stockpiles, according to sand traders.
Officials in Myanmar and industry sources in Singapore say the bans have prompted Singapore to seek new supplies from countries like Myanmar.
Almost 1 million tonnes of sand went from Myanmar to Singapore in 2018, earning over $6 million, according to the most recent UN data on the trade. That amount is expected to have increased substantially following the Malaysia bans, according to the Myanmar government.
""Since the Philippines, Cambodia, and Vietnam almost completely stopped exporting sand to Singapore, the sand from Myanmar has become much more in demand,"" said Aye Lwin, joint secretary-general of the Myanmar Port Authority, which grants licenses for sand-mining operations.
The benefits of the mining – including tax revenues for the government – outweighed the costs, he said.
""I believe it only causes little environmental damage,"" Aye Lwin said. ""But it generates funds for the government.""
'AN EASY TARGET’
The Singapore-registered company dredging in Chaungzon, Starhigh Asia Pacific Pte Ltd., has extracted hundreds of thousands of tonnes of sand since 2013, according to the local member of Parliament, Kyi Kyi Mya. She said at least 150,000 tonnes were extracted in 2018-2019, but did not have the exact number for other years.
Starhigh dredges the sand legally through a license with the local government that does not limit the amount of sand the company can extract.
Most of the sand Starhigh extracts is sent to Singapore. The company last year bid to supply sand to JTC Corporation, a Singapore government agency for infrastructure development, according to a tender on a government procurement site.
Starhigh also supplied sand for a JTC reclamation project in Singapore completed in 2018, according to Starhigh's managing director, Si Thu Phyo. He said the sand for that project came from Myanmar as well as Vietnam and the Philippines.
JTC referred questions from Reuters to Singapore's Ministry of National Development, which said the country imports sand on a commercial basis and that suppliers are expected to abide by laws and regulations in source countries.
The Myanmar government says the environmental impact of the dredging is minimal and necessary to clear waterways of built-up sediment.
In 2014, the company paid compensation to local farmers who claimed that mining too close to the shore had led to landslides, according to Kyi Kyi Mya, the MP in Chaungzon.
Starhigh did not comment on any compensation paid to farmers but said ""whenever it is possible, we will help locals with small landfill work at our own cost.""
Si Thu Phyo, the Starhigh managing director, told Reuters that erosion was present in the area before dredging work started.
""Dredging is always an easy target when it comes to environmental complaints,"" he said. ""People don't understand and are worried.""
SECRETIVE INDUSTRY
Riverbank erosion along the Salween is not an entirely new phenomenon, with factors including climate change worsening the problem by contributing to higher levels of flooding and siltation, said Vanessa Lamb, a geography lecturer at the University of Melbourne who has studied the river.
She said that a lack of baseline data about the river made it difficult to track just how much sand dredging was affecting riverbank erosion. But in a 2019 research paper, Lamb said locals blamed accelerating erosion on the rise in sand-mining. It was not possible to verify those claims from local records or old photographs.
Dr Aung Naing Oo, deputy speaker of the Mon state parliament and the author of a parliamentary report on sand extraction in the region, said there was little transparency around the industry.
He said that there was no consistent monitoring process and that authorities were not checking how much sand was being extracted or whether companies were taking material only from agreed sites.
For now, the government says it does not have plans to end the dredging or compensate farmers for lost land.
Than Zaw Oo, the farmer in Chaungzon, said he is now in debt after borrowing more than $2,600 to pay for embankments in an attempt to keep erosion at bay.

""I am lost and I don't know what to do,"" he said. ""The sadness is just beyond words.""

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two Vatican officials charged with investigating accusations of sexual abuse by clergy will visit Mexico for a fact-finding mission later this month, the Church said on Tuesday.
Archbishop Charles Scicluna and Monsignor Jordi Bertomeu will meet with church leaders and alleged victims during their week-long visit to the world's second largest Roman Catholic country, the Mexican bishops' conference said.
Auxiliary Bishop Alfonso Miranda Guardiola, general secretary of the bishops' conference, told a news conference in Mexico City that the Church had requested aid from the Vatican in order to help the youngest and most vulnerable in Mexico.
""We're confident it will improve the response to these cases, looking for civil and canonical justice under the principles of zero tolerance, so that no case goes unpunished in our Church,"" Miranda said of the March 20-27 visit.
Scicluna and Bertomeu are part of a taskforce created last year by Pope Francis to assist in countries where the Church had no guidance for dealing with sexual abuse cases.
The two led the Vatican's 2018 investigation into sexual abuse in Chile, producing a 2,300-page report that sparked the resignation of several of the country's top bishops.
Scicluna also conducted the Vatican's investigation into Father Marcial Maciel, the late founder of Mexico's Legionaries of Christ Catholic religious order. Maciel was accused of sexually abusing at least 60 boys, some as young as 12.
Allegations of pedophilia have long plagued the Church in Mexico.
Archbishop Rogelio Cabrera Lopez, President of the Mexican bishops conference, said 271 Mexican priests have been accused of sexual abuse to date.
The bishops' conference said it does not have an estimate of the number of victims. Advocates say there are many more victims than those who have come forward with accusations.
Some expressed reservations about the Vatican's fact-finding mission.
Alberto Athie, a former Mexican priest who has spent more than two decades campaigning on behalf of victims of Church abuse, criticized previous missions for lacking transparency. 

""They have tried to handle these things internally, in secret, and resolve them according to the institutional logic of the Church,"" he told Reuters.

(Reuters) - Three more deaths from the coronavirus were reported by Washington state on Tuesday as the nation's largest and only fatal outbreak of the respiratory disease reached beyond the Seattle area in what appeared to be the first known instance of coast-to-coast transmission.
A North Carolina resident tested positive after returning from a trip to Washington state, where the individual was exposed, and apparently infected, during a visit to a nursing facility at the center of a recent surge in cases in suburban Seattle.
The total number of people diagnosed with the coronavirus in the greater Seattle area rose to 27 on Tuesday, including nine deaths, up from 18 cases and six deaths tallied on Monday, the state Department of Health reported.
President Donald Trump told reporters his administration may cut off overseas travel from the United States to areas abroad with high rates of coronavirus, but said officials were not weighing any restrictions on domestic travel.
A multibillion-dollar funding bill was moving slowly through Congress after Democrats raised questions about the availability of testing for the new virus.
The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an emergency move designed to shield the world's largest economy from the impact of the coronavirus as Group of Seven finance officials pledged all appropriate policy moves.
The North Carolina diagnosis, the first presumptive positive case announced in that state, was not part of the Seattle-area case cluster, which ranks as the largest concentration detected to date in the United States, and the only one yet to prove deadly.
NURSING HOME OUTBREAK
Eight of those who died in Washington state were in King County and one was in neighboring Snohomish County, officials said.
""This is a very fluid, fast-moving situation as we aggressively respond to this outbreak,"" said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a public health officer for Seattle and King County.
Of the 27 cases documented as of Tuesday, nine of them were connected to a long-term nursing-care facility called LifeCare in the Seattle suburb of Kirkland, according to the Seattle & King County Public Health agency. Five of those who died had been LifeCare residents.
The latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) listed 108 confirmed and presumed cases in the United States. That tally consists of 60 reported by public health authorities in 12 states plus 48 among people repatriated from abroad, most of them from an outbreak aboard the Diamond Princess cruise liner in Japan.
The number of U.S. cases beyond the repatriated patients has mushroomed from just 15 reported by the CDC on Friday, as the first handful of infections believed to have emerged from community transmission were detected in the Pacific Northwest. Before that, all U.S. cases were deemed travel-related, essentially imported from abroad.
In New York, a man in his 50s who lives in a New York City suburb and works at a Manhattan law firm tested positive for the virus, bringing the number of confirmed cases in that state to two, New York officials said.
He has severe pneumonia and is hospitalized, officials said. The patient had not traveled to countries hardest hit in the coronavirus outbreak, which began in China in December and is now present in nearly 80 countries and territories, killing more than 3,000 people.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio said confirmation of the case was made by the city's public health laboratory on its first day of testing.
FUNDING DISPUTE
Previously, all testing was conducted by the CDC, creating a delay of several days before the result was known. U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn told Congress that testing kits should be available by the end of the week that would give labs the capacity to perform about 1 million coronavirus tests.
Trump said his administration was working with Congress to pass an emergency spending measure, adding that he expected lawmakers to authorize about $8.5 billion.
Senate Democrats said a dispute with Republicans over the affordability of coronavirus tests and vaccinations were holding up agreement on a funding bill.
Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Vice President Mike Pence, who heads the government's coronavirus task force, was unable to answer ""vital questions"" about the availability of tests during a 45-minute meeting.

MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Activist Arussi Unda knew many across Mexico shared her fury over violence against women and impunity for the perpetrators, but she was still surprised when her vision of women staging a national one-day strike took off beyond her home state.
In many towns and cities, women next Monday will skip school, work and other activities to show how public life looks without them, delivering a critique of the violence that has led to a surge in femicides, or gender-motivated killings of women.
""It's like a Cinderella story,"" Unda told Reuters, marveling at how her obscure 15-member feminist collective Brujas del Mar (""Witches of the Sea"") had suddenly been thrust into the national spotlight by the protest it helped inspire.
""This is like the lost village, the tiny collective, the nobody women ... but sooner or later, it was going to happen,"" said Unda, whose group in the eastern state of Veracruz lives off its own funds, plus sales of bandannas and key chains.
Femicides in Mexico jumped 137% in the past five years, according to Mexican government statistics, as gang violence pushed the national murder tally to record heights. Most violent crimes go unsolved.
In Veracruz, one of the main battlegrounds of warring drug cartels, femicides leapt almost 300% to 159 in 2019, fueling the indignation of women's advocacy groups.
""Women in Mexico are fed up,"" said Unda, 32, the spokeswoman for Brujas del Mar, which became known in Mexico late last year for its advocacy of abortion rights.
""It's not just the obvious crisis of femicides in Mexico but also what happens every day at home, at school, at work. There's no place that is safe for us.""
Notorious cases including the recent kidnapping and killing of a young girl, and the newspaper publication of photos of a 25-year-old woman's mutilated corpse, have pushed the strike known as ""a day without us"" to the center of national politics.
Support for next Monday's protest, one day after International Women's Day, has cut across a swath of society from companies and universities right up to government ministries.
President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has said government employees are free to join the walkout. But he has also accused political opponents of seeking to exploit the country's security problems to undermine his administration.
Unda dismissed his comments as a macho and condescending attitude toward the organizers.
""So, we're stupid, or what?"" she said."

Rocket fire and shelling towards the airport ramped up late last week as a United Nations effort to bring the warring sides together in Geneva failed to make headway. On Monday, the U.N. special envoy Ghassan Salame said he was resigning.
The latest bout in Libya's violence since the 2011 uprising that overthrew longtime ruler Muammar Gaddafi began last year, when the eastern-based military commander Khalifa Haftar launched a push to capture the capital.
Haftar's forces are backed by the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, while the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA) is supported by Turkey, which sent forces this year.
Mitiga airport has been closed by rocket fire repeatedly in recent days and flights were suspended for much of Tuesday, with a military source in the eastern forces saying Turkish installations there were being targeted.
On Sunday, the GNA's Interior Minister Fathi Bashagha told Reuters it would soon shift from defense to attack in order to push Haftar's forces further from the capital."
1639,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 05:49PM ET</span>",Trump tells Sisi U.S. to pursue efforts for deal on Ethiopia dam: Egypt presidency,"CAIRO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump told Egyptian counterpart Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi on Tuesday that Washington will keep up efforts for a deal among Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over a dam Ethiopia is building on the Nile, Egypt's presidency said.
The three countries had expected to sign an accord in Washington last week on the filling and operation of the $4 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD), but Ethiopia skipped the meeting and only Egypt has initialed the deal thus far.
""President Trump emphasized that the U.S. administration will keep up tireless efforts and coordination with Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia over this vital issue until the three countries sign an agreement over the Renaissance Dam,"" the Egyptian presidency said in a statement.
In its own statement on the phone conversation, the White House said Trump ""expressed hope that an agreement on the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam would be finalised soon and benefit all parties involved."" 
Sisi told Trump that Cairo would continue ""giving this issue the utmost attention in defense of the interests of the Egyptian people, their capabilities and their future,"" the Egyptian presidency added.
The dam is the centerpiece in Ethiopia's ambition to become Africa's biggest power exporter. But it has sparked fears in Cairo that Egypt's already scarce supplies of Nile river water, on which its population of more than 100 million people is almost entirely dependent, would be further restricted.
Egypt - a largely desert country - is short of water. It imports about half its food products and recycles about 25 billion cubic meters of water annually.
Ethiopia, which announced the dam project in 2011 as Egypt was beset by political upheaval, denies the dam will undermine Egypt's access to water.
The dam is under construction near Ethiopia's border with Sudan on the Blue Nile, which flows into the Nile river. Egypt and Ethiopia have been at odds over how quickly the reservoir behind the giant dam can be filled and how much water Ethiopia should promise to release.
U.S. MEDIATION
The United States has hosted several rounds of talks in Washington with ministers from the three regional powers and the World Bank after years of trilateral negotiations failed.
""We have been trying to bring the parties together. They have made enormous progress. We were incredibly disappointed that Ethiopia didn't show up for the last meeting,"" U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told a hearing of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee on Tuesday.
""It is an important issue for the entire region. It is obviously a grave concern - there are safety concerns, there are water concerns,"" Mnuchin said.
Ethiopia has said it needs more time for deliberations. It says outstanding issues concerning the dam's operation and the filling of its reservoir have yet to be addressed, but that it can commence filling in parallel with construction of the dam.
""The U.S. statement that says Ethiopia shouldn't start filling the dam without reaching an agreement is diplomatically incorrect and we think it is wrong and we expect the U.S. to correct this statement,"" Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew told reporters on Tuesday.
Egypt accused Ethiopia on Sunday of ""deliberately"" not attending the last round of talks in Washington last week ""to hinder the path of negotiations""."
1640,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 05:26PM ET</span>","Trump, Taliban leader talk as prisoner feud threatens Afghan peace","By Charlotte Greenfield and Jonathan Landay
KABUL/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke by telephone with chief Taliban negotiator Mullah Baradar Akhund on Tuesday, the first known conversation between a U.S. leader and a top Taliban official, as a dispute over a prisoner release threatened a U.S.-led effort to bring peace to Afghanistan.
The call, announced on Twitter by a Taliban spokesman and then confirmed by Trump, came three days after Baradar and U.S. Special Envoy Zalmay Khalilzad signed an agreement in Qatar for a withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan.
That deal, a step toward ending America's longest war, could boost Trump's bid for a second term in the Nov. 3 U.S. election. Trump has made a troop withdrawal from Afghanistan a priority. 
The pact calls for a phased withdrawal of U.S.-led foreign forces if the Taliban keeps its commitments and for the March 10 start of talks between the insurgents and an Afghan delegation on a political settlement to end decades of conflict.
But the peace effort quickly hit an obstacle, with Afghan President Ashraf Ghani refusing to implement a part of the accord – to which his government was not a party - providing for the release of up to 5,000 Taliban prisoners.
Ghani said the issue should be negotiated, but the Taliban demanded about 5,000 prisoners go free before peace talks begin.
In a statement on the 35-minute Trump-Baradar conversation, Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid suggested Baradar gave no ground on the issue.
""Baradar said to Trump, 'It is the inherent right of the Afghans that all the points of this agreement are implemented as soon as possible so that peace may come to Afghanistan,'"" Mujahid said.
In an apparent reference to Ghani, Mujahid quoted Baradar as telling Trump, ""Don’t let anyone act against the signed agreement and keep you involved in the prolonged war."" 
Trump told Baradar he would soon have U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speak to Ghani ""so that the barriers against the inter-Afghan talks get removed,"" Mujahid said.
'VERY GOOD' RELATIONSHIP WITH MULLAH
Speaking with reporters, Trump gave few details of the discussion but said he had a good relationship with Baradar.
""We had a very good conversation with the leader of the Taliban today. They're looking to get this ended, and we're looking to get it ended... the relationship is very good that I have with the Mullah. We had a good, long conversation today."" 
Trump declined to say if the call was his first with Baradar, a co-founder of the Taliban and its political chief. Pakistan released Baradar from prison in October 2018 to lead the Taliban negotiating team.
The call was the first known conversation between a U.S. president and a leader of the insurgent group overthrown in the 2001 U.S.-led invasion for harboring al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden while he plotted the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.
James Dobbins, a former U.S. special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, said he was confident no prior U.S. president had such contact, which he chalked up to Trump's ""showmanship.""
""Talking to the president is … a major deliverable. Prior administrations would consider this selling one’s self cheaply, or selling a considerable asset at considerably below value,"" said Dobbins, a retired veteran U.S. diplomat.
More than 2,500 U.S. troops have died in Afghanistan and more than 20,660 have been wounded, according to iCasualties, a website that tracks foreign troop casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Trump in September scotched a first bid to finalize a U.S.-Taliban troop withdrawal deal, citing a U.S. soldier's death in a Taliban attack. Talks resumed in December and the pact was signed on Saturday after a seven-day reduction in violence.

BISSAU (Reuters) - A dozen soldiers have occupied the grounds of Guinea-Bissau's Supreme Court, the court said on Tuesday, deepening a post-election crisis that has resulted in the appointment of rival presidents and the silencing of state media.
The West African country's military, which has regularly intervened in politics in recent decades, vowed to remain neutral ahead of the December election. But the presence last week of senior army officials at the contentious inauguration of Umaro Cissoko Embalo as president appeared to signal it had picked a side.
The electoral commission has repeatedly confirmed Embalo as the winner of the Dec. 29 run-off despite complaints by the Supreme Court and the declared runner-up that the commission had not respected the court's orders to conduct a full audit of the vote.
On Monday, soldiers occupied the Supreme Court's grounds of in Bissau, the capital, blocking entry to judges and officials, court spokesman Salimo Vieira told Reuters.
""The soldiers are still refusing entry to the Supreme Court, which cannot function,"" he said, adding that other courts had also been occupied by the military.
State radio has been silent and the state television channel has shown only a blank screen since Feb. 29. Streets in Bissau have remained quiet.
An Embalo representative, Bamba Cote, said Embalo had asked the army chief of staff for troops to occupy ""public institutions as well as radio and TV stations in order to enable the formation of the new cabinet and its installation in the state institutions.""
The soldiers will return to their barracks on Wednesday or Thursday, Cote told Reuters.
Domingos Simoes Pereira, candidate of the majority party in parliament and shown by the official results as losing the run-off to Embalo, has denounced his rival's inauguration as a coup.
In the ongoing standoff, Pereira's allies in parliament had appointed the speaker as a rival interim president after Embalo's inauguration. The speaker, Cipriano Cassama, withdrew his claim to the presidency on Sunday, citing the risk of civil war.
Guinea-Bissau has witnessed nine coups or attempted coups since independence from Portugal in 1974, most recently in 2012 when an election was abandoned after soldiers stormed the presidential palace.
In a statement on Sunday, West African regional bloc ECOWAS said Embalo's inauguration had taken place ""outside legal and constitutional frameworks"" and warned about ""the interference of the defense and security forces in the political sphere"".
The December election was meant to end five years of institutional chaos in which then-President Jose Mario Vaz cycled through seven different prime ministers during a series of political disputes.
""The military seem to be trying to give the final word on things,"" said analyst Vincent Foucher of the French National Center for Scientific Research. ""It's clear whose side the army is on."""

LAGOS (Reuters) - No women were arrested in a 2018 police raid that led 47 Nigerian men to be charged with displays of affection with members of the same sex, a witness said on Tuesday, in a case that tests a law criminalising homosexuality in Africa's most populous country.
In November the men pleaded not guilty to the offence which carries a 10-year jail term and resulted from legislation introduced by former Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan in 2014.
No one has yet been convicted under the law, which targets same-sex unions with prison terms of up to 14 years, prosecution and defense lawyers in the case have told Reuters.
Police said the men were being ""initiated"" into a gay club at the Kelly Ann hotel in the southwestern commercial capital of Lagos in August 2018. However, the accused said they were attending a birthday party.
Among the contentious points in the case are whether some women were also arrested during the raid but later released, which according to human rights campaigners would suggest that men were unfairly singled out by police.
Oke Olufunmilayo, a senior policeman called as a witness by the prosecution, told the court on Tuesday he led a team of officers in the raid around four hours after receiving a call from police headquarters that a ""gay initiation"" would be held at the hotel.
He said around 100 men fled a hall when police arrived, many of whom climbed over a fence.
Olufunmilayo told the court women were not among those arrested.
But the defense lawyer claimed women were present at the event and were arrested, only to be released later. Asked if any women were arrested in the raid, the witness said: ""Not at all.""
The case was adjourned until April 2.
Outside the court one of the defendants, Desmond Onuoha, claimed women were in the hall and among those arrested. ""When we were brought outside, they (police) asked them to go,"" said the 25-year-old cook.
In all, 57 men were arrested in the raid. Arrest warrants were issued for 10 men who failed to appear in court.
Some of the men told Reuters they have been stigmatized as a result of the raid and a televised news conference held by police in which they were identified the day after their arrest."

""I find it offensive that you're telling me that I'm breaking the law and staggering lies,"" Mnuchin said during a hearing held by the U.S. House of Representatives Ways and Means Committee on the Trump administration's fiscal 2021 budget request.
The exchange came after over a year of legal battles between the panel and the Trump administration over the Republican president's tax returns.
Mnuchin told the committee that he was relying on legal counsel and that the issue would be decided by the courts, not Congress.
""This is in the courts and the courts will deal with it,"" he said in an exceptionally testy exchange with Representative Bill Pascrell, a New Jersey Democrat who insisted that U.S. laws require the Treasury to submit documents requested by Congress.
Pascrell said a member of Mnuchin's staff member accused the lawmaker of being ""intemperate"" when he submitted written questions about reports that Mnuchin had provided private tax information about former Vice President Joe Biden to two Senate Republicans.
""Being lectured on civility from someone who works for the president - President Trump - is like taking chivalry lessons from Jack the Ripper,"" Pascrell said. ""It is impossible to be polite to corruption and people who break the law.""
The U.S. Justice Department in June said Mnuchin did not violate the law by refusing to provide Trump's tax returns to Congress because the confidentiality of returns is protected under the law.
Ways and Means Committee Chairman Richard Neal had issued a subpoena demanding the administration turn over six years of Trump's returns.
A federal judge in January put that bid on hold, saying he would wait for a much-anticipated appeals court decision relating to congressional subpoenas before issuing a ruling.
That court handed Trump a major victory last month when it dismissed a Democratic-led congressional panel's lawsuit seeking to enforce a subpoena for testimony from former White House Counsel Donald McGahn.

Trump has refused to release his tax returns since he was a presidential candidate in 2016, breaking with a modern tradition set by contenders for the White House from both parties.

(Reuters) - Chinese anti virus firm Qihoo 360 said CIA hackers have spent more than a decade breaking into the Chinese airline industry and other targets, a blunt allegation of American espionage from a Beijing-based firm.
In a brief blog post http://blogs.360.cn/post/APT-C-39_CIA_EN.html published on Monday in English and Chinese, Qihoo said it discovered the spying campaign by comparing samples of malicious software it had discovered against a trove of CIA digital spy tools released by WikiLeaks in 2017.
Qihoo - a major cybersecurity vendor whose research is generally followed for the insight it offers into China's digital security world - said the Central Intelligence Agency had targeted China's aviation and energy sectors, scientific research organizations, internet companies, and government agencies. It added that the hacking of aviation targets might have been aimed at tracking ""important figures' travel itinerary.""
Qihoo published a catalog of intercepted malicious software samples as well as an analysis of their creation times that suggested that whoever devised the tools did so during working hours on the U.S. East Coast.
The CIA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages seeking comment. A message seeking additional comment from Qihoo's chief security officer, Yuejin Du, was not immediately returned after business hours in Beijing.
The United States - like China and other world powers - rarely comments when accused of cyberespionage. There has, however, long been evidence in the public domain - released by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, in the U.S. case, or by U.S. prosecutors and private cybersecurity firms, in China's case - that both countries hack their opponents.
The allegations leveled against Beijing by U.S. companies have for years been laid out in lengthy, data-heavy reports. More recently, Chinese companies have begun doing the same with respect to other foreign hacking groups.
The timing of Qihoo's most recent publication could be related to last month's indictment of four Chinese military hackers over a massive breach at U.S. credit reporting agency Equifax (NYSE:EFX), said Adam Segal, who studies China and cybersecurity issues at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.
He said outing CIA operations publicly could be a way of sending a message to Washington - while at the same time burnishing Qihoo's reputation.
""This is great public relations for them,"" Segal said.
Qihoo's publication is the latest fallout from WikiLeaks' release of CIA hacking tools in 2017.
U.S. prosecutors have accused a disgruntled CIA coder, Joshua Schulte, of handing the digital espionage arsenal to WikiLeaks as revenge for a series of professional setbacks, calling the leak ""instantly devastating."" 
""Years of work and millions of dollars developing those tools went up in smoke,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney David Denton told a jury at Schulte's trial in New York last month, according to a transcript https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6768406-20200204.html#document/p14/a549062 of his remarks.
Schulte denies the allegation, saying he is being unfairly blamed for the breach because of his contentious relationship with his colleagues.

The Manhattan jury in Schulte's case is expected to begin its deliberations Tuesday.

Caputova met with the heads of OLANO's potential coalition partners on Tuesday. ""They expressed readiness to continue talks with the OLANO leader on the creation of a new government,"" she said on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB).
In a fragmented vote on Sunday, OLANO - a politically amorphous, pro-European Union and pro-NATO movement - won 25%, beating center-left Smer, which has dominated Slovakian politics for over a decade into second place with 18.3%.
Support for OLANO, campaigning on a strong anti-graft message, surged in the final weeks of the campaign, rising from less than 6% late last year.
Matovic, 46, will seek to form a four-party coalition.
His prospective partners are: Sme Rodina (We are Family), a socially conservative party that placed third; the liberal SaS (Freedom and Solidarity) party; and the centrist Za Ludi (For the People) of former president Andrej Kiska.
The coalition would hold a clear majority in parliament with 95 of 150 seats, but analysts have said it could be fragile.
Matovic, a lawmaker since 2010 who is known for publicity stunts, calls himself a social conservative and economic liberal but declines to put political labels on his OLANO party.
We are Family has allied with Italy's League party of Matteo Salvini and the National Rally of France's Marine Le Pen on a European level. Its pro-business leader Boris Kollar has said the coalition should avoid legislating on contentious issues like same sex civil partnerships or abortion.
SaS leader Richard Sulik was a part of a government coalition that unseated Smer in 2010 but it fell apart less than two years later when Sulik's faction missed a confidence vote.

KABUL (Reuters) - The Taliban is willing to meet Afghan officials but only on the question of releasing prisoners, the militant group said on Tuesday, as diplomats raised concern that a deadlock over the issue could jeopardize the Afghan peace process.
The prisoner release dispute has emerged as a fresh impediment to peace negotiations between the Islamist insurgents and the Afghan government that are to begin on March 10. 
A prisoner swap arrangement was part of a U.S. troop withdrawal agreement between the United States and the Taliban signed on Saturday.
""The Taliban delegation has not met with the government delegation in Qatar, but authorities responsible for prisoners on both sides could meet to discuss the issue,"" the Taliban's Doha office spokesman, Suhail Shaheen, tweeted. 
The U.S.-Taliban deal says the Afghan government will free up to 5,000 Taliban detainees by March 10. But a U.S.-Afghan declaration commits the Kabul government only to taking part in U.S.-brokered talks on the “feasibility” of such a release.
The Taliban spokesman in Afghanistan, Zabihullah Mujahid, told Reuters the prisoners' release was one of the few important points that took U.S. and Taliban negotiators a long time to agree upon.
But a day after the deal between the Taliban and United States was clinched in Doha, Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said the government of Afghanistan has made no commitment to free 5,000 Taliban prisoners.
The Taliban has said it will not begin talks with the Afghan government as envisaged in the agreement until the prisoner release takes place. 
""Now it is in the agreement and it is up to the U.S. how it fulfils the commitments they made in the agreement. It is not our problem what is in the U.S.-Afghan government joint declaration,"" Mujahid said.
Some Western diplomats have raised concern that the impasse could jeopardize the peace process. 
""If they postpone the talks then we will see a collapse of a deal. (U.S. President Donald) Trump doesn’t want that to happen at this juncture,"" one official who has been overseeing the negotiations for two years in Doha told Reuters.
The Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission expressed concern about the prisoner release matter in a letter to U.S. officials, the Taliban and the Afghan government.
The commission raised a number of questions, including on the record of activity of the individual Taliban prisoners and if they had been charged with carrying out violent crimes against civilian and military targets.

""He's going to stay,"" he added, describing May as a ""first rate"" official.
May has been the official in charge of ""Sembrando Vida,"" an ambitious forestation program focused on Mexico's poorer south intended to provide jobs and support agriculture.
Mexico has also exported the scheme to Central America in a bid to contain migration from the region.
In his resignation letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, May wrote: ""Once the Welfare Minister had unilaterally revoked the faculties required to run the said program, the conditions to remain in charge of it no longer existed.""
Neither May nor the welfare ministry immediately replied to requests for comment.
A source close to May told Reuters that his future would be resolved in meetings during the day.
Separately, a government source said friction had been brewing between May and Albores for months, and that May, a politician from the president's home state of Tabasco, had the support of Lopez Obrador.
Lopez Obrador, in power since December 2018, has dominated the government from his morning news conferences, at times giving policy direction an improvised feel.
That governing style has caused tensions within the administration and prompted some prominent officials to quit.
The most high-level resignation was that of Finance Minister Carlos Urzua, who quit in July 2019 with a letter that shocked markets by citing ""extremism"" in economic policy."

Lebanon is in the throes of an unprecedented economic crisis, the result of long-entrenched corruption and bad governance that have landed the state with one of the world's heaviest public debt burdens.
Hezbollah, a heavily armed Shi'ite group which is backed by Iran and designated a terrorist organization by Washington, is one of the main backers of a new government that has sought technical but not financial aid from the International Monetary Fund.
Long-standing financial backer France said last week it was looking at options to support Lebanon, including through an IMF program if Beirut sought one.
Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah told Reuters the group was against the type of terms typically imposed by the IMF as part of a bailout such as taxes, privatization, reducing the size of the public sector and halting subsidies.
""The position is not toward the Fund as an international financial institution but on the terms offered to Lebanon, because they will lead to a popular revolution,"" he said.
""Our position is against this type of program and not against the Fund as an organization.""
Deputy Hezbollah leader Sheikh Naim Qassem last week said the group was against allowing the IMF to manage the financial crisis, describing the Fund as a U.S. tool to which Lebanon would not submit.
Fadlallah said Lebanon needed a deeply-rooted reform plan that would ""benefit from the experience of the IMF and others"".
France and other countries that have provided Lebanon with financial backing in the past say it must implement long-delayed economic reforms before any support is forthcoming this time.
Based mainly on previous IMF recommendations, any program from the Fund is likely to require Lebanon to agree to measures ranging from increasing taxes to fighting corruption."

BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Union ambassadors voiced outrage at a meeting this week over what they see as an attempt by Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan to ""blackmail"" the bloc by allowing migrants to mass at Greece's border, diplomatic sources said.
Some envoys conceded, however, that Erdogan has the EU in a bind because its member states cannot agree how to deal with refugees and - to avoid a replay of the 2015/16 migration crisis - believe the bloc will have to cough up more money for Turkey to go on keeping a lid on arrivals in Europe.
""The EU is the target of a blackmail,"" one diplomat told Monday's closed-door meeting in Brussels, details of which were relayed to Reuters by multiple diplomatic sources.
The EU has struggled to respond as thousands of migrants have arrived at Greece's border from Turkey in recent days. Its ties with Ankara are already strained over security and human rights, as well as Turkish hydrocarbon drilling off Cyprus.
In 2015/16 the chaotic arrival of more than a million people from the Middle East stretched the bloc's security and welfare systems and fueled political support for far-right groups.
The EU sealed a deal with Turkey in March 2016 under which Ankara stopped people on its soil from heading to Europe. In exchange, the bloc offered 6 billion euros in aid for the more than 3.5 million Syrian refugees Turkey is hosting. 
But Erdogan has long complained that the money is slow to come and channeled through aid groups, not Turkey's budget. After Russian-backed Syrian government forces killed Turkish soldiers in an air strike in Syria last week, Ankara signaled it would walk away from its pact with the EU altogether.
""You sleep with the devil, you wake up in hell - there is where we are now,"" one ambassador said during the meeting. 
Compounding the EU's dilemma are internal divisions over how to distribute the burden of caring for refugees and migrants arriving in the 27-nation bloc.
One senior EU diplomat said the EU had squandered the time since the 2016 deal, brushing the problem under the carpet by paying for refugees and migrants to be kept in Turkey.
Representatives of the Netherlands, Italy, France and Germany were among those who proposed giving more funds to help refugees in Turkey in the hope of appeasing Erdogan.At the same time, ""as much as it is logical for the EU to continue supporting Syrian refugees in Turkey, it is important not to create the impression of giving in to blackmail"", one of the diplomats said, according to the sources. 
During a visit on Tuesday to a Turkish-Greek border crossing that thousands of migrants have been trying to breach, EU officials promised more cash to Greece to deal with the crisis.
OUTSOURCING MIGRATION CONTROLS
Turkey's regional foes Greece and Cyprus are particularly worried about mollifying Ankara and demand a tougher EU line.
Several diplomats warned of a repeat of the 2015/16 chaos, which brought more eurosceptic and anti-immigration politicians to the forefront in Europe, saw EU countries slap border controls in what is normally the bloc's zone of free travel, and sowed bitter divisions between member states, damaging EU unity.
These feuds led the EU to eventually outsource migration management to Turkey, despite heavy criticism from rights groups that the scheme aggravates the suffering of already distressed people by leaving them in grim circumstances there.
Of the 6 billion euros promised, the EU's executive European Commission said on Tuesday that 2.2 billion had already been disbursed and the rest was assigned to specific projects, meaning they should reach beneficiaries soon. 
The EU has not yet discussed numbers for further funding and diplomats said any decision to step up financing could be deferred to the bloc's leaders, due to meet in Brussels on March 26-27.
In the meantime, the EU may step up humanitarian aid to Syria's northwestern region of Idlib, one of the last places held by Turkish-backed rebels facing off against Damascus.
It is also offering Ankara - a NATO ally of most EU members - words of support over the conflict in Syria and raising political pressure on Erdogan to honor the 2016 deal.
""It is so dishonest of Erdogan. We cannot let ourselves be blackmailed so any new money must not come too soon. But we will probably have to pay eventually. What else can we do?"" a fourth diplomat told Reuters.

JERUSALEM/TAIBE, Israel (Reuters) - Israel's Arab parties looked poised on Tuesday for their largest-ever representation in parliament, propelled by what analysts say is anger toward Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his U.S. allies.
The Joint List coalition of Arab factions looked set to take 15 of parliament's 120 seats with more than 90% of the vote counted, a two-seat boost for representatives of the 21% Arab minority. 
Arab voter turnout surged to 64.7%, its highest in 20 years, according to Arik Rudnitzky, a researcher with the Israel Democracy Institute (IDI).
Politicians and analysts said the strong showing helped limit gains by Netanyahu's right-wing Likud party and its partners, which appeared to fall just short of a governing majority after Monday's vote.
""The Netanyahu regime does not have 61 (seats) for one reason: the ascendance of the Joint List,"" the coalition's leader, Ayman Odeh, said in the Arab city of Shefaram to cheering supporters, who snapped selfies with politicians late into election night.
But the Joint List is unlikely to translate its record showing into influence during coalition negotiations as no Arab party has ever sat in an Israeli government.
The leader of main Likud rivals, the centrist Blue and White party, denied that a government led by it would rely on the Joint List after Likud tried to taint it during the campaign by associating it with Arab lawmakers.
GET OUT THE VOTE
Many of Israel's Arab citizens have protested against a proposal in U.S. President Donald Trump's peace plan - dubbed ""The Deal of the Century"" - that would put a cluster of Israel's Arab towns near the West Bank into a future Palestinian state.
The Joint List played on Arab anger in those border communities at the prospect of being denied the benefits of Israeli citizenship to encourage people to vote.
It also picked up support from Arab citizens who voted for non-Arab, left-wing Israeli parties in the country's last election in September, according to Rudnitzky, the IDI researcher.
In Taibe, a tree-lined Arab village that could be moved outside Israel under Trump's plan, Ahmad Aweidah said he voted to push back against what he called ""Netanyahu's racism"" and to reject the U.S. Mideast proposal.
""The Deal of the Century stirred something up in the Arabs. It got them to go vote to try to stop it,"" the 27-year-old fishmonger said.
Rinad Musleh Jbara, another Taibe resident, said she hoped the Joint List's strong showing ""will add to peoples' awareness of the need to exercise their natural, democratic right to vote in elections for the Knesset"".
Israel's Arab minority - Palestinian by heritage, Israeli by citizenship - is mostly descended from the Palestinians who lived under Ottoman and then British colonial rule before staying in Israel after the country's 1948 creation. 
Arab lawmakers often call for an end to Israel's occupation of the Palestinian Territories and complain their communities face discrimination in areas such as health, education and housing.

Netanyahu’s party counters that its 15 billion shekel ($4.34 billion) investment plan for the Arab sector is the largest ever by an Israeli government.

1660,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 11:51AM ET</span>",U.N. nuclear watchdog admonishes Iran for denying access to two sites,"By Francois Murphy
VIENNA (Reuters) - The U.N. watchdog policing Iran's troubled nuclear deal with major powers admonished Tehran on Tuesday for failing to answer its questions about past nuclear activities at three sites and for denying it access to two of them.
Reuters first reported on Monday that the IAEA planned to issue a second report in addition to its regular quarterly update on Iran's nuclear activities, rebuking Iran for less than full cooperation in general and for failing to grant U.N. inspectors access to one or more sites of interest.
The regular report showed Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium nearly tripling since November to more than a ton, as Tehran continues to breach key limits of its steadily eroding nuclear deal in response to renewed U.S. sanctions against it since Washington pulled out of the accord in May 2018.
The extraordinary second report delved into the International Atomic Energy Agency's open questions and Iran's denial of access to sites which a senior diplomat said are believed to have been active in the early 2000s.
""Iran has not provided access to the agency to two locations ... and not engaged in substantive discussions to clarify agency questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities,"" the second confidential IAEA report to member states said. 
""The director general calls on Iran to immediately cooperate fully with the agency, including by providing prompt access to the locations specified,"" said the report, seen by Reuters, referring to new IAEA chief Rafael Grossi of Argentina, who took office in December.
What exactly is thought to have happened at the three sites, none of which the IAEA has visited before, is unclear. 
They are also different to the site in Tehran to which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu drew attention in 2018, calling it a ""secret atomic warehouse"", where the IAEA later found uranium traces.
Discussions with Iran aimed at explaining those traces of uranium that was processed - but not enriched - are ongoing, despite the agency previously encouraging Iran to do more.
SANITIZING
The second report said the IAEA's open questions include whether natural uranium was used at one of the three sites, one that the IAEA has yet to say it wants to visit. 
At one of the other two the agency has seen activities ""from early July 2019 onwards that were consistent with efforts to sanitize part of the location"", it said.
The term ""sanitize"" is often used to denote construction or demolition work intended to remove traces of nuclear material.
Diplomats who tipped off Reuters about the second report said the agency was looking at sites which - like the Tehran one where uranium particles were found - were mentioned in a trove of data on Iran's past nuclear activities that Israel calls the ""atomic archive"", which it says its agents seized in Iran.
U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA believe the Islamic Republic had a secret, coordinated nuclear weapons program that it halted in 2003, long before the 2015 deal. 
That is also roughly the time at which an exiled Iranian opposition group exposed the existence of Iran's underground uranium enrichment complex at Natanz. The revelation raised international alarm about Tehran's covert nuclear activities, which it later declared to the IAEA. 
Tuesday's second report also said Iran had informed the IAEA that it ""will not recognize any allegation on past activities and does not consider itself obliged to respond to such allegations"". 
While the 2015 deal drew a line under Iran's past atomic activities, the IAEA's non-proliferation mandate must also account for all nuclear material and activities. If previously unknown items come to light, it investigates.
The deal, which lifted international sanctions against Tehran in exchange for limits on its uranium enrichment and other nuclear activities, is aimed at keeping Tehran at least a year away from accumulating enough fissile material for an atomic bomb if it sought one.

Iran denies ever having had a nuclear arms program and says it would never seek to build an atomic bomb.

William wore a green tie and Kate a green coat and dress as they stepped off a commercial Aer Lingus flight. It was William's first official trip to the Republic of Ireland, nearly a decade after his grandmother Queen Elizabeth made history with the first visit by a reigning British monarch.
Britain left the European Union on Jan 31 after tendentious negotiations, mainly held up by debate over its land border with the EU - between the Irish Republic and British-ruled Northern Ireland.
The couple were to follow in Elizabeth's footsteps by laying a wreath at Dublin's Garden of Remembrance, which is dedicated to those who gave their lives for independence, which Ireland gained from Britain in 1921.
“May we never forget the lessons of history as we continue to build a brighter future together. William. Catherine,” says the message on their wreath.
They met Ireland's president Michael D. Higgins and were due to meet Prime Minister Leo Varadkar and visit a reception at the Guinness brewery, the country’s top tourist attraction.
The British royal family has had an easier relationship with Ireland since the 1998 Good Friday Agreement brought an end to 30 years of conflict in Northern Ireland, where mainly Catholic Republicans sought to end British rule.
William's father Prince Charles, whose great uncle Lord Louis Mountbatten was killed in a bomb attack by the Irish Republican Army on his boat off the coast of Ireland in 1979, has made several trips to Ireland. In 2015, he shook hands with former IRA commander Martin McGuinness. 

Northern Ireland has been largely peaceful since the agreement, but small splinter groups continue to launch attacks against British targets and security for royal visits to Ireland remains tight.

KASTANIES/LESBOS, Greece (Reuters) - European Union officials on Tuesday promised more cash for Greece during a visit to its border with Turkey which tens of thousands of migrants and refugees have been trying for days to breach.
The officials urged Turkey to abide by a 2016 deal which requires it to keep the migrants on its soil in return for EU aid. After an upsurge in fighting in Syria last week, Ankara says it will no longer stop migrants who want to reach Europe.
Greek riot police have used tear gas against the migrants at its Kastanies border post, while the coastguard has tried to stop boats transporting migrants to Greece's Aegean islands. A Syrian boy died on Monday after his boat capsized in the area.
""The situation at our border is not only an issue for Greece to manage, it is the responsibility of Europe as a whole,"" the head of the EU's executive Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, told a news conference at Kastanies.
""We will hold the line and our unity will prevail,"" she said after touring the area with Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and the heads of the European Council and Parliament.
Von der Leyen announced additional aid of 700 million euros to help Greece deal with the migrant crisis.
Brussels is desperate to avoid a repeat of the 2015-16 crisis, when more than a million migrants entered the EU from Turkey via the Balkans, straining European security and welfare systems and boosting support for far-right parties.
Greek troops and riot police remained on high alert along the Turkish border on Tuesday, though there were no reports of significant new clashes with the migrants. 
""There were only a few attempts today (to cross the border). Let's hope they get the message,"" a machine gun-toting army officer told Reuters at the Kastanies border post.
Army jeeps patrolled the area and roads leading to the Evros river which marks the Greek-Turkish border remained shut.
GREECE, TURKEY AT LOGGERHEADS
The crisis has badly strained ties, never good, between Ankara and Athens.
Mitsotakis accused Ankara of deliberately encouraging migrants to head to the border in order to ""promote its geopolitical agenda and divert attention from the situation in Syria"".
He also said these migrants were not fleeing the latest flareup of fighting in Syria's Idlib province but were people ""who have been living safely in Turkey for a long period of time"". Many speak fluent Turkish, he added.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian also accused Turkey on Tuesday of using the refugees to ""blackmail"" Europe.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan infuriated Mitsotakis on Monday by accusing Greek border guards of killing two migrants and wounding a third, a claim denied by Athens.
On Tuesday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said Greek forces were shooting migrants ""in the back as they are running away"", but he provided no evidence.
Turkey, which hosts 3.6 million refugees from Syria's civil war and faces another possible big influx as the fighting drags on there, says it cannot take in any more.
Human Rights Watch said it had received multiple reports that Greek border guards were pushing people back into Turkey, which could violate the right to claim asylum as well as a ban on returning people to where they would be unsafe, both of which are enshrined in international law. 
The mood toward migrants on Greek islands such as Lesbos - once relatively welcoming - has soured since the 2015-16 crisis amid a sense that the Athens government and the EU are not providing sufficient support.

""It used to be the island of solidarity but it seems like the locals are exhausted,"" said Charlie Meyers, a U.S. aid worker on Lesbos.

1667,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 11:11AM ET</span>",'Perfect Storm': Washington virus deaths highlight risk at nursing homes,"By Laila Kearney and Maria Caspani
NEW YORK (Reuters) - Less than a year after Constantine Valhouli moved his 85-year-old father into a Massachusetts elder-care facility, he is considering bringing his dad back home, his confidence rattled by a deadly coronavirus outbreak at a Washington state nursing home.
The deaths of four residents at the LifeCare long-term care facility in Kirkland has stoked Valhouli's fears that the virus could spread quickly and quietly in facilities such as the home where his father resides after a series of strokes.
""You've got this perfect storm of conditions - the density of residents, the age of residents and the health concerns,"" said Valhouli, a Boston resident who works in real estate analytics. ""The terrifying part of it is that you can worry about it from a distance, but the minute you've got a case, it's almost too late.""
Virus outbreaks are especially problematic in nursing homes because residents live in close quarters, so infections can spread easily. Older residents also tend to have weaker immune systems and underlying health conditions, making illnesses easier to catch and more dangerous if contracted.
As COVID-19 cases begin to spread across the United States, the Washington deaths have highlighted the vulnerability of older people in general. The elderly are considered the most at risk of dying from the virus, with deaths in China disproportionately affecting people over the age of 80.
""One thing that is clear is that nursing homes and hospitals are potentially at greater risk, and we are really going to have to think hard about what can be done to protect them,"" Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a media briefing on Monday.
If the outbreak spreads, Frieden said, U.S. officials might have to consider new steps to protect the more than 1.3 million Americans in nursing homes, such as curtailing visits to reduce the risk of introducing the virus to them.
At LifeCare in Kirkland, a resident in his 70s died over the weekend after contracting coronavirus, becoming the fourth person at the facility to have passed away from the virus as of Monday. Another 27 residents and 25 staff members were reporting symptoms, which can be similar to that of the common flu.
To be sure, the outbreak is not widespread in the United States so far, with only about 100 people across the country testing positive for the virus as of Sunday and six deaths. That compares with more than 87,000 cases worldwide and nearly 3,000 deaths in 60 countries, the World Health Organization said.
Even so, some senior living facilities have already started taking steps to limit their residents' exposure to the virus. 
Era Living, which manages eight independent and assisted living communities in the Seattle area, has begun restricting visitors, the group said on its website. 
For now, facilities are working to prevent COVID-19 infections in similar ways that they guard against the flu, David Gifford, chief medical officer for the Agency For Health Care Administration, a non-profit federation of about 13,500 nursing homes and other care facilities, said on a conference call. 
One essential weapon that nursing homes have against the flu is not available for coronavirus. 
""There is no vaccine for coronavirus, and we know that when we have flu outbreaks, they are just huge. They just sweep through an entire nursing home,"" Frieden said. 
Keeping the virus away from nursing homes and other facilities with vulnerable residents will likely take restrictions on who can enter the buildings, with no sick people allowed inside, said Frieden. In the meantime, he said more outbreaks similar to the one in Washington are likely.

""This is a sentinel event. We are going to see this elsewhere,"" he said.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday widened the ability of states to use criminal laws against illegal immigrants and other people who do not have work authorization in the United States in a ruling involving identity theft prosecutions in Kansas.
In the decision, the justices upheld the authority of states to prosecute immigrants for identity theft when applying for a job. The court found that Kansas did not unlawfully encroach on federal authority over immigration policy in charging three men accused of using other people's Social Security numbers.
President Donald Trump's administration backed Kansas in the case. Trump has made his hardline policies toward immigration a centerpiece of his presidency and 2020 re-election campaign. Kansas is one of several conservative states that have sought to crack down on illegal immigrants.
The justices overturned a 2017 Kansas Supreme Court decision that had voided the convictions of the three restaurant workers, finding that a 1986 federal law called the Immigration Reform and Control Act did not prevent states from pursuing such prosecutions.
Though immigration-related employment fraud is a federal matter, Kansas contended that its prosecutions were not immigration-related and did not conflict with federal immigration law. Kansas had argued that a ruling in favor of the immigrants would undermine its ability to combat the growing problem of identity theft.
Immigrant rights groups have said that giving states power to prosecute employment fraud would let them take immigration policy into their own hands.
The three men - Ramiro Garcia, Donaldo Morales and Guadalupe Ochoa-Lara - were not authorized to work in the United States and provided their employers Social Security numbers that were not their own.

The case focused on the employment verification process under federal immigration law requiring employers, on a form known as the I-9, to attest that an employee is authorized to work. The law also states that the form ""may not be used for purposes other than for enforcement of this act.""

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny on Tuesday accused Russian authorities of emptying and blocking his bank accounts and those of his close family, a move he said was unfair and aimed at strangling him and his supporters financially.
Navalny, 43, an outspoken opponent of President Vladimir Putin who has tried to build an anti-Kremlin movement by exposing official corruption, said his own accounts had been frozen as had the bank cards of his wife, son, daughter and parents.
Navalny said that accounts belonging to him and his wife had not only been blocked since Monday, but were now overdrawn to the tune of 75 million roubles ($1.13 million).
His 11-year-old son's savings, the result of weekly pocket money handouts, had also disappeared, he said on his website https://navalny.com/p/6305.
The Kremlin declined to discuss the blocking of Navalny's accounts, saying bank freezes were not a matter for the president's office.
Navalny, Russia's most prominent opposition politician, said the freezes appeared linked to a criminal case opened by investigators into suspected money laundering by his Anti-Corruption Foundation, allegations he says are fabricated.
The investigation was opened last August after Navalny called on people to attend rallies that grew into Moscow's biggest sustained protest movement in years before fizzling out.
""I'm not going to lie, this is fairly unpleasant. My parents are elderly people, pensioners. Like everyone they have illnesses, medicine (to buy) and so on. No idea how they'll pay for their utilities,"" he said.
BARRED FROM ELECTION
Navalny was barred from running for president in 2018 because of a past conviction on charges he has called trumped up. Putin won that election by a landslide.
Navalny said on Tuesday he believed authorities were trying to sideline him at a sensitive political time when Putin is pushing for major constitutional changes and may be thinking of calling snap parliamentary elections this autumn.
Putin announced plans for an array of constitutional reforms earlier this year that his critics say may be designed to extend his grip on power after his presidential term ends in 2024 and he is due to step down.
Navalny and allies are set to file a case to the European Court of Human Rights on Friday alleging the money laundering case is part of a campaign of intimidation and harassment against them, the European Human Rights Advocacy Centre said.
Russia's Justice Ministry in October formally labeled Navalny's anti-corruption group a ""foreign agent"", meaning it can be subjected to spot checks and face bureaucratic scrutiny.
Separately, the TASS news agency reported on Tuesday that Russian businessman Oleg Deripaska, whom Navalny has targeted in his investigations, was suing Navalny for smearing his reputation, though only for a symbolic sum of one rouble."

ARRAS, France (Reuters) - Eleonore Laloux has battled all her life to be treated like others. Now the 34-year-old is waging a new campaign: to become one of the first women in France with Down's syndrome to win a local council seat in this month's municipal elections.
Armed with a broad smile and a gritty determination, Laloux is canvassing for support in Arras, her hometown in northern France, talking up her ambitions for a cleaner town and improved access for disabled people. But above all, a fairer society.
""I've fought hard to live with Down's Syndrome. It doesn't trouble me any longer,"" Laloux said. 
""Now I am fighting for inclusion. Handicapped people have their place in society.""
As a young girl, Laloux's parents refused to place her in a special needs school, instilling in their daughter a self-belief that would later help her overcome bullies and secure a job as an administrator in a private hospital.
She has made peace with her condition, she said. She founded ""Friends of Eleonore"", an association which challenges the social stigmas confronting Down's sufferers, and has written a book, ""Down's syndrome, so what?""
Laloux's drive has not let up as she makes her first foray into politics. 
She has drawn up a list of a dozen priorities for Arras, a relatively affluent town of 40,000 people in the economically depressed northeast of France. 
They include audio and brail aides to help the hard of hearing and sight cross streets, electric buses with wheelchair ramps, and dedicated parks for dogs.
""I have loads of ideas in my head. I work on them every morning, every day,"" she told one Arras resident on a walkabout in the town's Baroque main square last week.
Laloux is running on the ticket of incumbent mayor Frederic Leturque, a centrist who won more than half the vote in 2014 and is favorite to win again.
""The disability she has, the force of her character, the ideas she has, will make us think differently,"" Leturque told Reuters after a meeting with his team of candidates.
When she's not at work or on the campaign trail, Laloux will pick up her electric guitar to relax. Bob Dylan is a favorite.
With less than two weeks until the March 15 first round of France's municipal elections, Laloux is making headway in persuading townsfolk that she is a deserving candidate. 

""I was surprised when I saw her on the list. But you know, what a great idea,"" chocolate shop worker Chantal Legrand said, turning to Laloux to add: ""I'm happy for you.""

As many as 700 people, including senior government officials and lawmakers, had been expected to attend the ceremony on March 11 in Tokyo. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's administration will make the formal decision to halt the event when his cabinet meets on Friday, the reports said.
The powerful magnitude 9 quake, referred to as 3/11 in Japan, unleashed a tsunami that swept away coastal communities and crippled the Fukushima power plant. The subsequent radiation cloud released from its overheated reactors forced residents to flee from nearby towns, some of which remain abandoned inside an exclusion zone.
The torch relay that will bring the Olympic flame to Tokyo in July for the 2020 Games will begin in Fukushima prefecture on March 26.
Since the coronavirus outbreak began, 999 people have been infected in Japan, including passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. Nineteen new cases were reported around the country on Tuesday, according to public broadcaster NHK."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's left-wing government approved a bill on Tuesday that would qualify all non-consensual sex as rape, acting on a pre-election promise to strengthen laws in defense of women's rights.
The draft law, which faces months of debate in parliament, seeks to establish specialized courts for dealing with sexual offences and round-the-clock recovery centers for victims. It would increase jail penalties for work-related sexual harassment to up to two years and make catcalling a criminal offense.
Combating gender violence has been high on Spain's political agenda since its women's rights movement was galvanized by the 2016 ""Wolf Pack"" trial, in which five men referring to themselves by that name were jailed for sexual abuse after gang-raping a young woman at the Pamplona bull-running festival.
Mass protests against that conviction, which attracted international attention in the wake of the global #MeToo movement highlighting abuse and mistreatment of women, led to an appeal in 2019 in which the Supreme Court ruled the men had committed rape.
""Spain will be a safer country for women with the approval of this law,"" Equality Minister Irene Montero told a news briefing. ""Women's rights and sexual freedoms will never again be stranded down a blind alley.""
The Socialist-led coalition government announced the bill's approval in the run-up to Sunday's International Women's Day, and rallies in Spain this weekend to mark it.
Maria Solanas, director at the Elcano Royal Institute think-tank, said the proposed legislation would make Spain the first country to implement in a single bill all the recommendations of the 2014 Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women.
According to Amnesty International, only nine of 31 European countries have laws that define rape based on the absence of consent, instead defining it by other measures such as whether violence or the threat of violence was used - as is still the case in Spain.
The bill proposes to merge the crimes of sexual abuse and sexual assault into the same type of crime qualified as rape.
Aggravating factors such as physical violence or the use of drugs or alcohol to incapacitate the victim would carry heavier sentences. Such cases would be heard by special judges in courts dedicated to sexual crimes, as is already done with crimes relating to gender violence.
The gender violence law was approved in 2004 by Spain's previous Socialist government, and the World Economic Forum ranks the country eighth globally in terms of gender parity."

ANKARA/MOSCOW (Reuters) - Escalating military action by Russia and Turkey in Idlib risks a direct confrontation between the two major foreign powers in Syria's war, days ahead of a summit of their leaders to hammer out a deal to halt the fighting.
Both countries say they hope to avoid a head-on clash, but after Turkey ramped up attacks on Russian-backed Syrian forces and Russian military police helped secure a town seized from Turkey-backed rebels, all sides acknowledge the risk.
Turkey says it has shot down three Syrian planes and destroyed eight helicopters and scores of tanks since last Thursday, when 34 Turkish soldiers were killed in an air strike, the deadliest attack on the Turkish army in nearly 30 years.
In response to the Turkish assault and advances by Turkey-backed rebels, Moscow said on Monday that Russian military police had helped drive back rebels from Saraqeb and entered the strategic town which has changed hands three times in a month.
""We need to accept that this incident raised tensions between the two countries,"" a Turkish security official said of last week's attack on Turkish troops.
""Turkey does not intend to clash with Russia in any way, and Russia does not want that either,"" he said. ""But on the battlefield it's another story. It's so complicated that an accidental attack on one another is the biggest risk.""
NATO member Turkey has the alliance's second largest army. Russia, a nuclear-armed power, has a major air base in Syria and deployed warships in the Mediterranean last week.
Turkey already hosts 3.6 million Syrian refugees and is trying to stem advances by Russian-backed Syrian government forces which have displaced 1 million people in Idlib, the last rebel bastion in Syria, driving them toward the Turkish border.
Russian support since 2015 has been instrumental in turning the tide of the war in favor of President Bashar al-Assad, who says he will recapture ""every inch"" of Syrian land.
""Russia is taking a very tough stance and showing it's ready for conflict,"" said former Russian lawmaker Sergey Markov. ""An attack on Saraqeb will be an attack on Russia.""
STRENGTHENING NEGOTIATING HANDS
The showdown in northwest Syria comes ahead of Thursday's meeting between Presidents Tayyip Erdogan and Vladimir Putin, suggesting both sides are seeking to consolidate their military position in part to bolster their negotiating hand.
A Syrian opposition figure described the battle for Saraqeb, at the junction of Syria's main north-south and east-west highways, as a ""war of wills"", while a rebel military commander said both countries were trying to impose a ""fait accompli"".
""The Syrian government is trying to take over new places with Russian support ahead of the Erdogan-Putin meeting,"" the Turkish security official said. ""They are trying to have the upper hand at the table"".
Turkey insisted last month that Syrian forces withdraw to Idlib frontlines established in a 2017 ""de-escalation"" accord. Damascus and Moscow ignored the demand, taking more territory in a conflict they frame as a war on terrorists.
Vladimir Frolov, a former senior Russian diplomat, said the key issue at Thursday's summit was the size of the remaining pocket of border territory which Russia would allow rebels to hold and where millions of displaced people could shelter.
""Erdogan wants a 30 mile deep zone, Moscow has been offering an 8 mile strip,"" Frolov told Reuters, predicting that the two leaders might split the difference.
He said Russia's deployment in Saraqeb was a signal that the control of the north-south M5 highway on which the town stands was a ""red line"" for Moscow, and would remain under its control.
That would require Turkey to back down from a months-long refusal to abandon a dozen military observation posts set up around the perimeter of the de-escalation zone, most of which are now surrounded by Syrian government forces."

NANGARHAR/KABUL (Reuters) - Five Afghan policemen died in a Taliban attack on a security checkpoint near a copper mine on Tuesday, officials in the region said, a day after the insurgents decided to resume operations against local forces.
A Taliban spokesman did not confirm or deny responsibility for the attack in eastern Afghanistan when contacted by Reuters, saying he was collecting information.
The militants had a reduction of violence arrangement in place before the signing of a troop withdrawal agreement with the United States in Doha on Saturday.
But on Monday they decided to end that for Afghan forces, while still holding back on fighting American and other foreign troops, according to sources.
Tuesday's ""heavy clash"" killing five Afghan officers took place at a checkpoint at the Mes Aynak copper mine in Logar province, said Deedar Lawang, a spokesman for Logar's provincial governor.
Hasib Stanekzai, head of Logar provincial council, told Reuters the policemen were soft targets during the early morning attack as they had no heavy weapons.
A senior U.S. official said the attack was being investigated.
A spokeswoman for Afghanistan's interior ministry said that in 24 hours, the Taliban carried out 33 attacks against Afghan forces in 16 provinces, killing six civilians. She did not say how many Afghan security force members had died.
""Taliban should give up killing civilians, otherwise (Afghan National Security forces) take action and eliminate them in the defense of our people,"" said the spokeswoman Marwa Amini.
U.S.-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
But the nation has been in stalemate since, with Taliban forces controlling some territory but unable to capture major urban centers.
The weekend agreement envisages a full withdrawal of all U.S. and coalition forces within 14 months, dependent on security guarantees by the Taliban.
""If the announcement of resumption of violence by Taliban is verified, this is against the spirit of the agreement just signed in Doha,"" tweeted the European Union's special envoy for Afghanistan, Roland Kobia."

LAHORE (Reuters) - A Pakistani court on Tuesday gave the go-ahead to the country's largest women's rights event but told organizers to ensure participants adhere to ""decency and moral values"".
The country-wide event, known as Aurat March, using the Urdu word for women, has been attended by tens of thousands over the last two years to mark International Women's Day on March 8.
A court in Lahore was petitioned last month to place restrictions on the organizers and participants of the march, whom the complainant said had an agenda to ""spread anarchy, vulgarity, blasphemy and hatred"" against Islam.
The court told organizers to consult local officials to finalize arrangements for the event, which campaigns for reclaiming space for women as well as the LGBT community.
Global watchdogs have expressed concern in recent years over what they see as a growing clampdown on rights campaigns in Pakistan.
""The court remarked that the participants should not ignore decency and moral values while carrying placards and chanting slogans,"" the movement's lawyer Saqib Jilani told Reuters, adding that organizers had been ordered to devise a code of conduct but already had one.
Local police, told to ensure security for the march, submitted a report to the court stating the event faced a threat from radical groups including Pakistani Taliban militants.
The police told the court they would provide security but it was essential for organizers to prohibit participants from engaging in ""controversial acts"".
There was uproar in conservative circles over slogans at last year's event. Some said: ""My body, my choice!"" ""My body is not your battleground!"" and ""Stop being menstrual phobic!""
Following last year's event, organizers said they faced a backlash including murder and rape threats.
Ahead of this year's event, volunteers and organizers in Islamabad and Lahore say posters and murals are being vandalized."

Travelers (NYSE:TRV) coming from any fellow GCC state - the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar - must spend 14 continuous days there and show no signs of the coronavirus before being granted entry, SPA said, citing an interior ministry source.
Saudi Arabia reported its first case of coronavirus on Monday in a Saudi national returning from Iran, which has reported the most deaths outside China, where the flu-like disease originated.
The other GCC states have also diagnosed the infection in people who had visited Iran, totaling more than 145 cases.
The Saudi health ministry said it was testing 70 people who had come into contact with the infected Saudi citizen, who remains in quarantine in hospital. The authorities have said he had not disclosed his visit to Iran upon returning home.
Iran hosts several important shrines and pilgrimage sites for Shi'ite Muslims, who make up a minority of Saudi Arabia's population.
The Saudi foreign ministry tweeted a video on Tuesday reminding citizens of an existing ban on travel to Iran, which is locked in a struggle with Saudi Arabia for regional supremacy.
Saudi Arabia took several measures last week to prevent the spread of the disease to the kingdom, banning foreigners arriving for the Muslim umrah pilgrimage, Gulf Arab citizens visiting Mecca and Medina, and tourists from at least 25 states where the virus has been found.
SPA also said that Saudi citizens or residents entering from a GCC country must inform authorities upon arrival in the kingdom of any travel outside the GCC in the preceding 14 days.

REYHANLI, Turkey/AMMAN (Reuters) - Turkey shot down a Syrian government warplane on Tuesday over northwest Syria, where fighting has intensified in recent days, bringing Turkish and Russian forces close to direct conflict in the battle over the last swathe of Syria still held by rebels.
It was the third Syrian warplane Turkey has shot down since Sunday in an escalating campaign against President Bashar al-Assad's forces. NATO-member Turkey supports the rebels, while Assad relies on his superpower ally Russia.
With more than a million refugees amassing since December on the Turkish border, the battle for Syria's Idlib province has brought what the United Nations fears might be the worst humanitarian crisis of the nine-year-old Syrian civil war.
""This relief operation has been overwhelmed. There needs to be more of everything. The first thing is money,"" U.N. Under-secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs Mark Lowcock told reporters at a trans-shipment point for supplies in southern Turkey.
Fighting was raging north of the strategic crossroads town of Saraqeb, recaptured on Monday by Syrian troops, one of several times the town, which controls access to Idlib city and Aleppo, has changed hands in recent weeks.
Syrian state media said the army was now combing the town and had dealt heavy blows to fighters still holed up in hideouts on its outskirts. A state television correspondent said Turkey was firing artillery to halt the government advance.
Rebels said the government was aided by thousands of Iranian-backed Lebanese and Iraqi militiamen brought from other areas to help storm the town after two days of failed attempts.
A Syrian general who has defected to the opposition, Ahmad Rahhal, said a Russian announcement on Monday that it had deployed military police in Saraqeb was aimed at blocking Turkey from trying to help rebels reclaim the town.
HUMANITARIAN CRISIS
Turkey has sent thousands of troops and armored vehicles into northern Syria over the past month to fight back against Assad. Last week, a Syrian air strike killed at least 34 Turkish soldiers in the deadliest attack on the Turkish army in decades.
Moscow, which has anti-aircraft missiles in Syria, has since warned Turkey that it cannot guarantee the safety of Turkish planes in Syrian skies.
The Turkish Defence Ministry said on Tuesday that its forces had shot down a Syrian L-39 ground attack jet. Syria's state-run SANA news agency confirmed the plane had been shot down over Idlib province by missiles fired from Turkish warplanes.
Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and Russia's Vladimir Putin are due to meet on Thursday to seek ways to avert conflict. Asked about the prospect of direct clashes with Turkey, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters: ""We hope that we're able to absolutely minimize this risk thanks to the close contact between the two countries' militaries.""
Turkey, already home to 3.6 million Syrian refugees, says it cannot take any more. It wants to push Assad's forces back to lines agreed in a 2017 deal brokered with Russia and Iran, which left a buffer zone in northern Syria near its border.
Since last week, Turkey has thrown open its frontiers with Greece and Bulgaria to allow migrants to enter the EU, a move apparently aimed at putting pressure on European countries to back it in Syria.
Some 10,000 migrants have tried to cross into Greece by land in recent days and more than 1,000 have arrived by sea at Greek islands, creating fears of a repeat of the 2015-2016 migration crisis, when more than 1 million people crossed into Greece and 4,000 drowned in the Aegean.
The opposition says Syrian government forces are deliberately attacking civilians to provoke them to flee.
A rocket attack believed to have been fired by the Syrian army on a residential quarter of Idlib city left at least nine civilians dead, including five children, according to Osama Idlibi, a rescuer in the opposition-run Syrian Civil Defence.
Overnight Russian and Syrian jets killed at least 10 people in the town of Al Foah in what residents said was a spike in strikes on several towns, including Binish and the outskirts of Tatanaz in Idlib province.
Russia and its Syrian army ally deny indiscriminate bombing of civilian areas and say they target jihadists.
U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Kelly Craft, in Turkey inspecting the relief efforts, announced $180 million in additional funding for the humanitarian crisis in Idlib.

""Humanitarian aid is only a response but the solution is an immediate ceasefire,"" Craft told reporters. ""This is not something that just happened. This is planned by the Assad regime,"" Craft said. ""It is cruel and brutal.""

1685,By Reuters,"<span>Mar 03, 2020 08:19AM ET</span>",Germany unearths right-wing radicals in military after scandal,"BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany has discovered eight right-wing radicals in its armed forces and 27 individuals who have reservations about the constitution, according to a report commissioned to help root out extremism in the military after a scandal in 2017.
Germany is struggling to tackle a rise in right-wing radicalism which has culminated in attacks including a shooting rampage in Hanau two weeks ago when a racist gunman killed 11 people, including migrants and himself.
The report, by German military intelligence and seen by Reuters, showed that in addition to the eight people categorized as ""right-wing extremists"", a further two were members of a network that claims allegiance to the pre-war German Reich.
""There is no place for extremism in the armed forces,"" said the report, submitted to parliament but not yet officially presented.
""(The report) represents an important pillar in guaranteeing a transparent and unified picture of the situation,"" it said.
The right-wing radicals were discovered after a military intelligence unit investigated 592 individuals suspected of holding broadly anti-constitutional views.
By comparison, the report showed four confirmed Islamists and no established Left wing militants in the armed forces, which has a total of 265,000 uniformed and civilian employees.
The investigations were prompted by the arrest in 2017 of an army officer who was suspected of planning a racially motivated attack. Legal proceedings in that case are continuing.
Also in 2017, Nazi memorabilia, including Nazi-era Wehrmacht helmets, was found at a barracks. While possessing Wehrmacht items is not an offence, the then defense minister, Ursula von der Leyen, said any veneration of Hitler's army was unacceptable.
The numbers may not look high, but given Germany's Nazi past, many lawmakers insist on 'zero tolerance' and demanded action.
""This overview is long overdue and can only be the beginning,"" said Greens lawmaker Agnieszka Brugger, in a statement after the report was leaked to some media, adding that right-wing extremism was a threat to Germany's democratic order.

BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Bolivian former president Evo Morales, who resigned last year under pressure from the military, says while he is confident his political party will win re-run elections scheduled for May, he fears they will be fraudulent or followed by a coup.
In an interview with Reuters in Argentina, where Morales is currently living in exile, the socialist former leader accused the ""right"" and the United States of preventing his presidential or Senate candidacies, and of trying to keep his Movement to Socialism (MAS) out of power.
He cited a recently published independent analysis of the election he was initially judged to have won in October by two researchers at MIT's Election Data and Science Lab as evidence for his claim.
An Organization of American States audit that found serious irregularities in October was flawed, the MIT study said, and concluded that it was ""very likely"" Morales won the vote by the 10 percentage points needed to avoid a runoff.
Morales has been barred from running in the May polls but is backing his former economy minister Luis Arce Catacora as the candidate for MAS.
""We are sure that we are going to win the elections. Only a fraud or a coup can get in the way,"" Morales said.
""We are preparing internally on how to take care of the vote. And if we win, then the coup,"" he added, convinced his rivals would attempt to unseat his party.
Morales, who resigned on Nov. 10 after the OAS audit, called for a severe sanction against OAS Secretary-General Luis Almagro and the audit team in response to the new analysis, which has stirred international debate.
""Unfortunately, the method used by the OAS is uncited and untested within the field [of election science], and it is unlikely that this method can be justified within the field,"" Jack R. Williams (NYSE:WMB), one of the authors of the study, told Reuters in an email.
Morales, 60, faces charges of sedition and terrorism related to accusations from the interim government that he has been stirring unrest since resigning.
He did not rule out taking his claims of a coup in October, which he says the OAS promoted, to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.
For now, he waits for his opportunity to return to Bolivia. To pass the time, he said he tries to stay in shape with a strict exercise routine."

TARTAGAL, Argentina (Reuters) - In Argentina, once one of the world's richest countries and long a major supplier of beef, children are dying of hunger.
In Argentina's far northern province of Salta, in a small indigenous community plagued by extreme poverty, eight children died in January alone from malnutrition and a lack of access to clean drinking water, health authorities say.
The issue affects other places, too, and has prompted the national government to announce a plan to tackle hunger. The governor of Salta has declared a public health emergency, vowing to work with the national government to provide clean water in the province.
In the province last week, children from the Wichi community, with a population of just 1,200, played barefoot in the mud, outside homes constructed by hand from wood and cloth.
In Tartagal, the small town nearest to where the Wichi live, hospital beds are filled with Wichi children battling malnutrition and a host of other health issues linked to a lack of clean water, health officials said. Sometimes, the children arrive too late to make a recovery, according to Juan Lopez, manager of the hospital in Tartagal.
Complications related to the issues led to the deaths of the eight Wichi children in January, he said. The community also has one of the country's highest rates of infant mortality.
A spokesman for Argentina's ministry of health said, ""We are constantly liaising with the province of Salta. We are doing food assistance and health assistance."" He added that there were teams from the federal government working in the province.
Liliana Ciriaco, a 45-year-old Wichi woman, said in an interview that there had been ""many sicknesses.""
""There are some pregnant women who die, there are children who die, the elderly, too, and we don't know what is going on,"" she said.
A century ago, Argentina was one of the world's most affluent countries, but it has weathered a series of economic crises in recent decades. The latest one began in 2018. Inflation hovers above 50% and the poverty rate is at 35%. Argentina's indigenous communities, historically poor, have been especially hard hit.
For the Wichi community, the lack of access to safe water is a critical problem.
""The place where they access their water source has high salinization or even chemicals that have been used for agriculture, which cause many gastrointestinal diseases, diarrhea, malnutrition and, above all, dehydration,"" said Diego Tipping, president of the Red Cross in Argentina.
Argentina's new center-left President Alberto Fernandez campaigned on promises to address hunger, poverty and unemployment. In December, he announced a plan to combat the issue in the most affected areas of the country called ""Argentina Against Hunger.""
Alejandro Deane, president of the Siwok Foundation, which is dedicated to improving water access for indigenous communities in northern Argentina, called the situation for the Wichi community ""disastrous.""
""There is no good news. What needs to be done? What can be done? Here we need a long-term plan, not a short-term plan,"" Deane said."

LESBOS/ATHENS (Reuters) - ""Go away, go,"" a smartly dressed Greek woman in sunglasses and a black leather jacket shouted in English at about 40 migrants in a dinghy bobbing near the small harbor. A headscarfed woman in the boat waved her forefinger, a baby on board wailed.
In an ugly standoff, which continued for about an hour on Sunday, about 20 locals on the Greek island of Lesbos jeered the migrants and kept pushing their dinghy away from the quay.
The chilly reception, though not necessarily representative, was a far cry from scenes in 2015 and 2016, when Greeks threw open their homes to refugees fleeing war in Syria and elsewhere, and Lesbos residents were contenders for the Nobel Peace Prize.
Five years on, another crisis is in the making after Turkey said it would no longer contain hundreds of thousands of migrants under a 2016 deal brokered with the European Union to stop them heading to Europe.
For Lesbos, Greece’s third-biggest island and located barely four miles from the Turkish coast, it is a perfect storm.
The island already hosts more than 20,000 asylum seekers, many of them living in filthy conditions in one overcrowded camp, Moria, which was originally intended to accommodate fewer than 3,000.
Islanders say they are being forced to shoulder a disproportionate share of the migrant burden. Last month they rioted over government plans to create new reception facilities on Lesbos to replace existing one.
""They (the migrants) were refugees of war then (in 2015-16). Now they are economic migrants,"" said Costas Moutzouris, governor of the Northern Aegean, which includes a cluster of islands hosting thousands of migrants.
""LOCALS ARE EXHAUSTED""
Aid organizations have started pulling out volunteers after being harassed. On the road toward Moria, informal roadblocks have sprung up, manned by locals quizzing people about their movements.
""Most of the volunteers are leaving,"" one worker with a major aid group told Reuters, on condition of anonymity.
One volunteer, U.S. citizen Charlie Meyers, said he would probably leave Lesbos on Tuesday. ""The mood is categorically different. It used to be the island of solidarity but it seems like the locals are exhausted.""
Moutzouris said the past five years had changed people.
""They can't go back to their routine, they can't go to the hospital because it's full of migrants, they can't get to an ATM (cash dispenser) because of the queues of migrants, they can't use a bus,"" he said.
The dinghy that drew angry jeers on Sunday was eventually allowed by authorities to dock and its passengers came on shore.
""Why are they here? They are their kids, not ours,"" shouted the smartly dressed woman. ""Rabbits,"" another man sneered at the sight of a pregnant woman.
The anonymous aid worker, who has been on Lesbos for four years, said such scenes were not typical.
""A lot of locals are very nice and support us. It's a small group of locals who are very aggressive and dangerous.""

UK PM Johnson asked about paternity leave","LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Boris Johnson went some way toward committing to taking paternity leave after his partner Carrie Symonds gives birth to his child later this year, but quickly said he could not remember the question.
At a news conference on Tuesday to unveil his government's coronavirus action plan, Johnson was asked whether he would be taking paternity leave - when fathers can take two weeks off work after the birth of their child.
""I think the answer is almost certainly yes,"" Johnson said, before adding: ""I can't remember what the question was.""

REYHANLI, Turkey (Reuters) - Relief operations to meet the needs of nearly 1 million people who fled recent fighting in northwest Syria's Idlib have been overwhelmed, the U.N. aid chief said on Tuesday as the United States and Britain pledged to step up aid efforts.
While Syrian government forces fought Turkey-backed rebels in Idlib, U.S. and U.N. officials visited Turkey's Hatay border province to view efforts to cope with one of the biggest humanitarian crises of Syria's nine-year civil war.
The United Nations is scaling up assistance after agreeing with Turkish authorities to double the number of trucks it sends across the border to 100 each day, said Mark Lowcock, U.N. Under-secretary General for Humanitarian Affairs.
""This relief operation has been overwhelmed. There needs to be more of everything. The first thing is money,"" Lowcock told reporters at a trans-shipment point for U.N. supplies in Turkey's Reyhanli district.
The number of displaced people has surged to 980,000, more than half of them children, who are now coping with inadequate shelter and a lack of sanitation facilities in areas near the Turkish border, he said.
Lowcock said $1 billion was needed annually to sustain relief operations for a couple of million people in the Idlib region, noting there were not enough tents.
Kelly Craft, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations who was also inspecting the relief efforts, announced $180 million additional funding for the operations.
""Humanitarian aid is only a response but the solution is an immediate ceasefire,"" Craft told reporters. ""We are asking for other countries to step up and contribute.""
Britain's Foreign Minister Dominic Raab said during a visit to Ankara that his country was giving an additional 89 million pounds ($114 million) in aid to Syria, part of it to Idlib.
Fighting in Idlib has escalated in recent days as Turkey steps up military operations to counter advances by Syrian government forces, backed by Russia, in the last remaining bastion held by rebels in the country's northwest.
""This is not something that just happened. This is planned by the Assad regime,"" Craft said. ""It is cruel and brutal.""
Turkey, which has sent thousands of troops and military hardware into Idlib to confront Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces, hosts 3.6 million Syrians and has closed its border saying it cannot take in more migrants.
Ankara said last week it would no longer uphold a 2016 accord with the European Union to keep refugees on its territory in return for aid, leading to thousands of migrants seeking to breach the border into Greece."

Johnson was speaking at the announcement of Britain's plan to deal with the expected spread of the virus, which included a warning that as many as one in five employees could be off work at the peak of the outbreak.
The global death toll from the virus is over 3,000, prompting a range of official, and sometimes contradictory, advice on how to prevent its spread.
France recommended last week that people do not shake hands to prevent the spread of the virus, while Switzerland has said its residents should consider dropping the everyday greeting of kissing each other on the cheek.
Johnson however, exhibited no such caution.
""I'm shaking hands,"" Johnson said when asked how he planned to handle visiting dignitaries.
""I was at a hospital the other night where I think a few there were actually coronavirus patients and I shook hands with everybody, you'll be pleased to know, and I continue to shake hands.

Syria has faced resistance from Turkish forces allied to rebels in its northeast.
Libya has two governments, one based in the capital Tripoli and widely recognized internationally, and another based in the east. Eastern commander Haftar has launched an assault to capture Tripoli, and is fighting forces aligned with the government there which are backed militarily by Turkey.
""Terrorism will kill any Arab country if it's permitted and if the criminal (President Tayyip) Erdogan is permitted to win this fight,"" Syria's deputy foreign minister Faisal Mekdad said at a ceremony to open the embassy.
President Bashar al-Assad has looked to shed his country's pariah status and regain Arab support. The United Arab Emirates, which backs Haftar in Libya, re-opened its Damascus embassy in December 2018 and has forged closer ties after once supporting rebels fighting against Assad.

Libya's diplomatic missions are generally aligned with the government based in Tripoli, but diplomats in some foreign capitals have supported the rival government based in the east.

The amendment is one of an array of constitutional changes proposed by Putin as part of a shake-up of the political system that critics say may be designed to keep him in power after he is due to leave the Kremlin in 2024. 
Putin, who has dominated Russian politics for two decades, submitted his proposed amendments to parliament on Monday. 
If adopted, the territorial amendment would make it unconstitutional for Putin or any of his successors in the Kremlin to give ground in territorial rows with Japan and Ukraine without first changing the constitution. 
Russia annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. It has also been in a decades-long dispute with Tokyo over ownership of a chain of islands in the Pacific that Moscow seized from Japan at the end of World War Two.
Russia has moved to integrate Crimea into its economy and infrastructure, though the peninsula is still widely recognized internationally as Ukrainian territory and Western governments have said Moscow must give it back. 
""Actions ... directed toward the transfer of parts of Russia's territory, and also calls for such actions, are not allowed,"" the text of Putin's constitutional proposal says. 
The amendment stipulates that it would not affect the ""delimitation, demarcation, redemarcation of Russia's state borders with neighboring states"".
A separate amendment stipulates that the office of president can only be held by a Russian citizen aged at least 35 who has not held citizenship of, or official residency rights in, any other country. 

However, it proposes making an exception for people if they are from countries or parts of countries that have been absorbed into Russia.

LJUBLJANA (Reuters) - Slovenia's parliament is expected to elect Janez Jansa as prime minister on Tuesday, handing a third term to a center-right leader who plans to decentralize the state and fight red tape to improve services and economic growth.
Jansa, the head of the largest party in parliament, the center-right Slovenian Democratic Party (SDS), is set to replace center-left Marjan Sarec, who resigned in January.
Last week Jansa formed a coalition with the center-left Party of Modern Centre (SMC), the conservative New Slovenia and the pensioners' party Desus. The four parties together hold 48 out of 90 parliamentary seats, although one SMC member has said he would not support a government led by Jansa.
Jansa told parliament his government will work toward cutting red tape, improving infrastructure and decentralizing the country by locating new institutions outside the capital.
He also said taxes on wages will have to increase to get more money for the national health system and care for the elderly. As a result, he said, the country has to improve economic growth, which reached 1.7% year-on-year in the last quarter of 2019, the lowest quarterly growth since 2013.
""The fact is ... that only economic growth, that is creation of new value, can represent a basis for well-being. All the rest is bluff,"" Jansa said.
He said being a member of the European Union and NATO is in the ""strategic interest"" of Slovenia which will take over the EU presidency in the second half of 2021.
He said his government plans to introduce army conscription to strengthen the military, adding Slovenia's professional army ""is not capable of defending the state"". He also said he hoped to cooperate with the opposition on the main projects.
Jansa, 61, led the government from 2004 to 2008 and from 2012 to 2013. He is close to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and advocates stricter border controls to prevent the illegal inflow of migrants.
In 2013 he was sentenced to two years in prison for taking a bribe in a 2006 armored vehicle deal but served only six months before the Constitutional Court overturned the sentence and ordered a retrial. The case eventually expired. Jansa denied any wrongdoing.
The parliament is due to confirm Jansa in a secret vote later on Tuesday. Following that Jansa will have 15 days to present his cabinet, which is expected to be approved by parliament by the end of March. Jansa will take over once his government is confirmed.
Sarec, who led the first minority government in Slovenia's history, resigned because his government did not have enough support in parliament to pass important legislation.
A regular parliamentary election is due in the middle of 2022."

, a luxury liner operated by Monaco-based Silversea Cruises, last docked at the Thai island of Phuket and was scheduled to stop at Thilawa, outside Myanmar's commercial capital of Yangon on Wednesday.
""We have informed the ... port authorities that the entry of this ship should not be allowed,"" Khin Maung Soe, deputy permanent secretary of the Ministry of Hotels and Tourism, told Reuters by phone.
He said he did not know whether any of the passengers were showing symptoms of the virus.
""Even if passengers haven't shown the symptoms so far, they might when they arrive in Myanmar and it will be difficult for the country to control,"" he said.
""If things get worse, our people might get affected.""
A statement by the Ministry of Health and Sports published on Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) said the ship should not be allowed to enter because it had docked in countries with a high number of cases of the virus, including Thailand which has 43.
The boat has more than 400 passengers on board, a ministry spokesman said. It was not immediately clear where the ship would go next.
Myanmar borders China, where the virus first broke out late last year in the central city of Wuhan before spreading rapidly, but has reported no confirmed cases so far, though several people have been quarantined in a Yangon hospital.
The government has urged citizens to avoid public gatherings and the country's military canceled its annual parade scheduled for late March, citing the virus.
While the outbreak appears to be easing in China, it has surged elsewhere and countries other than China now account for about three-quarters of new infections.
Japan on Monday confirmed at least 19 new coronavirus cases, bringing the number of infections in the country to 980, including passengers who were infected on the quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship.
